Introduction 
 
 THE SUBJECT. 
 MICIO and DEMEA are two brothers of dissimilar tempers. Demea is married, and lives a country life, while his brother remains single, and resides in Athens . Demea has two sons, the elder of whom, Aeschinus, has been adopted by Micio. Being allowed by his indulgent uncle to gratify his inclinations without restraint, Aeschinus has debauched Pamphila, the daughter of a widow named Sostrata. Having, however, promised to marry the young woman, he has been pardoned for the offense, and it has been kept strictly secret. Ctesipho, who lives in the country with his father under great restraint, on visiting the city, falls in love with a certain Music-girl, who belongs to the Procurer Sannio. To screen his brother, Aeschinus takes the responsibility of the affair on himself, and succeeds in carrying off the girl for him. Demen, upon hearing of this, censures Micio for his ill-timed indulgence, the bad effects of which are thus exemplified in Aeschinus; and at the same time lauds the steady conduct and frugality of Ctesipho, who has been brought up under his own supervision. Shortly after this, Sostrata hears the story about the Music-girl, at the very time that her daughter Pamphila is in labor. She naturally supposes that Aeschinus has deserted her daughter for another, and hastens to acquaint Hegio, her kinsman, with the fact. Meantime Demea learns that Ctesipho has taken part in carrying off the Music-girl, whereon Syrus invents a story, and screens Ctesipho for the moment. Demea is next informed by Hegio of the conduct of Aeschinus toward Pamphila. Wishing to find his brother, he is purposely sent on a fruitless errand by Syrus, on which he wanders all over the city to no purpose. Micio having now been informed by Hegio, and knowing that the intentions of Aeschinus toward Pamphila are not changed, accompanies him to the house of Sostrata, whom he consoles by his promise that Aeschinus shall marry her daughter. Demea then returns from his search, and, rushing into Micio's house, finds his son Ctesipho there carousing; on which he exclaims vehemently against Micio, who uses his best endeavors to soothe him, and finally with success. He now determines to become kind and considerate for the future. At his request, Pamphila is brought to Micio's house, and the nuptials are celebrated. Micio, at the earnest request of Demea and Aeschinus, marries Sostrata; Hegio has a competency allowed him; and Syrus and his wife Phrygia are made free. The Play concludes with a serious warning from Demea, who advises his relatives not to squander their means in riotous living; but, on the contrary, to bear admonition and to submit to restraint in a spirit of moderation and thankfulness. 
 
 
 THE TITLE OF THE PLAY. 
 PERFORMED at the, Funeral Games of Aemilius Paulus, which were celebrated by Q. Fabius Maximns and P. Cornelius Africanus. L. Atilius Praenestinus and Minutius Prothimus performed it. Flaccus, the freedman of Claudius, composed the music for Sarranian flutes. Taken from the Greek of Menander, L. Anicius and M. Cornelius being Consuls. 
 
 
 
 THE SUMMARY OF C. SULPITIUS APOLLINARIS. 
 As Demea has two sons, young men, he gives Aeschinus to his brother Micio to be adopted by him; but he retains Ctesipho: him, captivated with the charms of a Music-girl, and under a harsh and strict father, his brother Aeschinus screens; the scandal of the affair and the amour he takes upon himself; at last, he carries the Music-girl away from the Procurer. This same Aeschinus has previously debauched a poor woman, a citizen of Athens , and has given his word that she shall be his wife. Demea upbraids him, and is greatly vexed; afterward, however, when the truth is discovered, Aeschinus marries the girl who has been debauched; and, his harsh father Demea now softened, Ctesipho retains the Music-girl.

THE PROLOGUE. 
 Since the Poet has found that his writings are carped at by unfair critics, and that his adversaries represent in a bad light the Play that we are about to perform, he shall give information about himself; you shall be the judges whether this ought to be esteemed to his praise or to his discredit. The Synapothnescontes 
 is a Comedy of Diphilus; 
 Plautus made it into a Play called the "Commorientes." In the Greek, there is a young man, who, at the early part of the Play, carries off a Courtesan from a Procurer; that part Plautus has entirely left out. This portion he has adopted in the Adelphi , and has transferred it, translated word for word. This new Play we are about to perform; determine then whether you think a theft has been committed, or a passage has been restored to notice which has been passed over in neglect. For as to what these malevolent persons say, that men of noble rank assist him, and are always writing in conjunction with himâ€”that which they deem to be a heavy crimination, he takes to be the highest praise; since he pleases those who please you all and the public; the aid of whom in war, in peace, in private business, 
 each one has availed himself of, on his own occasion, without any haughtiness on their part. Now then, do not expect the plot of the Play; the old men 
 who come first will disclose it in part; a part in the representation they will make known. Do you cause your impartial attention to increase the industry of the Poet in writing?

Enter MICIO, calling to a servant within. 
 
 MICIO 
 Storax! Aeschinus has not returned home from the entertainment last night, nor any of the servants who went to fetch him. 
 To himself. Really, they say it with reason, if you are absent anywhere, or if you stay abroad at any time, 'twere better for that to happen which your wife says against you, and which in her passion she imagines in her mind, than the things which fond parents fancy. A wife, if you stay long abroad, either imagines that you are in love or are beloved, or that you are drinking and indulging your inclination, and that you only are taking your pleasure, while she herself is miserable. As for myself, in consequence of my son not having returned home, what do I imagine? In what ways am I not disturbed? For fear lest he may either have taken cold, 
 or have fallen down somewhere, or have broken some limb. Oh dear! that any man should take it into his head, or find out what is dearer to him than he is to himself! And yet he is not my son, but my brother's. He is quite different in disposition. I, from my very youth upward, have lived a comfortable town life, and taken my ease; and, what they esteem a piece of luck, I have never had a wife. He, on the contrary to all this, has spent his life in the country, and has always lived laboriously and penuriously. He married a wife, and has two sons. This one, the elder of them, I have adopted. I have brought him up from an infant, and considered and loved him as my own. In him I centre my delight; this object alone is dear to me. On the other hand, I take all due care that he may hold me equally dear. I giveâ€”I overlook; I do not judge it necessary to exert my authority in every thing; in fine, the things that youth prompts to, and that others do unknown to their fathers, I have used my son not to conceal from me. For he, who, as the practice is, will dare to tell a lie to or to deceive his father, will still more dare to do so to others. I think it better to restrain children through a sense of shame and liberal treatment, than through fear. On these points my brother does not agree with me, nor do they please him. He often comes to me exclaiming, "What are you about, Micio? Why do you ruin for us this youth? Why does he intrigue? Why does he drink? Why do you supply him with the means for these goings on? You indulge him with too much dress; you are very inconsiderate." He himself is too strict, beyond what is just and reasonable; and he is very much mistaken, in my opinion, at all events, who thinks that an authority is more firm or more lasting which is established by force, than. that which is founded on affection. Such is my mode of reasoning; and thus do I persuade myself. He, who, compelled by harsh treatment, does his duty, so long as he thinks it will be known, is on his guard: if he hopes that it will be concealed, he again returns to his natural bent. He whom you have secured by kindness, acts from inclination; he is anxious to return like for like; present and absent, he will be the same. This is the duty of a parent, to accustom a son to do what is right rather of his own choice, than through fear of another. In this the father differs from the master: he who can not do this, let him confess that he does not know how to govern children. But is not this the very man of whom I was speaking? Surely it is he. I don't know why it is I see him out of spirits; I suppose he'll now be scolding as usual. Demea, I am glad to see you well.

Enter DEMEA. 
 
 DEMEA 
 Oh,â€”opportunely met; you are the very man I was looking for. 
 
 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Why are you out of spirits? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Do you ask me, when we have such a son as Aeschinus, 
 why I'm out of spirits? 
 
 
 MICIO 
 
 aside. Did I not say it would be so? To DEMEA. What has he been doing? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 What has he been doing? He, who is ashamed of nothing, and fears no one, nor thinks that any law can control him. But I pass by what has been previously done: what a thing he has just perpetrated! 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Why, what is it? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 He has broken open a door, 
 and forced his way into another person's house, beaten to death the master himself, and all the household, and carried off a wench whom he had a fancy for. All people are exclaiming that it was a most disgraceful proceeding. How many, Micio, told me of this as I was coming here? It is in everybody's mouth. In fine, if an example must be cited, does he not see his brother giving his attention to business, and living frugally and soberly in the country? No action of his is like this. When I say this to him, Micio, I say it to you. You allow him to be corrupted. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Never is there any thing more unreasonable than a man who wants experience, who thinks nothing right except what he himself has done. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 What is the meaning of that? 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Because, Demea, you misjudge these matters. It is no heinous crime, believe me, for a young man to intrigue or to drink; it is not; nor yet for him to break open a door. If neither I nor you did so, it was poverty that did not allow us to do so. Do you now claim that as a merit to yourself which you then did from necessity? That is unfair; for if we had had the means to do so, we should have done the same. And, if you were a man, you would now suffer that other son of yours to act thus now, while his age will excuse it, rather than, when he has got you, after long wishing it, out of the way, he should still do so, at a future day, and at an age more unsuited. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 O Jupiter ! You, sir, are driving me to distraction. Is it not a heinous thing for a young man to do these things? 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Oh! do listen to me, and do not everlastingly din me upon this subject. You gave me your son to adopt; he became mine; if he offends in any thing, Demea, he offends against me: in that case I shall bear the greater part of the inconvenience. Does he feast, 
 does he drink, does he smell of perfumes, 
 â€”it is at my cost. Does he intrigue, money shall be found by me, so long as it suits me; when it shall be no longer convenient, probably he'll be shut out of doors. 
 Has he broken open a doorâ€”it shall be replaced; has he torn any one's clothesâ€”they shall be mended. Thanks to the Gods, I both have means for doing this, and these things are not as yet an annoyance. In fine, either desist, or else find some arbitrator between us: I will show that in this matter you are the most to blame. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Ah me! Learn to be a father from those who are really so. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 You are his father by nature, I by my anxiety. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 You, feel any anxiety? 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Oh dear,â€”if you persist, I'll leave you. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Is it thus you act? 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Am I so often to hear about the same thing? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 I have some concern for my son. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 I have some concern for him too; but, Demea, let us each be concerned for his own shareâ€”you for the one, and I for the other. For, to concern yourself about both is almost the same thing as to demand him back again, whom you intrusted to me. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Alas, Micio! 
 
 
 MICIO 
 So it seems to me. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 What am I to say to this? If it pleases you, henceforthâ€”let him spend, squander, and destroy; it's nothing to me. If I say one word after thisâ€” 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Again angry, Demea? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Won't you believe me? Do I demand him back whom I have intrusted? I am concerned for him; I am not a stranger in blood; if I do interposeâ€”well, well, I have done. You desire me to concern myself for one of them,â€”do concern myself; and I give thanks to the Gods, he is just as I would have him; that fellow of yours will find it out at a future day : I don't wish to say any thing more harsh against him. (Exit.) 
 
 
 
 MICIO 
 These things are 
 not nothing at all, nor yet all just as he says; still they do give me some uneasiness; but I was unwilling to show him that I took them amiss, for he is such a man; when I would pacify him, I steadily oppose and resist him; and in spite of it he hardly puts up with it like other men; but if I were to inflame, or even to humor his anger, I should certainly be as mad as himself. And yet Aesclhinus has done me some injustice in this affair. What courtesan has he not intrigued with? Or to which of them has he not made some present? At last, he recently told me that he wished to take a wife, 
 I suppose he was just then tired of them all. I was in hopes that the warmth of youth had now subsided; I was delighted. But look now, he is at it again; however, I am determined to know it, whatever it is, and to go meet the fellow, if he is at the Forum. (Exit.)

Enter AESCHINUS and PARMENO with the MUSIC-GIRL, followed by SANNIO and a crowd of people. 
 
 SANNIO 
 I beseech you, fellow-citizens, do give aid to a miserable and innocent man; do assist the distressed.
 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 
 to the GIIL. Be quiet, and now then stand here just where you are. Why do you look back? There's no danger; he shall never touch you while I am here. 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 I'll have her, in spite of all. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Though he is a villain, he'll not risk, to-day, getting a second beating. 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 Hear me, Aeschinus, that you may not say that you were in ignorance of my calling; I am a Procurer. 
 
 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 I know it. 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 And of as high a character as any one ever was. When you shall be excusing yourself by-and-by, how that you wish this injury had not been done me, I shall not value it this snapping his fingers . Depend upon it, I'll prosecute my rights; and you shall never pay with words for the evil that you have done me in deed. I know those ways of yours: "I wish it hadn't happened; I'll take my oath that you did not deserve this injustice;" while I myself have been treated in a disgraceful manner. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 
 to PARMENO. Go first with all dispatch and open the door. PARMENO opens the door. 
 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 But you will avail nothing by this. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 
 To the GIRL. Now then, step in. 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 
 coming between. But I'll not let her. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Step this way, Parmeno; you are gone too far that way; here pointing , stand close by him; there, that's what I want. Now then, take care you don't move your eyes in any direction from mine, that there may be no delay if I give you the sign, to your fist being instantly planted in his jaws. 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 I'd have him then try that. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 
 to PARMENO. Now then, observe me. 
 
 
 PARMENO 
 
 to SANNIO. Let go the woman. Strikes him. 
 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 Oh! scandalous deed!
 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 He shall repeat it, if you don't take care. PARMENO strikes him again. 
 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 Oh shocking! 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 
 to PARMENO. I didn't give the sign; but still make your mistakes on that side in preference. Now then, go. PARMENO goes with the MUSIC-GIRL into MICIO'S house. 
 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 What is the meaning of this? Have you the sway here, Aeschinus? 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 If I had it, you should be exalted for your deserts. 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 What business have you with me? 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 None. 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 How then, do you know who I am? 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 I don't want to. 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 Have I touched any thing of yours? 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 If you had touched it, you'd have got a drubbing. 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 What greater right then have you to take my property, for which I paid my money? Answer me that. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 It were better for you not to be making a disturbance here before the house; for if you persist in being impertinent, you shall be dragged in at once, and there you shall be lashed to death with whips. 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 A free man, with whips? 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 So it shall be. 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 Oh, you shameless fellow! Is this the place where they say there is equal liberty for all? 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 If you have now raved enough, Procurer, now then listen, if you please. 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 Why, is it I that have been raving, or you against me? 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Leave alone all that, and come to the point. 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 What point? Where am I to come to? 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Are you willing now that I should say something that concerns you? 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 With all my heart, only so it be something that's fair. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Very fine! a Procurer wishing me not to say what's unfair. 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 I am a Procurer, 
 I confess it-the common bane of youthâ€”a perjurer, a public nuisance; still, no injury has befallen you from me.
 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Why, faith, that remains to comeâ€” 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 Pray, Aeschinus, do come back to the point at which you set out. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 You bought her for twenty nine; and may your bargain never thrive! That sum shall be given for her. 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 What if I don't choose to sell her to you? Will you compel me? 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 By no means. 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 I was afraid you would. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Neither do I think that a woman can be sold who is free; for I claim her by action of freedom. 
 Now consider which you choose; take the money, or prepare yourself for the action. Think of it, Procurer, till I return. 
 
 He goes into the house of MICIO. 
 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 
 to himself. O supreme Jupiter ! I do by no means wonder that men run mad through ill usage. He has dragged me out of my house, beaten me, taken my property away against my will, and has given me, unfortunate wretch, more than five hundred blows. In return for all this ill usage he demands the girl to be made over to him for just the same price at which she was bought. But however, since he has so well deserved of me, be it so: he demands what is his due. Very well, I consent then, provided he only gives the money. But I suspect this; when I have said that I will sell her for so much, he'll be getting witnesses forthwith that I have sold her. 
 As to getting the money, it's all a dream. Call again by and by; come back to-morrow. I could bear with that too, hard as it is, if he would only pay it. But I consider this to be the fact; when you take up this trade, you must brook and bear in silence the affronts of these young fellows. However, no one will pay me; it's in vain for me to be reckoning upon that.

Enter SYRUS, from the house of MICIO. 
 
 SYRUS 
 
 speaking to AECHINUS within. Say no more; I myself will arrange with him; I'll make him glad to take the money at once, and say besides that he has been fairly dealt with. Addressing SANNIO. Sannio, how is this, that I hear you have been having some dispute or other with my master? 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 I never saw a dispute on more unequal terms 
 than the one that has happened to-day between us; I, with being thumped, he, with beating me, were both of us quite tired. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Your own fault. 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 What could I do? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 You ought to have yielded to the young man. 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 How could I more so, when to-day I have even afforded my face to his blows? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Wellâ€”are you aware of what I tell you? To slight money on some occasions is sometimes the surest gain. What!â€”were you afraid, you greatest simpleton alive, if you had parted with ever so little 
 of your right, and had humored the young man, that he would not repay you with interest?
 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 I do not pay ready money for hope. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Then you'll never make a fortune. Get out with you, Sannio; you don't know how to take in mankind. 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 I believe that to be the better planâ€”but I was never so cunning as not, whenever I was able to get it, to prefer getting ready money. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Come, come, I know your spirit; as if twenty minae were any thing at all to you in comparison to obliging him; besides, they say that you are setting out for Cyprus â€” 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 (aside.) Hah! 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 That you have been buying up many things to take thither; and that the vessel is hired. This I know, your mind is in suspense; however, when you return thence, I hope you'll settle the matter. 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 Not a foot do stir: Heavens! I'm undone! Aside. It was upon this hope they devised their project. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 
 aside. He is alarmed. I've brought the fellow into a fix. 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 
 aside. Oh, what villainy!â€”Just look at that; how he has nicked me in the very joint.
 
 Several women have been purchased, and other things as well, for me to take to Cyprus .
 
 If I don't get there to the fair, my loss will, be very great. Then if I postpone this business, and settle it when I come back from there, it will be of no use; the matter will be quite forgotten. "Come at last?" they'll say. "Why did you delay it? Where have you been?" So that I had better lose it altogether than either stay here so long, or be suing for it then. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Have you by this reckoned
 
 up what you calculate will be your profits?
 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 Is this honorable of him? Ought Aeschinus to attempt this? Ought he to endeavor to take her away from me by downright violence? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 
 aside. He gives ground. To SANNIO. I have this one proposal to make; see if you fully approve of it. Rather than you should run the risk, Sannio, of getting or losing the whole, halve it. He will manage to scrape together ten minae 
 from some quarter or other. 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 Ah me! unfortunate wretch, I am now in danger of even losing part of the principal. Has he no shame? He has loosened all my teeth; my head, too, is full of bumps with his cuffs; and would he defraud me as well? I shall go nowhere. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Just as you please. Have you any thing more to say before I go? 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 Why yes, Syrus, i' faith, I have this to request. Whatever the matters that are past, rather than go to law, let what is my own be returned me; at least, Syrus, the sum she cost me. I know that you have not hitherto made trial of my friendship; you will have no occasion to say that I am unmindful or ungrateful. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 I'll do the best I can. But I see Ctesipho; he's in high spirits about his mistress. 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 What about what I was asking you? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Stay a little.

Enter CTESIPHO, at the other side of the stage. 
 
 CTESIPHO 
 From any man, when you stand in need of it, you are glad to receive a service; but of a truth it is doubly acceptable, if he does you a kindness who ought to do so. O brother, brother, how can I sufficiently commend you? This I am quite sure of; I can never speak of you in such high terms but that your deserts will surpass it. For I am of opinion that I possess this one thing in especial beyond all others, a brother than whom no individual is more highly endowed with the highest qualities. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 O Ctesipho! 
 
 
 CTESIPHO 
 O Syrus, where is Aeschinus? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Why, lookâ€”he's at home, waiting for you. 
 
 
 CTESIPHO 
 
 speaking joyously. Ha! 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 What's the matter? 
 
 
 CTESIPHO 
 What's the matter? 'Tis through him, Syrus, that I am now aliveâ€”generous creature! Has he not deemed every thing of secondary importance to himself in comparison with my happiness? The reproach, the discredit, my own amour and imprudence, he has taken upon himself. There can be nothing beyond this; but what means that noise at the door? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Stay, stay; 'tis Aeschinus himself coming out.

Enter AESCHINUS, from the house of MICIO. 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Where is that villain? 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 
 aside. He's looking for me. Is he bringing any thing with him? Confusion! I don't see any thing. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 
 to CTESIPHO. Ha! well met; you are the very man I was looking for. How goes it, Ctesipho? All is safe: away then with your melancholy. 
 
 
 CTESIPHO 
 By my troth, I certainly will away with it, when I have such a brother as you. O my dear Aeschinus! O my brother! Alas! I am unwilling to praise you any more to your face, lest you should think I do so rather for flattery than through gratitude. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Go to, you simpleton! as though we didn't by this time understand each other, Ctesipho. This grieves me, that we knew of it almost too late, and that the matter had come to such a pass, that if all mankind had wished they could not possibly have assisted you. 
 
 
 CTESIPHO 
 I felt ashamed.
 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Pooh! that is folly, not shame; about such a trifling matter to be almost flying the country!
 
 'Tis shocking to be mentioned; I pray the Gods may forbid it! 
 
 
 CTESIPHO 
 I did wrong. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 
 in a lower voice. What says Sannio to us at last? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 He is pacified at last. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 I'll go to the Forum to pay him off; you, Ctesipho, step in-doors to her. 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 
 aside to SYRUS. Syrus, do urge the matter. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 
 to AESCHINUS. Let us be off, for he is in haste foe' Cyprus .
 
 
 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 Not particularly so; although still, I'm stopping here doing nothing at all. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 It shall be paid, don't fear. 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 But he is to pay it all. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 He shall pay it all; only hold your tongue and follow us this way. 
 
 
 SANNIO 
 I'll follow. 
 
 
 CTESIPHO 
 
 as SYRUS is going. Harkye, harkye, Syrus. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 
 turning back. Well now, what is it? 
 
 
 CTESIPHO 
 
 aside. Pray do discharge that most abominable fellow as soon as possible; for fear, in case he should become more angry, by some means or other this matter should reach my father, and then I should be ruined forever. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 That shall not happen, be of good heart; meanwhile enjoy yourself in-doors with her, and order the couches
 
 to be spread for us, and the other things to be got ready. As soon as this business is settled, I shall come home with the provisions. 
 
 
 CTESIPHO 
 Pray do so. Since this has turned out so well, let us make a cheerful day of it. CTESIPHO goes into the house of MICIO; and exeunt AESCHINUS and SYRUS, followed by SANNIO.

Enter SOSTRATA and CANTHARA, from the house of the former. 
 
 SOSTRATA 
 Prithee, my dear nurse, how is it like to end? 
 
 
 CANTHARA 
 Like to end, do you ask? I' troth, right well, I trust. 
 
 
 SOSTRATA 
 Her pains are just beginning, my dear. 
 
 
 CANTHARA 
 You are in a flight, now, just as though you had never been present on such an occasionâ€”never been in labor yourself. 
 
 
 SOSTRATA 
 Unfortunate woman that I am! I have not a person at home; we are quite alone; Geta too is absent. I have no one to go for the midwife, or to fetch Aeschinus. 
 
 
 CANTHARA 
 I' faith, he'll certainly be here just now, for he never lets a day pass without visiting us. 
 
 
 SOSTRATA 
 He is my sole comfort in my afflictions. 
 
 
 CANTHARA 
 Things could not have happened, mistress, more for the advantage of your daughter than they have, seeing that violence was offered her; so far as he is concerned, it is most lucky,â€”such a person, of such disposition and feelings, a member of so respectable a family. 
 
 
 SOSTRATA 
 It is indeed as you say; I entreat the Gods that he may be preserved to us. They stand apart, on seeing GETA.

Enter GETA, on the other side of the stage. 
 
 GETA 
 
 to himself. Now such is our condition, that if all were to combine all their counsels, and to seek a remedy for this mischief that has befallen myself, my mistress, and her daughter, they could find no relief. Oh wretched me! so many calamities beset us on a sudden, we can not possibly extricate ourselves. Violence, poverty, oppression, desertion, infamy! What an age is this! O shocking villainy! O accursed race! O impious man!â€” 
 
 
 SOSTRATA 
 Unhappy me! How is it that I see Geta hurrying along thus terrified? 
 
 
 GETA 
 
 continuing. Whom neither promises, nor oaths, nor compassion could move or soften; nor yet the fact that the delivery was nigh at hand of the unfortunate woman on whom he had so shamefully committed violence. 
 
 
 SOSTRATA 
 
 apart to CANTHARA. I don't well understand what he is talking about. 
 
 
 CANTHARA 
 Pray, let us go nearer to him, Sostrata. 
 
 
 GETA 
 
 continuing. Ah wretched me! I am scarcely master of my senses, I am so inflamed with anger. There is nothing that 1 would like better than for all that family to be thrown in my way, that I might give vent to all my wrath upon them while this wound is still fresh. 1 could be content with any punishment, so I might only wreak my vengeance on them. First, I would stop the breath of the old fellow himself who gave being to this monster; then as for his prompter, Syrus, out upon him! How I would tear him piecemeal! I would snatch him by the middle up aloft, and dash him head downward upon the earth, so that with his brains he would bestrew the road: I would pull out the eyes of the young fellow himself, and afterward hurl him headlong over some precipice. The others I would rush upon, drive, drag, crush, and trample them under foot. But why do I delay at once to acquaint my mistress with this calamity? Moves as if going. 
 
 
 
 SOSTRATA 
 
 to CANTHARA. Let us call him Lack. Getaâ€” 
 
 
 GETA 
 Wellâ€”leave me alone,
 
 whoever you are. 
 
 
 SOSTRATA 
 'Tis I,â€”Sostrata. 
 
 
 GETA 
 
 turning round. Why, where are you? You are the very person I am looking for. I was in quest of you; it's very fortunate you have met me. 
 
 
 SOSTRATA 
 What's the matter? Why are you trembling?
 
 
 
 GETA 
 Alas! alas! 
 
 
 SOSTRATA 
 My dear Geta, why in such haste? Do take breath. 
 
 
 GETA 
 Quiteâ€” pauses. 
 
 
 
 SOSTRATA 
 Why, what means this "quite"? 
 
 
 GETA 
 Undoneâ€”It's all over with us. 
 
 
 SOSTRATA 
 Say, then, I entreat you, what is the matter. 
 
 
 GETA 
 Nowâ€” 
 
 
 SOSTRATA 
 What "now," Geta? 
 
 
 GETA 
 Aeschinusâ€” 
 
 
 SOSTRATA 
 What about him? 
 
 
 GETA 
 Has abandoned our family. 
 
 
 SOSTRATA 
 Then I am undone! Why so? 
 
 
 GETA 
 He has attached himself to another woman. 
 
 
 SOSTRATA 
 Woe unto wretched me! 
 
 
 GETA 
 And he makes no secret of it; he himself has carried her off openly from a procurer. 
 
 
 SOSTRATA 
 Are you quite sure of this? 
 
 
 GETA 
 Quite sure; I saw it myself, Sostrata, with these same eyes. 
 
 
 SOSTRATA 
 Ah wretched me! What is one now to believe, or whom believe? Our own Aeschinus, the very life of us all, in whom all our hopes and comforts were centred! Who used to swear he could never live a single day without her! Who used to say, that he would place the infant on his father's knees,
 
 and thus entreat that he might be allowed to make her his wife! 
 
 
 GETA 
 Dear mistress, forbear weeping, and rather consider what must be done for the future in this matter. Shall we submit to it, or shall we tell it to any person? 
 
 
 CANTHARA 
 Pooh, pooh! Are you in your senses, my good man? Does this seem to you a business to be made known to any one? 
 
 
 GETA 
 I, indeed, have no wish for it. In the first place, then, that his feelings are estranged from us, the thing itself declares. Now, if we make this known, he'll deny it, I'm quite sure; your reputation and your daughter's character will then be in danger. On the other hand, if he were fully to confess it, as he is in love with another woman, it would not be to her advantage to be given to him. Therefore, under either circumstance, there is need of silence. 
 
 
 SOSTRATA 
 Oh! by no means in the world! I'll not do it. 
 
 
 GETA 
 What is it you say? 
 
 
 SOSTRATA 
 I'll make it known. 
 
 
 GETA 
 Ha, my dear Sostrata, take care what you do! 
 
 
 SOSTRATA 
 The matter can not possibly be in a worse position than it is at present. In the first place, she has no portion; then, besides, that which was as good as a portion, her honor, is lost: she can not be given in marriage as a virgin. This resource is left; if he should deny it, I have a ring which he lost as evidence of the truth. In fine, Geta, as I am fully conscious that no blame attaches to me, and that neither interest nor any consideration unworthy of her or of myself has had a share in this matter, I will make trialâ€” 
 
 
 GETA 
 What am I to say to this? I agree, as you speak for the best. 
 
 
 SOSTRATA 
 You be off as fast as possible, and relate all the matter just as it has happened to her kinsman Hegio; for he was the best friend of our lamented Simulus, and has shown especial regard for us. 
 
 
 GETA 
 
 aside. Aye, faith, because nobody else takes any notice of us. 
 
 
 SOSTRATA 
 Do you, my dear Canthara, run with all haste, and fetch the midwife, so that, when she is wanted, we may not have to wait for her. SOSTRATA goes into the house, and exit GETA and CANTHARA.

Enter DEMEA. 
 
 DEMEA 
 
 to himself. Utterly undone! I hear that Ctesipho was with Aeschinus at the carrying off of this girl. This sorrow still remains for unhappy me, should Aeschinus be able to seduce him, even him, who promises so fair, to a course of debauchery. Where am I to inquire for him? I doubt he has been carried off to some bad house; that profligate has persuaded him, I'm quite sure. But lookâ€”I see Syrus coming this way, I shall now know from him where he is. But, i 'faith, he is one of the gang; if he perceives that I am looking for him, the rascal will never tell me. I'll not let him know what I want.
 Enter SYRUS, at the other side of the stage. 
 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 
 to himself. We just now told the old gentleman the whole affair just as it happened; I never did see any one more delighted. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 
 apart. O Jupiter ! the folly of the man! 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 
 continuing. He commended his son. To me, who put them upon this project, he gave thanksâ€” 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 
 apart. I shall burst asunder. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 
 continuing. He told down the money instantly, and gave me half a mina besides to spend. That was laid out quite to my liking. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 
 apart. Very fineâ€”if you would wish a thing to be nicely managed, intrust it to this fellow. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 
 overhearing him. Ha, Demea! I didn't see you; how goes it? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 How should it go? I can not enough wonder at your mode of living here. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Why, really silly enough, and, to speak without disguise, altogether absurd. Calls at the door of MICIO'S house. Dromo, clean the: rest of the fish; let the largest conger-eel play a little in the water; when I come back it shall, be boned;
 
 not before. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Is profligacy like thisâ€” 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 As for myself, it isn't to my taste, and I often exclaim against it. Calls; at the door. Stephanio, take care that the salt fish is well soaked. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Ye Gods, by our trust in you! Is he doing this for any purpose of his own, or does he think it creditable to ruin his son? Wretch that I am! methinks I already see the day when Aeschinus will be running away for want, to serve somewhere or other as a soldier.
 
 
 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 O Demea ! That is wisdom indeed, not only to look at the present moment, but also to look forward to what's to come. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Wellâ€”is this Music-girl still with you? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Why, yes, she's in-doors. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 How nowâ€”is he going to keep her at home? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 I believe so; such is his madness! 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Is it possible? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 An imprudent lenity in his father, and a vicious inlulgence. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Really, I am ashamed and grieved at my brother. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Demea! Between you there is a greatâ€”I do not say it because you are here presentâ€”a too great difference. You are, every bit of you, nothing but wisdom; he a mere dreamer. Would you indeed have suffered that son of yours to act thus? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 I, suffer him? Would I not have smelt it out six months before he attempted it? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Need I be told by you of your foresight? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 I pray he may only continue the same he is at present! 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Just as each person wishes his son to be, so he turns out. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 What news of him? Have you seen him to-day? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 What, your son? Aside. I'll pack him off into the country. To DEMEA. I fancy he's busy at the farm long before this. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Are you quite sure he is there? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 What!â€”when I saw him part of the way myselfâ€” 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Very good. I was afraid he might be loitering here. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 And extremely angry too. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Why so? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 He attacked his brother in the Forum with strong language about this Music-girl. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Do you really say so? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Oh dear, he didn't at all mince the matter; for just as the money was being counted out, the gentleman came upon us by chance, and began exclaiming, "Oh Aeschinus, that you should perpetrate these enormities! that you should be guilty of actions so disgraceful to our family!" 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Oh, I shall weep for joy. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 "By this you are not squandering your money only, but your reputation." 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 May he be preserved to me! I trust he will be like his forefathers. Weeping. 
 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 
 aside. Heyday! 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Syrus, he is full of these maxims. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 
 aside. Strange, indeed! He had the means at home of learning them. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 I do every thing I can; I spare no pains; I train him up to it: in fine, I bid him look into the lives of men, as though into a mirror, and from others to take an example for himself. Do this, I sayâ€” 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Quite right. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Avoid thatâ€” 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Very shrewd. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 This is praiseworthyâ€” 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 That's the thing. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 That is considered blamableâ€” 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Extremely good. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 And then, moreoverâ€” 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Upon my honor, I have not the leisure to listen to you just at present: I have got some fish just to my taste, and must take care they are not spoiled; for that would be as much a crime in me, as for you, Demea, not to observe those maxims which you have just been mentioning; and so far as I can, I lay down precepts for my fellow-servants on the very same plan; "this is too salt, that is quite burned up, this is not washed enough, that is very well done; remember and do so another time." I carefully instruct them so far as I can to the best of my capacity. In short, Demea, I bid them look into their sauce-pans as though into a mirror,
 
 and suggest to them what they ought to do. I am sensible these things are trifling which we do; but what is one to do? According as the man is, so must you humor him. Do you wish any thing else? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 That more wisdom may be granted you. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 You will be going off into the country, I suppose? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Directly. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 For what should you do here, where, if you do give any good precepts, no one will regard them? Goes into MICIO'S house. 
 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 
 to himself. I certainly will be off, as he on whose account I came hither has gone into the country. I have a care for him: that alone is my own concern, since my brother will have it so; let him look to the other himself. But who is it I see yonder at a distance? Isn't it Hegio of our tribes?
 
 If I see right, i' faith, it is he. Ah, a man I have been friendly with from a child! Good Gods! we certainly have a great dearth of citizens of that stamp nowadays, with the old-fashioned virtue and honesty. Not in a hurry will any misfortune accrue to the public from him. How glad I am to find some remnants of this race even still remaining; now I feel some pleasure in living. I'll wait here for him, to ask him how he is, and have some conversation with him.

Enter HEGIO and GETA, conversing, at a distance. 
 
 HEGIO 
 Oh immortal Gods! a disgraceful action, Geta! What is it you tell me? 
 
 
 GETA 
 Such is the fact.
 
 
 
 HEGIO 
 That so ignoble a deed should come from that family! Oh Aeschinus, assuredly you haven't taken after your father in that ! 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 
 apart. Why surely, he has heard this about the Music-girl; that gives him concern, though a stranger; this father of his thinks nothing of it. Ah me! I wish he were somewhere close at hand to overhear this. 
 
 
 HEGIO 
 Unless they do as they ought to do, they shall not come off so easily. 
 
 
 GETA 
 All our hopes, Hegio, are centred in you; you we have for our only friend; you are our protector, our father. The old man, Simulus, when dying, recommended us to you; if you forsake us, we are undone. 
 
 
 HEGIO 
 Beware how you mention that; I neither will do it, nor do I think that, with due regard to the ties of relationship, I could. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 
 apart. I'll accost him. Approaches HEGIO. Hegio, I bid you welcome right heartily; 
 
 
 HEGIO 
 
 starting. Oh! you are the very man I was looking for. Greetings to you, Demea. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Why, what's the matter? 
 
 
 HEGIO 
 Your eldest son Aeschinus, whom you gave to your brother to adopt, has been acting the part of neither an honest man nor a gentleman. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 What has he been doing? 
 
 
 HEGIO 
 You knew my friend and year's-mate, Simulus? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Why not? 
 
 
 HEGIO 
 He has debauched his daughter, a virgin. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Hah! 
 
 
 HEGIO 
 Stay, Demea. You have not yet heard the worst. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Is there any thing still worse? 
 
 
 HEGIO 
 Worse, by far: for this indeed might in some measure have been borne with. The hour of night prompted him; passion, wine, young blood; 'tis human nature. When he was sensible of what he had done, he came voluntarily to the girl's mother, weeping, praying, entreating, pledging his honor, vowing that he would take her home.
 
 The affair was pardoned, hushed up, his word taken. The girl from that intercourse became pregnant: this is the tenth month. He, worthy fellow, has provided himself, if it please the Gods, with a Music-girl to live with; the other he has cast off. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Do you say this for certain? 
 
 
 HEGIO 
 The mother of the young woman is among us,
 
 the young woman too; the fact speaks for itself; this Geta, besides, according to the common run of servants, not a bad one or of idle habits; he supports them; alone, maintains the whole family; take him, bind him,
 
 examine him upon the matter. 
 
 
 GETA 
 Aye, faith, put me to the torture, Demea, if such is not the fact: besides, he will not deny it. Confront me with him. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 
 aside. I am ashamed; and what to do, or how to answer him, I don't know. 
 
 
 PAMPHILA 
 
 crying out within the house of SOSTRATA. Ah me! I am racked with pains! Juno Lucina,
 
 bring aid, save me, I beseech thee. 
 
 
 HEGIO 
 Hold; is she in labor, pray? 
 
 
 GETA 
 No doubt of it, Hegio. 
 
 
 HEGIO 
 Ah! she is now imploring your protection, Demea; let her obtain from you spontaneously what the power of the law compels you to give. I do entreat the Gods that what befits you may at once be clone. But if your sentiments are otherwise, Demea, I will defend both them and him who is dead to the utmost of my power. He was my kinsman:
 
 we were brought up together from children, we were companions in the wars and at home, together we experienced the hardships of poverty. I will therefore exert myself, strive, use all methods, in fine lay down my life, rather than forsake these women. What answer do you give me? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 I'll go find my brother, Hegio: the advice he gives me upon this matter I'll follow.
 
 
 
 
 
 HEGIO 
 But, Demea, take you care and reflect upon this: the more easy you are in your circumstances, the more powerful, wealthy, affluent, and noble you are, so much the more ought you with equanimity to observe the dictates of justice, if you would have yourselves esteemed as men of probity. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Go back now;
 
 every thing shall be done that is proper to be done. 
 
 
 HEGIO 
 It becomes you to act thus. Geta, show me in to Sostrata. Follows GETA into SOSTRATA'S house. 
 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 
 to himself. Not without warning on my part have these things happened: I only wish it may end here; but this immoderate indulgence will undoubtedly lead to some great misfortune. I'll go find my brother, and vent these feelings upon him. (Exit.)

Enter HEGIO, from SOSTRATA'S house, and speaking to her within. 
 
 HEGIO 
 Be of good heart, Sostrata, and take care and console her as far as you can. I'll go find Micio, if he is at the Forum, and acquaint him with the whole circumstances in their order; if so it is that he will do his duty by you, let him do so; but if his sentiments are otherwise about this matter, let him give me his answer, that I may know at once what I am to do. (Exit.)

Enter CTESIPHO and SYRUS from the house of MICIO. 
 
 CTESIPHO 
 My father gone into the country, say you? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 
 with a careless air. Some time since. 
 
 
 CTESIPHO 
 Do tell me, I beseech you. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 He is at the farm at this very moment,
 
 I warrantâ€”hard at some work or other. 
 
 
 CTESIPHO 
 I really wish, provided it be done with no prejudice to his health, I wish that he may so effectually tire himself, that, for the next three days together, he may be unable to arise from his bed. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 So be it, and any thing still better than that,
 
 if possible. 
 
 
 CTESIPHO 
 Just so; for I do most confoundedly wish to pass this whole day in merry-making as I have begun it; and for no reason do I detest that farm so heartily as for its being so near town. If it were at a greater distance, night would overtake him there before he could return hither again. Now, when he doesn't find me there, he'll come running back here, I'm quite sure; he'll be asking me where I have been, that I have not seen him all this day: what am I to say? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Does nothing suggest itself to your mind? 
 
 
 CTESIPHO 
 Nothing whatever. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 So much the worse
 
 â€”have you no client, friend, or guest?
 
 
 
 CTESIPHO 
 I have; what then? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 You have been engaged with them. 
 
 
 CTESIPHO 
 When I have not been engaged? That can never do. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 It may. 
 
 
 CTESIPHO 
 During the daytime; but if I pass the night here, what excuse can I make, Syrus? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Dear me, how much I do wish it was the custom for one to be engaged with friends at night as well! But you be easy; I know his humor perfectly well. When he raves the most violently, I can make him as gentle as a lamb. 
 
 
 CTESIPHO 
 In what way? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 He loves to hear you praised: I make a god of you to him, and recount your virtues. 
 
 
 CTESIPHO 
 What, mine 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Yours; immediately the tears fall from him as from a child, for very joy. Starting. Hah take careâ€” 
 
 
 CTESIPHO 
 Why, what's the matter? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 The wolf in the fable
 
 â€” 
 
 
 CTESIPHO 
 What! my father? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 His own self. 
 
 
 CTESIPHO 
 What shall we do, Syrus? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 You only be off in-doors, I'll see to that.
 
 
 
 CTESIPHO 
 If he makes any inquiries, you have seen me no-where; do you hear? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Can you not be quiet? They retreat to the door of MICIO'S house, and CTESIPHO stands in the doorway.

Enter DEMEA, on the other side of the stage. 
 
 DEMEA 
 
 to himself. I certainly am an unfortunate man. In the first place, I can find my brother nowhere; and then, in the next place, while looking for him, I met a day-laborer from the farm; he says that my son is not in the country, and what to do I know notâ€” 
 
 
 CTESIPHO 
 
 apart. Syrus! 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 
 apart. What's the matter? 
 
 
 CTESIPHO 
 
 apart. Is he looking for me? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 
 apart. Yes. 
 
 
 CTESIPHO 
 
 apart. Undone! 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 
 apart. Nay, do be of good heart. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 
 to himself. Plague on it! what ill luck is this? I can not really account for it, unless I suppose myself only born for the purpose of enduring misery. I am the first to feel our misfortunes; the first to know of them all; then the first to carry the news; I am the only one, if any thing does go wrong, to take it to heart. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 
 apart. I'm amused at him; he says that he is the first to know of every thing, while he is the only one ignorant of every thing. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 
 to himself. I've now come back; and I'll go see whether perchance my brother has yet returned. 
 
 
 CTESIPHO 
 
 apart. Syrus, pray do take care that he doesn't suddenly rush in upon us here. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 
 apart. Now will you hold your tongue? I'll take care. 
 
 
 CTESIPHO 
 
 apart. Never this day will I depend on your management for that, upon my faith; for I'll shut myself up with her in some cupboard
 
 â€”that's the safest. Goes into the house. 
 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 
 apart. Do so, still I'll get rid of him. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 
 seeing SYRUS. But see! there's that rascal, Syrus. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 
 aloud, pretending not to see DEMEA. Really, upon my faith, no person can stay here, if this is to be the case! ]For my part, I should like to know how many masters I haveâ€”what a cursed condition this is 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 What's he whining about? What does he mean? How say you, good sir, is my brother at home? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 What the plague do you talk to me about, "good sir"? I'm quite distracted! 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 What's the matter with you? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Do you ask the question Ctesipho has been beating me, poor wretch, and that Music-girl, almost to death. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Ha! what is it you tell me? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Aye, see how he has cut my lip. Pretends to point to it. 
 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 For what reason? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 He says that she was bought by my advice. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Did not you tell me, a short time since, that you had seen him on his way into the country? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 I did; but he afterward came back, raving like a madman; he spared nobodyâ€”ought he not to have been ashamed to beat an old man? Him whom, only the other day, I used to carry about in my arms when thus high? Showing. 
 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 I commend him; O Ctesipho, you take after your father. Well, I do pronounce you a man. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Commend him? Assuredly he will keep his hands to himself in future, if he's wise. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 'Twas done with spirit. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Very much so, to be beating a poor woman, and me, a slave, who didn't dare strike him in return; heyday! very spirited indeed! 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 He could not have done better; he thought the same as I did, that you were the principal in this affair. But is my brother within?
 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 He is not. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 I'm thinking where to look for him. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 I know where he isâ€”but I shall not tell you at present. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Ha! what's that you say? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 I do say so. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Then I'll break your head for you this instant. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 I can't tell the person's name he's gone to, but I know the place where he lives. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Tell me the place then. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Do you know the portico down this way, just by the shambles? Pointing in the direction. 
 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 How should I but know it? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Go straight along, right up that street; when you come there, there is a descent right opposite that goes down-ward, go straight down that; afterward, on this side extending one hand , there is a chapel: close by it is a narrow lane, where there's also a great wild fig-tree. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 I know it. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Go through thatâ€” 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 But that lane is not a thoroughfare. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 I' faith, that's true; dear, dear, would you take me to be in my senses?
 
 I made a mistake. Return to the portico; indeed that will be a much nearer way, and there is less going round about you know the house of Cratinus, the rich man? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 I know it. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 When you have passed that, keep straight along that street on the left hand;
 
 when you come to the Temple of Diana, turn to the right; before you come to the city gate, 
 just by that pond, there is a baker's shop, and opposite to it a joiner's; there he is.
 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 What is he doing there? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 He has given some couches to be made, with oaken legs, for use in the open air.
 
 
 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 For you to carouse upon! Very fine ! But why do I delay going to him? (Exit.) 
 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Go, by all means. I'll work you to day, you skeleton,
 
 as you deserve. Aeschinus loiters intolerably; the breakfast's spoiling; arid as for Ctesipho, he's head and ears in love.
 
 I shall now think of myself, for I'll be off at once, and pick out the very nicest bit, and, leisurely sipping my cups,
 
 I'll lengthen out the day. Goes into the house.

Enter MICIO and HEGIO. 
 
 MICIO 
 I can see no reason here, Hegio, that I should be so greatly commended. I do my duty; the wrong that has originated with us I redress. Unless, perhaps, you thought me one of that class of men who think that an injury is purposely done them if you expostulate about any thing they have done; and yet are themselves the first to accuse. Because I have not acted thus, do you return me thanks? 
 
 
 HEGIO 
 Oh, far from it; I never led myself to believe you to be otherwise than you are; but I beg, Micio, that you will go with me to the mother of the young woman, and repeat to her the same; what you have told me, do you yourself tell the woman, that this suspicion of Aeschinus's fidelity was incurred on his brother's account, and that this Music-girl was for him. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 If you think I ought, or if there is a necessity for doing so, let us go. 
 
 
 HEGIO 
 You act with kindness; for you'll then both have relieved her mind who is now languishing in sorrow and affliction, and have discharged your duty. But if you think otherwise, I will tell her myself what you have been saying to me. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Nay, I'll go as well. 
 
 
 HEGIO 
 You act with kindness; all who are in distressed circumstances are suspicious,
 
 to I know not what degree; they take every thing too readily as an affront; they fancy themselves trifled with on account of their helpless condition; therefore it will be more satisfactory for you to justify him to them yourself. They go into the house of SOSTRATA.

Enter AESCHINUS. 
 I am quite distracted in mind! for this misfortune so unexpectedly to befall me, that I neither know what to do with myself, or how to act! My limbs are enfeebled through fear, my faculties bewildered with apprehension; no counsel is able to find a place within my breast. Alas! how to extricate myself from this perplexity I know not; so strong a suspicion has taken possession of them about me; not without some reason too: Sostrata believes that I have purchased this Music-girl for myself: the old woman informed me of that. For by accident, when she was sent for the midwife, I saw her, and at once went up to her. "How is Pamphila?" I inquired; "is her delivery at hand? Is it for that she is sending for the midwife?" "Away, away, Aeschinus," cries she; "you have deceived us long enough; already have your promises disappointed us sufficiently." "Ha !" said I; "pray what is the meaning of this?" "Farewell," she cries; "keep to her who is your choice." I instantly guessed what it was they suspected, but still I checked myself, that I might not be telling that gossip any thing about my brother, whereby it might be divulged. Now what am I to do? Shall I say she is for my brother, a thing that ought:by no means to be repeated any where? However, let that pass. It is possible it might go no further. I am afraid they would not believe it, so many probabilities concur against it; 'twas I myself carried her off; 'twas I, my own self, that paid the money for her; 'twas my own house she was carried to. This I confess has been entirely my own fault. Ought I not to have disclosed this affair, just as it happened, to my father? I might have obtained his consent to marry her. I have been too negligent hitherto; henceforth, then, arouse yourself, Aeschinus. This then is the first thing; to go to them and clear myself. I'll approach the door. Advances to the door of SOSTRATA'S house. Confusion! I always tremble most dreadfully when I go to knock at that door. Knocking and calling to them within. Ho there, ho there! it is Aeschinus; open the door immediately, some one. The door opens. Some person, I know not who, is coming out; I'll step aside here. He stands apart.

Enter MICIO from the house of SOSTRATA. 
 
 MICIO 
 
 speaking at the door to SOSTRATA. Do as I told you, Sostrata; I'll go find Aeschinus, that lie may know how these matters have been settled. Looking round. But who was it knocking at the door? 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 
 apart. Heavens, it is my father!â€”I am undone ! 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Aeschinus ! 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 
 aside. What can be his business here? 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Was it you knocking at this door? Aside. He is silent. Why shouldn't I rally him a little? It would be as well, as he was never willing to trust me with this secret. To AESCHINUS. Don't you answer me? 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 
 confusedly. It wasn't I knocked at that door, that I know of. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Just so; for I wondered what business you could have here. Apart. He blushes; all's well. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Pray tell me, father, what business have you there? 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Why, none of my own; but a certain friend of mine just now brought me hither from the Forum to give him some assistance. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Why? 
 
 
 MICIO 
 I'll tell you. There are some women living here; in impoverished circumstances, as I suppose you don't know them; and, in fact, I'm quite sure, for it is not long since they removed to this place. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Well, what next? 
 
 
 MICIO 
 There is a girl living with her mother. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Go on. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 This girl has lost her father; this friend of mine is her next of kin; the law obliges him to marry her.
 
 
 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 
 aside. Undone! 
 
 
 MICIO 
 What's the matter? 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Nothing. Very well: proceed. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 He has come to take her with him; for he lives at Miletus .
 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 What ! To take the girl away with him? 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Such is the act. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 All the way to Miletus , pray?
 
 
 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Yes. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 
 aside. I'm overwhelmed with grief To MICIO. But what of them? What do they say? 
 
 
 MICIO 
 What do you suppose they should? Why, nothing at all. The mother has trumped up a tale, that there is a child by some other man, I know not who, and she does not state the name; she says that he was the first, and that she ought not to be given to the other. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Well now, does not this seem just to you after all? 
 
 
 MICIO 
 No. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Why not, pray? Is the other to be carrying her away from here? 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Why should he not take her? 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 You have acted harshly and unfeelingly, and even, if, father, I may speak my sentiments more plainly, unhandsomely. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Why so? 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Do you ask me? Pray, what do you think must be the state of mind of the man who was first connected with her, who, to his misfortune, may perhaps still love her to distraction, when he sees her torn away from before his face, and borne off from his sight forever? An unworthy action, father! 
 
 
 MICIO 
 On what grounds is it so? Who betrothed her?
 
 Who gave her away? When and to whom was she married? Who was the author of all this? Why did he connect himself with a woman who belonged to another? 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Was it to be expected that a young woman of her age should sit at home, waiting till a kinsman of hers should come from a distance? This, my father, you ought to have represented, and have insisted on it.
 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Ridiculous! Was I to have pleaded against him whom I was to, support But what's all this, Aeschinus, to us? What have we to do with them? Let us begone:â€” What's the matter? Why these tears? 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 
 weeping. Father, I beseech you, listen to me. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Aeschinus, I have heard and know it all; for I love you, and therefore every thing you do is the more a care to me. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 So do I wish you to find me deserving of your love, as long as you live, my dear father, as I am sincerely sorry for the offense I have committed, and am ashamed to see you. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Upon my word 1 believe it, for I know your ingenuous disposition: but I am afraid that you are too inconsiderate. In what city, pray, do you suppose you live? You have debauched a virgin, whom it was not lawful for you to touch. In the first place then that was a great offense; great, but still natural. Others, and even men of worth, have frequently done the same. But after it happened, pray, did you show any circumspection? Or did you use any foresight as to what was to be done, or how it was to be done? If you were ashamed to tell me of it, by what means was I to come to know it? While you were at a loss upon these points, ten months have been lost. So far indeed as lay in your power, you have periled both yourself and this poor girl, and the child. What did you imagineâ€”that the Gods would set these matters to rights for you while you were asleep, and that she would be brought home to your chamber without any exertions of your own? I would not have you to be equally negligent in other affairs. Be of good heart, you shall have her for your wife. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Hah! 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Be of good heart, I tell you. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Father, are you now jesting with me, pray? 
 
 
 MICIO 
 I, jesting with you! For what reason? 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 I don't know; but so anxiously do I wish this to be true, that I am the more afraid it may not be. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Go home, and pray to the Gods that you may have your wife; be off. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 What! have my wife now?
 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Now. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Now? 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Now, as soon as possible. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 May all the Gods detest me, father, if I do not love you better than even my very eyes! 
 
 
 MICIO 
 What! better than her? 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Quite as well. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Very kind of you ! 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Well, where is this Milesian? 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Departed, vanished, gone on board ship; but why do you delay? 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Father, do you rather go and pray to the Gods; for I know, for certain, that they will rather be propitious to you,
 
 as being a much better man than I am. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 I'll go in-doors, that what is requisite may be prepared. You do as I said, if you are wise. Goes into his house. 
 AESCHINUS alone. 
 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 What can be the meaning of this? Is this being a father, or this being a son? If he had been a brother or familiar companion, how could he have been more complaisant ! Is he not worthy to be beloved? Is he not to be imprinted in my very bosom? Well then, the more does he impose an obligation on me by his kindness, to take due precaution not inconsiderately to do any thing that he may not wish. But why do I delay going in-doors this instant, that I may not myself delay my own nuptials? Goes into the house of MICIO.

Enter DEMEA. 
 I am quite tired with walking: May the great Jupiter confound you, Syrus, together with your directions! I have crawled the whole city over; to the gate, to the pondâ€”where not? There was no joiner's shop there; not a soul could say he had seen my brother; but now I'm determined to sit and wait at his house till he returns.

Enter MICIO from his house. 
 
 MICIO 
 
 speaking to the people within. I'll go and tell them there's no delay on our part. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 But see here's the very man: O Micio, I have been seeking you this long time. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Why, what's the matter? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 I'm bringing you some new and great enormities of that hopeful youth. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Just look at that! 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Fresh ones, of blackest dye. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 There nowâ€”at it again. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Ah, Micio! you little know what sort of person he is. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 I do. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 O simpleton! you are dreaming that I'm talking about the Music-girl; this crime is against a virgin and a citizen. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 I know it. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 So then, you know it, and put up with it! 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Why not put up with it? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Tell me, pray, don't you exclaim about it? Don't you go distracted? 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Not I: certainly I had rather
 
 â€”
 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 There has been a child born. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 May the Gods be propitious to it. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 The girl has no fortune. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 So I have heard. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 And heâ€”must he marry her without one? 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Of course. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 What is to be done then? 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Why, what the case itself points out: the young woman must be brought hither. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 O Jupiter! must that be the way then? 
 
 
 MICIO 
 What can I do else? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 What can you do?: If in reality this causes you no concern, to pretend it were surely the duty of a man. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 But I have already betrothed the young woman to him; the matter is settled: the marriage takes place to-day. I have removed all apprehensions. This is rather the duty of a man. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 But does the affair please you, Micio? 
 
 
 MICIO 
 If I were able to alter it, no; now, as I can not, I bear it with patience. The life of man is just like playing with dice:
 
 if that which you most want to throw does not turn up, what turns up by chance you must correct by art. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 O rare corrector! of course it is by your art that twenty minae have been thrown away for a Music-girl; who, as soon as possible, must be got rid of at any price; and if not for money, why then for nothing. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Not at all, and indeed I have no wish to sell her. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 What will you do with her then? 
 
 
 MICIO 
 She shall be at my house. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 For heaven's sake, a courtesan and a matron in the same house!
 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Why not? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Do you imagine you are in your senses 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Really I do think so. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 So may the Gods prosper me, I now see your folly; I believe you are going to do so that you may have somebody to practice music with. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Why not? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 And the new-made bride to be learning too? 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Of course. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Having hold of the rope,
 
 you will be dancing with them. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Like enough; and you too along with us, if there's need. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Ah me! are you not ashamed of this? 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Demea, do, for once, lay aside this anger of yours, and show yourself as you ought at your son's wedding, cheerful and good-humored. I'll just step over to them, and return immediately. Goes into SOSTRATA'S house. 
 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 O Jupiter ! here's a life! here are manners! here's madness! A wife to be coming without a fortune! A musicwench in the house! A house full of wastefulness! A young man ruined by extravagance! An:old man in his dotage!â€”Should Salvation herself
 
 desire it, she certainly could not save this family. (Exit.)

Enter SYRUS, drunk, and DEMEA, on the opposite side of the stage. 
 
 SYRUS 
 Upon my faith, my dear little Syrus, you have taken delicate care of yourself, and have done your duty 
 with exquisite taste; be off with you. But since I've had my fill of every thing in-doors, I have felt disposed to take a walk. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 
 apart. Just look at thatâ€”there's an instance of their good training! 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 
 to himself. But see, here comes our old man. Addressing him. What's the matter ? Why out of spirits? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Oh you rascal! 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Hold now; are you spouting your sage maxims here? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 If you were my servantâ€” 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Why, you would be a rich man, Demea, and improve your estate. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 I would take care that you should be an example to all the rest. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 For what reason ? What have I done ? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Do you ask me ? in the midst of this confusion, and during the greatest mischief, which is hardly yet set right, you have been getting drunk, you villain, as though things had been going on well. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 
 aside. Really, I wish I hadn't come out.

Enter DROMO in haste, from the house of MICIO. 
 
 DROMO 
 Halloo, Syrus! Ctesipho desires you'll come back. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Get you gone. Pushes him back into the house. 
 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 What is it he says about Ctesipho? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Nothing. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 How now, you hang-dog, is Ctesipho in the house? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 He is not. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Then why does he mention him? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 It's another person; a little diminutive Parasite. Don't you know him? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 I will know him before long. Going to the door. 
 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 
 stopping him. What are you about? Whither are you going? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 
 struggling. Let me alone. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 
 holding him. Don't, I tell you. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Won't you keep your hands off, whip-scoundrel? Or would you like me to knock your brains out this instant ? Rushes into the house. 
 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 He's gone! no very pleasant boon-companion, upon my faith, particularly to Ctesipho. What am I to do now ? Why, even get into some corner till this tempest is lulled, and sleep off this drop of wine. That's my plan. Goes into the house, staggering.

Enter MICIO, from the house of SOSTRATA. 
 
 MICIO 
 
 to SOSTRATA, within. Every thing's ready with us, as I told you, Sostrata, when you like.â€”Who, I wonder, is making my door fly open with such fury ?
 Enter DEMEA in haste, from the house of MICIO. 
 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Alas! what shall I do? How behave? In what terms exclaim, or how make my complaint? O heavens! O earth! O seas of Neptune ! 
 
 
 MICIO 
 
 apart. Here's for you! he has discovered all about the affair; and of course is now raving about it; a quarrel is the consequence; I must assist him, 
 however.
 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 See, here comes the common corrupter of my children. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Pray moderate your passion, and recover yourself. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 I have moderated it; I am myself; I forbear all reproaches; let us come to the point: was this agreed upon between us,â€”proposed by yourself, in fact,â€”that you were not to concern yourself about my son, nor I about yours? Answer me. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 It is the fact,â€”I don't deny it. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Why is he now carousing at your house? Why are you harboring my son ? Why do you purchase a mistress for him, Micio ? Is it at all fair, that I should have any less justice from you, than you from me? Since I do not concern myself about your son, don't you concern yourself about mine. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 You don't reason fairly. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 No ? 
 
 
 MICIO 
 For surely it is a maxim of old, that among themselves all things are common to friends. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Smartly said; you've got that speech up for the occasion. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Listen to a few words, unless it is disagreeable, Demea. In the first place, if the extravagance your sons are guilty of distresses you, pray do reason with yourself. You formerly brought up the two suitably to your circumstances, thinking that your own property would have to suffice for them both; and, of course, you then thought that I should marry. Adhere to that same old rule of yours,â€”save, scrape together, and be thrifty for them; take care to leave them as much as possible, and take that credit to yourself: my fortune, which has come to them beyond their expectation, allow them to enjoy; of your capital there will be no diminution; what comes from this quarter, set it all down as so much gain. If you think proper impartially to consider these matters in your mind, Demea, you will save me and yourself, and them, considerable uneasiness. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 I don't speak about the expense; their moralsâ€” 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Hold; I understand you; that point I was coming to. 
 There are in men, Demea, many signs from which a conjecture is easily formed; so that when two persons do the same thing, you may often say, this one may be allowed to do it with impunity, the other may not; not that the thing itself is different, but that he is who does it. I see signs in them, so as to feel confident that they will turn out as we wish. I see that they have good sense and understanding, that they have modesty upon occasion, and are affectionate to each other; you may infer that their bent and disposition is of a pliant nature; at any time you like you may reclaim them. But still, you may be apprehensive that they will be somewhat too apt to neglect their interests. O my dear Demea, in all other things we grow wiser with age; this sole vice does old age bring upon men: we are all more solicitous about our own interests than we need be; and in this respect age will make them sharp enough. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Only take care, Micio, that these fine reasonings of yours, and this easy disposition of yours, do not ruin us in the end. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Say no more; there's no danger of that. Now think no further of these matters. Put yourself to-day into my hands; smooth your brow. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Why, as the occasion requires it, I must do so; but to-morrow I shall be off with my son into the country at day-break. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Aye, to-night, for my share; only keep yourself in good-humor for the day. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 I'll carry off that Music-girl along with me as well. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 You will gain your point; by that means you will keep your son fast there; only take care to secure her. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 I'll see to that; and what with cooking and grinding, I'll take care she shall be well covered with ashes, smoke, and meal; besides all this, at the very mid-day 
 I'll set her gathering stubble; I'll make her as burned and as black as a coal. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 You quite delight me; now you seem to me to be wise; and for my part I would then compel my son to go to bed with her, even though he should be unwilling. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Do you banter me? Happy man, to have such a temper! I feelâ€” 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Ah ! at it again! 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 I'll have done then at once. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Go in-doors then, and let's devote this day to the object 
 to which it belongs. Goes into the house.

DEMEA alone. 
 
 DEMEA 
 Never was there any person of ever such well-trained habits of life, but that experience, age, and custom are always bringing him something new, or suggesting something; so much so, that what you believe you know you don't know, and what you have fancied of first importance to you, on making trial you reject; and this is my case at present: for the rigid life I have hitherto led, my race nearly run, I now renounce. Why so ?â€”I have found, by experience, that there is nothing better for a man than an easy temper and complacency. That this is the truth, it is easy for any one to understand on comparing me with my brother. He has always spent his life in ease and gayety; mild, gentle, offensive to no one, having a smile for all, he has lived for himself, and has spent his money for himself; all men speak well of him, all love him. I, again, a rustic, a rigid, cross, self-denying, morose and thrifty person, married a wife; what misery I entailed in consequence! Sons were bornâ€”a fresh care. And just look, while I have been studying to do as much as possible for them, I have worn out my life and years in saving; now, in the decline of my days, the return I get from them for my pains is their dislike. He, on the other hand, with out any trouble on his part, enjoys a father's comforts; they love him; me they shun; him they trust with all their secrets, are fond of him, are always with him. I am forsaken; they wish him to live; but my death, forsooth, they are longing for. Thus, after bringing them up with all possible pains, at a trifling cost he has made them his own; thus I bear all the misery, he enjoys the pleasure. Well, then, henceforward let us try, on the other hand, whether I can't speak kindly and act complaisantly, as he challenges me to it: I also want myself to be loved and highly valued by my friends. If that is to be effected by giving and indulging, I will not be behind him. If our means fail, that least concerns me, as I am the eldest.

Enter SYRUS. 
 
 SYRUS 
 Hark you, Demea, your brother begs you will not go out of the way. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Who is it?â€”O Syrus, my friend, 
 save you! how are you? How goes it with you? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Very well. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Very good. Aside. I have now for the first time used these three expressions contrary to my nature,â€”"O Syrus, my friend, how are you ?â€”how goes it with you?" To SYRUS. You show yourself far from an unworthy servant, and I shall gladly do you a service. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 I thank you. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Yes, Syrus, it is the truth; and you shall be convinced of it by experience before long.

Enter GETA, from the house of SOSTRATA. 
 
 GETA 
 
 to SOSTRATA, within . Mistress, I am going to see after them, that they may send for the damsel as soon as possible; but see, here's Demea. Accosting him. Save you! 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 O, what's your name? 
 
 
 GETA 
 Geta. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Geta, I have this day come to the conclusion that you are a man of very great worth, for I look upon him as an undoubtedly good servant who has a care for his master; as I have found to be your case, Geta; and for that reason, if any opportunity should offer, I would gladly do you a service. Aside. I am practicing the affable, and it succeeds very well. 
 
 
 GETA 
 You are kind, sir, to think so. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 
 aside. Getting on by degreesâ€”I'll first make the lower classes my own.

Enter AESCHINUS, from the house of MICIO. 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 
 to himself. They really are killing me while too intent on performing the nuptials with all ceremony; the whole day is being wasted in their preparations. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Aeschinus ! how goes it? 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Ha, my father! are you here ? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Your father, indeed, both by affection and by nature; as I love you more than my very eyes; but why don't you send for your wife ? 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 So I wish to do; but I am waiting for the music-girl 
 and people to sing the nuptial song. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Come now, are you willing to listen to an old fellow like me? 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 What is it? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Let those things alone, the nuptial song, the crowds, the torches, 
 and the music-girls, and order the stone wall in the garden 
 here to be pulled down with all dispatch, and bring her over that way; make but one house of the two; bring the mother and all the domestics over to our house. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 With all my heart, kindest father. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 
 aside. Well done! now I am called " kind." My brother's house will become a thoroughfare; he will be bringing home a multitude, incurring expense in many ways: what matters it to me ? I, as the kind Demea, shall get into favor. Now then, bid that Babylonian 
 pay down his twenty minae. To SYRUS. Syrus, do you delay to go and do it ? 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 What am I to do? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Pull down the wall: and you, Geta, go and bring them across. 
 
 
 GETA 
 May the Gods bless you, Demea, as I see you so sincere a well-wisher to our family. GETA and SYRUS go into MICIO'S house. 
 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 I think they deserve it. What say you, Aeschinus, as to this plan ? 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 I quite agree to it. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 It is much more proper than that she, being sick and lying-in, should be brought hither through the street. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Why, my dear father, I never did see any thing better contrived. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 It's my way; but see, here's Micio coming out.

Enter MICIO, from his house. 
 
 MICIO 
 
 speaking to GETA, within. Does my brother order it? Where is he? To DEMEA. Is this your order, Demea? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Certainly, I do order it, and in this matter, and in every thing else, wish especially to make this family one with ourselves, to oblige, serve, and unite them.
 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Father, pray let it be so. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 I do not oppose it. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 On the contrary, i' faith, it is what we ought to do: in the first place, she is the mother of his wife pointing to AESCHINUS . 
 
 
 MICIO 
 She is. What then? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 An honest and respectable woman. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 So they say. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Advanced in years. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 I am aware of it. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Through her years, she is long past child-bearing; there is no one to take care of her; she is a lone woman. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 
 aside. What can be his meaning ? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 It is right you should marry her; and that you, Aeschinus, should use your endeavors to effect it. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 I, marry her, indeed ? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 You. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 I? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 You, I say. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 You are trifling ! 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Aeschinus, if you are a man, he'll do it 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 My dear fatherâ€” 
 
 
 MICIO 
 What, ass! do you attend to him? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 'T is all in vain; it can not be otherwise. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 You are mad! 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Do let me prevail on you, my father. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Are you out of your senses? Take yourself off. 
 
 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Come, do oblige your son. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Are you quite in your right mind? Am I, in my five-and-sixtieth year, to be marrying at last? A decrepit old woman too ? Do you advise me to do this? 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Do; I have promised it. 
 
 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Promised, indeed; be generous at your own cost, young man. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Come, what if he should ask a still greater favor ?
 
 
 
 MICIO 
 As if this was not the greatest ! 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Do comply. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Don't make any difficulty. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Do promise. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Will you not have done? 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Not until I have prevailed upon you. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Really, this is downright force. 
 
 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Act with heartiness, Micio. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Although this seems to me 
 to be wrong, foolish, absurd, and repugnant to my mode of life, yet, if you so strongly wish it, be it so. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 You act obligingly. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 With reason I love you; butâ€” 
 
 
 MICIO 
 What ? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 I will tell you, when my wish has been complied with. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 What now ? What remains to be done? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Hegio here is their nearest relation; he is a connection of ours and poor; we ought to do some good for him. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Do what? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 There is a little farm here in the suburbs, which you let out; let us give it him to live upon. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 But is it a little one ? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 If it were a large one, still it ought to be done; he has been as it were a father to her; he is a worthy man, and connected with us; it would be properly bestowed. In fine, I now adopt that proverb which you, Micio, a short time ago repeated with sense and wisdomâ€”it is the common vice of all, in old age, to be too intent upon our own interests. This stain we ought to avoid: it is a true maxim, and ought to be observed in deed. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 What am I to say to this? Well then, as he desires it pointing to AESCHINUS , it shall be given him. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 My father! 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Now, Micio, you are indeed my brother, both in spirit and in body. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 I am glad of it. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 
 aside. I foil him at his own weapon.

Enter SYRUS, from the house. 
 
 SYRUS 
 It has been done as you ordered, Demea. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 You are a worthy fellow. Upon my faith,â€”in my opinion, at least,â€”I think Syrus ought at once to be made free. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 He free! For what reason? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 For many. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 O my dear Demea! upon my word, you are a worthy man! I have strictly taken care of both these sons of yours, from childhood; I have taught, advised, and carefully instructed them in every thing I could. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 The thing is evident; and then, besides all this, to cater for them, secretly bring, home a wench, prepare a morning entertainment; 
 these are the accomplishments of no ordinary person. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 O, what a delightful man ! 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Last of all, he assisted to-day in purchasing this Music-wenchâ€”he had the management of it; it is right he should be rewarded; other servants will be encouraged thereby: besides, he pointing to AESCHINUS desires it to be so.
 
 
 
 MICIO 
 
 to AESCHINUS. Do you desire this to be done? 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 I do wish it. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Why then, if you desire it, just come hither, Syrus, to me performing the ceremony of manumission ; be a free man. 
 
 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 You act generously; I return my thanks to you all;â€”and to you, Demea, in particular. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 I congratulate you. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 And I. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 I believe you. I wish that this joy were made completeâ€”that I could see my wife, Phrygia , 
 free as well. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Really, a most excellent woman. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 And the first to suckle your grandchild, his son, today pointing to AESCHINUS . 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 Why really, in seriousness, if she was the first to do so, there is no doubt she ought to be made free. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 What, for doing that? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 For doing that; in fine, receive the amount from me 
 at which she is valued. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 May all the Gods always grant you, Demea, all you desire. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Syrus, you have thrived pretty well to-day. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 If, in addition, Micio, you will do your duty, and lend him a little ready money in hand for present use, he will soon repay you. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 Less than this snapping his fingers . 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 He is a deserving fellow. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 Upon my word, I will repay it; only lend it me. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Do, father. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 I'll consider of it afterward. 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 He'll do it, Syrus. 
 
 
 SYRUS 
 O most worthy man ! 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 O most kind-hearted father!
 
 
 
 MICIO 
 How is this? What has so suddenly changed your disposition, Demea? What caprice is this? What means this sudden liberality? 
 
 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 I will tell you:â€”That I may convince you of this, Micio, that the fact that they consider you an easy and kind-hearted man, does not proceed from your real life, nor, indeed, from a regard for virtue and justice; but from your humoring, indulging, and pampering them. Now therefore, Aeschinus, if my mode of life has been displeasing to you, because I do not quite humor you in every thing, just or unjust, I have done: squander, buy, do what you please. But if you would rather have one to reprove and correct those faults, the results of which, by reason of your youth, you can not see, which you pursue too ardently, and are thoughtless upon, and in due season to direct you; behold me ready to do it for you. 
 
 
 AESCHINUS 
 Father, we leave it to you; you best know what ought to be done. But what is to be done about my brother? 
 
 
 DEMEA 
 I consent. Let him have his mistress: 
 with her let him make an end of his follies. 
 
 
 MICIO 
 That's right. To the AUDIENCE. Grant us your applause.
