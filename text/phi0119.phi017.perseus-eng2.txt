ARCTURUS 
 
 
 
 WITH him who sways all nations, seas, and lands, I am a fellow-citizen in the realms of the Gods. I am, as you see 
 , a bright and shining star, a Constellation that ever in its season rises here on earth and in the heavens. Arcturus is my name. By night, I am glittering in the heavens and amid the Gods, passing among mortals in the day. Other Constellations, too, descend from the heavens upon the earth; Jove, who is the ruler of Gods and men—he disperses us here in various directions among the nations, to observe the actions, manners, piety, and faith of men, just as the means of each avail him. Those who commence villanous suits at law upon false testimony, and those who, in court, upon false oath deny a debt, their names written down, do we return to Jove. Each day does he learn who here is calling for vengeance. Whatever wicked men seek here to gain their cause through perjury, who succeed before the judge in their unjust demands, the same case adjudged does he judge over again, and he fines them in a penalty much greater than the results of the judgment they have gained. The good men written down on other tablets 
 does he keep. And still these wicked persons entertain a notion of theirs, that they are able to appease Jupiter with gifts, with sacrifice; both their labour and their cost they lose. This, for this reason, is so, because no petition of the perjured is acceptable to Him. If any person that is supplicating the Deities is pious, he will more easily procure pardon for himself than he that is wicked. Therefore I do advise you this, you who are good and who pass your lives in piety and in virtue—still persevere, that one day you may rejoice that so you did. Now, the reason for which I've come hither, I will disclose to you. First, then, Diphilus 
 has willed the name of this city to be Cyrene 
 
 . There pointing to the cottage dwells Dæmones, in the country and in a cottage very close adjoining to the sea, an old gentleman who has come hither in exile from Athens , no unworthy man. And still, not for his bad deserts has he left his country, but while he was aiding others, meanwhile himself he embarrassed: a property honorably acquired he lost by his kindly ways. Long since, his daughter, then a little child, was lost; a most villanous fellow bought her of the thief, and this Procurer 
 brought the maiden hither to Cyrene . A certain Athenian youth, a citizen of this city, beheld her as she was going home from the music-school. He begins to love her; to the Procurer he comes; he purchases the damsel for himself at the price of thirty minæ, and gives him earnest, and binds the Procurer with an oath. This Procurer, just as befitted him, did not value at one straw his word, or what, on oath, he had said to the young man. He had a guest, a fit match for himself, an old man of Sicily , a rascal from Agrigentum 
 
 , a traitor to his native city; this fellow began to extol the beauty of that maiden, and of the other damsels, too, that were belonging to him. On this he began to persuade the Procurer to go together with himself to Sicily ; he said that there the men were given to pleasure; that there he might be enabled to become a wealthy man; that there was the greatest profit from courtesans. He prevails. A ship is hired by stealth. Whatever he has, by night the Procurer carries it on board ship from his house; the young man who purchased the damsel of him he has told that he is desirous of performing a vow to Venus. This is the Temple of Venus, here pointing at it , and here, for that reason, has he invited the youth hither to a breakfast 
 . From there at once did he embark on board ship, and he carried off the courtesans. Some other persons informed the young man what things were going on, how that the Procurer had departed. When the young man came to the harbour, their ship had got a great way out to sea. When I beheld how that the maiden was being carried off, I brought at the same instant both relief to her and destruction to the Procurer; the storm I rebuked, and the waves of the sea I aroused. For the most violent Constellation of them all am 1, Arcturus; turbulent I am when rising, when I set, more turbulent still. Now, cast ashore there, both the Procurer and his guest are sitting upon a rock; their ship is dashed to pieces. But this maiden, and another as well, her attendant, affrighted, have leaped from the ship into a boat. At this moment the waves are bringing them from the rocks to land, to the cottage of this old man, who is living here in exile, whose roof and tiles the storm has stript off. And this is his servant who is coming out of doors. The youth will be here just now, and you shall see him, who purchased the maiden of the Procurer. Now, fare ye well, and may your foes 
 distrust themselves. (Exit.)

Enter SCEPARNIO, with a spade on his shoulder. 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 
 to himself . O ye immortal Gods, what a dreadful tempest has Neptune sent us this last night! The storm has unroofed the cottage. What need of words is there? It was no storm, but what Alcmena met with in Euripides 
 ; it has so knocked all the tiles from off the roof; more light has it given us, and has added to our windows.

Enter PLESIDIPPUS, at a distance, talking with three CITIZENS. 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 I have both withdrawn you from your avocations, and that has not succeeded on account of which I've brought you; I could not catch the Procurer down at the harbour. But I have been unwilling to abandon all hope by reason of my remissness; on that account, my friends, have I the longer detained you. Now hither to the Temple of Venus am I come to see, where he was saying that he was about to perform a sacrifice. 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 
 aloud to himself, at a distance . If I am wise, I shall be getting ready this clay that is awaiting me. Falls to work digging. 
 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 
 looking round . Some one, I know not who, is speaking near to me.
 Enter DÆMONES, from his house. 
 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Hallo! Sceparnio! 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 Who's calling me by name? 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 He who paid his money for you. 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 
 turning round . As though you would say, Dæmones, that I am your slave. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 There's occasion for plenty of clay , therefore dig up plenty of earth. I find that the whole of my cottage must be covered; for now it's shining through it, more full of holes than a sieve. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 
 advancing . Health to you, good father, and to both of you, indeed. DÆM. Health to you. 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 
 to PLESIDIPPUS, who is muffled up in a coat . But whether are you male or female, who are calling him father? 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 Why really, I'm a man. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Then, man, go seek a father elsewhere. I once had an only daughter, that only one I lost. Of the male sex I never had a child. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 But the Gods will give— 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 
 going on digging . A heavy mischance to you indeed, i' faith, whoever you are, who are occupying us, already occupied, with your prating. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 
 pointing to the cottage . Pray are you dwelling there? 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 Why do you ask that? Are you reconnoitring the place for you to come and rob there? 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 It befits a slave to be right rich in his savings, whom, in the presence of his master, the conversation cannot escape, or who is to speak rudely to a free man. 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 And it befits a man to be shameless and impudent, for him to whom there's nothing owing, of his own accord to come to the house of another person annoying people. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Sceparnio, hold your tongue. To PLESIDIPPUS. What do you want, young man? 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 A mishap to that fellow, who is in a hurry to be the first to speak when his master's present. But, unless it's troublesome, I wish to make enquiry of you in a few words. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 My attention shall be given you, even though in the midst of business. 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 
 to PLESIDIPPUS . Rather, be off with you to the marsh, and cut down some reeds 
 , with which we may cover the cottage, while it is fine weather. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Hold your tongue. Do you tell me to PLESIDIPPUS if you have need of anything. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 Inform me on what I ask you; whether you have seen here any frizzle-headed fellow, with grey hair, a worthless, perjured, fawning knave. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Full many a one; for by reason of fellows of that stamp am I living in misery. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 Him, I mean, who brought with him to the Temple of Venus here two young women, and who was to make preparations for himself to perform a sacrifice either to-day or yesterday. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 By my faith, young man, for these very many days past I haven't seen any one sacrificing there; and yet it can't be unknown to me if any one does sacrifice there. They are always asking here for water, or for fire, or for vessels, or for a knife, or for a spit, or for a pot for cooking 
 , or something or other. What need is there of words? I procured my vessels and my well, for the use of Venus, and not my own. There has now been a cessation of it for these many days past. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 According to the words you utter, you tell me I'm undone. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Really, so far as I'm concerned, i' faith, you may be safe and sound. 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 
 stopping in his digging . Hark you, you that are roaming about Temples for the sake of your stomach, 'twere better for you to order a breakfast to be got ready at home. Perhaps you've been invited here 
 to breakfast. He that invited you, hasn't he come at all? 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 'Tis the fact. 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 There's no risk then in your betaking yourself hence home without your breakfast. It's better for you to be a waiter upon Ceres than upon Venus; the latter attends to love, Ceres attends to wheat. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 
 to DÆMONES . This fellow has been making sport of me in a digraceful manner. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 
 looking out at the side . O ye immortal Gods, Sceparnio, what means those people near the sea-shore? 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 According to my notion, they've been invited to a parting breakfast 
 . 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 How so? 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 Why, because, after dinner, I fancy, they yesterday washed themselves clean; their ship has gone to pieces out at sea. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 
 looking steadfastly . Such is the fact. 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 But, i' faith, on dry land our cottage and tiles have done the same. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Oh dear! what unfortunate creatures you are; to SCEPARNIO how the shipwrecked people are swimming. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 Prithee, where are these people? 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 
 pointing to the distance . This way, to the right; don't you see them near the shore? 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 
 looking the same way . I see them; to his FRIENDS follow me. I only wish it may be he that I'm seeking, that most accursed fellow. To DÆMONES and SCEPARNIO. Fare you well. 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 If you hadn't put us in mind, we should have thought of that ourselves. (Exeunt PLESIDIPPUS and FRIENDS. SCEPARNIO looks out towards the sea.) . But, O Palæmon 
 , hallowed associate of Neptune, who art said to be the partner of Hercules, what shocking thing do I see? 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 What do you see? 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 I see two young women sitting in a boat alone. How the poor things are being tossed about That's good, that's good, well done. The surge is driving the boat away from the rock towards the shore. Not a pilot could have ever done it better. I don't think that I ever saw billows more huge. They are saved, if they can escape those waves. Now, now's the danger; it has sent one overboard! See you that one whom the waves have thrown out of the boat? Still, she's in a shallow place; she'll easily wade through it now. O capital! now she's safe; she has escaped from the water; she's now on shore. But that other one has now sprung towards the land from the boat—from her alarm she has fallen into the waves upon her knees. She has got up again; if she takes this direction, the matter's safe; a pause but she has taken to the right, to utter destruction. Ah, she will be wandering all the day— 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 What signifies that to you? 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 If she should fall down from that rock towards which she is wending her way, she'll be putting a period to her wandering. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 If you are about to dine this evening at their expense, I think you may then be concerned for them, Sceparnio; if you are going to eat at my house, I wish your services to be devoted to myself. 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 You ask what's good and proper. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Then follow me this way. 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 I follow 
 . (Exeunt.)

Enter PALÆSTRA, at a distance, with her clothes torn and drenched. 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 
 to herself . By heavens, the mishaps of mortals are spoken of as much less bitter than * * * * * * * the sharp pangs that are inflicted in the experience of them * * * * Has this then pleased the Deity, that I, clad in this guise, should, in my terror, be cast upon a spot unknown? Shall I then declare that I have been born to this wretched lot? Do I receive this meed in return for my exemplary piety? For to me it would not prove a hardship to endure this laborious lot, if I had conducted myself undutifully towards my parents or the Gods; but if studiously I have exerted myself to beware of that, then, unduly and unjustly, Deities, you send upon me this. For what henceforth shall the glaringly impious receive, if after this fashion you pay honor to the guiltless? But if I knew that I or my parents had done anything wicked, now should I have grieved the less. But the wickedness of this master of mine is pressing hard upon me, his impiety is causing my woes; everything has he lost in the sea; these are the remains looking at her dress of his property. Even she, who was carried together with me in the boat, was washed out by the violence of the waves; I am now alone. If she at least 
 had been saved for me, through her aid my affliction here would have been lighter to me. Now, what hope or aid or what counsel shall I receive, a spot so lonesome here have I lighted upon alone? Here are the rocks, here roars the sea, and not one individual comes across my path. This dress that I am clothed in forms all my riches quite entirely; nor know I with what food or roof I am to be provided. What hope have I through which to desire to live? Neither am I acquainted with the place, nor was I ever here before. At least I could have wished for some one who would point out to me either a road or a path from these spots; so much am I now at a loss for advice whether to go this way or that; neither, indeed, do I see 
 anywhere near here a cultivated spot. Cold, distraction, and alarm, have taken possession of all my limbs. My parents, you know not of this, that I am now thus wretched; I that was born a woman entirely free, was so to no purpose. Am I at all the less in servitude now, than if I had been born a slave? And never in any way has it been a profit to those who for their own sakes reared me up. She advances forward, and rests on one side against the cliff.

Enter AMPELISCA, at a distance, on the other side of the stage, in a similar condition. 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 
 to herself . What is there better for me, what more to my advantage, than to shut out life from my body? So wretched am I in my existence, and so many deadening cares are there in my breast; so despicable is my lot; I care not for my life; I have lost the hope with which I used to comfort myself. All places have I now rambled about, and through each covert spot have I crawled along, to seek my fellow-slave with voice, eyes, ears, that I might trace her out. And still I find her nowhere, nor have I yet determined whither to go, nor where to seek her, nor, in the meantime, do I find any person here to give me an answer, of whom I might make enquiry. No place, too, is there on earth more solitary than are these spots and this locality. And yet, if she lives, never while I exist will I cease before I discover her alive. 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 
 aloud . Whose voice is it that sounds close by me here? 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 
 starting . I am alarmed. Who's speaking near me? 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 Prithee, kind Hope, do come to my aid. 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 It's a woman: a woman's voice reaches my ears. Will you not rescue wretched me from this alarm? 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 Surely a woman's voice reached my ears. Prithee is it Ampelisca? 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 Is it you, Palæstra, that I hear? 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 But why don't I call her by her own name, that she may hear me? With a loud voice. Ampelisca! 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 Ha! who's that? 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 'Tis I. 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 Is it Palæstra? 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 It is. 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 Tell me where 
 you are. 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 Troth, I'm now in the midst of a multitude of woes.
 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 I am your partner; and no less is my own share than yours. But I long to see you. 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 In that wish you are my rival. 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 Let's follow our voices with our steps; where are you? 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 See, here am I. Step onward towards me, and come straight on to meet me. 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 I'm doing so with care. They meet in front of the stage. 
 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 Give me your hand. 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 Take it. 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 Are you still alive Prithee, tell me. 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 You, indeed, make me now wish to live, since I'm empowered to touch you. How hardly can I persuade myself of this, that I am holding you. Prithee, do embrace me they embrace , my only hope; how you are now easing me of all my woes. 
 PAL. You are beforehand with me in using expressions which belong to me. Now it befits us to be going hence. 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 Prithee, whither shall we go? 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 Let's keep along this sea-shore. Pointing to the shore. AMP. Wherever you please, I'll follow. 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 Shall we go along thus with our wet clothing? 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 That which exists, the same must of necessity be borne. Looking up at the Temple. But, pray, what's this? 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 What is it? 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 Prithee, don't you see this Temple? Pointing towards it. 
 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 Where is it? 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 On the right hand. 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 I seem to be looking at a place becoming the Divinities. 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 There must be people not far hence; it is so delightful a spot. Whoever the God is, I pray him to relieve us from these troubles, and to succour us females, wretched, helpless, and in distress. They advance towards the Temple, and kneel down before it.

Enter PTOLEMOCRATIA, the Priestess, from the Temple of Venus . 
 
 PTOLEMOCRATIA 
 Who are these, that in their prayers are soliciting aid from my Patroness? For the voice of suppliants has brought me hither out of doors. They pay suit to a kind and compliant Goddess and a Patroness that makes no difficulties, and one who is very benevolent.
 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 Mother, we bid you hail. 
 
 
 PTOLEMOCRATIA 
 Maidens, hail to you. But, prithee, whence am I to say that you are hither come with your wet garments, thus wofully arrayed? 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 Just now, we came from a place there pointing towards the shore , not a great way from this spot; but it is a great way off from here, whence we have been brought hither. 
 
 
 PTOLEMOCRATIA 
 Have you been borne, do you mean, by a ship, the wooden steed 
 , over the azure paths? 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 Even so. 
 
 
 PTOLEMOCRATIA 
 Then it were more fitting that you should have come arrayed in white and provided with victims; it isn't the practice for people to come to this Temple in that fashion. Pointing at their dresses. 
 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 Prithee, whence would you have us, who have been both cast away at sea, to be bringing victims hither? Now, in want of assistance, do we embrace your knees, we who are of hopes undefined in places unknown, that you may receive us under your roof and shelter us, and that you will pity the miseries of us both, who have neither any place of refuge nor hope at hand, nor have anything whatever of our own beyond that which you see. 
 
 
 PTOLEMOCRATIA 
 Give me your hands, arise, both of you, from off your knees; no one among women is more compassionate than I. They arise from the ground. But, maidens, my circumstances are poor and limited; with difficulty I support my own existence; Venus I serve for my maintenance. 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 Prithee, is this a Temple of Venus ? 
 
 
 PTOLEMOCRATIA 
 I will admit it; I am styled the Priestess of this Temple. But whatever it is, it shall be done by me with a hearty welcome, so far as my means shall suffice. Come with me this way. 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 Kindly and attentively, mother, do you show your attentions to us. 
 
 
 PTOLEMOCRATIA 
 So I ought to do. They go into the Temple.

Ente some FISHERMEN, with lines and nets. 
 
 A FISHERMAN. 
 Persons who are poor live wretchedly in every way, especially those who have no calling and have learned no art. Of necessity must that be deemed enough, whatever they have at home. From our garb, then, you pretty well understand how wealthy we are. These hooks and these rods here are as good to us as a calling and as our clothing. Each day from the city do we come out hither to the sea to seek for forage. Instead of exertion in the wrestling-school and the place for exercise, we have this: sea-urchins, rock-mussels, oysters, limpets 
 , cockles, sea-nettles, sea-mussels and spotted crabs 
 , we catch. After that, we commence our fishing with the hook and among the rocks, and thus we take our food from out of the sea. If success does not befall us, and not any fish is taken, soaked in salt water 
 and thoroughly drenched, we quietly betake ourselves home, and without dinner go to sleep. And since the sea is now in waves so boisterous, no hopes have we; unless we take some cockles, without a doubt we've had our dinners. Now let's adore good Venus here, that she may kindly befriend us to-day. They advance towards the door of the Temple.

Enter TRACHALIO, at a distance, in haste. 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 
 to himself . I've carefully given all attention that I mightn't pass my master anywhere; for when some time since he went out of the house, he said that he was going to the harbour, and he ordered me to come here to meet him at the Temple of Venus . But see, opportunely do I espy some people standing here of whom I may enquire; I'll accost them. Goes up to the FISHERMEN. Save you, thieves of the sea, shellfish-gatherers and hook-fishers 
 , hungry race of men, how fare ye? How perish apace 
 ?
 
 
 
 FISHERMEN of Cyrene. 
 Just as befits a fisherman with hunger, thirst, and expectation. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Have you seen to-day, while you've been standing here, any young man, of courageous aspect, ruddy, stout, of genteel appearance, come by this way, who was taking with him three men in scarfs, with swords? 
 
 
 FISHERMEN of Cyrene. 
 We know of no one coming this way of that appearance which you mention. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Have you seen any old fellow, bald on the forehead and snub-nosed, of big stature, pot-bellied, with eyebrows awry, a narrow forehead, a knave, the scorn of Gods and men, a scoundrel, one full of vile dishonesty and of iniquity, who had along with him two very pretty-looking young women? 
 
 
 FISHERMEN of Cyrene. 
 One who has been born with qualities and endowments of that sort, 'twere really fitter for him to resort to the executioner than to the Temple of Venus . 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 But tell me if you have seen him. 
 
 
 FISHERMEN of Cyrene. 
 Really, no one has passed this way. Fare you well. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Fare ye well. (Exeunt FISHERMEN.) 
 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 
 to himself . I thought so; it has come to pass as I suspected; my master has been deceived; the cursed Procurer has taken himself off to distant lands. He has embarked on board ship, and carried the women away; I'm a wizard. He invited my master here to breakfast, as well, this very spawn of wickedness. Now what is better for me than to wait here in this spot until my master comes? At the same time, if this Priestess of Venus knows anything more, if I see her, I'll make enquiries; she'll give me the information.

Enter AMPELISCA, from the Temple. 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 
 to the PRIESTESS, within . I understand; here at this cottage pointing to it , which is close by the Temple of Venus , you've requested me to knock and ask for water. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Whose voice is it that has flown to my ears? 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 Prithee, who's speaking here? Who is it that I see? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Isn't this Ampelisca that's coming out from the Temple?
 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 Isn't this Trachalio that I see, the servant of Plesidippus? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 It is she. 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 It is he; Trachalio, health to you. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Health, Ampelisca, to you; how fare you? 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 In misery I pass a life not far advanced 
 . 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Do give some better omen. 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 Still it behoves all prudent persons to confer and talk together. But, prithee, where's your master, Plesidippus? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Marry, well said, indeed; as if he wasn't within there. Pointing to the Temple. 
 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 By my troth, he isn't, nor, in fact, has he come here at all. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 He hasn't come? 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 You say the truth. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 That's not my way, Ampelisca. But how nearly is the breakfast got ready? 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 What breakfast, I beg of you? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 The sacrifice, I mean, that you are performing here. 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 Prithee, what is it you are dreaming about? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 For certain, Labrax invited Plesidippus hither to a breakfast, your master, my master. 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 By my troth, you're telling of no wondrous facts: if he has deceived Gods and men, he has only acted after the fashion of Procurers. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Then neither yourselves nor my master are here performing a sacrifice. 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 You are a wizard. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 What are you doing then? 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 The Priestess of Venus has received here into her abode both myself and Palæstra, after many mishaps and dreadful alarm, and from being in danger of our lives, destitute of aid and of resources. 
 
 
 TEACH. 
 Prithee, is Palæstra here, the beloved of my master? 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 Assuredly. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Great joyousness is there in your news, my dear Ampelisca. But I greatly long to know what was this danger of yours. 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 Last night our ship was wrecked, my dear Trachalio. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 How, ship? What story's this? 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 Prithee, have you not heard in what way the Procurer intended secretly to carry us away hence to Sicily , and how, whatever there was at home, he placed on board ship? That has all gone to the bottom now. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 O clever Neptune , hail to thee! Surely, no dicer is more skilful than thyself. Decidedly a right pleasant throw 
 hast thou made; thou didst break a-villain. But where now is the Procurer Labrax? 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 Perished through drinking, I suppose; Neptune last night invited him to deep potations. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 By my troth, I fancy it was given him to drink by way of cup of necessity 
 . How much I do love you, my dear Ampelisca; how pleasing you are; what honied words you do utter. But you and Palæstra, in what way were you saved? 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 I'll let you know. Both in affright, we leapt from the ship into a boat, because we saw that the ship was being borne upon a rock; in haste, I unloosed the rope, while they were in dismay. The storm separated us from them with the boat in a direction to the right. And so, tossed about by winds and waves, in a multitude of ways, we, wretched creatures, during the livelong night * * * * * * * half dead, the wind this day has scarce borne us to the shore. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 I understand; thus is Neptune wont to do; he is a very dainty Ædile 
 ; if any wares are bad, over he throws them all. 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 Woe to your head and life! 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 To your own, my dear Ampelisca. I was sure that the Procurer would do that which he has done; I often said so. It were better I should let my hair grow 
 , and set up for a soothsayer.
 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 Did you not take care then, you and your master, that he shouldn't go away, when you knew this? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 What could he do? 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 If he was in love, do you ask what he could do? Both night and day he should have kept watch; he should have been always on his guard. But, by my troth, he has done like many others; thus finely has Plesidippus taken care of her. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 For what reason do you say that? 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 The thing is evident. 
 
 
 TEACH. 
 Don't you know this? Even he who goes to the bath to bathe, while there he carefully keeps an eye upon his garments, still they are stolen; inasmuch as some one of those that he is watching is a rogue; the thief easily marks him for whom he's upon the watch; the keeper knows not which one is the thief. But bring me to her; where is she? 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 Well then, go here into the Temple of Venus ; you'll find her sitting there, and in tears. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 How disagreable is that to me already. But why is she weeping? 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 I'll tell you; she's afflicting herself in mind for this; because the Procurer took away a casket from her which she had, and in which she kept that by which she might be enabled to recognize her parents; she fears that this has been lost. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Where was that little casket, pray? 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 There, on board the ship; he himself locked it up in his wallet, that there mightn't be the means by which she might recognize her parents. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 O scandalous deed! to require her to be a slave, who ought to be a free woman. 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 Therefore she now laments that it has gone to the bottom along with the ship. There, too, was all the gold and silver of the Procurer. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Some one, I trust, has dived and brought it up. 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 For this reason is she sad and disconsolate, that she has met with the loss of them. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Then have I the greater occasion to do this, to go in and console her, that she mayn't thus distress herself in mind. For I know that many a lucky thing has happened to many a one beyond their hopes. 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 But I know too that hope has deceived many who have hoped. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Therefore a patient mind is the best remedy for affliction. I'll go in, unless you wish for anything. Goes into the Temple. 
 
 
 
 AMP. GO. 
 
 To herself. I'll do that which the Priestess requested me, and I'll ask for some water here at the neighbour's; for she said that if I asked for it in her name, they would give it directly. And I do think that I never saw a more worthy old lady, one to whom I should think that it is more befitting for Gods and men to show kindness. How courteously, how heartily, how kindly, how, without the least difficulty, she received us into her home, trembling, in want, drenched, shipwrecked, half dead; not otherwise, in fact, than if we had been her own offspring. How kindly did she herself, just now, tucking up her garments, make the water warm for us to bathe. Now, that I mayn't keep her waiting, I'll fetch some water from the place where she requested me. Knocking at the door of DÆMONES. 
 Hallo , there, is there any one in the cottage? is any one going to open this door? Will any one come out?

Enter SCEPARNIO, from the cottage of DÆMONES. 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 Who is it so furiously making an attack upon our door? 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 It's I. 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 Well now, what good news is there? Aside. Dear me, a lass of comely appearance, i' troth. 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 Greeting to you, young man. 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 And many greetings to you, young woman. 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 I'm come to you— 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 I'll receive you with a welcome, if you come in the evening, by-and-by, just such as I could like; for just now I've no means 
 to receive you, a damsel, thus early in the morning * * * But what have you to say, my smiling, pretty one. Chucks her under the chin. 
 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 Oh, you're handling me too familiarly. Moves away. 
 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 O ye immortal Gods! she's the very image of Venus . What joyousness there is in her eyes, and, only do see, what a skin 'tis of the vulture's tint ,—rather, the eagle's, indeed, I meant to say. Her breasts, too, how beautiful; and then what expression on her lips! Takes hold of her. 
 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 
 struggling . I'm no common commodity for the whole township 
 ; can't you keep your hands off me? 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 
 patting her . Won't you let me touch you, gentle one, in this manner, gently and lovingly? * * * * * * * * 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 When I have leisure, then I'll be giving my attention to toying and dalliance to please you; for the present, prithee, do either say me "Yes" or "No" to the matter for which I was sent hither. 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 What now is it that you wish? 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 
 pointing to her pitcher . To a shrewd person, my equipment would give indications of what it is I want. 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 To a shrewd woman, this equipment, too, of mine, would give indication of what it is I want. 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 
 pointing to the Temple . The Priestess there of Venus , requested me to fetch some water from your house here. 
 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 But I'm a lordly sort of person; unless you entreat me, you shan't have a drop. We dug this well with danger to ourselves, and with tools of iron. Not a drop can be got out of me except by means of plenty of blandishments. 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 Prithee, why do you make so much fuss about the water—a thing that even enemy affords to enemy? 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 Why do you make so much fuss about granting a favour to me, that citizen grants to citizen? 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 On the contrary, my sweet one, I'll even do everything for you that you wish. 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 O charming! I am favoured; she's now calling me her sweet one. The water shall be given you, so that you mayn't be coaxing me in vain. Give me the pitcher. 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 Take it gives it to him : make haste and bring it out, there's a dear. 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 Stay a moment; I'll be here this instant, my sweet one. Goes into the cottage. * * * * * * * * * * *
 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 What shall I say to the Priestess for having delayed here so long a time? * * * * * * * How, even still, in my wretchedness do I tremble, when with my eyes I look upon the sea. She looks towards the shore. But what, to my sorrow, do I see afar upon the shore? My master, the Procurer, and his Sicilian guest. both of whom wretched I supposed to have perished in the deep. Still does thus much more of evil survive for us than we had imagined. But why do I delay to run off into the Temple, and to tell Palæstra this, that we may take refuge at the altar before this scoundrel of a Procurer can come hither and seize us here? I'll betake myself away from this spot; for the necessity suddenly arises for me to do so. Runs into the Temple.

Enter SCEPARNIO, from the cottage. 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 
 to himself . O ye immortal Gods, I never did imagine that there was so great delight in water; how heartily I did draw this. Thewell seemed much less deep than formerly. How entirely without exertion did I draw this up. With all deference 
 to myself, am I not a very silly fellow,in having only to-day made a commencement of being in love 
 ? Turning slowly round, he holds out the pitcher. Here's the water for you, my pretty one; here now, I would have you carry it with as much pleasure as I carry it, that you may please me. Stares around him. But where are you, my tit-bit? Do take this water, please; where are you? Again looks about. I' troth, she's in love with me, as I fancy; the roguish one's playing bo- peep 
 . Where are you? Are you going now to take this pitcher? Where are you, I say? You've carried the joke far enough. Really, do be serious at last. Once more, are you going to take this pitcher? Where in the world are you? Looks about. I' troth, I don't see her anywhere, for my part; she's making fun of me. I' faith, I shall now set down this pitcher in the middle of the road. But yet, suppose any person should carry away from here this sacred pitcher of Venus , he would be causing me some trouble. I' faith, I'm afraid that this woman's laying a trap for me, that I may be caught with the sacred pitcher of Venus . In such case, with very good reason, the magistrate will be letting me die in prison, if any one shall see me holding this. For it's marked with the name; itself tells its own tale, whose property it is. Troth now, I'll call that Priestess here out of doors, that she may take this pitcher. I'll go there to the door. He knocks. 
 Hallo there! Ptolemocratia. Calling aloud. Take this pitcher of yours, please; some young woman, I don't know who, brought it here to me. A pause. It must then be carried in-doors by me. I've found myself a job, if, in fact, of my own accord, water is to be carried by me for these people as well. Goes into the Temple with the pitcher.

Enter LABRAX, dripping wet, followed by CHARMIDES, at a distance, in the same plight. 
 
 LABRAX 
 
 grumbling to himself . The person that chooses himself to be wretched and a beggar, let him trust himself and his life to Neptune . For if any one has any dealings at all with him, he sends him back home equipped in this guise. Surveying himself. By my troth, Liberty, you were a clever one, who were never willing 
 to put even a foot, i' faith, on board ship with me. But looking round where's this guest of mine that has proved my ruin? Oh, see, here he comes. 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 Where the plague are you hurrying to, Labrax? For really I cannot follow you so fast.
 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 I only wish that you had perished by direful tornments in Sicily before I had looked upon you with my eyes, you on whose account this misfortune has befallen me. 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 I only wish that on the day on which you admitted me into your house, I had laid me down in a prison sooner. I pray the immortal Gods, that so long as you live, you may have all your guests just like your own self. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 In your person I admitted misfortune into my house. What business had I to listen to a rogue like you, or what to depart hence? Or why to go on board ship, where I have lost even more wealth 
 than I was possessor of? 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 Troth, I'm far from being surprised if your ship has been wrecked, which was carrying yourself, a villain, and your property villanously acquired. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 You've utterly ruined me with your wheedling speeches. 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 A more accursed dinner of yours have I been dining upon than the ones that were set before Thyestes and Tereus . 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 I'm dying; I'm sick at heart. Prithee, do hold up my head. 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 By my troth, I could very much wish that you would vomit up your lungs. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Alas! Palæstra and Ampelisca, where are you now? 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 Supplying food for the fishes at the bottom, I suppose. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 You have brought beggary upon me by your means, while I was listening to your bragging lies. 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 You have reason deservedly to give me many hearty thanks, who from an insipid morsel by my agency have made you salt 
 . 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Nay, but do you get out from me to extreme and utter perdition.
 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 You be off; I was just going to do that very thing. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Alas! what mortal being is there living more wretched than I? 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 I am by very far much more wretched, Labrax, than yourself. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 How so? 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 Because I am not deserving of it, whereas you are deserving. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 O bulrush, bulrush, I do praise your lot, who always maintain your credit for dryness. 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 
 his teeth chattering . For my part, I'm exercising myself for a skirmishing fight , for, from my shivering, I utter all my words in piecemeal flashes. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 By my troth, Neptune, you are a purveyor of chilly baths; since I got away from you with my clothes, I've been freezing. No hot liquor-shop 
 at all for sure does he provide; so salt and cold the potions that he prepares. 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 How lucky are the blacksmiths who are always sitting among hot coals; they are always warm. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 I only wish that I were now enjoying the lot of the duck, so as, although I had just come from out of the water, still to be dry. 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 What if I some way or other let myself out at the games for a hobgoblin 
 ? 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 For what reason? 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 Because, i' faith, I'm chattering aloud with my teeth. But I'm of opinion that, with very good reason, I've had this ducking. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 How so? 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 Why, haven't I ventured to go on board ship with yourself, who have been stirring up the ocean for me from the very bottom?
 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 I listened to you when advising me; you assured me that there in Sicily was very great profit from courtesans; there, you used to say, I should be able to amass wealth. 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 Did you expect, then, you unclean beast, that you were going to gobble up the whole island of Sicily ? 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 What whale, I wonder, has gobbled up my wallet where all my gold and silver was packed up? 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 That same one, I suppose, that has swallowed my purse, which was full of silver in my travelling-bag. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Alas! I'm reduced even to this one poor tunic stretching it out and to this poor shabby cloak; I'm done for to all intents. 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 Then you may even go into partnership with me; we have got equal shares. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 If at least my damsels had been saved, there would have been some hope. Now, if the young man Plesidippus should be seeing me, from whom I received the earnest for Palæstra, he'll then be causing me some trouble in consequence. He begins to cry. 
 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 Why cry, you fool? Really, by my troth, so long as your tongue shall exist, you have abundance with which to make payment to everybody 
 .

Enter SCEPARNIO, from the Temple. 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 
 to himself, aloud . What to-do is this, I'd like to know, that two young women here in the Temple, in tears, are holding in their embrace the statue of Venus, dreading I know not what in their wretchedness? But they say that this last night they have been tossed about, and to-day cast on shore from the waves. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 
 overhearing . Troth now, young man, prithee, where are these young women that you are talking of? 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 Here pointing in the Temple of Venus. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 How many are there? 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 Just as many as you and I make. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Surely, they are mine. 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 Surely, I know nothing about that. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Of what appearance are they?
 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 Good-looking; I could even fall in love with either of them, if I were well liquored. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Surely, they are the damsels. 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 Surely, you are a nuisance; be off, go in and see, if you like. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 These must be my wenches in here, my dear Charmides. 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 Jupiter confound you, both if they are and still if they are not. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 I'll straightway burst into this Temple of Venus here. 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 Into the bottomless pit, I would rather. LABRAX rushes into the Temple, and shuts the door. Prithee, stranger, show me some spot where I may go to sleep. 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 Go to sleep there, wherever you please points to the ground ; no one hinders, it's free to the public. 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 
 pointing to his clothes . But do you see me, in what wet clothes I'm dressed? Do take me under shelter; lend me some dry clothes, while my own are drying; on some occasion I'll return you the favour. 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 See, here's my outer coat, which alone is dry; that, if you like, I'll lend you. Takes it off and holds it out to him. In that same I'm wont to be clothed, by that same protected, when it rains. Do you give me those clothes of yours; I'll soon have them dried. 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 How now, are you afraid that, as I've been washed bare 
 last night at sea, I mayn't be made bare again here upon shore? 
 
 
 SCEPARNIO 
 Wash you bare, or anoint you well, I don't care one fig 
 . I shall never entrust anything to you unless upon a pledge being taken. Do you either sweat away or perish with cold, be you either sick or well. I'll put up with no stranger-guest in my house; I've had disagreements enough. Puts on his coat again, and goes into the house of DÆMONES. 
 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 What, are you off? A pause. He's a trafficker in slaves for money 
 ; whoever he is, he has no bowels of compassion. But why in my wretchedness am I standing here, soaking? Why don't I rather go away from here into the Temple of Venus, that I may sleep off this debauch which I got with drinking last night against the bent of my inclination? Neptune has been drenching us with salt water as though we were G-reek wines 
 , and so he hoped that our stomachs might be vomited up with his salt draughts. What need of words? If he had persisted in inviting us a little longer, we should have gone fast asleep there; as it is, hardly alive has he sent us off home. Now I'll go see the Procurer, my boon companion, what he's doing within. Goes into the Temple.

Enter DÆMONES, from his house. 
 
 DÆM. 
 
 to himnself . In wondrous ways 
 do the Gods make sport of men, in wondrous fashions do they send dreams in sleep. Not the sleeping, even, do they allow to rest. As, for example, I, this last night which has gone by, dreamed a wonderful and a curious dream. A she-ape seemed to be endeavouring to climb up to a swallow's nest; and she was not able thence to take them out. After that, the ape seemed to come to me to beg me to lend a ladder to her. I in these terms gave answer to the ape, that swallows are the descendants of Philomela 
 and of Progne. I expostulated with her, that she might not hurt those of my country. But then she began to be much more violent, and seemed gratuitously to be threatening me with vengeance. She summoned me to a court of justice. Then, in my anger, I seemed to seize hold of the ape by the middle, in what fashion I know not; and I fastened up with chains this most worthless beast. Now to what purpose I shall say that this dream tends, never have I this day been able to come to any conclusion. A loud noise is heard in the Temple. But what's this noise that arises in this Temple of Venus, my neighbour? My mind's in wonder about it.

Enter TRACHALIO, in haste, from the Temple. 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 
 aloud . O citizens of Cyrene , I implore your aid, countrymen, you who are near neighbours to these spots, bring aid to helplessness, and utterly crush a most vile attempt. Inflict vengeance, that the power of the wicked, who wish themselves to be distinguished by crimes, may not be stronger than of the guiltless. Make an example for the shameless man, give its reward to modest virtue; cause that one may be allowed to live here rather under the control of the laws than of brute force. Hasten hither into the Temple of Venus; again do I implore your aid, you who are here at hand and who hear my cries. Bring assistance to those who, after the recognized usage, have entrusted their lives to Venus and to the Priestess of Venus, under their protection. Wring ye the neck of iniquity before it reaches yourselves. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 What's all this to-do? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 
 embracing his knees . By these knees of yours, I do entreat you, old gentleman, whoever you are— 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Nay, but do you let go my knees, then, and tell me why it is that you are making a noise? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 I do beg and entreat you, that if you hope this year that you will have abundance of laserwort and silphium 
 , and that that export will arrive at Capua 
 safe and sound, and that you may ever enjoy freedom from diseased eyes—
 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Are you in your senses? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 —Or whether you trust that you will have plenty of juice of silphium 
 , that you will not hesitate to give me the aid which I shall entreat of you, aged sir. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 And I, by your legs, and ancles, and back, do entreat you that, if you hope that you will have a crop of elm-twigs, and that a fruitful harvest of beatings will this year be your lot, you will tell me what's the matter here, by reason of which you are making this uproar. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Why do you choose to speak me ill? For my part, I wished you everything that's good. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 And for my part, I'm speaking you well, in praying that things which you deserve may befall you. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Prithee, do prevent this. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 What's the matter, then? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 
 pointing to the Temple . Two innocent women are inside here, in need of your aid, on whom, against law and justice, an injury has been, is being, glaringly committed here in the Temple of Venus. Besides, the Priestess of Venus is being disgracefully insulted. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 What person is there of effrontery so great as to dare to injure the Priestess? But these women, who are they? Or what injury is being done to them? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 If you give me your attention, I'll tell you. They have clung to the statue of Venus; a most audacious fellow is now trying to tear them away. They ought, by rights, both of them to be free. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 What fellow is it that so lightly holds the Gods? In a few words tell me. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 One most full of fraud, villany, parricide, and perjury; a lawbreaker, an immodest, unclean, most shameless fellow; to sum up all in one word, he is a Procurer; why need I say more about him? 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Troth now, you tell of a man that ought to be handed over to retribution. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 A villain, to seize the Priestess by the throat.
 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 By my troth, but he has done it at his own great peril. Calls aloud at his door. Come you out of doors here, Turbalio and Sparax; where are you? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Prithee, do go in, and hasten to their rescue. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 
 impatiently . And am I to call for them once more?
 from the cottage. 
 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Follow me this way. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Come on now this instant, bid them tear his eyes out, just in the way that cooks do cuttle-fish 
 . 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Drag the fellow out here by his legs, just like a slaughtered pig. DÆMONES and his SERVANTS go into the Temple. 
 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 
 listening at the door . I hear a scuffling; the Procurer, I guess, is being belaboured with their fists; I'd very much like them to knock the teeth out of the jaws of the most villanous fellow. But see, here are the women themselves coming out of the Temple in consternation.

Enter PALÆSTRA and AMPELISCA, in haste, from the Temple, with dishevelled locks. 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 Now is that time arrived when destitution of all resources and aid, succour and defence, overtakes us. Neither hope nor means is there to bring us aid, nor know we in what direction we should commence to proceed. In exceeding terror now are we both, in this our wretchedness. Such cruelty and such outrage have been committed towards us just now in-doors here by our master, who, in his villany, pushed down the old lady, the Priestess, headlong, and struck her in a very disgraceful manner, and with his violence tore us away from the inner side 
 of the statue. But as our lot and fortunes are now showing themselves, 'twere best to die, nor in our miseries is there anything better than death. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 
 behind . What's this? Whose words are those? Why do I delay to console them? Aloud. Harkye, Palæstra, Ampelisca, harkye! 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 Prithee, who is it that calls us?
 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 Who is it that calls me by name? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 If you turn round and look, you'll know. 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 
 turning round . O hope of my safety! 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Be silent and of good courage; trust me 
 . 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 If only it can be so, let not violence overwhelm us. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 What violence? 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 That same which is driving me to commit violence on myself. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Oh, do leave off; you are very silly. 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 Then do you leave off at once your consoling me in my misery with words. 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 Unless you afford us protection in reality 
 , Trachalio, it's all over with us. 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 I'm resolved to die sooner than suffer this Procurer to get me in his power. But still I am of woman's heart; when, in my misery, death comes into my mind, fear takes possession of my limbs. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 By my troth, although this is a bitter affliction, do have a good heart. 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 Why where, pray, is a good heart to be found for me? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Don't you fear, I tell you; sit you down here by the altar. Points to it. 
 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 What can this altar possibly avail us more than the statue here within the Temple of Venus, from which just now, embracing it, in our wretchedness, we were torn by force? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Only you be seated here; then I'll protect you in this spot. This altar you possess as though your bulwarks 
 ; these your fortifications; from this spot will I defend you. With the aid of Venus, I'll march against the wickedness of the Procurer. 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 We follow your instructions they advance to the altar and kneel ; and genial Venus, we both of us, in tears, implore thee, embracing this thy altar, bending upon our knees, that thou wilt receive us into thy guardianship, and be our protector; that thou wilt punish those wretches who have set at nought thy Temple, and that thou wilt suffer us to occupy this thy altar with thy permission, we who last night were by the might of Neptune cast away; hold us not in scorn, and do not for that reason impute it to us as a fault, if there is anything that thou shouldst think is not so well attended to by us as it ought to have been. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 I think they ask what's just; it ought, Venus, by thee to be granted. Thou oughtst to pardon them; 'tis terror forces them to do this. They say that thou wast born from a shell 
 ; take thou care that thou dost not despise the shells of these. But see, most opportunely the old gentleman is coming out, both my protector and your own. He goes to the altar.

Enter DÆMONES, from the Temple, with his two SERVANTS dragging out LABRAX. 
 
 DÆM. 
 Come out of the Temple, you most sacrilegious of men, as many as have ever been born. Do you go calling to the WOMEN and sit by the altar. Not seeing them near the door. But where are they? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Look round here. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 
 looking round . Very good; I wanted that 
 . Now bid him come this way. To LABRAX. Are you attempting here among us to commit a violation of the laws against the Deities? To the SERVANTS, who obey with alacrity. Punch his face with your fists. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 I'm suffering these indignities at your own cost.
 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Why, the insolent fellow's threatening even. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 I've been robbed of my rights; you are robbing me of my female slaves against my will. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Do you then find some wealthy man of the Senate of Cyrene as judge, whether these women ought to be yours, or whether they oughtn't to be free, or whether it isn't right that you should be clapped into prison, and there spend your life, until you have worn the whole gaol out with your feet. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 I wasn't prepared to prophesy for this day that I should be talking with a hang-gallows 
 like yourself. Turning to DÆMONES. You do I summon to judgment. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 
 pointing to TRACHALIO . In the first place, try it with him who knows you. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 
 to DÆMONES . My suit is with yourself. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 But it must be with myself. Pointing to the WOMEN. Are these your female slaves? 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 They are. 
 
 
 TRACL. 
 Just come then, touch either of them with your little finger only. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 What if I do touch them? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 That very instant, upon my faith, I'll make a hand-ball 
 of you, and while you're in the air I'll belabour you with my fists, you most perjured villain. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Am I not to be allowed to take away my female slaves from the altar of Venus? 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 You may not; such is the law with us. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 I've no concern with your laws; for my part, I shall at once carry them both away from here 
 . If you are in love with them, old gentleman holding out his hand , you must down here with the ready cash. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 But these women have proved pleasing to Venus. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 She may have them, if she pays the money. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 A Goddess, pay you money? Now then, that you may understand my determination, only do you commence in mere joke to offer them the very slightest violence; I'll send you away from here with such a dressing, that you won't know your own self. You, therefore turning to his SERVANTS , when I give you the signal, if you don't beat his eyes out of his head, I'll trim you round about with rods just like beds of myrtle 
 with bulrushes. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 You are treating me with violence. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 What, do you even upbraid us with violence, you flagrant specimen of flagitiousness? 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 You, you thrice-dotted villain 
 , do you dare to speak abusively to me? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 I am a thrice-dotted villain; I confess it; you are a strictly honorable man; ought these women a bit the less to be free? 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 What—free? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Aye, and your mistresses, too, i' faith, and from genuine Greece 
 
 ; for one of them was born at Athens of free-born parents. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 What is it I hear from you? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 That she pointing to PALÆSTRA was born at Athens , a free-born woman. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 
 to TRACHALIO . Prithee is she a countrywoman of mine? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Are you not a Cyrenian? 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 No; born at Athens in Attica , bred and educated there. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Prithee, aged sir, do protect your countrywomen. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 
 aside . O daughter, when I look on her, separated from me you remind me of my miseries: aloud she who was lost by me when three years old; now, if she is living, she's just about as tall, I'm sure, as she. Pointing to PALÆSTRA. 
 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 I paid the money down for these two, to their owners, of whatever country they were. What matters it to me whether they were born at Athens or at Thebes , so long as they are rightfully in servitude as my slaves? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 it so, you impudent fellow? What, are you, a cat prowling after maidens, to be keeping children here kidnapped from their parents and destroying them in your disgraceful calling? But as for this other one, I really don't know what her country is; I only know that she's more deserving than yourself, you most abominable rascal. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Are these women your property? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Come to the trial, then, which of the two according to his back is the more truthful; if you don't bear more compliments 
 upon your back than any ship of war 
 has nails, then I'm the greatest of liars. Afterwards, do you examine mine, when I've examined yours; if it shall not prove to be so untouched, that any leather flask maker 
 will say that it is a hide most capital and most sound for the purposes of his business, what reason is there why I shouldn't mangle you with stripes, even till you have your belly full? Why do you stare at them? If you touch them I'll tear your eyes out. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Yet notwithstanding, although you forbid me to do so, I'll at once carry them off both together with me. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 What will you do? 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 I'll bring Vulcan ; he is an enemy to Venus 
 . Goes towards DÆMONES' cottage. 
 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Whither is he going? 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 
 calling at the door . Hallo ! Is there anybody here? Hallo ! I say. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 If you touch the door, that very instant, upon my faith, you shall get a harvest upon your face with fists for your pitchforks 
 . 
 
 
 SERV. 
 We keep no fire, we live upon dried figs.
 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 I'll find the fire, if only I have the opportunity of kindling it upon your head. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Faith, I'll go somewhere to look for some fire. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 What, when you've found it? 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 I'll be making a great fire here. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 What, to be burning 
 a mortuary sacrifice for yourself? 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 No, but I'll burn both of these alive here upon the altar. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 I'd like that. For, by my troth, I'll forthwith seize you by the head and throw you into the fire, and, half-roasted, I'll throw you out as food for the great birds. Aside. When I come to a consideration of it with myself, this is that ape, that wanted to take away those swallows from the nest against my will, as I was dreaming in my sleep. 
 
 
 TPACH. 
 Aged sir, do you know what I request of you? That you will protect these females and defend them from violence, until I fetch my master. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Go look for your master, and fetch him here. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 But don't let him— 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 At his own extreme peril, if he touches them, or if he attempts to do so. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Take care. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Due care is taken; do you be off. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 And watch him too, that he doesn't go away anywhere. For we have promised either to give the executioner a great talent, or else to produce this fellow this very day. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Do you only be off. I'll not let him get away, while you are absent. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 I'll be back here soon. (Exit TRACHALIO.)

DÆMONES, LABRAX, PALÆSTRA, AMPELISCA, and SERVANTS. 
 
 DÆM. 
 
 to LABRAX, who is struggling with the SERVANTS . Which, you Procurer, had you rather do, be quiet with a thrashing, or e'en as it is, without the thrashing, if you had the choice? 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Old fellow, I don't care a straw for what you say. My own women, in fact, I shall drag away this instant from the altar by the hair, in spite of yourself, and Venus , and supreme Jove.
 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Just touch them. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 
 going towards them I' troth, I surely will touch them. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Just come then; only approach this way. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Only bid both those fellows, then, to move away from there. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 On the contrary, they shall move towards you. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 I' faith, for my own part, I don't think so. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 If they do move nearer to you, what will you do? 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 I'll retire. But, old fellow, if ever I catch you in the city, never again, upon my faith, shall any one call me a Procurer, if I don't give you some most disagreable sport. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Do what you threaten. But now, in the meantime, if you do touch them, a heavy punishment shall be inflicted on you. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 How heavy, in fact? 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Just as much as is sufficient for a Procurer. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 These threats of yours I don't value one straw; I certainly shall seize them both this instant without your leave. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Just touch them. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 By my troth, I surely will touch them. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 You will touch them, but do you know with what result? Go then, Turbalio, with all haste, and bring hither from out of the house two cudgels. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Cudgels? 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Aye, good ones; make haste speedily. TURBALIO goes in. I'll let you have a reception this day in proper style, as you are deserving of. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 
 aside . Alas! cursedly unfortunate. I lost my headpiece in the ship; it would now have been handy for me, if it had been saved. To DÆMONES. May I at least address these women? 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 You may not * * * * * TURBALIO enters bringing two cudgels. Well now, by my faith, look, the cudgel-man is coming very opportunely here. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 
 aside . By my troth, this surely is a tingling for my ears. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Come, Sparax, do you take this other cudgel. Giving him one. Come, take your stand, one on one side, the other on one other. Take your stations both of you. They stand with lifted cudgels on each side of he altar. Just so. Now then attend to me: if, i' faith, that fellow there should this day touch these women with his finger against their inclination, if you don't give him a reception 
 with these cudgels even to that degree that he shan't know which way he is to get home, you are undone, both of you. If he shall call for any one, do you make answer to this fellow in their stead. But if he himself shall attempt to get away from here, that instant, as hard a you can, lay on to his legs with your sticks. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Are they not even to allow me to go away from here? 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 I've said sufficient. And when that servant comes here with his master, he that has gone to fetch his master, do you at once go home. Attend to this with great diligence, will you. DÆMONES goes into his house. 
 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 O rare, by my troth, the Temple here is surely changed all of a sudden; this is now the Temple of Hercules 
 
 which was that of Venus before; in such fashion has the old fellow planted two statues here with clubs. I' faith, I don't know now whither in the world I shall fly from here; so greatly are they both raging now against me, both land and sea. Palæstra! 
 
 
 SERV. 
 What do you want? 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Away with you, there is a misunderstanding between us; that, indeed, is not my Palæstra 
 that answers. Harkye, Ampelisca. 
 
 
 SERV. 
 Beware of a mishap, will you. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 
 aside . So far as they can, the worthless fellows advise me rightly enough. Aloud. But, harkye, I ask you, whether it is any harm to you for me to come nearer to these women?
 
 
 
 SERV. 
 Why none at all to ourselves. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Will there be any harm to myself? 
 
 
 SERV. 
 None at all, if you only take care. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 What is it that I'm to take care against? 
 
 
 SERV. 
 Why, look you, against a heavy mishap. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Troth now, prithee, do let me approach them. 
 
 
 SERV. 
 Approach them, if you like. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 I' faith, obligingly done; I return you thanks, I'll go nearer to them. Approaches them. 
 
 
 
 SERV. 
 Do you stand there on the spot, where you are. Drags him to his place, with the cudgel over his head. 
 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 
 aside . By my faith, I've come scurvily off in many ways. Still, I'm resolved to get the better of them this day by constantly besieging them.

Enter PLESIDIPPUS and TRACHALIO, at a distance, on the other side of the stage. 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 And did the Procurer attempt by force and violence to drag my mistress away from the altar of Venus ? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Even so. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 Why didn't you kill him on the instant? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 I hadn't a sword. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 You should have taken either a stick or a stone. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 What! ought I to have pelted this most villanous fellow with stones like a dog? * * * * * * * * * 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 
 aside, on seeing them . By my troth, but I'm undone now; see, here's Plesidippus; he'll be sweeping me away altogether this moment with the dust. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 Were the damsels sitting on the altar even then when you set out to come to me? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Yes, and now they are sitting in the same place. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 Who is now protecting them there? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Some old gentleman, I don't know who, a neighbour of the Temple of Venus —he gave very kind assistance; he is now protecting them with his servants—I committed them to his charge. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 Lead me straight to the Procurer. Where is this fellow? They go towards LABRAX. 
 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Health to you. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 I want none of your healths. Make your choice quickly, whether you lad rather be seized by your throat wrenched 
 , or be dragged along; choose whichever you please, while you may. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 I wish for neither. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 Be off then, Trachalio, with all speed to the sea-shore; bid those persons that I brought with me to hand over this rascal to the executioner, to come from the harbour to the city to meet me; afterwards return hither and keep guard here. I'll now drag this scoundrelly outcast to justice. (Exit TRACHALIO. Pleusicles addresses LABRAX.) . Come, proceed to a court of justice. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 In what have I offended? 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 Do you ask? Didn't you receive an earnest of me for this woman pointing to PALÆSTRA , and carry her off from here? 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 I didn't carry her off. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 Why do you deny it? 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Troth now, because I put her on board ship; carry her off 
 unfortunately, I couldn't. For my part, I told you that this day I would make my appearance at the Temple of Venus ; have I swerved at all from that? Am I not there? 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 Plead your cause in the court of justice; here a word is enough. Follow me. They lay hold of him. 
 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 
 calling aloud . I entreat you, my dear Charmides, do come to my rescue; I am being seized with my throat wrenched.

 Enter CHARMIDES, from the Temple. 
 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 
 looking about . Who calls my name? 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Do you see me how I'm being seized? 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 I see, and view it with pleasure. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Don't you venture to assist me? 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 What person is seizing you? 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Young Plesidippus. 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 What you've got, put up with; 'twere better for you, with a cheerful spirit, to slink to gaol; that has befallen you which many greatly wish for for themselves.
 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 What's that? 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 To find for themselves that which they are seeking. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 I entreat you, do follow me. 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 You try to persuade me, just like what you are: you are being taken off to gaol, for that reason is it you entreat me to follow you? 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 
 to LABRAX . Do you still resist? 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 I'm undone. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 I trust that may prove the truth. You, my dear Palæstra and Ampelisca, do you remain here in the meanwhile, until I return hither. 
 
 
 SERV. 
 I would advise them rather to go to our house, until you return. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 I'm quite agreable; you act obligingly. The SERVANTS open the door of the cottage, and PALÆSTRA and AMPELISCA go in. 
 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 You are thieves to me. 
 
 
 SERV. 
 How, thieves? 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 Lead him along. The SERVANTS seize him. 
 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 
 calling out . I pray and entreat you, Palæstra. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 Follow, you hang-dog. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Guest, Charmides! 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 I am no guest of yours; I repudiate your hospitality. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 What, do you slight me in this fashion? 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 I do so; I've been drinking with you once already 
 . 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 May the Deities confound you. 
 
 
 CHARMIDES 
 To that person of yours, say that. PLESIDIPPUS leads LABRAX off, followed by the SERVANTS. I do believe that men are transformed, each into a different beast. That Procurer, I guess, is transformed into a stock-dove 
 ; for, before long, his neck will be in the stocks. He'll to-day be building his nest in the gaol. Still, however, I'll go, that I may be his advocate,—if by my aid he may possibly be sentenced any the sooner.

Enter DÆMONES, from his cottage. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 
 to himself. 'Twas rightly done, and it is a pleasure this day for me to have given aid to these young women; I have now found some dependants, and both of them of comely looks and youthful age. But my plaguy wife is watching me in all ways, lest I should be giving any hint to the young women. But I wonder what in the world my servant Gripus is about, who went last night to the sea to fish. Troth, he had done wiser if he had slept at home; for now he throws away both his pains and his nets, seeing what a storm there now is and was last night. I'll thoroughly cook upon my fingers what he has caught to-day; so violently do I see the ocean heaving. A bell rings. But my wife's calling me to breakfast; I'll return home. She'll now be filling my ears with her silly prating. Goes into the cottage.

Enter GRIPUS, dragging a net enclosing a wallet, by a rope. 
 
 GRIPUS 
 
 to himself . These thanks do I return to Neptune , my patron, who dwells in the salt retreats, the abode of fishes, inasmuch as he has despatched me finely laden on my return from his retreats, and from his Temples, laden with most abundant booty, with safety to my boat, which in the stormy sea made me master of a singular and rich haul. In a wondrous and incredible manner has this haul turned out prosperously for me, nor yet have I this day taken a single ounce weight of fish, but only that which I am here bringing with me in my net. For when I arose in the middle of the night, and without sloth, I preferred profit to sleep and rest; in the raging tempest, I determined to try how I might lighten the poverty of my master and my own servitude, not sparing of my own exertions. Most worthless is the man that is slothful, and most detestably do I hate that kind of men. It behoves him to be vigilant who wishes to do his duty in good time; for it befits him not to be waiting until his master arouses him to his duties. For those who sleep on for the love of it, rest without profit to themselves and to their own cost. But now I, who have not been slothful, have found that for myself through which to be slothful if I should choose. Points to the wallet. This have I found in the sea to-day; whatever's in it, it's something heavy that's in it; I think it's gold that's in it. And not a single person is there my confidant in the matter. Now, Gripus, this opportunity has befallen you, that the Prætor 
 might make you a free man from among the multitude. Now, thus shall I do, this is my determination; I'll come to my master cleverly and cunningly, little by little I'll promise money for my freedom, that I may be free. Now, when I shall be free, then, in fine, I'll provide me land and houses 
 and slaves: I'll carry on merchandize with large ships: among the grandees I shall be considered a grandee. Afterwards, for the sake of pleasing myself, I'll build me a ship and I'll imitate Stratonicus 
 , and I'll be carried about from town to town. When my greatness is far-spread, I shall fortify some great city: to that city I shall give the name of "Gripus," a memorial of my fame and exploits, and there I'll establish a mighty kingdom. I am resolving here in my mind to prepare for mighty matters. At present I'll hide this booty. But this grandee pointing to himself is about to breakfast upon vinegar 
 and salt, without any good substantial meat. Gathers up the net, and drags it after him.

Enter TRACHALIO, in haste. 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 
 Hallo there! stop. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Why should I stop? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 While I coil up this rope 
 for you that you are dragging. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Now let it alone.
 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Troth, but I'll assist you. What's kindly done to worthy men, isn't thrown away. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 * * * * * There was a boisterous tempest yesterday; no fish have I, young man; don't you be supposing I have. Don't you see that I'm carrying my dripping net without the scaly race? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 I' faith, I'm not wishing for fish so much as I am in need of your conversation. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Then, whoever you are, you are worrying me to death with your annoyance. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 
 takes hold of him . I'll not allow you to go away from here; stop. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Take you care of a mishap, if you please; but why the plague are you dragging me back? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Listen. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 I won't listen. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 But, upon my faith, you shall listen. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Nay but, another time, tell me what you want. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Come now, it's worth your while at once to hear what I want to tell you. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Say on, whatever it is. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 See whether any person is following near us. Looks back. GRIP. Why, what reason is there that it should matter to me? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 So it is; but can you give me some good advice? 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 What's the business? Only tell me. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 I'll tell you; keep silence; if only you'll give me your word that you won't prove treacherous to me. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 I do give you my word; I'll be true to you, whoever you are. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Listen. I saw a person commit a theft; I knew the owner to whom that same property belonged. Afterwards I came myself to the thief, and I made him a proposal in these terms: "I know the person on whom that theft was committed; now if you are ready to give me half, I'll not make a discovery to the owner." He didn't even give me an answer. What is it fair should be given me out of it? Half, I trust you will say. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Aye, even more; but unless he gives it you, I think it ought to be told to the owner. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 I'll act on your advice. Now give me your attention; for it is to yourself all this relates. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 What has been done by me?
 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 
 pointing at the wallet . I've known the person for a long time to whom that wallet belongs. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 What do you mean? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 And in what manner it was lost. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 But I know in what manner it was found; and I know the person who found it, and who is now the owner. That, i' faith, is not a bit the more your matter than it is my own. I know the person to whom it now belongs; you, the person to whom it formerly belonged. This shall no individual get away from me; don't you be expecting to get it in a hurry. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 If the owner comes, shan't he get it away? 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 That you mayn't be mistaken, no born person is there that's owner of this but my own self—who took this in my own fishing. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Was it really so? 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Which fish in the sea will you say "is my own?" When I catch them, if indeed I do catch them, they are my own; as my own I keep them. They are not claimed as having a right to freedom 
 nor does any person demand a share in them. In the market I sell them all openly as my own wares. Indeed, the sea is, surely, common to all persons. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 I agree to that; prithee, then, why any the less is it proper that this wallet should be common to me? It was found in the sea. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Assuredly you are an outrageously impudent fellow; for if this is justice which you are saying, then fishermen would be ruined. Inasmuch as, the moment that the fish were exposed upon the stalls, no one would buy them; every person would be demanding his own share of the fish for himself; he would be saying that they were caught in the sea that was common to all. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 What do you say, you impudent fellow? Do you dare to compare a wallet with fish? Pray, does it appear to be the same thing? 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 The matter doesn't lie in my power; when I've cast my hook and net into the sea, whatever has adhered I draw out. Whatever my net and hooks have got, that in especial is my own. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Nay but, i' faith, it is not; if, indeed, you've fished up any article that's made 
 
 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Philosopher, you. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 But look now, you conjurer, did you ever see a fisherman who caught a wallet-fish, or exposed one for sale in the market? But, indeed, you shan't here be taking possession of all the profits that you choose; you expect, you dirty fellow, to be both a maker of wallets 
 and a fisherman. Either you must show me a fish that is a wallet, or else you shall carry nothing off that wasn't produced in the sea and has no scales. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 What, did you never hear before to-day that a wallet was a fish? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Villain, there is no such fish. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Yes, there certainly is; I, who am a fisherman, know it. But it is seldom caught; no fish more rarely comes near the land. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 It's to no purpose; you hope that you can be cheating me, you rogue. Of what colour is it? 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 
 looking at the wallet . Of this colour very few are caught: some are of a purple skin, there are great and black ones also. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 I understand; by my troth, you'll be turning into a wallet-fish I fancy, if you don't take care; your skin will be purple, and then afterwards black. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 
 aside . What a villain this that I have met with to-day! 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 We are wasting words; the day wears apace. Consider, please, by whose arbitration do you wish us to proceed? 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 By the arbitration of the wallet. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Really so, indeed? You are a fool. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 My respects to you, Mister Thales 
 
 
 Going. 
 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 
 holding him . You shan't carry that off this day, unless you find a place of safe keeping for it, or an umpire, by whose arbitration this matter may be settled. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Prithee, are you in your senses? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 I'm mad, in need of hellebore. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 But I'm troubled with sprites; still I shan't let this go. Hugs the wallet. 
 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Only add a single word more, that instant I'll drive my fists smash into your brains. This instant on this spot, just as a new napkin is wont to be wrung, I'll wring out of you whatever moisture there is, if you don't let this go. Seizes the wallet. 
 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Touch me; I'll dash you down on the ground just in such fashion as I'm in the habit of doing with a polypus fish 
 . Would you like to fight? Assumes a boxing attitude. 
 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 What need is there? Nay, in preference, divide the booty. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 You can't get anything from here but harm to yourself, so don't expect it. I'm taking myself off. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 But I'll turn aside your ship from that direction, that you mayn't be off anywhere—stop. Stands in front of him, and holds the rope. 
 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 If you are the helmsman of this ship, I'll be the pilot. Let go of the rope now, you villain. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 I will let go; do you let go of the wallet. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 I' faith, you shall never this day become a scrap the more wealthy from this. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 You cannot convince me by repeatedly denying, unless either a part is given me, or it is referred to arbitration, or it is placed in safe keeping. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 What, that which I got out of the sea—? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 But I spied it out from the shore. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 —With my own pains and labour, and net and boat. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 If now the owner, whose property it is, were to come, how am I, who espied from afar that you had taken this, a bit the less the thief than yourself? 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 None whatever. Going. 
 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 
 seizing the net . Stop, you whip-knave; just let me learn of you by what reasoning I am not the sharer, and yet the thief. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 I don't know; neither do I know these city laws of yours, only that I affirm that this is mine. Looks at the wallet. 
 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 And I, too, say that it is mine. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Stay now; I've discovered by what method you may be neither thief nor sharer. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 By what method? 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Let me go away from here; you quietly go your own way, and don't you inform against me to any one, and I won't give anything to you. You hold your tongue; I'll be mum. This is the best and the fairest plan. 
 
 
 TRACE. 
 Well, what proposition do you venture to make? 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 I've made it already; for you to go away, to let go of the rope, and not to be a nuisance to me. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Stop while I propose terms. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 I' faith, do, prithee, dispose 
 of yourself forthwith. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Do you know any one in these parts? 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 My own neighbours I must know. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Where do you live here? 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 
 pointing . At a distance out away yonder, as far off as the farthest fields. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 
 pointing to the cottage of DÆMONES . The person that lives in that cottage, should you like it to be decided by his arbitration? 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Let go of the rope for a moment while I step aside and consider. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Be it so. Lets go of the rope. 
 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 
 aside . Capital, the thing's all right; the whole of this booty is my own. He's inviting me here inside of my own abode to my own master as umpire. By my troth, he never this day will award three obols away from his own servant. Assuredly, this fellow doesn't know what proposal he has been making. To TRACHALIO. I'll go to the arbitrator with you. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 What then? 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Although I know for sure that this is my own lawful right, let that be done rather than I should now be fighting with you.
 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Now you satisfy me. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Although you are driving me before an arbitrator whom I don't know, if he shall administer justice, although he is unknown, he is as good as known to me; if he doesn't, though known, he is the same as though entirely unknown.

Enter DÆMONES, from his cottage, with PALÆSTRA and AMPELISCA, and SERVANTS. 
 
 DÆM. 
 
 to the WOMEN . Seriously, upon my faith, young women, although I wish what you desire, I'm afraid that on your account my wife will be turning me out of doors, who'll be saying that I've brought harlots here before her very eyes. Do you take refuge at the altar rather than I 
 . 
 
 
 THE WOMEN. 
 We, wretched creatures, are undone. They weep. 
 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 I'll place you in safety; don't you fear. But why turning to the SERVANTS are you following me out of doors? Since I'm here, no one shall do them harm. Now then, be off, I say, in-doors, both of you, you guards from off guard. They go in. 
 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 O master, save you. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Save you. How goes it? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 
 pointing to GRIPUS . Is he your servant? 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 I'm not ashamed to say yes. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 I've nothing to do with you. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Then get you gone hence, will you. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Prithee, do answer me, aged sir; is he your servant? 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 He is mine. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Oh then, that is very good, since he is yours. Again I salute you. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 And I you. Are you he who, not long since, went away from here to fetch his master? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 I am he. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 What now is it that you want? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 
 pointing to GRIPUS . This is your servant, you say? 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 He is mine. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 That is very good, since he is yours.
 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 What's the matter? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 
 pointing to GRIPUS . That's a rascally fellow there. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 What has the rascally fellow done to you? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 I wish the ancles of that fellow were smashed. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 What's the thing about which you are now disputing between yourselves? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 I'll tell you. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 No, I'll tell you. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 I fancy I'm to move the matter first. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 If indeed you were a decent person, you would be moving yourself off from here. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Gripus, give attention, and hold your tongue 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 In order that that fellow may speak first? 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Attend, Itell you. To TRACHALIO. Do you say on. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Will you give the right of speaking to a stranger sooner than to your own servant? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 O dear! how impossible it is for him to be kept quiet. As I was beginning to say, that Procurer, whom some little time since you turned out of the Temple of Venus —see pointing at the wallet , he has got his wallet. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 I haven't got it. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Do you deny that which I see with my own eyes? 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 But I only wish you couldn't see. I have got it, and I haven't got it; why do you trouble yourself about me, what things I do? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 In what way you got it does matter, whether rightfully or wrongfully. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 If I didn't take it in the sea, there's not a reason why you shouldn't deliver me up to the cross. If I took it in the sea with my net, how is it yours rather than my own? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 
 to DÆMONES . He is deceiving you; the matter happened in this way, as I am telling you. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 What do you say? 
 
 
 TRACE. 
 So long as the person that has the first right to speak is speaking, do to DÆMONES put a check on him, please, if he belongs to you. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 What, do you wish the same thing to be done to myself, that your master has been accustomed to do to yourself? If he is in the habit of putting a check upon you, this master of ours isn't in the habit of doing so with us. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 
 to TRACUALIO . In that remark only has he got the better 
 of you. What do you want now? Tell me.
 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 For my part, I neither ask for a share of that wallet there, nor have I ever said this day that it is my own; but in it there is a little casket that belongs to this female pointing to PALÆSTRA , whom a short time since I averred to be free born. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 You are speaking of her, I suppose, whom a short time since you said was my countrywoman? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Just so; and those trinkets which formerly, when little, she used to wear, are there in that casket, which is in that wallet. This thing is of no service to him, and will be of utility to her, poor creature, if he gives it up, by means of which to seek for her parents. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 I'll make him give it up; hold your tongue. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 I' faith, I'm going to give nothing to that fellow. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 I ask for nothing but the casket and the trinkets 
 . 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 What if they are made of gold? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 What's that to you? Gold shall be paid for gold, silver shall have its weight in silver in return. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Please let me see the gold; after that I'll let you see the casket. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 
 to GRIPUS . Do you beware of punishment, and hold your tongue. To TRACHALIO. As you commenced to speak do you go on. 
 
 
 TRACK. 
 This one thing I entreat of you, that you will have compassion on this female, if, indeed, this wallet is that Procurer's, which I suspect it is. In this matter, I'm saying nothing of certainty to you, but only on conjecture. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Do you see how the rascal's wheedling him? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Allow me to say on as I commenced. If this is the wallet that belongs to that villain whose I say it is, these women here will be able to recognize it; order him to show it to them.
 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Say you so? To show it to them? 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 He doesn't say unreasonably, Gripus, that the wallet should be shown. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Yes, i' faith, confoundedly unreasonably. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 How so? 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Because, if I do show it, at once they'll say, of course, that they recognize it. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Source of villany, do you suppose that all other people are just like yourself, you author of perjury? 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 All this I easily put up with, so long as he pointing to DÆMONES is of my way of thinking 
 . 
 
 
 TEACH. 
 But now he is against you; from this pointing to the wallet will he obtain true testimony. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Gripus, do you pay attention. To TRACHALIO. You explain in a few words what it is you want? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 For my part, I have stated it; but if you haven't understood me, I'll state it over again. Both of these women pointing to them , as I said a short time since, ought to be free; pointing to PALÆSTRA she was stolen at Athens when a little girl. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Tell me what that has got to do with the wallet, whether they are slaves or whether free women? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 You wish it all to be told over again, you rascal, so that the day may fail us. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Leave off your abuse, and explain to me what I've been asking. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 There ought to be a casket of wicker-work 
 in that wallet, in which are tokens by means of which she may be enabled to recognize her parents, by whom, when little, she was lost at Athens , as I said before. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 May Jupiter and the Gods confound you. What do you say, you sorcerer of a fellow? What, are these women dumb, that they are not able to speak for themselves? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 They are silent for this reason, because a silent woman is always better than a talking one.
 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Then, i' faith, by your way of speaking, you are neither a man nor a woman to my notion. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 How so? 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Why, because neither talking nor silent are you ever good for anything. Prithee to DÆMONES , shall I ever be allowed to-day to speak? 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 If you utter a single word more this day, I'll break your head for you. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 As I had commenced to say it, old gentleman, I beg you to order him to give up that casket to these young women; if for it he asks any reward for himself, it shall be paid; whatever else is there besides, let him keep for himself. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Now at last you say that, because you are aware it is my right; just now you were asking to go halves. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Aye, and even still I ask it. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 I've seen a kite making a swoop, even when he got nothing at all however. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 
 to GRIPUS . Can't I shut your mouth without a drubbing? 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 
 pointing to TRACHALIO . If that fellow is silent, I'll be silent; if he talks, allow me to talk in my own behalf. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Please now give me this wallet, Gripus. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 I'll trust it to you; but for you to return it me, if there are none of those things in it. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 It shall be returned. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Take it. Gives him the wallet. 
 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Now then listen, Palæstra and Ampelisca, to this which I say: is this the wallet, in which this Procurer said that your casket was? 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 It is the same. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 
 aside . Troth, to my sorrow, I'm undone; how on the instant, before she well saw it, she said that it was it. 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 I'll make this matter plain to you, instead of difficult. There ought to be a casket of wicker-work there in that wallet; whatever is in there I'll state by name; don't you show me anything. If I say wrong, I shall then have said this to no purpose; then you shall keep these things, whatever is in there for yourselves. But if the truth, then I entreat you that what is my own may be restored to me. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 I agree; you ask for bare justice only, in my way of thinking, at least. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 But, i' faith, in mine, for extreme injustice; what if she is a witch or a sorceress, and shall mention exactly everything that's in it P Is a sorceress to have it? 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 She shan't get it, unless she tells the truth; in vain will she 
 be conjuring. Unloose the wallet, then giving it to GRIPUS , that as soon as possible I may know what is the truth. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 
 first unfastens the straps of the wallet, and then hands it to his MASTER . Take it 
 , it's unfastened. DÆMONES takes out the casket. Alas, I'm undone; I see the casket. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 
 holding it up, and addressing PALÆSTRA . Is this it? 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 That is it. O my parents, here do I keep you locked up; here have I enclosed both my wealth and my hopes of recognizing you. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 
 aside . Then, by my faith, the Gods must be enraged with you, whoever you are, who fasten up your parents in so narrow a compass. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Gripus, come hither, your cause is being tried. To PALÆSTRA. Do you, young woman, away at a distance there say what's in it, and of what appearance; mention them all. By my troth, if you make ever so slight a mistake, even if afterwards you wish, madam, to correct yourself, you'll be making a great mistake. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 You demand what's real justice. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 By my troth, then, he doesn't demand yourself; for you are the opposite of justice. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Now then, say on, young woman. Gripus, give attention and hold your tongue. 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 There are some trinkets. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 
 looking in the casket . See, here they are, I espy them. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 
 aside . In the first onset I an. worsted; takes hold of the arm of DÆMONES hold, don't be showing. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Of what description are they? Answer in their order. 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 In the first place, there's a little sword of gold, with an inscription.
 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Just tell me, what the characters are upon that little sword. 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 The name of my father. Next, on the other side, there's a little two-edged axe, of gold likewise, with an inscription: there on the axe is the name of my mother. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Stay; tell me, what's the name of your father upon the little sword? 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 Dæmones. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Immortal Gods! where in the world are my hopes? 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Aye, by my troth, and where are mine? 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Do proceed forthwith, I entreat you. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Cautiously, or else aside away to utter perdition. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Say, what's the name of your mother, here upon the little axe? 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 Dædalis. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 The Gods will that I should be preserved. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 But that I should be ruined. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 This must be my own daughter, Gripus. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 She may be for me, indeed. To TRACHALIO. May all the Gods confound you who this day saw me with your eyes, and myself as well for a blockhead, who didn't look about a hundred times first to see that no one was watching me, before I drew the net out of the water. 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 Next, there's a little knife of silver, and two little hands linked together, and then a little sow. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 
 aside . Nay, then, go and be hanged, you with your little sow and with your little pigs. 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 There's also a golden drop 
 , which my father presented to me upon my birthday. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Undoubtedly there is; but I cannot restrain myself any longer from embracing you. My daughter, blessings on you; I am that father who begot you; I am Dæmones, and see, your mother Dædalis is in the house here pointing to his cottage . 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 
 embracing him . Blessings on you, my unlooked-for father. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Blessings on you; how joyously do I embrace you. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 'Tis a pleasure to me, inasmuch as this falls to your lot from your feelings of affection. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Come then, Trachalio, if you can, bring that wallet into the house. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 
 taking the wallet . See the villany of Gripus; inasmuch, Gripus, as this matter has turned out unfortunately for you, I congratulate you. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Come, then, let's go, my daughter, to your mother, who will be better able to enquire of you into this matter from proofs; who had you more in her hands, and is more thoroughly acquainted with your tokens. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Let's all go hence in-doors, since we are giving our common aid. 
 
 
 PALAESTRA 
 Follow me, Ampelisca. 
 
 
 AMPELISCA 
 That the Gods favour you, it is a pleasure to me. They all go into the cottage of DÆMONES, exceptGRIPUS. 
 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 
 to himself . Am I not a blockhead of a fellow, to have this day fished up that wallet? Or, when I had fished it up, not to have hidden it somewhere in a secret spot? By my troth, I guessed that it would be a troublesome booty for me, because it fell to me in such troublous weather. I' faith, I guess that there's plenty of gold and silver there. What is there better for me than to be off hence in-doors and secretly hang myself—at least for a little time, until this vexation passes away from me? Goes into the cottage.

Enter DÆMONES, from his cottage. 
 
 DÆM. 
 
 to himself. O ye immortal Gods, what person is there more fortunate than I, who unexpectedly have discovered my daughter? Isn't it the fact, that if the Gods will a blessing to befall any person, that longed-for pleasure by some means or other, falls to the lot 
 of the virtuous? I this day, a thing that I never hoped for nor yet believed, have unexpectedly discovered my daughter, and I shall bestow her upon a respectable young man of noble family, an Athenian, and my kinsman. For that reason I wish him to be fetched hither to me as soon as possible, and I've requested my servant to come out here, that he may go to the Forum. Still, I'm surprised at it that he isn't yet come out. I think I'll go to the door. Opens the door, and looks in. What do I behold? Embracing her, my wife is clasping my daughter around her neck. Her caressing is really almost too foolish and sickening.

DÆM. 
 
 Goes to the door again, and calls out. 'Twere better, wife, for an end to be made at last of your kissing; and make all ready that I may perform a sacrifice, when I come in-doors, in honor of the household Gods, inasmuch as they have increased our family. At home I have lambs and swine for sacred use. But why, ladies, are you detaining that Trachalio? Oh, I see he's coming out of doors, very seasonably.

 Enter TRACHALIO, from the cottage. 
 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 
 speaking to those within . Wheresoever he shall be, I'll seek Plesidippus out at once, and bring him together with me to you. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Tell him how this matter has fallen out about my daughter. Request him to leave other occupations and to come here. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Very well 
 
 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Tell him that I'll give him my daughter for a wife. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Very well. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 And that I knew his father, and that he is a relation of my own. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Very well. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 But do make haste.
 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Very well. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Take care and let a dinner be prepared here at once. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Very well. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 What, all very well? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Very well. But do you know what it is I want of you? That you'll remember what you promised, that this day I'm to be free. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Very well 
 . 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Take care and entreat Plesidippus to give me my freedom. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Very well. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 And let your daughter request it; she'll easily prevail. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Very well. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 And that Ampelisca may marry me, when I'm a free man. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Very well. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 And that I may experience a pleasing return to myself in kindness for my actions. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Very well. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 What, all very well? 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Very well. Again I return you thanks. But do you make haste to proceed to the city forthwith, and betake yourself hither again. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 Very well. I'll be here directly. In the meanwhile, do you make the other preparations that are necessary. (Exit TRACHALIO.) 
 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Very well—may Hercules ill befriend him with his "very-welling 
 ;" he has so stuffed my ears with it. Whatever it was I said, "very well" was the answer.

Enter GRIPUS, from the cottage. 
 
 GRIPUS 
 How soon may I have a word with you, Dæmones? 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 What's your business, Gripus? 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Touching that wallet, if you are wise, be wise; keep what goods the Gods provide you. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Does it seem right to you, that, what belongs to another I should assert to be my own? 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 What, not a thing that I found in the sea? 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 So much the better does it happen for him who lost it; none the more is it necessary that it should be your wallet.
 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 For this reason are you poor because you are too scrupulously righteous. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 O Gripus, Gripus, in the life of man very many traps there are, in what they are deceived by guile. And, by my troth, full often is a bait placed in them, which bait if any greedy person greedily snaps at, through his own greediness he is caught in the trap. He who prudently, skilfully, and warily, takes precaution, full long he may enjoy that which is honestly acquired. This booty seems to me 
 to be about to be made a booty of by me, that it may go hence with a greater blessing than it first came. What, ought I to conceal what I know was brought to me as belonging to another? By no means will my friend Dæmones do that. 'Tis ever most becoming for prudent men to be on their guard against this, that they be not themselves confederates with their servants in evil-doing. Except only when I'm gaming, I don't care for any gain. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 At times, I've seen the Comedians, when acting, in this fashion repeat sayings in a wise manner, and be applauded for them, when they pointed out this prudent conduct to the public. But when each person went thence his own way home, there wasn't one after the fashion which they had recommended. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Go in-doors, don't be troublesome, moderate your tongue. I'm going to give you nothing, don't you deceive yourself. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 
 apart . Then I pray the Gods that whatever's in that wallet, whether it's gold, or whether silver, it may all become ashes. Goes into the cottage. 
 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 This is the reason why we have bad servants. For this master, if he had combined with any servant, would have made both himself and the other guilty of a theft. While he was thinking that he himself had made a capture, in the meantime he himself would have been made a capture: capture would have led to capture. Now will I go in-doors from here and sacrifice; after that, I'll at once order the dinner to be cooked for us. Goes into the cottage.

Enter PLESIDIPPUS and TRACHALIO, at the further end of the stage. 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 Tell me all these things over again my life, my Trachalio, my freed-man, my patron, aye rather, my father; has Palæstra found her father and mother? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 She has found them. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 And is she my countrywoman? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 So I think. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 And is she to marry me? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 So I suspect. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 Prithee, do you reckon that he will betroth her to me? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 So I reckon 
 . 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 Well, shall I congratulate her father too upon his finding her? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 So I reckon. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 Well, her mother too? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 So I reckon. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 What then do you reckon? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 What you ask me, I reckon. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 Tell me then how much do you reckon it at? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 What I, I reckon— 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 Then really, do carry over 
 . Don't be always making a reckoning. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 So I reckon. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 What if I run? Pretends to run. 
 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 So I reckon. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 Or rather gently, this way? He walks slowly. 
 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 So I reckon. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 Ought I to salute her as well when I arrive? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 So I reckon. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 Her father too? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 So I reckon. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 After that, her mother? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 So I reckon. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 And what after that? When I arrive, should I also embrace her father? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 So I don't reckon. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 Well, her mother? 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 So I don't reckon. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 Well, her own self?
 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 So I don't reckon. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 Confusion, he has closed his reckoning 
 ; now when I wish him, he doesn't reckon. 
 
 
 TRACHALIO 
 You are not in your senses; follow me. 
 
 
 PLESIDIPPUS 
 Conduct me, my patron, where you please. They go into the cottage of DÆMONES.

Enter LABRAX, at a distance. 
 
 LABRAX 
 
 to himself . What other mortal being is there living this day more wretched than myself, whom before the commissioned judges 
 Plesidippus has just now cast? Palæstra has just been taken from me by award. I'm ruined outright. But I do believe that Procurers were procreated for mere sport; so much do all persons make sport if any misfortune befalls a Procurer. Now I'll go look here, in the Temple of Venus, for that other female, that her at least I may take away, the only portion of my property that remains. He retires a little distance.

Enter GRIPUS, from the cottage of DÆMONES, with a spit in his hand. 
 
 GRIPUS 
 
 calling to the PEOPLE within . By the powers, you shall never this day at nightfall behold Gripus alive, unless the wallet is restored to me. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 
 behind . I'm ready to die; when I hear mentior made anywhere of a wallet, I'm thumped, as it were with a stake, upon the breast. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 
 at the door, continuing . That scoundrel is free; I, the person that held the net in the sea, and drew up the wallet, to him you refuse to give anything. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 
 behind . O ye immortal Gods! by his talk this person has made me prick up my ears.
 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 
 continuing . By my troth, in letters a cubit long, I'll immediately post it up in every quarter, "If any person has lost a wallet with plenty of gold and silver, let him come to Gripus." You shan't keep it as you are wishing. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 
 behind . I' faith, this person knows, as I think, who has got the wallet. This person must be accosted by me; ye Gods, aid me, I do entreat you.
 Some one calls GRIPUS, from within. 
 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Why are you calling me back in-doors? He rubs away at the spit. I want to clean this here before the door. But surely this, i' faith, has been made of rust, and not of iron; so that the more I rub it, it becomes quite red and more slender. Why surely this spit has been drugged 
 ; it does waste away so in my hands. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 
 accosting him . Save you, young man. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 May the Gods prosper you with your shorn pate 
 . 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 What's going on? 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 A spit being cleaned. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 How do you do? 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 What are you? Prithee, are you a medicant 
 ? 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 No, i' faith, I am more than a medicant by one letter. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Then you are a "mendicant." 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 You've hit it to a nicety 
 . 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Your appearance seems suitable to it. But what's the matter with you? 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Troth, this last night I was shipwrecked at sea the vessel was cast away, and to my misfortune I lost there everything that I had. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 What did you lose? 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 A wallet with plenty of gold and silver. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Do you at all remember what there was in the wallet which was lost? 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 What matters for us now to be talking of it, if, in spite of it, it's lost? 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 What if I know who has found it? I wish to learn from you the tokens. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Eight hundred golden pieces were there in a purse, besides a hundred Philippean minæ in a wash-leather bag apart. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 
 aside . Troth, it is a noble prize; I shall be getting a handsome reward. The Gods show respect to mortals; therefore I shall come off bounteously rewarded. No doubt, it is this man's wallet. To LABRAX. Do you proceed to relate the rest. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 A large talent of silver of full weight was in a purse, besides a bowl, a goblet, a beaker, a boat, and a cup. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Astonishing! you really did have some splendid riches. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 A shocking expression is that, and a most abominable one. "You did have, and now have not." 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 What would you be ready to give to one who should find these out for you, and give you information? Say, speedily and at once. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Three hundred didrachms. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Rubbish. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Four hundred. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Old thrums. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Five hundred. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 A rotten nut. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Six hundred. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 You are prating about mere tiny weevils. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 I'll give seven hundred. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Your mouth is hot, you are cooling it 
 just now. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 I'll give a thousand didrachms. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 You are dreaming. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 I add no more; be off with you. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Hear me then; if, i' faith, I should be off from here, I shan't be here. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Would you like a hundred as well as the thousand? 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 You are asleep. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Say how much you ask. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 That you mayn't be adding anything against your inclination, a great talent; it's not possible for three obols to be bated thence; then do you say either "yes" or "no" at once. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 
 aside . What's to be done here? It's a matter of necessity, I see: to GRIPUS the talent shall be paid. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 
 going towards the altar . Just step this way; I wish Venus here to put the question to you. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Whatever you please, that command me. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Touch this altar of Venus. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 
 touching it . I am touching it. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 By Venus here must you swear to me. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 What must I swear? 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 What I shall bid you. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Dictate in words just as you like. Aside. What I've got at home, I shall never beg 
 of any one else. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Take hold of this altar. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 
 taking hold of it . I am taking hold of it. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Swear that you will pay me the money on that same day on which you shall gain possession of the wallet. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Be it so. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 
 speaking, while LABRAX repeats after him . Venus of Cyrene, I invoke thee as my witness, if I shall find that wallet which I lost in the ship, safe with the gold and silver, and it shall come into my possession— 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 "Then to this Gripus do I promise;" say so and place your hand upon me. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Then to this Gripus do I promise, Venus, do thou hear me— 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 
 followed by LABRAX . "That I will forthwith give him a great talent of silver." 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 If you defraud me, say, may Venus utterly destroy your body, and your existence in your calling. Aside. As it is, do you have this for yourself, when you've once taken the oath. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 If, Venus, I shall do anything amiss against this oath, I supplicate thee that all Procurers may henceforth be wretched. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 
 aside . As it is, it shall be so, even if you do keep your oath. Do you wait here; going towards the cottage —I'll at once make the old gentleman come out; do you forthwith demand of him that wallet. Goes in. 
 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 
 to himself . If ever so much he shall restore to me this wallet, I'm not this day indebted to him three obols even. It's according to my own intention what my tongue swears. The door opens. But I'll hold my peace; see, here he's coming out, and bringing the old man.

Enter GRIPUS, followed by DÆMONES, with the wallet. 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Follow this way. Where is this Procurer? Hark you to LABRAX , see now; this person pointing at DÆMONES has got your wallet. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 I have got it, and I confess that it is in my possession; and if it's yours, you may have it. Everything, just as each particular was in it, shall in like manner be given safe to you. Holding it out. Take it, if it's yours. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Immortal Gods, it is mine. Takes it. Welcome, dear wallet. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Is it yours? 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Do you ask the question? If indeed, i' faith, it were in Jove's possession, still it is my own. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Everything in it is safe; there has only been one casket taken out of it, with some trinkets, by means of which this day I have found my daughter. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 What person? 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Palæstra, who was your property, she has been discovered to be my own daughter. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 By my troth, it has happily turned out so; since this matter has happened so fortunately for you according to your wishes, I'm rejoiced. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 In that I don't readily believe you. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Aye, by my faith, that you may be sure that I'm rejoiced, you shan't give me three obols for her; I excuse you. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 I' faith, you are acting kindly. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 No, troth; it's really yourself, indeed, that's doing so. Going off with the wallet. 
 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Hark you, you've got the wallet now. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 I have got it. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Make haste.
 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Make haste about what? 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 To pay me the money. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 By my troth, I'll neither give you anything nor do I owe you anything. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 What mode of proceeding is this? Don't you owe it me? 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Troth, not I indeed. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Didn't you promise it me upon your oath? 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 I did take an oath, and now I'll take an oath, if it is in any way my own pleasure; oaths were invented for preserving property, not for losing it. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Give me, will you, a great talent of silver, you most perjured fellow. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Gripus, what talent is it you are asking him for? 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 He promised it me on oath. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 I chose to swear; turning to DÆMONES are you the priest 
 as to my perjury? 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 
 to GRIPUS . For what reason did he promise you the money? 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 If I restored this wallet into his hands, he swore that he would give me a great talent of silver. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Find me a person with whom I may go to the judge, to decide whether you did not make the bargain with wicked fraudulence, and whether I am yet five-and-twenty years old 
 . 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 
 pointing to DÆMONES . Go to the judge with him. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 No; I must have some other person. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 
 to LABRAX . Then I shan't allow you to take it away from him, unless I shall have found him guilty. Did you promise him the money?
 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 I confess it. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 What you promised my slave must needs be my own. Don't you be supposing, Procurer, that you are to be using your pimping honesty here. That can't be. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 
 to LABRAX . Did you fancy now that you had got hold of a person whom you might cheat? It must be paid down here holding his hand , good silver coin; I shall, at once, pay it to him pointing to DÆMONES , so that he may give me my liberty. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Inasmuch, therefore, as I have acted courteously towards you, and by my means these things pointing to the wallet have been saved for you— 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 I' faith, by my means, rather; don't say by yours. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 
 to GRIPUS . If you are prudent you'll hold your tongue. To LABRAX. Then it befits you in a like courteous manner kindly to return the obligation to myself, who so well merit the same. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 You are pleading, of course, for my right? 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 
 ironically . It would be a wonder if I didn't, at a loss to myself, ask you to forego your right. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 
 aside . I'm all right; the Procurer's giving way; my freedom is at hand. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 
 pointing to GRIPUS . He found this wallet; he is my slave. I therefore have preserved this for you, together with a large sum of money. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 I return you thanks, and with regard to the talent that I promised on oath to him, there's no reason that you shouldn't receive it. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Hark you, give it me then, if you are wise. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 
 to GRIPUS . Will you hold your tongue, or not? 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 You pretend to be acting on my side: I tell you * * * * * * by my troth, you shan't do me out of that, if I did lose the other booty 
 . 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 You shall have a beating if you add a single word. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Troth now, do you kill me even; I'll never be silent on any terms, unless my mouth is shut with the talent. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 For yourself, in fact, is he using his exertions; do hold your tongue.
 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Step this way, Procurer. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Very well. They walk on one side. 
 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Proceed openly; I don't want any whisperings or mumblings to be going on. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Tell me, at what price did you buy that other young woman, Ampelisca? 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 I paid down a thousand didrachms. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Should you like me to make you a handsome offer? 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 I should like it much. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 I'll divide the talent. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 You act fairly. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 For that other woman Ampelisca, that she may be free, take you one half, and give the other half to him. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 By all means. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 For that half I'll give his freedom to Gripus, by means of whom you found your wallet, and I my daughter. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 You act fairly; I return you many thanks. They return to GRIPUS. 
 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 How soon then is the money to be returned to me? 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 The money's paid, Gripus; I've got it. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 You, faith; but I had rather it were myself. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 I' faith, there's nothing for you here, so don't you be expecting it. I wish you to release him from his oath. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 
 aside. Troth, I'm undone; if I don't hang myself 
 , I'm utterly done for. Aloud. I' faith, after this day you certainly shall never be cheating me again. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Dine here to-day, Procurer. 
 
 
 LABRAX 
 Be it so; the proposal is to my taste. 
 
 
 DÆM. 
 Do you both follow me in-doors. He comes forward and addresses the AUDIENCE. Spectators, I would invite you to dinner as well, were it not that I'm going to give nothing, and that there is no good cheer at all at home; and if, too, I didn't believe that you are invited to dinner elsewhere. But if you shall be willing to give hearty applause to this Play, do you all come to make merry at my house some sixteen years hence. Do you to LABRAX and GRIPUS both dine here with me to-day. 
 
 
 GRIPUS 
 Be it so. 
 
 
 An ACTOR 
 
 (To the AUDIENCE) Now give us your applause.
