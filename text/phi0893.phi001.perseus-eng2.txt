Maecenas, born of monarch ancestors,

The shield at once and glory of my life!

There are who joy them in the Olympic strife

And love the dust they gather in the course;

The goal by hot wheels shunn'd, the famous prize,

Exalt them to the gods that rule mankind;

This joys, if rabbles fickle as the wind

Through triple grade of honours bid him rise,

That, if his granary has stored away

Of Libya 's thousand floors the yield entire;

The man who digs his field as did his sire,

With honest pride, no Attalus may sway

By proffer'd wealth to tempt Myrtoan seas,

The timorous captain of a Cyprian bark.

The winds that make Icarian billows dark

The merchant fears, and hugs the rural ease

Of his own village home; but soon, ashamed

Of penury, he refits his batter'd craft.

There is, who thinks no scorn of Massic draught,

Who robs the daylight of an hour unblamed,

Now stretch'd beneath the arbute on the sward,

Now by some gentle river's sacred spring;

Some love the camp, the clarion's joyous ring,

And battle, by the mother's soul abhorr'd.

See, patient waiting in the clear keen air,

The hunter, thoughtless of his delicate bride,

Whether the trusty hounds a stag have eyed,

Or the fierce Marsian boar has burst the snare.

To me the artist's meed, the ivy wreath

Is very heaven: me the sweet cool of woods,

Where Satyrs frolic with the Nymphs, secludes

From rabble rout, so but Euterpe's breath

Fail not the flute, nor Polyhymnia fly

Averse from stringing new the Lesbian lyre.

O, write my name among that minstrel choir,

And my proud head shall strike upon the sky!

Enough of snow and hail at last

The sire has sent in vengeance down:

His bolts, at his own temple cast,

Appall'd the town,

Appall'd the lands, lest Pyrrha 's time

Return, with all its monstrous sights,

When Proteus led his flocks to climb

The flatten'd heights,

When fish were in the elm-tops caught,

Where once the stock-dove wont to bide,

And does were floating, all distraught,

Adown the tide.

Old Tiber , hurl'd in tumult back

From mingling with the Etruscan main,

Has threaten'd Numa's court with wrack

And Vesta's fane.

Roused by his Ilia 's plaintive woes,

He vows revenge for guiltless blood,

And, spite of Jove, his banks o'erflows,

Uxorious flood.

Yes, Fame shall tell of civic steel

That better Persian lives had spilt,

To youths, whose minish'd numbers feel

Their parents' guilt.

What god shall Rome invoke to stay

Her fall? Can suppliance overbear

The ear of Vesta, turn'd away

From chant and prayer?

Who comes, commission'd to atone

For crime like ours? at length appear,

A cloud round thy bright shoulders thrown,

Apollo seer!

Or Venus, laughter-loving dame,

Round whom gay Loves and Pleasures fly;

Or thou, if slighted sons may claim

A parent's eye,

O weary with thy long, long game,

Who lov'st fierce shouts and helmets bright,

And Moorish warrior's glance of flame

Or e'er he smite!

Or Maia 's son, if now awhile

In youthful guise we see thee here,

Caesar's avenger—such the style

Thou deign'st to bear;

Late be thy journey home, and long

Thy sojourn with Rome 's family;

Nor let thy wrath at our great wrong

Lend wings to fly.

Here take our homage, Chief and Sire;

Here wreathe with bay thy conquering brow,

And bid the prancing Mede retire,

Our Caesar thou!

Thus may Cyprus ' heavenly queen,

Thus Helen's brethren, stars of brightest sheen,

Guide thee! May the sire of wind

Each truant gale, save only Zephyr, bind!

So do thou, fair ship, that ow'st

Virgil, thy precious freight, to Attic coast,

Safe restore thy loan and whole,

And save from death the partner of my soul!

Oak and brass of triple fold

Encompass'd sure that heart, which first made bold

To the raging sea to trust

A fragile bark, nor fear'd the Afric gust

With its Northern mates at strife,

Nor Hyads' frown, nor South-wind fury-rife,

Mightiest power that Hadria knows,

Wills he the waves to madden or compose.

What had Death in store to awe

Those eyes, that huge sea-beasts unmelting saw,

Saw the swelling of the surge,

And high Ceraunian cliffs, the seaman's scourge?

Heaven's high providence in vain

Has sever'd countries with the estranging main,

If our vessels ne'ertheless

With reckless plunge that sacred bar transgress.

Daring all, their goal to win,

Men tread forbidden ground, and rush on sin:

Daring all, Prometheus play'd

His wily game, and fire to man convey'd;

Soon as fire was stolen away,

Pale Fever's stranger host and wan Decay

Swept o'er earth's polluted face,

And slow Fate quicken'd Death's once halting pace.

Daedalus the void air tried

On wings, to humankind by Heaven denied;

Acheron 's bar gave way with ease

Before the arm of labouring Hercules.

Nought is there for man too high;

Our impious folly e'en would climb the sky,

Braves the dweller on the steep,

Nor lets the bolts of heavenly vengeance sleep.

The touch of Zephyr and of Spring has loosen'd Winter's thrall;

The well-dried keels are wheel'd again to sea:

The ploughman cares not for his fire, nor cattle for their stall,

And frost no more is whitening all the lea.

Now Cytherea leads the dance, the bright moon overhead;

The Graces and the Nymphs, together knit,

With rhythmic feet the meadow beat, while Vulcan , fiery red,

Heats the Cyclopian forge in Aetna 's pit.

'Tis now the time to wreathe the brow with branch of myrtle green,

Or flowers, just opening to the vernal breeze;

Now Faunus claims his sacrifice among the shady treen,

Lambkin or kidling, which soe'er he please.

Pale Death, impartial, walks his round: he knocks at cottage-gate

And palace-portal. Sestius, child of bliss!

How should a mortal's hopes be long, when short his being's date?

Lo here! the fabulous ghosts, the dark abyss,

The void of the Plutonian hall, where soon as e'er you go,

No more for you shall leap the auspicious die

To seat you on the throne of wine; no more your breast shall glow

For Lycidas, the star of every eye.

What slender youth, besprinkled with perfume,

Courts you on roses in some grotto's shade?

Fair Pyrrha , say, for whom

Your yellow hair you braid,

So trim, so simple! Ah! how oft shall he

Lament that faith can fail, that gods can change,

Viewing the rough black sea

With eyes to tempests strange,

Who now is basking in your golden smile,

And dreams of you still fancy-free, still kind,

Poor fool, nor knows the guile

Of the deceitful wind!

Woe to the eyes you dazzle without cloud

Untried! For me, they show in yonder fane

My dripping garments, vow'd

To Him who curbs the main.

Not I, but Varius:—he, of Homer's brood

A tuneful swan, shall bear you on his wing,

Your tale of trophies, won by field or flood,

Mighty alike to sing.

Not mine such themes, Agrippa; no, nor mine

To chant the Wrath that fill'd Pelides' breast,

Nor dark Ulysses' wanderings o'er the brine,

Nor Pelops' house unblest.

Vast were the task, I feeble; inborn shame,

And she, who makes the peaceful lyre submit,

Forbid me to impair great Caesar's fame

And yours by my weak wit.

But who may fitly sing of Mars array'd

In adamant mail, or Merion, black with dust

Of Troy , or Tydeus' son by Pallas ' aid

Strong against gods to thrust?

Feasts are my theme, my warriors maidens fair,

Who with pared nails encounter youths in fight;

Be Fancy free or caught in Cupid's snare,

Her temper still is light.

Let others Rhodes or Mytilene sing,

Or Ephesus , or Corinth , set between

Two seas, or Thebes , or Delphi , for its king

Each famous, or Thessalian Tempe green;

There are who make chaste Pallas' virgin tower

The daily burden of unending song,

And search for wreaths the olive's rifled bower:

The praise of Juno sounds from many a tongue,

Telling of Argos ' steeds, Mycenae 's gold.

For me stern Sparta forges no such spell,

No, nor Larissa's plain of richest mould,

As bright Albunea echoing from her cell.

O headlong Anio! O Tiburnian groves,

And orchards saturate with shifting streams!

Look how the clear fresh south from heaven removes

The tempest, nor with rain perpetual teems!

You too be wise, my Plancus: life's worst cloud

Will melt in air, by mellow wine allay'd,

Dwell you in camps, with glittering banners proud,

Or 'neath your Tibur 's canopy of shade.

When Teucer fled before his father's frown

From Salamis , they say his temples deep

He dipp'd in wine, then wreath'd with poplar crown,

And bade his comrades lay their grief to sleep:

“Where Fortune bears us, than my sire more kind,

There let us go, my own, my gallant crew.

'Tis Teucer leads, 'tis Teucer breathes the wind;

No more despair; Apollo's word is true.

Another Salamis in kindlier air

Shall yet arise. Hearts, that have borne with me

Worse buffets! drown today in wine your care;

To-morrow we recross the wide, wide sea!”

Lydia , by all above,

Why bear so hard on Sybaris , to ruin him with love?

What change has made him shun

The playing-ground, who once so well could bear the dust and sun?

Why does he never sit

On horseback in his company, nor with uneven bit

His Gallic courser tame?

Why dreads he yellow Tiber , as 'twould sully that fair frame?

Like poison loathes the oil,

His arms no longer black and blue with honourable toil,

He who erewhile was known

For quoit or javelin oft and oft beyond the limit thrown?

Why skulks he, as they say

Did Thetis' son before the dawn of Ilion 's fatal day,

For fear the manly dress

Should fling him into danger's arms, amid the

Lycian press?

See, how it stands, one pile of snow,

Soracte! 'neath the pressure yield

Its groaning woods; the torrents' flow

With clear sharp ice is all congeal'd.

Heap high the logs, and melt the cold,

Good Thaliarch; draw the wine we ask,

That mellower vintage, four-year-old,

From out the cellar'd Sabine cask.

The future trust with Jove; when he

Has still'd the warring tempests' roar

On the vex'd deep, the cypress-tree

And aged ash are rock'd no more.

O, ask not what the morn will bring,

But count as gain each day that chance

May give you; sport in life's young spring,

Nor scorn sweet love, nor merry dance,

While years are green, while sullen eld

Is distant. Now the walk, the game,

The whisper'd talk at sunset held,

Each in its hour, prefer their claim.

Sweet too the laugh, whose feign'd alarm

The hiding-place of beauty tells,

The token, ravish'd from the arm

Or finger, that but ill rebels.

Grandson of Atlas, wise of tongue,

O Mercury, whose wit could tame

Man's savage youth by power of song

And plastic game!

Thee sing I, herald of the sky,

Who gav'st the lyre its music sweet,

Hiding whate'er might please thine eye

In frolic cheat.

See, threatening thee, poor guileless child,

Apollo claims, in angry tone,

His cattle;—all at once he smiled,

His quiver gone.

Strong in thy guidance, Hector's sire

Escaped the Atridae, pass'd between

Thessalian tents and warders' fire,

Of all unseen,

Thou lay'st unspotted souls to rest;

Thy golden rod pale spectres know;

Blest power! by all thy brethren blest,

Above, below!

Ask not ('tis forbidden knowledge), what our destined term of years,

Mine and yours; nor scan the tables of your Babylonish seers.

Better far to bear the future, my Leuconoe, like the past,

Whether Jove has many winters yet to give, or this our last;

This , that makes the Tyrrhene billows spend their strength against the shore.

Strain your wine and prove your wisdom; life is short; should hope be more?

In the moment of our talking, envious time has ebb'd away.

Seize the present; trust tomorrow e'en as little as you may.

What man, what hero, Clio sweet,

On harp or flute wilt thou proclaim?

What god shall echo's voice repeat

In mocking game

To Helicon 's sequester'd shade,

Or Pindus, or on Haemus chill,

Where once the hurrying woods obey'd

The minstrel's will,

Who, by his mother's gift of song,

Held the fleet stream, the rapid breeze,

And led with blandishment along

The listening trees?

Whom praise we first? the sire on high,

Who gods and men unerring guides,

Who rules the sea, the earth, the sky,

Their times and tides.

No mightier birth may he beget;

No like, no second has he known;

Yet nearest to her sire's is set

Minerva 's throne.

Nor yet shall Bacchus pass unsaid,

Bold warrior, nor the virgin foe

Of savage beasts, nor Phoebus, dread

With deadly bow.

Alcides too shall be my theme,

And Leda's twins, for horses he,

He famed for boxing; soon as gleam

Their stars at sea,

The lash'd spray trickles from the steep,

The wind sinks down, the storm-cloud flies,

The threatening billow on the deep

Obedient lies.

Shall now Quirinus take his turn,

Or quiet Numa , or the state

Proud Tarquin held, or Cato stern,

By death made great?

Ay, Regulus and the Scaurian name,

And Paullus, who at Cannae gave

His glorious soul, fair record claim,

For all were brave.

Thee, Furius, and Fabricius, thee,

Rough Curius too, with untrimm'd beard,

Your sires' transmitted poverty

To conquest rear'd.

Marcellus ' fame, its up-growth hid,

Springs like a tree; great Julius ' light

Shines, like the radiant moon amid

The lamps of night.

Dread Sire and Guardian of man's race,

To thee, O Jove, the Fates assign

Our Caesar's charge; his power and place

Be next to thine.

Whether the Parthian, threatening Rome ,

His eagles scatter to the wind.

Or follow to their eastern home

Cathay and Ind,

Thy second let him rule below

Thy car shall shake the realms above;

Thy vengeful bolts shall overthrow

Each guilty grove.

Telephus—you praise him still,

His waxen arms, his rosy-tinted neck;

Ah! and all the while I thrill

With jealous pangs I cannot, cannot check

See, my colour comes and goes,

My poor heart flutters, Lydia , and the dew,

Down my cheek soft stealing, shows

What lingering torments rack me through and through.

Oh, 'tis agony te see

Those snowwhite shoulders scarr'd in drunken fray,

Or those ruby lips, where he

Has left strange marks, that show how rough his play!

Never, never look to find

A faithful heart in him whose rage can harm

Sweetest lips, which Venus kind

Has tinctured with her quintessential charm.

Happy, happy; happy they

Whose living love, untroubled by all strife,

Binds them till the last sad day,

Nor parts asunder but with parting life!

O luckless bark! new waves will force you back

To sea. O, haste to make the haven yours!

E'en now, a helpless wrack,

You drift, despoil'd of oars;

The Afric gale has dealt your mast a wound;

Your sailyards groan, nor can your keel sustain,

Till lash'd with cables round,

A more imperious main.

Your canvass hangs in ribbons, rent and torn;

No gods are left to pray to in fresh need.

A pine of Pontus born

Of noble forest breed,

You boast your name and lineage—madly blind

Can painted timbers quell a seaman's fear?

Beware! or else the wind

Makes you its mock and jeer.

Your trouble late made sick this heart of mine,

And still I love you, still am ill at ease.

O, shun the sea, where shine

The thick-sown Cyclades !

When the false swain was hurrying o'er the deep

His Spartan hostess in the Idaean bark,

Old Nereus laid the unwilling winds asleep,

That all to Fate might hark,

Speaking through him:—“Home in ill hour you take

A prize whom Greece shall claim with troops untold,

Leagued by an oath your marriage tie to break

And Priam's kingdom old.

Alas! what deaths you launch on Dardan realm!

What tolls are waiting, man and horse to tire!

See! Pallas trims her aegis and her helm,

Her chariot and her ire.

Vainly shall you; in Venus' favour strong,

Your tresses comb, and for your dames divide

On peaceful lyre the several parts of song;

Vainly in chamber hide

From spears and Gnossian arrows, barb'd with fate,

And battle's din, and Ajax in the chase

Unconquer'd; those adulterous locks, though late,

Shall gory dust deface.

Hark! 'tis the death-cry of your race! look back!

Ulysses comes, and Pylian Nestor grey;

See! Salaminian Teucer on your track,

And Sthenelus, in the fray

Versed, or with whip and rein, should need require,

No laggard. Merion too your eyes shall know

From far. Tydides, fiercer than his sire,

Pursues you, all aglow;

Him, as the stag forgets to graze for fright,

Seeing the wolf at distance in the glade,

And flies, high panting, you shall fly, despite

Boasts to your leman made.

What though Achilles' wrathful fleet postpone

The day of doom to Troy and Troy 's proud dames,

Her towers shall fall, the number'd winters flown,

Wrapp'd in Achaenan flames.”

O lovelier than the lovely dame

That bore you, sentence as you please

Those scurril verses, be it flame

Your vengeance craves, or Hadrian seas.

Not Cybele, nor he that haunts

Rich Pytho , worse the brain confounds,

Not Bacchus, nor the Corybants

Clash their loud gongs with fiercer sounds

Than savage wrath; nor sword nor spear

Appals it, no, nor ocean's frown,

Nor ravening fire, nor Jupiter

In hideous ruin crashing down.

Prometheus, forced, they say, to add

To his prime clay some favourite part

From every kind, took lion mad,

And lodged its gall in man's poor heart.

'Twas wrath that laid Thyestes low;

'Tis wrath that oft destruction calls

On cities, and invites the foe

To drive his plough o'er ruin'd walls.

Then calm your spirit; I can tell

How once, when youth in all my veins

Was glowing, blind with rage, I fell

On friend and foe in ribald strains.

Come, let me change my sour for sweet,

And smile complacent as before:

Hear me my palinode repeat,

And give me back your heart once more.

The pleasures of Lucretilis

Tempt Faunus from his Grecian seat;

He keeps my little goats in bliss

Apart from wind, and rain, and heat.

In safety rambling o'er the sward

For arbutes and for thyme they peer,

The ladies of the unfragrant lord,

Nor vipers, green with venom, fear,

Nor savage wolves, of Mars' own breed,

My Tyndaris , while Ustica 's dell

Is vocal with the silvan reed,

And music thrills the limestone fell.

Heaven is my guardian; heaven approves

A blameless life, by song made sweet;

Come hither, and the fields and groves

Their horn shall empty at your feet.

Here, shelter'd by a friendiy tree,

In Teian measures you shall sing

Bright Circe and Penelope,

Love-smitten both by one sharp sting.

Here shall you quaff beneath the shade

Sweet Lesbian draughts that injure none,

Nor fear lest Mars the realm invade

Of Semele's Thyonian son,

Lest Cyrus on a foe too weak

Lay the rude hand of wild excess,

His passion on your chaplet wreak,

Or spoil your undeserving dress.

Varus, are your trees in planting? put in none before the vine,

In the rich domain of Tibur , by the walls of Catilus;

There's a power above that hampers all that sober brains design,

And the troubles man is heir to thus are quell'd, and only thus.

Who can talk of want or warfare when the wine is in his head,

Not of thee, good father Bacchus, and of Venus fair and bright?

But should any dream of licence, there's a lesson may be read,

How 'twas wine that drove the Centaurs with the Lapithae to fight.

And the Thracians too may warn us; truth and falsehood, good and ill,

How they mix them, when the wine-god's hand is heavy on them laid!

Never, never, gracious Bacchus, may I move thee 'gainst thy will,

Or uncover what is hidden in the verdure of thy shade!

Silence thou thy savage cymbals, and the Berecyntine horn;

In their train Self-love still follows, dully, desperately blind,

And Vain-glory, towering upwards in its emptyheaded scorn,

And the Faith that keeps no secrets, with a window in its mind.

Cupid's mother, cruel dame,

And Semele's Theban boy, and Licence bold,

Bid me kindle into flame

This heart, by waning passion now left cold.

O, the charms of Glycera,

That hue, more dazzling than the Parian stone!

O, that sweet tormenting play,

That too fair face, that blinds when look'd upon!

Venus comes in all her might,

Quits Cyprus for my heart, nor lets me tell

Of the Parthian, bold in flight,

Nor Scythian hordes, nor aught that breaks her spell.

Heap the grassy altar up,

Bring vervain, boys, and sacred frankincense;

Fill the sacrificial cup;

A victim's blood will soothe her vehemence.

Not large my cups, nor rich my cheer,

This Sabine wine, which erst I seal'd,

That day the applauding theatre

Your welcome peal'd,

Dear knight Maecenas! as 'twere fain

That your paternal river's banks,

And Vatican , in sportive strain,

Should echo thanks.

For you Calenian grapes are press'd,

And Caecuban; these cups of mine

Falernum's bounty ne'er has bless'd,

Nor Formian vine.

Of Dian's praises, tender maidens, tell;

Of Cynthus' unshorn god, young striplings, sing;

And bright Latona , well

Beloved of Heaven's high king.

Sing her that streams and silvan foliage loves,

Whate'er on Algidus' chill brow is seen,

In Erymanthian groves

Dark-leaved, or Cragus green.

Sing Tempe too, glad youths, in strain as loud,

And Phoebus' birthplace, and that shoulder fair,

His golden quiver proud

And brother's lyre to bear.

His arm shall banish Hunger, Plague, and War

To Persia and to Britain 's coast, away

From Rome and Caesar far,

If you have zeal to pray.

No need of Moorish archer's craft

To guard the pure and stainless liver;

He wants not, Fuscus, poison'd shaft

To store his quiver,

Whether he traverse Libyan shoals,

Or Caucasus , forlorn and horrent,

Or lands where far Hydaspes rolls

His fabled torrent.

A wolf, while roaming trouble-free

In Sabine wood, as fancy led me,

Unarm'd I sang my Lalage,

Beheld, and fled me.

Dire monster! in her broad oak woods

Fierce Daunia fosters none such other,

Nor Juba 's land, of lion broods

The thirsty mother.

Place me where on the ice-bound plain

No tree is cheer'd by summer breezes,

Where Jove descends in sleety rain

Or sullen freezes;

Place me where none can live for heat,

'Neath Phoebus' very chariot plant me,

That smile so sweet, that voice so sweet,

Shall still enchant me.

You fly me, Chloe, as o'er trackless hills

A young fawn runs her timorous dam to find,

Whom empty terror thrills

Of woods and whispering wind.

Whether 'tis Spring's first shiver, faintly heard

Through the light leaves, or lizards in the brake

The rustling thorns have stirr'd,

Her heart, her knees, they quake.

Yet I, who chase you, no grim lion am,

No tiger fell, to crush you in my gripe:

Come, learn to leave your dam.

For lover's kisses ripe.

Why blush to let our tears unmeasured fall

For one so dear? Begin the mournful stave,

Melpomene, to whom the sire of all

Sweet voice with music gave.

And sleeps he then the heavy sleep of death,

Quintilius? Piety, twin sister dear

Of Justice! naked Truth! unsullied Faith!

When will ye find his peer?

By many a good man wept, Quintilius dies;

By none than you, my Virgil, trulier wept:

Devout in vain, you chide the faithless skies,

Asking your loan ill-kept.

No, though more suasive than the bard of Thrace

You swept the lyre that trees were fain to hear,

Ne'er should the blood revisit his pale face

Whom once with wand severe

Mercury has folded with the sons of night,

Untaught to prayer Fate's prison to unseal.

Ah, heavy grief! but patience makes more light

What sorrow may not heal.

The Muses love me: fear and grief,

The winds may blow them to the sea;

Who quail before the wintry chief

Of Scythia 's realm, is nought to me.

What cloud o'er Tiridates lowers,

I care not, I. O, nymph divine

Of virgin springs, with sunniest flowers

A chaplet for my Lamia twine,

Pimplea sweet! my praise were vain

Without thee. String this maiden lyre,

Attune for him the Lesbian strain,

O goddess, with thy sister quire!

What, fight with cups that should give joy?

'Tis barbarous; leave such savage ways

To Thracians. Bacchus, shamefaced boy,

Is blushing at your bloody frays.

The Median sabre! lights and wine!

Was stranger contrast ever seen?

Cease, cease this brawling, comrades mine,

And still upon your elbows lean.

Well, shall I take a toper's part

Of fierce Falernian? let our guest,

Megilla's brother, say what dart

Gave the death-wound that makes him blest.

He hesitates? no other hire

Shall tempt my sober brains. Whate'er

The goddess tames you, no base fire

She kindles; 'tis some gentle fair

Allures you still. Come, tell me truth,

And trust my honour—That the name?

That wild Charybdis yours? Poor youth!

O, you deserved a better flame!

What wizard, what Thessalian spell,

What god can save you, hamper'd thus?

To cope with this Chimaera fell

Would task another Pegasus.

The sea, the earth, the innumerable sand,

Archytas, thou couldst measure; now, alas!

A little dust on Matine shore has spann'd

That soaring spirit; vain it was to pass

The gates of heaven, and send thy soul in quest

O'er air's wide realms; for thou hadst yet to die.

Ay, dead is Pelops' father, heaven's own guest,

And old Tithonus, rapt from earth to sky,

And Minos, made the council-friend of Jove;

And Panthus' son has yielded up his breath

Once more, though down he pluck'd the shield, to prove

His prowess under Troy , and bade grim death

O'er skin and nerves alone exert its power,

Not he, you grant, in nature meanly read.

Yes, all “await the inevitable hour;”

The downward journey all one day must tread.

Some bleed, to glut the war-god's savage eyes;

Fate meets the sailor from the hungry brine;

Youth jostles age in funeral obsequies;

Each brow in turn is touch'd by Proserpine.

Me, too, Orion's mate, the Southern blast,

Whelm'd in deep death beneath the Illyrian wave.

But grudge not, sailor, of driven sand to cast

A handful on my head, that owns no grave.

So, though the eastern tempests loudly threat

Hesperia's main, may green Venusia 's crown

Be stripp'd, while you lie warm; may blessings yet

Stream from Tarentum 's guard, great Neptune, down,

And gracious Jove, into your open lap!

What! shrink you not from crime whose punishment

Falls on your innocent children? it may hap

Imperious Fate will make yourself repent.

My prayers shall reach the avengers of all wrong;

No expiations shall the curse unbind.

Great though your haste, I would not task you long;

Thrice sprinkle dust, then scud before the wind.

Your heart on Arab wealth is set,

Good Iccius: you would try your steel

On Saba 's kings, unconquerd yet,

And make the Mede your fetters feel.

Come, tell me what barbarian fair

Will serve you now, her bridegroom slain?

What page from court with essenced hair

Will tender you the bowl you drain,

Well skill'd to bend the Serian bow

His father carried? Who shall say

That rivers may not uphill flow,

And Tiber 's self return one day,

If you would change Panaetius' works,

That costly purchase, and the clan

Of Socrates, for shields and dirks,

Whom once we thought a saner man?

Come, Cnidian, Paphian Venus, come,

Thy well-beloved Cyprus spurn,

Haste, where for thee in Glycera's home

Sweet odours burn.

Bring too thy Cupid, glowing warm,

Graces and Nymphs, unzoned and free,

And Youth, that lacking thee lacks charm,

And Mercury.

What blessing shall the bard entreat

The god he hallows, as he pours

The winecup? Not the mounds of wheat

That load Sardinian threshing floors;

Not Indian gold or ivory—no,

Nor flocks that o'er Calabria stray,

Nor fields that Liris, still and slow,

Is eating, unperceived, away.

Let those whose fate allows them train

Calenum's vine; let trader bold

From golden cups rich liquor drain

For wares of Syria bought and sold,

Heaven's favourite, sooth, for thrice a year

He comes and goes across the brine

Undamaged. I in plenty here

On endives, mallows, succory dine.

O grant me, Phoebus, calm content,

Strength unimpaird, a mind entire,

Old age without dishonour spent,

Nor unbefriended by the lyre!

They call;—if aught in shady dell

We twain have warbled, to remain

Long months or years, now breathe, my shell,

A Roman strain,

Thou, strung by Lesbos ' minstrel hand,

The bard, who 'mid the clash of steel,

Or haply mooring to the strand

His batter'd keel,

Of Bacchus and the Muses sung,

And Cupid, still at Venus' side,

And Lycus, beautiful and young,

Dark-hair'd, dark-eyed.

O sweetest lyre, to Phoebus dear,

Delight of Jove's high festival,

Blest balm in trouble, hail and hear

Whene'er I call!

What, Albius! why this passionate despair

For cruel Glycera? why melt your voice

In dolorous strains, because the perjured fair

Has made a younger choice?

See, narrow-brow'd Lycoris, how she glows

For Cyrus! Cyrus turns away his head

To Pholoe's frown; but sooner gentle roes

Apulian wolves shall wed,

Than Pholoe to so mean a conqueror strike:

So Venus wills it; 'neath her brazen yoke

She loves to couple forms and minds unlike,

All for a heartless joke.

For me sweet Love had forged a milder spell;

But Myrtale still kept me her fond slave,

More stormy she than the tempestuous swell

That crests Calabria 's wave.

My prayers were scant, my offerings few,

While witless wisdom fool'd my mind;

But now I trim my sails anew,

And trace the course I left behind.

For lo! the sire of heaven on high,

By whose fierce bolts the clouds are riven,

Today through an unclouded sky

His thundering steeds and car has driven.

E'en now dull earth and wandering floods,

And Atlas' limitary range,

And Styx, and Taenarus' dark abodes

Are reeling. He can lowliest change

And loftiest; bring the mighty down

And lift the weak; with whirring flight

Comes Fortune, plucks the monarch's crown,

And decks therewith some meaner wight.

Lady of Antium , grave and stern!

O Goddess, who canst lift the low

To high estate, and sudden turn

A triumph to a funeral show!

Thee the poor hind that tills the soil

Implores; their queen they own in thee,

Who in Bithynian vessel toil

Amid the vex'd Carpathian sea.

Thee Dacians fierce, and Scythian hordes,

Peoples and towns, and Rome , their head,

And mothers of barbarian lords,

And tyrants in their purple dread,

Lest, spurn'd by thee in scorn, should fall

The state's tall prop, lest crowds on fire

To arms, to arms! the loiterers call,

And thrones be tumbled in the mire.

Necessity precedes thee still

With hard fierce eyes and heavy tramp:

Her hand the nails and wedges fill,

The molten lead and stubborn clamp.

Hope, precious Truth in garb of white,

Attend thee still, nor quit thy side

When with changed robes thou tak'st thy flight

In anger from the homes of pride.

Then the false herd, the faithless fair,

Start backward; when the wine runs dry.

The jocund guests, too light to bear

An equal yoke, asunder fly.

O shield our Caesar as he goes

To furthest Britain , and his band,

Rome 's harvest! Send on Eastern foes

Their fear, and on the Red Sea strand!

O wounds that scarce have ceased to run!

O brother's blood! O iron time!

What horror have we left undone?

Has conscience shrunk from aught of crime?

What shrine has rapine held in awe?

What altar spared? O haste and beat

The blunted steel we yet may draw

On Arab and on Massagete!

Bid the lyre and cittern play;

Enkindle incense, shed the victim's gore;

Heaven has watch'd o'er Numida,

And brings him safe from far Hispania 's shore.

Now, returning, he bestows

On each dear comrade all the love he can;

But to Lamia most he owes,

By whose sweet side he grew from boy to man.

Note we in our calendar

This festal day with whitest mark from Crete :

Let it flow, the old wine-jar,

And ply to Salian time your restless feet.

Damalis tosses off her wine,

But Bassus sure must prove her match tonight.

Give us roses all to twine,

And parsley green, and lilies deathly white.

Every melting eye will rest

On Damalis' lovely face; but none may part

Damalis from our new-found guest;

She clings, and clings, like ivy, round his heart.

Now drink we deep, now featly tread

A measure; now before each shrine

With Salian feasts the table spread;

The time invites us, comrades mine.

'Twas shame to broach, before today,

The Caecuban, while Egypt 's dame

Threaten'd our power in dust to lay

And wrap the Capitol in flame,

Girt with her foul emasculate throng,

By Fortune's sweet new wine befool'd,

In hope's ungovern'd weakness strong

To hope for all; but soon she cool'd,

To see one ship from burning 'scape;

Great Caesar taught her dizzy brain,

Made mad by Mareotic grape,

To feel the sobering truth of pain,

And gave her chase from Italy ,

As after doves fierce falcons speed,

As hunters 'neath Haemonia's sky

Chase the tired hare, so might he lead

The fiend enchain'd; she sought to die

More nobly, nor with woman's dread

Quail'd at the steel, nor timorously

In her fleet ships to covert fled.

Amid her ruin'd halls she stood

Unblench'd, and fearless to the end

Grasp'd the fell snakes, that all her blood

Might with the cold black venom blend,

Death's purpose flushing in her face;

Nor to our ships the glory gave,

That she, no vulgar dame, should grace

A triumph, crownless, and a slave.

No Persian cumber, boy, for me;

I hate your garlands linden-plaited;

Leave winter's rose where on the tree

It hangs belated.

Wreath me plain myrtle; never think

Plain myrtle either's wear unfitting,

Yours as you wait, mine as I drink

In vine-bower sitting.

The broils that from Metellus date,

The secret springs, the dark intrigues,

The freaks of Fortune, and the great

Confederate in disastrous leagues,

And arms with uncleansed slaughter red,

A work of danger and distrust,

You treat, as one on fire should tread

Scarce hid by treacherous ashen crust.

Let Tragedy's stern muse be mute

Awhile; and when your order'd page

Has told Rome 's tale, that buskin'd foot

Again shall mount the Attic stage,

Pollio, the pale defendant's shield,

In deep debate the senate's stay,

The hero of Dalmatic field

By Triumph crown'd with deathless bay.

E'en now with trumpet's threatening blare

You thrill our ears; the clarion brays;

The lightnings of the armour scare

The steed, and daunt the rider's gaze.

Methinks I hear of leaders proud

With no uncomely dust distain'd,

And all the world by conquest bow'd,

And only Cato's soul unchain'd.

Yes, Juno and the powers on high

That left their Afric to its doom,

Have led the victors' progeny

As victims to Jugurtha's tomb.

What field, by Latian blood-drops fed,

Proclaims not the unnatural deeds

It buries, and the earthquake dread

Whose distant thunder shook the Medes?

What gulf, what river has not seen

Those sights of sorrow? nay, what sea

Has Daunian carnage yet left green?

What coast from Roman blood is free?

But pause, gay Muse, nor leave your play

Another Cean dirge to sing;

With me to Venus' bower away,

And there attune a lighter string.

The silver, Sallust, shows not fair

While buried in the greedy mine:

You love it not till moderate wear

Have given it shine.

Honour to Proculeius! he

To brethren play'd a father's part;

Fame shall embalm through years to be

That noble heart.

Who curbs a greedy soul may boast

More power than if his broad-based throne

Bridged Libya 's sea, and either coast

Were all his own.

Indulgence bids the dropsy grow;

Who fain would quench the palate's flame

Must rescue from the watery foe

The pale weak frame.

Phraates, throned where Cyrus sate,

May count for blest with vulgar herds,

But not with Virtue; soon or late

From lying words

She weans men's lips; for him she keeps

The crown, the purple, and the bays,

Who dares to look on treasure-heaps

With unblench'd gaze.

An equal mind, when storms o'ercloud,

Maintain, nor 'neath a brighter sky

Let pleasure make your heart too proud,

O Dellius, Dellius! sure te die,

Whether in gloom you spend each year,

Or through long holydays at ease

In grassy nook your spirit cheer

With old Falernian vintages,

Where poplar pale, and pine-tree high

Their hospitable shadows spread

Entwined, and panting waters try

To hurry down their zigzag bed.

Bring wine and scents, and roses' bloom,

Too brief, alas! to that sweet place;

While life, and fortune, and the loom

Of the Three Sisters yield you grace.

Soon must you leave the woods you buy,

Your villa, wash'd by Tiber 's flow,

Leave,—and your treasures, heap'd so high,

Your reckless heir will level low.

Whether from Argos ' founder born

In wealth you lived beneath the sun,

Or nursed in beggary and scorn,

You fall to Death, who pities none.

One way all travel; the dark urn

Shakes each man's lot, that soon or late

Will force him, hopeless of return,

On board the exile-ship of Fate.

Why, Xanthias, blush to own you love

Your slave? Briseis, long ago,

A captive, could Achilles move

With breast of snow.

Tecmessa's charms enslaved her lord,

Stout Ajax, heir of Telamon;

Atrides, in his pride, adored

The maid he won,

When Troy to Thessaly gave way,

And Hector's all too quick decease

Made Pergamus an easier prey

To wearied Greece .

What if, as auburn Phyllis' mate,

You graft yourself on regal stem?

Oh yes! be sure her sires were great;

She weeps for them.

Believe me, from no rascal scum

Your charmer sprang; so true a flame,

Such hate of greed, could never come

From vulgar dame.

With honest fervour I commend

Those lips, those eyes; you need not fear

A rival, hurrying on to end

His fortieth year.

Septimius, who with me would brave

Far Gades , and Cantabrian land

Untamed by Rome , and Moorish wave

That whirls the sand;

Fair Tibur , town of Argive kings,

There would I end my days serene,

At rest from seas and travellings,

And service seen.

Should angry Fate those wishes foil,

Then let me seek Galesus, sweet

To skin-clad sheep, and that rich soil,

The Spartan's seat.

O, what can match the green recess,

Whose honey not to Hybla yields,

Whose olives vie with those that bless

Venafrum 's fields?

Long springs, mild winters glad that spot

By Jove's good grace, and Aulon , dear

To fruitful Bacchus, envies not

Falernian cheer.

That spot, those happy heights desire

Our sojourn; there, when life shall end,

Your tear shall dew my yet warm pyre,

Your bard and friend.

O, oft with me in troublous time

Involved, when Brutus warr'd in Greece ,

Who gives you back to your own clime

And your own gods, a man of peace,

Pompey, the earliest friend I knew,

With whom I oft cut short the hours

With wine, my hair bright bathed in dew

Of Syrian oils, and wreathed with flowers?

With you I shared Philippi 's rout,

Unseemly parted from my shield,

When Valour fell, and warriors stout

Were tumbled on the inglorious field:

But I was saved by Mercury,

Wrapp'd in thick mist, yet trembling sore,

While you to that tempestuous sea

Were swept by battle's tide once more.

Come, pay to Jove the feast you owe;

Lay down those limbs, with warfare spent,

Beneath my laurel; nor be slow

To drain my cask; for you 'twas meant.

Lethe's true draught is Massic wine;

Fill high the goblet; pour out free

Rich streams of unguent. Who will twine

The hasty wreath from myrtle-tree

Or parsley? Whom will Venus seat

Chairman of cups? Are Bacchants sane?

Then I'll be sober. O, 'tis sweet

To fool, when friends come home again!

Had chastisement for perjured truth,

Barine, mark'd you with a curse—

Did one wry nail, or one black tooth,

But make you worse—

I'd trust you; but, when plighted lies

Have pledged you deepest, lovelier far

You sparkle forth, of all young eyes

The ruling star.

'Tis gain to mock your mother's bones,

And night's still signs, and all the sky,

And gods, that on their glorious thrones

Chill Death defy.

Ay, Venus smiles; the pure nymphs smile,

And Cupid, tyrant-lord of hearts,

Sharpening on bloody stone the while

His fiery darts.

New captives fill the nets you weave;

New slaves are bred; and those before,

Though oft they threaten, never leave

Your godless door.

The mother dreads you for her son,

The thrifty sire, the new-wed bride,

Lest, lured by you, her precious one

Should leave her side.

The rain, it rains not every day

On the soak'd meads; the Caspian main

Not always feels the unequal sway

Of storms, nor on Armenia 's plain,

Dear Valgius, lies the cold dull snow

Through all the year; nor northwinds keen

Upon Garganian oakwoods blow,

And strip the ashes of their green.

You still with tearful tones pursue

Your lost, lost Mystes; Hesper sees

Your passion when he brings the dew,

And when before the sun he flees.

Yet not for loved Antilochus

Grey Nestor wasted all his years

In grief; nor o'er young Troilus

His parents' and his sisters' tears

For ever flow'd. At length have done

With these soft sorrows; rather tell

Of Caesar's trophies newly won,

And hoar Niphates' icy fell,

And Medus' flood, 'mid conquer'd tribes

Rolling a less presumptuous tide,

And Scythians taught, as Rome prescribes,

Henceforth o'er narrower steppes to ride.

Licinius, trust a seaman's lore:

Steer not too boldly to the deep,

Nor, fearing storms, by treacherous shore

Too closely creep.

Who makes the golden mean his guide,

Shuns miser's cabin, foul and dark,

Shuns gilded roofs, where pomp and pride

Are envy's mark.

With fiercer blasts the pine's dim height

Is rock'd; proud towers with heavier fall

Crash to the ground; and thunders smite

The mountains tall.

In sadness hope, in gladness fear

'Gainst coming change will fortify

Your breast. The storms that Jupiter

Sweeps o'er the sky

He chases. Why should rain today

Bring rain tomorrow? Python's foe

Is pleased sometimes his lyre to play,

Nor bends his bow.

Be brave in trouble; meet distress

With dauntless front; but when the gale

Too prosperous blows, be wise no less,

And shorten sail.

O ask not what those sons of war,

Cantabrian, Scythian, each intend,

Disjoin'd from us by Hadria 's bar,

Nor puzzle, Quintius, how to spend

A life so simple. Youth removes,

And Beauty too; and hoar Decay

Drives out the wanton tribe of Loves

And Sleep, that came or night or day.

The sweet spring-flowers not always keep

Their bloom, nor moonlight shines the same

Each evening. Why with thoughts too deep

O'ertask a mind of mortal frame?

Why not, just thrown at careless ease

'Neath plane or pine, our locks of grey

Perfumed with Syrian essences

And wreathed with roses, while we may,

Lie drinking? Bacchus puts to shame

The cares that waste us. Where's the slave

To quench the fierce Falernian's flame

With water from the passing wave?

Who'll coax coy Lyde from her home?

Go, bid her take her ivory lyre,

The runaway, and haste to come,

Her wild hair bound with Spartan tire.

The weary war where fierce Numantia bled,

Fell Hannibal, the swoln Sicilian main

Purpled with Punic blood—not mine to wed

These to the lyre's soft strain,

Nor cruel Lapithae, nor, mad with wine,

Centaurs, nor, by Herculean arm o'ercome,

The earth-born youth, whose terrors dimm'd the shine

Of the resplendent dome

Of ancient Saturn. You, Maecenas, best

In pictured prose of Caesar's warrior feats

Will tell, and captive kings with haughty crest

Led through the Roman streets.

On me the Muse has laid her charge to tell

Of your Licymnia's voice, the lustrous hue

Of her bright eye, her heart that beats so well

To mutual passion true:

How nought she does but lends her added grace,

Whether she dance, or join in bantering play,

Or with soft arms the maiden choir embrace

On great Diana's day.

Say, would you change for all the wealth possest

By rich Achaemenes or Phrygia 's heir,

Or the full stores of Araby the blest,

One lock of her dear hair,

While to your burning lips she bends her neck,

Or with kind cruelty denies the due

She means you not to beg for, but to take,

Or snatches it from you?

Black day he chose for planting thee,

Accurst he rear'd thee from the ground,

The bane of children yet to be,

The scandal of the village round.

His father's throat the monster press'd

Beside, and on his hearthstone spilt,

I ween, the blood of midnight guest;

Black Colchian drugs, whate'er of guilt

Is hatch'd on earth, he dealt in all—

Who planted in my rural stead

Thee, fatal wood, thee, sure to fall

Upon thy blameless master's head.

The dangers of the hour! no thought

We give them; Punic seaman's fear

Is all of Bosporus , nor aught

Reeks he of pitfalls otherwhere;

The soldier fears the mask'd retreat

Of Parthia ; Parthia dreads the thrall

Of Rome ; but Death with noiseless feet

Has stolen and will steal on all.

How near dark Pluto's court I stood,

And Aeacus' judicial throne,

The blest seclusion of the good,

And Sappho, with sweet lyric moan

Bewailing her ungentle sex,

And thee, Alcaeus, louder far

Chanting thy tale of woful wrecks,

Of woful exile, woful war!

In sacred awe the silent dead

Attend on each: but when the song

Of combat tells and tyrants fled,

Keen ears, press'd shoulders, closer throng.

What marvel, when at those sweet airs

The hundred-headed beast spell-bound

Each black ear droops, and Furies' hairs

Uncoil their serpents at the sound?

Prometheus too and Pelops' sire

In listening lose the sense of woe;

Orion hearkens to the lyre,

And lets the lynx and lion go.

Ah, Postumus! they fleet away,

Our years, nor piety one hour

Can win from wrinkles and decay,

And Death's indomitable power;

Not though three hundred bullocks flame

Each year, to soothe the tearless king

Who holds huge Geryon's triple frame

And Tityos in his watery ring,

That circling flood, which all must stem,

Who eat the fruits that Nature yields,

Wearers of haughtiest diadem,

Or humblest tillers of the fields.

In vain we shun war's contact red

Or storm-tost spray of Hadrian main:

In vain, the season through, we dread

For our frail lives Scirocco's bane.

Cocytus' black and stagnant ooze

Must welcome you, and Danaus' seed

Ill-famed, and ancient Sisyphus

To never-ending toil decreed.

Your land, your house, your lovely bride

Must lose you; of your cherish'd trees

None to its fleeting master's side

Will cleave, but those sad cypresses.

Your heir, a larger soul, will drain

The hundred-padlock'd Caecuban,

And richer spilth the pavement stain

Than e'er at pontiff's supper ran.

Few roods of ground the piles we raise

Will leave to plough; ponds wider spread

Than Lucrine lake will meet the gaze

On every side; the plane unwed

Will top the elm; the violet-bed,

The myrtle, each delicious sweet,

On olive-grounds their scent will shed,

Where once were fruit-trees yielding meat;

Thick bays will screen the midday range

Of fiercest suns. Not such the rule

Of Romulus, and Cato sage,

And all the bearded, good old school.

Each Roman's wealth was little worth,

His country's much; no colonnade

For private pleasance wooed the North

With cool “prolixity of shade.”

None might the casual sod disdain

To roof his home; a town alone,

At public charge, a sacred fane

Were honour'd with the pomp of stone.

For ease, in wide Aegean caught,

The sailor prays, when clouds are hiding

The moon, nor shines of starlight aught

For seaman's guiding:

For ease the Mede , with quiver gay:

For ease rude Thrace , in battle cruel:

Can purple buy it, Grosphus? Nay,

Nor gold, nor jewel.

No pomp, no lictor clears the way

'Mid rabble-routs of troublous feelings,

Nor quells the cares that sport and play

Round gilded ceilings.

More happy he whose modest board

His father's well-worn silver brightens;

No fear, nor lust for sordid hoard,

His light sleep frightens.

Why bend our bows of little span?

Why change our homes for regions under

Another sun? What exiled man

From self can sunder?

Care climbs the bark, and trims the sail,

Curst fiend! nor troops of horse can 'scape her,

More swift than stag, more swift than gale

That drives the vapour.

Blest in the present, look not forth

On ills beyond, but soothe each bitter

With slow, calm smile. No suns on earth

Unclouded glitter.

Achilles' light was quench'd at noon;

A long decay Tithonus minish'd;

My hours, it may be, yet will run

When yours are flnish'd.

For you Sicilian heifers low,

Bleat countless flocks; for you are neighing

Proud coursers; Afric purples glow

For your arraying

With double dyes; a small domain,

The soul that breathed in Grecian harping,

My portion these; and high disdain

Of ribald carping.

Why rend my heart with that sad sigh?

It cannot please the gods or me

That you, Maecenas, first should die,

My pillar of prosperity.

Ah! should I lose one half my soul

Untimely, can the other stay

Behind it? Life that is not whole,

Is that as sweet? The self-same day

Shall crush us twain; no idle oath

Has Horace sworn; whene'er you go,

We both will travel, travel both

The last dark journey down below.

No, not Chimaera's fiery breath,

Nor Gyas, could he rise again,

Shall part us; Justice, strong as death,

So wills it; so the Fates ordain.

Whether 'twas Libra saw me born

Or angry Scorpio, lord malign

Of natal hour, or Capricorn,

The tyrant of the western brine,

Our planets sure with concord strange

Are blended. You by Jove's blest power

Were snatch'd from out the baleful range

Of Saturn, and the evil hour

Was stay'd, when rapturous benches full

Three times the auspicious thunder peal'd;

Me the curst trunk, that smote my skull,

Had slain; but Faunus, strong to shield

The friends of Mercury, check'd the blow

In mid descent. Be sure to pay

The victims and the fane you owe;

Your bard a humbler lamb will slay.

Carven ivory have I none

No golden cornice in my dwelling shines;

Pillars choice of Libyan stone

Upbear no architrave from Attic mines;

'Twas not mine to enter in

To Attalus' broad realms, an unknown heir,

Nor for me fair clients spin

Laconian purples for their patron's wear.

Truth is mine, and Genius mine;

The rich man comes, and knocks at my low door:

Favour'd thus, I ne'er repine,

Nor weary out indulgent Heaven for more:

In my Sabine homestead blest,

Why should I further tax a generous friend?

Suns are hurrying suns a-west,

And newborn moons make speed to meet their end.

You have hands to square and hew

Vast marble-blocks, hard on your day of doom,

Ever building mansions new,

Nor thinking of the mansion of the tomb.

Now you press on ocean's bound,

Where waves on Baiae beat, as earth were scant;

Now absorb your neighbour's ground,

And tear his landmarks up, your own to plant.

Hedges set round clients' farms

Your avarice tramples; see, the outcasts fly,

Wife and husband, in their arms

Their fathers' gods, their squalid family.

Yet no hall that wealth e'er plann'd

Waits you more surely than the wider room

Traced by Death's yet greedier hand.

Why strain so far? you cannot leap the tomb.

Earth removes the impartial sod

Alike for beggar and for monarch's child:

Nor the slave of Hell's dark god

Convey'd Prometheus back, with bribe beguiled.

Pelops he and Pelops' sire

Holds, spite of pride, in close captivity;

Beggars, who of labour tire,

Call'd or uncall'd, he hears and sets them free.

Bacchus I saw in mountain glades

Retired (believe it, after years!)

Teaching his strains to Dryad maids,

While goat-hoof'd satyrs prick'd their ears.

Evoe! my eyes with terror glare;

My heart is revelling with the god;

'Tis madness! Evoe! spare, O spare,

Dread wielder of the ivied rod!

Yes, I may sing the Thyiad crew,

The stream of wine, the sparkling rills

That run with milk, and honey-dew

That from the hollow trunk distils;

And I may sing thy consort's crown,

New set in heaven, and Pentheus' hall

With ruthless ruin thundering down,

And proud Lycurgus' funeral.

Thou turn'st the rivers, thou the sea;

Thou, on far summits, moist with wine,

Thy Bacchants' tresses harmlessly

Dost knot with living serpent-twine.

Thou, when the giants, threatening wrack,

Were clambering up Jove's citadel,

Didst hurl o'erweening Rhoetus back,

In tooth and claw a lion fell.

Who knew thy feats in dance and play

Deem'd thee belike for war's rough game

Unmeet: but peace and battle-fray

Found thee, their centre, still the same.

Grim Cerberus wagg'd his tail to see

Thy golden horn, nor dreamd of wrong.

But gently fawning, follow'd thee,

And lick'd thy feet with triple tongue.

No vulgar wing, nor weakly plied,

Shall bear me through the liquid sky;

A two-form'd bard, no more to bide

Within the range of envy's eye

'Mid haunts of men. I, all ungraced

By gentle blood, I, whom you call

Your friend, Maecenas, shall not taste

Of death, nor chafe in Lethe's thrall.

E'en now a rougher skin expands

Along my legs: above I change

To a white bird; and o'er my hands

And shoulders grows a plumage strange:

Fleeter than Icarus, see me float

O'er Bosporus, singing as I go,

And o'er Gaetulian sands remote,

And Hyperborean fields of snow;

By Dacian horde, that masks its fear

Of Marsic steel, shall I be known,

And furthest Scythian: Spain shall hear

My warbling, and the banks of Rhone .

No dirges for my fancied death;

No weak lament, no mournful stave;

All clamorous grief were waste of breath,

And vain the tribute of a grave.

Bid the unhallow'd crowd avaunt!

Keep holy silence; strains unknown

Till now, the Muses' hierophant,

I sing to youths and maids alone.

Kings o'er their flocks the sceptre wield;

E'en kings beneath Jove's sceptre bow:

Victor in giant battle-field,

He moves all nature with his brow.

This man his planted walks extends

Beyond his peers; an older name

One to the people's choice commends;

One boasts a more unsullied fame;

One plumes him on a larger crowd

Of clients. What are great or small?

Death takes the mean man with the proud;

The fatal urn has room for all.

When guilty Pomp the drawn sword sees

Hung o'er her, richest feasts in vain

Strain their sweet juice her taste to please;

No lutes, no singing birds again

Will bring her sleep. Sleep knows no pride;

It scorns not cots of village hinds,

Nor shadow-trembling river-side,

Nor Tempe , stirr'd by western winds.

Who, having competence, has all,

The tumult of the sea defies,

Nor fears Arcturus' angry fall,

Nor fears the Kid-star's sullen rise,

Though hail-storms on the vineyard beat,

Though crops deceive, though trees complain,

One while of showers, one while of heat,

One while of winter's barbarous reign.

Fish feel the narrowing of the main

From sunken piles, while on the strand

Contractors with their busy train

Let down huge stones, and lords of land

Affect the sea: but fierce Alarm

Can clamber to the master's side:

Black Cares can up ihe galley swarm,

And close behind the horseman ride.

If Phrygian marbles soothe not pain,

Nor star-bright purple's costliest wear,

Nor vines of true Falernian strain,

Nor Achaemenian spices rare,

Why with rich gate and pillard range

Upbuild new mansions, twice as high,

Or why my Sabine vale exchange

For more laborious luxury?

To suffer hardness with good cheer,

In sternest school of warfare bred,

Our youth should learn; let steed and spear

Make him one day the Parthian's dread;

Cold skies, keen perils, brace his life.

Methinks I see from rampired town

Some battling tyrant's matron wife,

Some maiden, look in terror down,—

“Ah, my dear lord, untrain'd in war!

O tempt not the infuriate mood

Of that fell lion I see! from far

He plunges through a tide of blood!“

What joy, for fatherland to die!

Death's darts e'en flying feet o'ertake,

Nor spare a recreant chivalry,

A back that cowers, or loins that quake.

True Virtue never knows defeat:

Her robes she keeps unsullied still,

Nor takes, nor quits, her curule seat

To please a people's veering will.

True Virtue opens heaven to worth:

She makes the way she does not find:

The vulgar crowd, the humid earth,

Her soaring pinion leaves behind.

Seal'd lips have blessings sure to come:

Who drags Eleusis ' rite today,

That man shall never share my home,

Or join my voyage: roofs give way

And boats are wreck'd: true men and thieves

Neglected Justice oft confounds:

Though Vengeance halt, she seldom leaves

The wretch whose flying steps she hounds.

The man of firm and righteous will,

No rabble, clamorous for the wrong,

No tyrant's brow, whose frown may kill,

Can shake the strength that makes him strong:

Not winds, that chafe the sea they sway,

Nor Jove's right hand, with lightning red:

Should Nature's pillar'd frame give way,

That wreck would strike one fearless head.

Pollux and roving Hercules

Thus won their way to Heaven's proud steep,

'Mid whom Augustus, couch'd at ease,

Dyes his red lips with nectar deep.

For this, great Bacchus , tigers drew

Thy glorious car, untaught to slave

In harness: thus Quirinus flew

On Mars ' wing'd steeds from Acheron's wave,

When Juno spoke with Heaven's assent:

“O Ilium , Ilium , wretched town!

The judge accurst, incontinent,

And stranger dame have dragg'd thee down.

Pallas and I, since Priam's sire

Denied the gods his pledged reward,

Had doom'd them all to sword and fire,

The people and their perjured lord.

No more the adulterous guest can charm

The Spartan queen: the house forsworn

No more repels by Hector's arm

My warriors, baffled and outworn:

Hush'd is the war our strife made long:

I welcome now, my hatred o'er,

A grandson in the child of wrong,

Him whom the Trojan priestess bore.

Receive him, Mars! the gates of flame

May open: let him taste forgiven

The nectar, and enrol his name

Among the peaceful ranks of Heaven.

Let the wide waters sever still

Ilium and Rome , the exiled race

May reign and prosper where they will:

So but in Paris ' burial-place

The cattle sport, the wild beasts hide

Their cubs, the Capitol may stand

All bright, and Rome in warlike pride

O'er Media stretch a conqueror's hand.

Aye, let her scatter far and wide

Her terror, where tbe land-lock'd waves

Europe from Afric's shore divide,

Where swelling Nile the corn-field laves—

Of strength more potent to disdain

Hid gold, best buried in the mine,

Than gather it with hand profane,

That for man's greed would rob a shrine.

Whate'er the bound to earth ordain'd,

There let her reach the arm of power,

Travelling, where raves the fire unrein'd,

And where the storm-cloud and the shower.

Yet, warlike Roman, know thy doom,

Nor, drunken with a conqueror's joy,

Or blind with duteous zeal, presume

To build again ancestral Troy .

Should Troy revive to hateful life,

Her star again should set in gore,

While I, Jove's sister and his wife,

To victory led my host once more.

Though Phoebus thrice in brazen mail

Should case her towers, they thrice should fall,

Storm'd by my Greeks: thrice wives should wail

Husband and son, themselves in thrall.”—

Such thunders from the lyre of love!

Back, wayward Muse! refrain, refrain

To tell the talk of gods above,

And dwarf high themes in puny strain.

Come down, Calliope, from above:

Breathe on the pipe a strain of fire:

Or if a graver note thou love,

With Phoebus' cittern and his lyre.

You hear her? or is this the play

Of fond illusion? Hark! meseems

Through gardens of the good I stray,

'Mid murmuring gales and purling streams.

Me, as I lay on Vultur's steep,

A truant past Apulia 's bound,

O'ertired, poor child, with play and sleep,

With living green the stock-doves crown'd—

A legend, nay, a miracle,

By Acherontia's nestlings told,

By all in Bantine glade that dwell,

Or till the rich Forentan mould.

“Bears, vipers, spared him as he lay,

The sacred garland deck'd his hair,

The myrtle blended with the bay:

The child's inspired: the gods were there.”

Your grace, sweet Muses, shields me still

On Sabine heights, or lets me range

Where cool Praeneste , Tibur 's hill,

Or liquid Baiae proffers change.

Me to your springs, your dances true,

Philippi bore not to the ground,

Nor the doom'd tree in falling slew,

Nor billowy Palinurus drown'd.

Grant me your presence, blithe and fain

Mad Bosporus shall my bark explore;

My foot shall tread the sandy plain

That glows beside Assyria's shore;

'Mid Briton tribes, the stranger's foe,

And Spaniards, drunk with horses' blood,

And quiver'd Scythians, will I go

Unharm'd, and look on Tanais ' flood.

When Caesar's self in peaceful town

The weary veteran's home has made,

You bid him lay his helmet down

And rest in your Pierian shade.

Mild thoughts you plant, and joy to see

Mild thoughts take root. The nations know

How with descending thunder he

The impious Titans hurl'd below,

Who rules dull earth and stormy seas,

And towns of men, and realms of pain,

And gods, and mortal companies,

Alone, impartial in his reign.

Yet Jove had fear'd the giant rush,

Their upraised arms, their port of pride,

And the twin brethren bent to push

Huge Pelion up Olympus ' side.

But Typhon, Mimas, what could these,

Or what Porphyrion's stalwart scorn,

Rhoetus, or he whose spears were trees,

Enceladus, from earth uptorn,

As on they rush'd in mad career

'Gainst Pallas' shield? Here met the foe

Fierce Vulcan , queenly Juno here,

And he who ne'er shall quit his bow,

Who laves in clear Castalian flood

His locks, and loves the leafy growth

Of Lycia next his native wood,

The Delian and the Pataran both.

Strength, mindless, falls by its own weight;

Strength, mix'd with mind, is made more strong

By the just gods, who surely hate

The strength whose thoughts are set on wrong.

Let hundred-handed Gyas bear

His witness, and Orion known

Tempter of Dian, chaste and fair,

By Dian's maiden dart o'erthrown.

Hurl'd on the monstrous shapes she bred,

Earth groans, and mourns her children thrust

To Orcus; Aetna 's weight of lead

Keeps down the fire that breaks its crust;

Still sits the bird on Tityos' breast,

The warder of Unlawful love;

Still suffers lewd Pirithous, prest

By massive chains no hand may move.

Jove rules in heaven, his thunder shows;

Henceforth Augustus earth shall own

Her present god, now Briton foes

And Persians bow before his throne.

Has Crassus' soldier ta'en to wife

A base barbarian, and grown grey

(Woe, for a nation's tainted life!)

Earning his foemen-kinsmen's pay,

His king, forsooth, a Mede , his sire

A Marsian? can he name forget,

Gown, sacred shield, undying fire,

And Jove and Rome are standing yet?

'Twas this that Regulus foresaw,

What time he spurn'd the foul disgrace

Of peace, whose precedent would draw

Destruction on an unborn race,

Should aught but death the prisoner's chain

Unrivet. “I have seen,” he said,

“ Rome 's eagle in a Punic fane,

And armour, ne'er a blood-drop shed,

Stripp'd from the soldier; I have seen

Free sons of Rome with arms fast tied;

The fields we spoil'd with corn are green,

And Carthage opes her portals wide.

The warrior, sure, redeem'd by gold,

Will fight the bolder! Aye, you heap

On baseness loss. The hues of old

Revisit not the wool we steep;

And genuine worth, expell'd by fear,

Returns not to the worthless slave.

Break but her meshes, will the deer

Assail you? then will he be brave

Who once to faithless foes has knelt;

Yes, Carthage yet his spear will fly,

Who with bound arms the cord has felt,

The coward, and has fear'd to die.

He knows not, he, how life is won;

Thinks war, like peace, a thing of trade!

Great art thou, Carthage ! mate the sun,

While Italy in dust is laid!”

His wife's pure kiss he waved aside,

And prattling boys, as one disgraced,

They tell us, and with manly pride

Stern on the ground his visage placed.

With counsel thus ne'er else aread

He nerved the fathers' weak intent,

And, girt by friends that mourn'd him, sped

Into illustrious banishment.

Well witting what the torturer's art

Design'd him, with like unconcern

The press of kin he push'd apart

And crowds encumbering his return,

As though, some tedious business o'er

Of clients' court, his journey lay

Towards Venafrum 's grassy floor,

Or Sparta-built Tarentum 's bay.

Your fathers' guilt you still must pay,

Till, Roman, you restore each shrine,

Each temple, 'mouldering in decay,

And smoke-grimed statue, scarce divine.

Revering Heaven, you rule below;

Be that your base, your coping still;

'Tis Heaven neglected bids o'erflow

The measure of Italian ill.

Now Pacorus and Monaeses twice

Have given our unblest arms the foil;

Their necklaces, of mean device;

Smiling they deck with Roman spoil.

Our city, torn by faction's throes,

Dacian and Ethiop well-nigh razed,

These with their dreadful navy, those

For archer-prowess rather praised.

An evil age erewhile debased

The marriage-bed, the race, the home;

Thence rose the flood whose waters waste

The nation and the name of Rome .

Not such their birth, who stain'd for us

The sea with Punic carnage red,

Smote Pyrrhus, smote Antiochus,

And Hannibal, the Roman's dread.

Theirs was a hardy soldier-brood,

Inured all day the land to till

With Sabine spade, then shoulder wood

Hewn at a stern old mother's will,

When sunset lengthen'd from each height

The shadows, and unyoked the steer,

Restoring in its westward flight

The hour to toilworn travail dear.

What has not cankering Time made worse?

Viler than grandsires, sires beget

Ourselves, yet baser, soon to curse

The world with offspring baser yet.

Why weep for him whom sweet Favonian airs

Will waft next spring, Asteria, back to you,

Rich with Bithynia 's wares,

A lover fond and true,

Your Gyges? He, detain'd by stormy stress

At Oricum, about the Goat-star's rise,

Cold, wakeful, comfortless,

The long night weeping lies.

Meantime his lovesick hostess' messenger

Talks of the flames that waste poor Chloe's heart

(Flames lit for you, not her!)

With a besieger's art;

Shows how a treacherous woman's lying breath

Once on a time on trustful Proetus won

To doom to early death

Too chaste Bellerophon;

Warns him of Peleus' peril, all but slain

For virtuous scorn of fair Hippolyta,

And tells again each tale

That e'er led heart astray.

In vain; for deafer than Icarian seas

He hears, untainted yet. But, lady fair,

What if Enipeus please

Your listless eye? beware!

Though true it be that none with surer seat

O'er Mars's grassy turf is seen to ride,

Nor any swims so fleet

Adown the Tuscan tide,

Yet keep each evening door and window barr'd;

Look not abroad when music strikes up shrill,

And though he call you hard,

Remain obdurate still.

The first of March! a man unwed!

What can these flowers, this censer mean?

Or what these embers, glowing red

On sods of green?

You ask, in either language skill'd!

A feast I vow'd to Bacchus free,

A white he-goat, when all but kill'd

By falling tree.

So, when that holyday comes round,

It sees me still the rosin clear

From this my wine-jar, first embrown'd

In Tullus' year.

Come, crush one hundred cups for life

Preserved, Maecenas; keep till day

The candles lit; let noise and strife

Be far away.

Lay down that load of state-concern;

The Dacian hosts are all o'erthrown;

The Mede , that sought our overturn,

Now seeks his own;

A servant now, our ancient foe,

The Spaniard, wears at last our chain;

The Scythian half unbends his bow

And quits the plain.

Then fret not lest the state should ail;

A private man such thoughts may spare;

Enjoy the present hour's regale,

And banish care.

While I had power to bless you,

Nor any round that neck his arms did fling

More privileged to caress you,

Happier was Horace than the Persian king.

While you for none were pining

Sorer, nor Lydia after Chloe came,

Lydia, her peers outshining,

Might match her own with Ilia's Roman fame.

Now Chloe is my treasure,

Whose voice, whose touch, can make sweet music flow:

For her I'd die with pleasure,

Would Fate but spare the dear survivor so.

I love my own fond lover,

Young Calais , son of Thurian Ornytus:

For him I'd die twice over,

Would Fate but spare the sweet survivor thus.

What now, if Love returning

Should pair us 'neath his brazen yoke once more,

And, bright-hair'd Chloe spurning,

Horace to off-cast Lydia ope his door?

Though he is fairer, milder,

Than starlight, you lighter than bark of tree,

Than stormy Hadria wilder,

With you to live, to die, were bliss for me.

Ah Lyce! though your drink were Tanais ,

Your husband some rude savage, you would weep

To leave me shivering, on a night like this,

Where storms their watches keep.

Hark! how your door is creaking! how the grove

In your fair courtyard, while the wild winds blow,

Wails in accord! with what transparence Jove

Is glazing the driven snow!

Cease that proud temper: Venus loves it not:

The rope may break, the wheel may backward turn:

Begetting you, no Tuscan sire begot

Penelope the stern.

O, though no gift, no “prevalence of prayer,”

Nor lovers' paleness deep as violet,

Nor husband, smit with a Pierian fair,

Move you, have pity yet!

O harder e'en than toughest heart of oak,

Deafer than uncharm'd snake to suppliant moans!

This side, I warn you, will not always brook

Rain-water and cold stones.

Come, Mercury, by whose minstrel spell

Amphion raised the Theban stones,

Come, with thy seven sweet strings, my shell,

Thy “diverse tones,”

Nor vocal once nor pleasant, now

To rich man's board and temple dear:

Put forth thy power, till Lyde bow

Her stubborn ear.

She, like a three-year colt unbroke,

Is frisking o'er the spacious plain,

Too shy to bear a lover's yoke,

A husband's rein.

The wood, the tiger, at thy call

Have follow'd: thou caust rivers stay:

The monstrous guard of Pluto's hall

To thee gave way,

Grim Cerberus, round whose Gorgon head

A hundred snakes are hissing death,

Whose triple jaws black venom shed,

And sickening breath.

Ixion too and Tityos smooth'd

Their rugged brows: the urn stood dry

One hour, while Danaus' maids were sooth'd

With minstrelsy.

Let Lyde hear those maidens' guilt,

Their famous doom, the ceaseless drain

Of outpour'd water, ever spilt,

And all the pain

Reserved for sinners, e'en when dead:

Those impious hands, (could crime do more?)

Those impious hands had hearts to shed

Their bridegrooms' gore!

One only, true to Hymen's flame,

Was traitress to her sire forsworn:

That splendid falsehood lights her name

Through times unborn.

“Wake!” to her youthful spouse she cried,

“Wake! or you yet may sleep too well:

Fly—from the father of your bride,

Her sisters fell:

They, as she-lions bullocks rend,

Tear each her victim: I, less hard

Than these, will slay you not, poor friend,

Nor hold in ward:

Me let my sire in fetters lay

For mercy to my husband shown:

Me let him ship far hence away,

To climes unknown.

Go; speed your flight o'er land and wave,

While Night and Venus shield you; go

Be blest: and on my tomb engrave

This tale of woe.”

How unhappy are the maidens who with Cupid may not play,

Who may never touch the wine-cup, but must tremble all the day

At an uncle, and the scourging of his tongue!

Neobule, there's a robber takes your needle and your thread,

Lets the lessons of Minerva run no longer in your head;

It is Hebrus , the athletic and the young!

O, to see him when anointed he is plunging in the flood!

What a seat he has on horseback! was Bellerophon's as good?

As a boxer, as a runner, past compare!

When the deer are flying blindly all the open country o'er,

He can aim and he can hit them; he can steal upon the boar,

As it couches in the thicket unaware.

Bandusia's fount, in clearness crystalline,

O worthy of the wine, the flowers we vow!

Tomorrow shall be thine

A kid, whose crescent brow

Is sprouting all for love and victory.

In vain: his warm red blood, so early stirr'd.

Thy gelid stream shall dye,

Child of the wanton herd.

Thee the fierce Sirian star, to madness fired,

Forbears to touch: sweet cool thy waters yield

To ox with ploughing tired,

And lazy sheep afield.

Thou too one day shalt win proud eminence

'Mid honour'd founts, while I the ilex sing

Crowning the cavern, whence

Thy babbling wavelets spring.

Our Hercules, they told us, Rome ,

Had sought the laurel Death bestows:

Now Glory brings him conqueror home

From Spaniard foes.

Proud of her spouse, the imperial fair

Must thank the gods that shield from death;

His sister too:—let matrons wear

The suppliant wreath

For daughters and for sons restored:

Ye youths and damsels newly wed,

Let decent awe restrain each word

Best left unsaid.

This day, true holyday to me,

Shall banish care: I will not fear

Rude broils or bloody death to see,

While Caesar's here.

Quick, boy, the chaplets and the nard,

And wine, that knew the Marsian war,

If roving Spartacus have spared

A single jar.

And bid Neaera come and trill,

Her bright locks bound with careless art:

If her rough porter cross your will,

Why then depart.

Soon palls the taste for noise and fray,

When hair is white and leaves are sere:

How had I fired in life's warm May,

In Plancus' year!

Wife of Ibycus the poor,

Let aged scandals have at length their bound:

Give your graceless doings o'er,

Ripe as you are for going underground.

You the maidens' dance to lead,

And cast your gloom upon those beaming stars!

Daughter Pholoe may succeed,

But mother Chloris what she touches mars.

Young men's homes your daughter storms,

Like Thyiad, madden'd by the cymbals' beat:

Nothus' love her bosom warms:

She gambols like a fawn with silver feet.

Yours should be the wool that grows

By fair Luceria, not the merry lute:

Flowers beseem not wither'd brows,.

Nor wither'd lips with emptied wine-jars suit.

Full well had Danae been secured, in truth,

By oaken portals, and a brazen tower,

And savage watch-dogs, from the roving youth

That prowl at midnight's hour:

But Jove and Venus mock'd with gay disdain

The jealous warder of that close stronghold:

The way, they knew, must soon be smooth and plain

When gods could change to gold.

Gold, gold can pass the tyrant's sentinel,

Can shiver rocks with more resistless blow

Than is the thunder's. Argos ' prophet fell,

He and his house laid low,

And all for gain. The man of Macedon

Cleft gates of cities, rival kings o'erthrew

By force of gifts: their cunning snares have won

Rude captains and their crew.

As riches grow, care follows: men repine

And thirst for more. No lofty crest I raise:

Wisdom that thought forbids, Maecenas mine,

The knightly order's praise.

He that denies himself shall gain the more

From bounteous Heaven. I strip me of my pride,

Desert the rich man's standard, and pass o'er

To bare Contentment's side,

More proud as lord of what the great despise

Than if the wheat thresh'd on Apulia 's floor

I hoarded all in my huge granaries,

'Mid vast possessions poor.

A clear fresh stream, a little field o'ergrown

With shady trees, a crop that ne'er deceives,

Pass, though men know it not, their wealth, that own

All Afric's golden sheaves.

Though no Calabrian bees their honey yield

For me, nor mellowing sleeps the god of wine

In Formian jar, nor in Gaul 's pasture-field

The wool grows long and fine,

Yet Poverty ne'er comes to break my peace;

If more I craved, you would not more refuse.

Desiring less, I better shall increase

My tiny revenues,

Than if to Alyattes' wide domains

I join'd the realms of Mygdon. Great desires

Sort with great wants. 'Tis best, when prayer obtains

No more than life requires.

Aelius, of Lamus' ancient name

(For since from that high parentage

The prehistoric Lamias came

And all who fill the storied page,

No doubt you trace your line from him,

Who stretch'd his sway o'er Formiae ,

And Liris, whose still waters swim

Whore green Marica skirts the sea,

Lord of broad realms), an eastern gale

Will blow to-morrow, and bestrew

The shore with weeds, with leaves the vale,

If rain's old prophet tell me true,

The raven. Gather, while 'tis fine,

Your wood; tomorrow shall be gay

With smoking pig and streaming wine,

And lord and slave keep holyday.

O wont the flying Nymphs to woo,

Good Faunus, through my sunny farm

Pass gently, gently pass, nor do

My younglings harm.

Each year, thou know'st, a kid must die

For thee; nor lacks the wine's full stream

To Venus' mate, the bowl; and high

The altars steam.

Sure as December's Nones appear,

All o'er the grass the cattle play;

The village, with the lazy steer,

Keeps holyday.

Wolves rove among the fearless sheep;

The woods for thee their foliage strow;

The delver loves on earth to leap,

His ancient foe.

What the time from Inachus

To Codrus, who in patriot battle fell,

Who were sprung from Aeacus,

And how men fought at Ilion ,—this you tell.

What the wines of Chios cost,

Who with due heat our water can allay,

What the hour, and who the host

To give us house-room,—this you will not say

Ho, there! wine to moonrise, wine

To midnight, wine to our new augur too!

Nine to three or three to nine,

As each man pleases, makes proportion true.

Who the uneven Muses loves,

Will fire his dizzy brain with three times three;

Three once told the Grace approves;

She with her two bright sisters, gay and free,

Shrinks, as maiden should, from strife:

But I'm for madness. What has dull'd the fire

Of the Berecyntian fife?

Why hangs the flute in silence with the lyre?

Out on niggard-handed boys!

Rain showers of roses; let old Lycus hear,

Envious churl, our senseless noise,

And she, our neighbour, his ill-sorted fere.

You with your bright clustering hair,

Your beauty, Telephus, like evening's sky,

Rhoda loves, as young, as fair;

I for my Glycera slowly, slowly die.

O born in Manlius' year with me,

Whate'er you bring us, plaint or jest,

Or passion and wild revelry,

Or, like a gentle wine-jar, rest;

Howe'er men call your Massic juice,

Its broaching claims a festal day;

Come then; Corvinus bids produce

A mellower wine, and I obey.

Though steep'd in all Socratic lore

He will not slight you; do not fear.

They say old Cato o'er and o'er

With wine his honest heart would cheer.

Tough wits to your mild torture yield

Their treasures; you unlock the soul

Of wisdom and its stores conceal'd,

Arm'd with Lyaeus' kind control.

'Tis yours the drooping heart to heal;

Your strength uplifts the poor man's horn;

Inspired by you, the soldier's steel,

The monarch's crown, he laughs to scorn,

Liber and Venus , wills she so,

And sister Graces, ne'er unknit,

And living lamps shall see you flow

Till stars before the sunrise flit.

Guardian of hill and woodland, Maid,

Who to young wives in childbirth's hour

Thrice call'd, vouchsafest sovereign aid,

O three-form'd power!

This pine that shades my cot be thine;

Here will I slay, as years come round,

A youngling boar, whose tusks design

The side-long wound.

If, Phidyle, your hands you lift

To heaven, as each new moon is born,

Soothing your Lares with the gift

Of slaughter'd swine, and spice, and corn,

Ne'er shall Scirocco's bane assail

Your vines, nor mildew blast your wheat.

Ne'er shall your tender younglings fail

In autumn, when the fruits are sweet.

The destined victim 'mid the snows

Of Algidus in oakwoods fed,

Or where the Alban herbage grows,

Shall dye the pontiff's axes red;

No need of butcher'd sheep for you

To make your homely prayers prevail;

Give but your little gods their due,

The rosemary twined with myrtle frail.

The sprinkled salt, the votive meal,

As soon their favour will regain,

Let but the hand be pure and leal,

As all the pomp of heifers slain.

Though your buried wealth surpass

The unsunn'd gold of Ind or Araby,

Though with many a ponderous mass

You crowd the Tuscan and Apulian sea,

Let Necessity but drive

Her wedge of adamant into that proud head,

Vainly battling will you strive

To 'scape Death's noose, or rid your soul of dread.

Better life the Scythians lead,

Trailing on waggon wheels their wandering home,

Or the hardy Getan breed,

As o'er their vast unmeasured steppes they roam;

Free the crops that bless their soil;

Their tillage wearies after one year's space;

Each in turn fulfils his toil;

His period o'er, another takes his place.

There the step-dame keeps her hand

From guilty plots, from blood of orphans clean;

There no downed wives command

Their feeble lords, or on adulterers lean.

Theirs are dowries not of gold,

Their parents' worth, their own pure chastity,

True to one, to others cold;

They dare not sin, or, if they dare, they die.

O, whoe'er has heart and head

To stay our plague of blood, our civic brawls,

Would he that his name be read

“Father of Rome ” on lofty pedestals,

Let him chain this lawless will,

And be our children's hero! cursed spite!

Living worth we envy still,

Then seek it with strain'd eyes, when snatch'd from sight.

What can sad laments avail

Unless sharp justice kill the taint of sin?

What can laws, that needs must fail

Shorn of the aid of manners form'd within,

If the merchant turns not back

From the fierce heats that round the tropic glow,

Turns not from the regions black

With northern winds, and hard with frozen snow;

Sailors override the wave,

While guilty poverty, more fear'd than vice.

Bids us crime and suffering brave,

And shuns the ascent of virtue's precipice?

Let the Capitolian fane,

The favour'd goal of yon vociferous crowd,

Aye, or let the nearest main

Receive our gold, our jewels rich and proud:

Slay we thus the cause of crime,

If yet we would repent and choose the good:

Ours the task to take in time

This baleful lust, and crush it in the bud.

Ours to mould our weakling sons

To nobler sentiment and manlier deed:

Now the noble's first-born shuns

The perilous chase, nor learns to sit his steed:

Set him to the unlawful dice,

Or Grecian hoop, how skilfully he plays!

While his sire, mature in vice,

A friend, a partner, or a guest betrays,

Hurrying, for an heir so base,

To gather riches. Money, root of ill,

Doubt it not, still grows apace:

Yet the scant heap has somewhat lacking still.

Whither, Bacchus , tear'st thou me.

FiIl'd with thy strength? What dens, what forests these,

Thus in wildering race I see?

What cave shall hearken to my melodies,

Tuned to tell of Caesar's praise

And throne him high the heavenly ranks among?

Sweet and strange shall be my lays,

A tale till now by poet voice unsung.

As the Evian on the height,

Roused from her sleep, looks wonderingly abroad,

Looks on Thrace with snow-drifts white,

And Rhodope by barbarous footstep trod,

So my truant eyes admire

The banks, the desolate forests. O great King

Who the Naiads dost inspire,

And Bacchants, strong from earth huge trees to wring!

Not a lowly strain is mine,

No mere man's utterance. O, 'tis venture sweet

Thee to follow, God of wine,

Making the vine-branch round thy temples meet!

For ladies' love I late was fit,

And good success my warfare blest,

But now my arms, my lyre I quit,

And hang them up to rust or rest.

Here, where arising from the sea

Stands Venus, lay the load at last,

Links, crowbars, and artillery,

Threatening all doors that dared be fast.

O Goddess! Cyprus owns thy sway,

And Memphis , far from Thracian snow;

Raise high thy lash, and deal me, pray,

That haughty Chloe just one blow!

When guilt goes forth, let lapwings shrill,

And dogs and foxes great with young,

And wolves from far Lanuvian hill,

Give clamorous tongue:

Across the roadway dart the snake,

Frightening, like arrow loosed from string,

The horses. I, for friendship's sake,

Watching each wing,

Ere to his haunt, the stagnant marsh,

The harbinger of tempest flies,

Will call the raven, croaking harsh,

From eastern skies.

Farewell!—and wheresoe'er you go,

My Galatea, think of me:

Let lefthand pie and roving crow

Still leave you free.

But mark with what a front of fear

Orion lowers. Ah! well I know

How Hadria glooms, how falsely clear

The west-winds blow.

Let foemen's wives and children feel

The gathering south-wind's angry roar,

The black wave's crash, the thunder-peal,

The quivering shore.

So to the bull Europa gave

Her beauteous form, and when she saw

The monstrous deep, the yawning grave,

Grew pale with awe.

That morn of meadow-flowers she thought,

Weaving a crown the nymphs to please:

That gloomy night she look'd on nought

But stars and seas.

Then, as in hundred-citied Crete

She landed,—“O my sire!” she said,

“O childly duty! passion's heat

Has struck thee dead.

Whence came I? death, for maiden's shame,

Were little. Do I wake to weep

My sin? or am I pure of blame,

And is it sleep

From dreamland brings a form to trick

My senses? Which was best? to go

Over the long, long waves, or pick

The flowers in blow?

O, were that monster made my prize,

How would I strive to wound that brow,

How tear those horns, my frantic eyes

Adored but now!

Shameless I left my father's home;

Shameless I cheat the expectant grave;

O heaven, that naked I might roam

In lions' cave!

Now, ere decay my bloom devour

Or thin the richness of my blood,

Fain would I fall in youth's first flower,

The tigers' food.

Hark! 'tis my father—‘Worthless one!

What, yet alive? the oak is nigh.

'Twas well you kept your maiden zone,

The noose to tie.

Or if your choice be that rude pike,

New barb'd with death, leap down and ask

The wind to bear you. Would you like

The bondmaid's task,

You, child of kings, a master's toy,

A mistress' slave?’” Beside her, lo!

Stood Venus smiling, and her boy

With unstrung bow.

Then, when her laughter ceased, “Have done

With fume and fret,” she cried, “my fair;

That odious bull will give you soon

His horns to tear.

You know not you are Jove's own dame:

Away with sobbing; be resign'd

To greatness: you shall give your name

To half mankind.”

Neptune's feast-day! what should man

Think first of doing? Lyde mine, be bold,

Broach the treasured Caecuban,

And batter Wisdom in her own stronghold.

Now the noon has pass'd the full,

Yet sure you deem swift Time has made a halt,

Tardy as you are to pull

Old Bibulus' wine-jar from its sleepy vault.

I will take my turn and sing

Neptune and Nereus' train with locks of green;

You shall warble to the string

Latona and her Cynthia 's arrowy sheen.

Hers our latest song, who sways

Cnidos and Cyclads, and to Paphos goes

With her swans, on holydays;

Night too shall claim the homage music owes.

Heir of Tyrrhenian kings, for you

A mellow cask, unbroach'd as yet,

Maecenas mine, and roses new,

And fresh-drawn oil your locks to wet,

Are waiting here. Delay not still,

Nor gaze on Tibur , never dried,

And sloping Aesule, and the hill

Of Telegon the parricide.

O leave that pomp that can but tire,

Those piles, among the clouds at home;

Cease for a moment to admire

The smoke, the wealth, the noise of Rome !

In change e'en luxury finds a zest:

The poor man's supper, neat, but spare,

With no gay couch to seat the guest,

Has smooth'd the rugged brow of care.

Now glows the Ethiop maiden's sire;

Now Procyon rages all ablaze;

The Lion maddens in his ire,

As suns bring back the sultry days:

The shepherd with his weary sheep

Seeks out the streamlet and the trees,

Silvanus' lair: the still banks sleep

Untroubled by the wandering breeze.

You ponder on imperial schemes,

And o'er the city's danger brood:

Bactrian and Serian haunt your dreams,

And Tanais , toss'd by inward feud.

The issue of the time to be

Heaven wisely hides in blackest night,

And laughs, should man's anxiety

Transgress the bounds of man's short sight.

Control the present: all beside

Flows like a river seaward borne,

Now rolling on its placid tide,

Now whirling massy trunks uptorn,

And waveworn crags, and farms, and stock,

In chaos blent, while hill and wood

Reverberate to the enormous shock,

When savage rains the tranquil flood

Have stirr'd to madness. Happy he,

Self-centred, who each night can say,

“My life is lived: the morn may see

A clouded or a sunny day:

That rests with Jove: but what is gone,

He will not, cannot turn to nought;

Nor cancel, as a thing undone,

What once the flying hour has brought.”

Fortune, who loves her cruel game,

Still bent upon some heartless whim,

Shifts her caresses, fickle dame,

Now kind to me, and now to him:

She stays; 'tis well: but let her shake

Those wings, her presents I resign,

Cloak me in native worth, and take

Chaste Poverty undower'd for mine.

Though storms around my vessel rave,

I will not fall to craven prayers,

Nor bargain by my vows to save

My Cyprian and Sidonian wares,

Else added to the insatiate main.

Then through the wild Aegean roar

The breezes and the Brethren Twain

Shall waft my little boat ashore.

And now 'tis done: more durable than brass

My monument shall be, and raise its head

O'er royal pyramids: it shall not dread

Corroding rain or angry Boreas,

Nor the long lapse of immemorial time.

I shall not wholly die: large residue

Shall 'scape the queen of funerals. Ever new

My after fame shall grow, while pontiffs climb

With silent maids the Capitolian height.

“Born,” men will say, “where Aufidus is loud,

Where Daunus, scant of streams, beneath him bow'd

The rustic tribes, from dimness he wax'd bright,

First of his race to wed the Aeolian lay

To notes of Italy .” Put glory on,

My own Melpomene, by genius won,

And crown me of thy grace with Delphic bay.

Yet again thou wak'st the flame

That long had slumber'd! Spare me, Venus, spare!

Trust me, I am not the same

As in the reign of Cinara, kind and fair.

Cease thy softening spells to prove

On this old heart, by fifty years made hard,

Cruel Mother of sweet Love!

Haste, where gay youth solicits thy regard.

With thy purple cygnets fly

To Paullus' door, a seasonable guest;

There within hold revelry,

There light thy flame in that congenial breast.

He, with birth and beauty graced,

The trembling client's champion, ne'er tongue-tied,

Master of each manly taste,

Shall bear thy conquering banners far and wide.

Let him smile in triumph gay,

True heart, victorious over lavish hand,

By the Alban lake that day

'Neath citron roof all marble shalt thou stand:

Incense there and fragrant spice

With odorous fumes thy nostrils shall salute;

Blended notes thine ear entice,

The lyre, the pipe, the Berecyntine flute:

Graceful youths and maidens bright

Shall twice a day thy tuneful praise resound,

While their feet, so fair and white,

In Salian measure three times beat the ground.

I can relish love no more,

Nor flattering hopes that tell me hearts are true,

Nor the revel's loud uproar,

Nor fresh-wreathed flowerets, bathed in vernal dew.

Ah! but why, my Ligurine,

Steal trickling tear-drops down my wasted cheek?

Wherefore halts this tongue of mine,

So eloquent once, so faltering now and weak?

Now I hold you in my chain,

And clasp you close, all in a nightly dream;

Now, still dreaming, o'er the plain

I chase you; now, ah cruel! down the stream.

Who fain at Pindar's flight would aim,

On waxen wings, Iulus, he

Soars heavenward, doom'd to give his name

To some new sea.

Pindar, like torrent from the steep

Which, swollen with rain, its banks o'erflows,

With mouth unfathomably deep,

Foams, thunders, glows,

All worthy of Apollo's bay,

Whether in dithyrambic roll

Pouring new words he burst away

Beyond control,

Or gods and god-born heroes tell,

Whose arm with righteous death could tame

Grim Centaurs, tame Chimaeras fell,

Out-breathing flame,

Or bid the boxer or the steed

In deathless pride of victory live,

And dower them with a nobler meed

Than sculptors give,

Or mourn the bridegroom early torn

From his young bride, and set on high

Strength, courage, virtue's golden morn,

Too good to die.

Antonius! yes, the winds blow free,

When Dirce's swan ascends the skies,

To waft him. I, like Matine bee,

In act and guise,

That culls its sweets through toilsome hours,

Am roaming Tibur 's banks along,

And fashioning with puny powers

A laboured song.

Your Muse shall sing in loftier strain

How Caesar climbs the sacred height,

The fierce Sygambrians in his train,

With laurel dight,

Than whom the Fates ne'er gave mankind

A richer treasure or more dear,

Nor shall, though earth again should find

The golden year.

Your Muse shall tell of public sports,

And holyday, and votive feast,

For Caesar's sake, and brawling courts

Where strife has ceased.

Then, if my voice can aught avail,

Grateful for him our prayers have won,

My song shall echo, “Hail, all hail,

Auspicious Sun!”

There as you move, “Ho! Triumph, ho!

Great Triumph!” once and yet again

All Rome shall cry, and spices strow

Before your train.

Ten bulls, ten kine, your debt discharge:

A calf new-wean'd from parent cow,

Battening on pastures rich and large,

Shall quit my vow.

Like moon just dawning on the night

The crescent honours of his head;

One dapple spot of snowy white,

The rest all red.

He whom thou, Melpomene,

Hast welcomed with thy smile, in life arriving,

Ne'er by boxer's skill shall be

Renown'd abroad, for Isthmian mastery striving;

Him shall never fiery steed

Draw in Achaean car a conqueror seated;

Him shall never martial deed

Show, crown'd with bay, after proud kings defeated,

Climbing Capitolian steep:

But the cool streams that make green Tibur flourish,

And the tangled forest deep,

On soft Aeolian airs his fame shall nourish.

Rome , of cities first and best,

Deigns by her sons' according voice to hail me

Fellow-bard of poets blest,

And faint and fainter envy's growls assail me.

Goddess, whose Pierian art

The lyre's sweet sounds can modulate and measure,

Who to dumb fish canst impart

The music of the swan, if such thy pleasure:

O, 'tis all of thy dear grace

That every finger points me out in going

Lyrist of the Roman race;

Breath, power to charm, if mine, are thy bestowing!

E'en as the lightning's minister,

Whom Jove o'er all the feather'd breed

Made sovereign, having proved him sure

Erewhile on auburn Ganymede;

Stirr'd by warm youth and inborn power,

He quits the nest with timorous wing,

For winter's storms have ceased to lower,

And zephyrs of returuing spring

Tempt him to launch on unknown skies

Next on the fold he stoops downright;

Last on resisting serpents flies,

Athirst for foray and for flight:

As tender kidling on the grass

Espies, uplooking from her food,

A lion's whelp, and knows, alas!

Those new-set teeth shall drink her blood:

So look'd the Raetian mountaineers

On Drusus:—whence in every field

They learn'd through immemorial years

The Amazonian axe to wield,

I ask not now: not all of truth

We seekers find: enough to know

The wisdom of the princely youth

Has taught our erst victorious foe

What prowess dwells in boyish hearts

Rear'd in the shrine of a pure home,

What strength Augustus' love imparts

To Nero's seed, the hope of Rome .

Good sons and brave good sires approve:

Strong bullocks, fiery colts, attest

Their fathers' worth, nor weakling dove

Is hatch'd in savage eagle's nest.

But care draws forth the power within,

And cultured minds are strong for good:

Let manners fail, the plague of sin

Taints e'en the course of gentle blood.

How great thy debt to Nero's race,

O Rome , let red Metaurus say,

Slain Hasdrubal, and victory's grace

First granted on that glorious day

Which chased the clouds, and show'd the sun,

When Hannibal o'er Italy

Ran, as swift flames o'er pine-woods run,

Or Eurus o'er Sicilia 's sea.

Henceforth, by fortune aiding toil,

Rome 's prowess grew: her fanes, laid waste

By Punic sacrilege and spoil,

Beheld at length their gods replaced.

Then the false Libyan own'd his doom:—

“Weak deer, the wolves' predestined prey,

Blindly we rush on foes, from whom

'Twere triumph won to steal away.

That race which, strong from Ilion 's fires,

Its gods, on Tuscan waters tost,

Its sons, its venerable sires,

Bore to Ausonia's citied coast;

That race, like oak by axes shorn

On Algidus with dark leaves rife,

Laughs carnage, havoc, all to scorn,

And draws new spirit from the knife.

Not the lopp'd Hydra task'd so sore

Alcides, chafing at the foil:

No pest so fell was born of yore

From Colchian or from Theban soil.

Plunged in the deep, it mounts to sight

More splendid: grappled, it will quell

Unbroken powers, and fight a fight

Whose story widow'd wives shall tell.

No heralds shall my deeds proclaim

To Carthage now: lost, lost is all:

A nation's hope, a nation's name,

They died with dying Hasdrubal.”

What will not Claudian hands achieve?

Jove's favour is their guiding star,

And watchful potencies unweave

For them the tangled paths of war.

Best guardian of Rome 's people, dearest boon

Of a kind Heaven, thou lingerest all too long:

Thou bad'st thy senate look to meet thee soon:

Do not thy promise wrong.

Restore, dear chief, the light thou tak'st away:

Ah! when, like spring, that gracious mien of thine

Dawns on thy Rome , more gently glides the day,

And suns serener shine.

See her whose darling child a long year past

Has dwelt beyond the wild Carpathian foam;

That long year o'er, the envious southern blast

Still bars him from his home:

Weeping and praying to the shore she clings,

Nor ever thence her straining eyesight turns:

So, smit by loyal passion's restless stings,

Rome for her Caesar yearns.

In safety range the cattle o'er the mead:

Sweet Peace, soft Plenty, swell the golden grain:

O'er unvex'd seas the sailors blithely speed:

Fair Honour shrinks from stain:

No guilty lusts the shrine of home defile:

Cleansed is the hand without, the heart within:

The father's features in his children smile

Swift vengeance follows sin.

Who fears the Parthian or the Scythian horde,

Or the rank growth that German forests yield,

While Caesar lives? who trembles at the sword

The fierce Iberians wield?

In his own hills each labours down the day,

Teaching the vine to clasp the widow'd tree:

Then to his cups again, where, feasting gay,

He hails his god in thee.

A household power, adored with prayers and wine,

Thou reign'st auspicious o'er his hour of ease:

Thus grateful Greece her Castor made divine,

And her great Hercules.

Ah! be it thine long holydays to give

To thy Hesperia! thus, dear chief, we pray

At sober sunrise; thus at mellow eve,

When ocean hides the day.

Thou who didst make thy vengeful might

To Niobe and Tityos known,

And Peleus' son, when Troy 's tall height

Was nigh his own,

Victorious else, for thee no peer,

Though, strong in his sea-parent's power,

He shook with that tremendous spear

The Dardan tower.

He, like a pine by axes sped,

Or cypress sway'd by angry gust,

Fell ruining, and laid his head

In Trojan dust.

Not his to lie in covert pent

Of the false steed, and sudden fall

On Priam's ill-starr'd merriment

In bower and hail:

His ruthless arm in broad bare day

The infant from the breast had torn,

Nay, given to flame, ah, well a way!

The babe unborn:

But, won by Venus' voice and thine,

Relenting Jove Aeneas will'd

With other omens more benign

New walls to build.

Sweet tuner of the Grecian lyre,

Whose locks are laved in Xanthus ' dews,

Blooming Agyieus! help, inspire

My Daunian Muse!

'Tis Phoebus, Phoebus gifts my tongue

With minstrel art and minstrel fires:

Come, noble youths and maidens sprung

From noble sires,

Blest in your Dian's guardian smile,

Whose shafts the flying silvans stay,

Come, foot the Lesbian measure, while

The lyre I play:

Sing of Latona 's glorious boy,

Sing of night's queen with crescent horn,

Who wings the fleeting months with joy,

And swells the corn.

And happy brides shall say, “'Twas mine,

When years the cyclic season brought,

To chant the festal hymn divine

By Horace taught.”

The snow is fled: the trees their leaves put on,

The fields their green:

Earth owns the change, and rivers lessening run

Their banks between.

Naked the Nymphs and Graces in the meads

The dance essay:

“No 'scaping death” proclaims the year, that speeds

This sweet spring day.

Frosts yield to zephyrs; Summer drives out Spring,

To vanish, when

Rich Autumn sheds his fruits; round wheels the ring,—

Winter again!

Yet the swift moons repair Heaven's detriment:

We, soon as thrust

Where good Aeneas, Tullus, Ancus went,

What are we? dust.

Can Hope assure you one more day to live

From powers above?

You rescue from your heir whate'er you give

The self you love.

When life is o'er, and Minos has rehearsed

The grand last doom,

Not birth, nor eloquence, nor worth, shall burst

Torquatus' tomb.

Not Dian's self can chaste Hippolytus

To life recall,

Nor Theseus free his loved Pirithous

From Lethe's thrall.

Ah Censorinus! to my comrades true

Rich cups, rare bronzes, gladly would I send:

Choice tripods from Olympia on each friend

Would I confer, choicer on none than you,

Had but my fate such gems of art bestow'd

As cunning Scopas or Parrhasius wrought,

This with the brush, that with the chisel taught

To image now a mortal, now a god.

But these are not my riches: your desire

Such luxury craves not, and your means disdain:

A poet's strain you love; a poet's strain

Accept, and learn the value of the lyre.

Not public gravings on a marble base,

Whence comes a second life to men of might

E'en in the tomb: not Hannibal's swift flight,

Nor those fierce threats flung back into his face,

Not impious Carthage in its last red blaze,

In clearer light sets forth his spotless fame,

Who from crush'd Afric took away—a name,

Than rude Calabria 's tributary lays.

Let silence hide the good your hand has wrought,

Farewell, reward! Had blank oblivion's power

Dimm'd the bright deeds of Romulus, at this hour,

Despite his sire and mother, he were nought.

Thus Aeacus has 'scaped the Stygian wave,

By grace of poets and their silver tongue,

Henceforth to live the happy isles among.

No, trust the Muse: she opes the good man's grave,

And lifts him to the gods. So Hercules,

His labours o'er, sits at the board of Jove:

So Tyndareus' offspring shine as stars above,

Saving lorn vessels from the yawning seas:

So Bacchus, with the vine-wreath round his hair,

Gives prosperous issue to his votary's prayer.

Think not those strains can e'er expire,

Which, cradled 'mid the echoing roar

Of Aufidus , to Latium 's lyre

I sing with arts unknown before.

Though Homer fill the foremost throne,

Yet grave Stesichorus still can please,

And fierce Alcaeus holds his own

With Pindar and Simonides.

The songs of Teos are not mute,

And Sappho's love is breathing still:

She told her secret to the lute,

And yet its chords with passion thrill.

Not Sparta 's queen alone was fired

By broider'd robe and braided tress,

And all the splendours that attired

Her lover's guilty loveliness:

Not only Teucer to the field

His arrows brought, nor Ilion

Beneath a single conqueror reel'd:

Not Crete 's majestic lord alone,

Or Sthenelus, earn'd the Muses' crown:

Not Hector first for child and wife,

Or brave Deiphobus, laid down

The burden of a manly life.

Before Atrides men were brave:

But ah! oblivion, dark and long,

Has lock'd them in a tearless grave,

For lack of consecrating song.

'Twixt worth and baseness, lapp'd in death,

What difference? You shall ne'er be dumb,

While strains of mine have voice and breath:

The dull neglect of days to come

Those hard-won honours shall not blight:

No, Lollius, no: a soul is yours,

Clear-sighted, keen, alike upright

When fortune smiles, and when she lowers:

To greed and rapine still severe,

Spurning the gain men find so sweet:

A consul, not of one brief year,

But oft as on the judgment-seat

You bend the expedient to the right,

Turn haughty eyes from bribes away,

Or bear your banners through the fight,

Scattering the foeman's firm array.

The lord of boundless revenues,

Salute not him as happy: no,

Call him the happy, who can use

The bounty that the gods bestow,

Can bear the load of poverty,

And tremble not at death, but sin:

No recreant he when called to die

In cause of country or of kin.

Here is a cask of Alban , more

Than nine years old: here grows for you

Green parsley, Phyllis, and good store

Of ivy too

(Wreathed ivy suits your hair, you know):

The plate shines bright: the altar, strew'd

With vervain, hungers for the flow

Of lambkin's blood.

There's stir among the serving folk;

They bustle, bustle, boy and girl;

The flickering flames send up the smoke

In many a curl.

But why, you ask, this special cheer?

We celebrate the feast of Ides,

Which April's month, to Venus dear,

In twain divides.

O, 'tis a day for reverence,

E'en my own birthday scarce so dear,

For my Maecenas counts from thence

Each added year.

'Tis Telephus that you'd bewitch:

But he is of a high degree;

Bound to a lady fair and rich,

He is not free.

O think of Phaethon half burn'd,

And moderate your passion's greed:

Think how Bellerophon was spurn'd

By his wing'd steed.

So learn to look for partners meet,

Shun lofty things, nor raise your aims

Above your fortune. Come then, sweet,

My last of flames

(For never shall another fair

Enslave me), learn a tune, to sing

With that dear voice: to music care

Shall yield its sting.

The gales of Thrace , that hush the unquiet sea,

Spring's comrades, on the bellying canvas blow:

Clogg'd earth and brawling streams alike are free

From winter's weight of snow.

Wailing her Itys in that sad, sad strain,

Builds the poor bird, reproach to after time

Of Cecrops' house, for bloody vengeance ta'en

On foul barbaric crime.

The keepers of fat lambkins chant their loves

To silvan reeds, all in the grassy lea,

And pleasure Him who tends the flocks and groves

Of dark-leaved Arcady.

It is a thirsty season, Virgil mine:

But would you taste the grape's Calenian juice,

Client of noble youths, to earn your wine

Some nard you must produce.

A tiny box of nard shall bring to light

The cask that in Sulpician cellar lies:

O, it can give new hopes, so fresh and bright,

And gladden gloomy eyes.

You take the bait? then come without delay

And bring your ware: be sure, 'tis not my plan

To let you drain my liquor and not pay,

As might some wealthy man.

Come, quit those covetous thoughts, those knitted brows,

Think on the last black embers, while you may,

And be for once unwise. When time allows,

'Tis sweet the fool to play.

The gods have heard, the gods have heard my prayer;

Yes, Lyce! you are growing old, and still

You struggle to look fair;

You drink, and dance, and trill

Your songs to youthful Love, in accents weak

With wine, and age, and passion. Youthful Love!

He dwells in Chia 's cheek,

And hears her harp-strings move.

Rude boy, he flies like lightning o'er the heath

Past wither'd trees like you; you're wrinkled now;

The white has left your teeth

And settled on your brow.

Your Coan silks, your jewels bright as stars,

Ah no! they bring not back the days of old,

In public calendars

By flying Time enroll'd.

Where now that beauty? where those movements? where

That colour? what of her, of her is left,

Who, breathing Love's own air,

Me of myself bereft,

Who reign'd in Cinara's stead, a fair, fair face,

Queen of sweet arts? but Fate to Cinara gave

A life of little space;

And now she cheats the grave

Of Lyce, spared to raven's length of days,

That youth may see, with laughter and disgust,

A fire-brand, once ablaze,

Now smouldering in grey dust.

What honours can a grateful Rome ,

A grateful senate, Caesar, give

To make thy worth through days to come

Emblazon'd on our records live,

Mightiest of chieftains whomsoe'er

The sun beholds from heaven on high?

They know thee now, thy strength in war,

Those unsubdued Vindelici.

Thine was the sword that Drusus drew,

When on the Breunian hordes he fell,

And storm'd the fierce Genaunian crew

E'en in their Alpine citadel,

And paid them back their debt twice told

'Twas then the elder Nero came

To conflict, and in ruin roll'd

Stout Raetian kernes of giant frame.

O, 'twas a gallant sight to see

The shocks that beat upon the brave

Who chose to perish and be free!

As south winds scourge the rebel wave

When through rent clouds the Pleiads weep,

So keen his force to smite, and smite

The foe, or make his charger leap

Through the red furnace of the fight.

Thus Daunia's ancient river fares,

Proud Aufidus , with bull-like horn,

When swoln with choler he prepares

A deluge for the fields of corn.

So Claudius charged and overthrew

The grim barbarian's mail-clad host,

The foremost and the hindmost slew,

And conquer'd all, and nothing lost.

The force, the forethought, were thine own,

Thine own the gods. The selfsame day

When, port and palace open thrown,

Low at thy footstool Egypt lay,

That selfsame day, three lustres gone,

Another victory to thine hand

Was given; another field was won

By grace of Caesar's high command.

Thee Spanish tribes, unused to yield,

Mede , Indian, Scyth that knows no home,

Acknowledge, sword at once and shield

Of Italy and queenly Rome .

Ister to thee, and Tanais fleet,

And Nile that will not tell his birth,

To thee the monstrous seas that beat

On Britain 's coast, the end of earth,

To thee the proud Iberians bow,

And Gauls, that scorn from death to flee;

The fierce Sygambrian bends his brow,

And drops his arms to worship thee.

Of battles fought I fain had told,

And conquer'd towns, when Phoebus smote

His harp-string: “Sooth, 'twere over-bold.

To tempt wide seas in that frail boat.”

Thy age, great Caesar, has restored

To squalid fields the plenteous grain,

Given back to Rome 's almighty Lord

Our standards, torn from Parthian fane,

Has closed Quirinian Janus' gate,

Wild passion's erring walk controll'd,

Heal'd the foul plague-spot of the state,

And brought again the life of old,

Life, by whose healthful power increased

The glorious name of Latium spread

To where the sun illumes the east

From where he seeks his western bed.

While Caesar rules, no civil strife

Shall break our rest, nor violence rude,

Nor rage, that whets the slaughtering knife

And plunges wretched towns in feud.

The sons of Danube shall not scorn

The Julian edicts; no, nor they

By Tanais ' distant river horn,

Nor Persia , Scythia , or Cathay.

And we on feast and working-tide,

While Bacchus' bounties freely flow,

Our wives and children at our side,

First paying Heaven the prayers we owe,

Shall sing of chiefs whose deeds are done,

As wont our sires, to flute or shell,

And Troy , Anchises, and the son

Of Venus on our tongues shall dwell.
