                    another, those who in their own language are called <name type="ethnic">Celts</name>, in our <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>, the third. All these
                    differ from each other in language, customs and laws. The river <name key="tgn,1124123" type="place" n="Garonne [-0.6,45.33] (river), Europe">Garonne</name> separates the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> from the

                    civilization and refinement of [our] Province, and merchants least frequently
                    resort to them, and import those things which tend to effeminate the mind; and
                    they are the nearest to the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>, who dwell beyond

                    them from their own territories, or themselves wage war on their frontiers. One
                    part of these, which it has been said that the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>
                    occupy, takes its beginning at the river <name key="tgn,7023890" type="place" n="Rhone [4.833,43.333] (river), Europe">

                    the territories of the <name>Belgae</name>; it borders, too, on the side of the

                <p>Among the <name type="ethnic">Helvetii</name>, <name>Orgetorix</name> was by far
                    the most distinguished and wealthy. He, when <name>Marcus Messala</name> and
                        <name>Marcus Piso</name> were consuls [<date when-custom="-61">61</date> B.C.],
                    incited by lust of sovereignty, formed a conspiracy among the nobility, and
                    persuaded the people to go forth from their territories with all their
                    possessions, [saying] that it would be very easy, since they excelled all in
                    valor, to acquire the supremacy of the whole of <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>. To this he
                    the more easily persuaded them, because the <name type="ethnic">Helvetii</name>,
                    are confined on every side by the nature of their situation; on one side by the
                        <name key="tgn,7012611" type="place" n="Rhine [6,51.833] (river), Europe">
                        <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName>
                    </name>, a very broad and deep river, which separates the <name>Helvetian</name>
                    territory from the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>; on a second side by the
                        <name key="tgn,7003749" type="place" n="  +Jura [7.25,47.333] (canton), Switzerland, Europe ">
                        <placeName key="tgn,7003749">Jura</placeName>
                    </name>, a very high mountain, which is [situated] between the
                        <name>Sequani</name> and the <name type="ethnic">Helvetii</name>; on a third
                    by the <name key="tgn,1116389" type="place" n="Lake of Geneva (lake), Switzerland, Europe">Lake of Geneva</name>, and
                    by the river <name key="tgn,7023890" type="place" n="Rhone [4.833,43.333] (river), Europe">Rhone</name>, which separates our
                    Province from the <name type="ethnic">Helvetii</name>. From these circumstances
                    it resulted, that they could range less widely, and could less easily make war
                    upon their neighbors; for which reason men fond of war [as they were] were
                    affected with great regret. They thought, that considering the extent of their
                    population, and their renown for warfare and bravery, they had but narrow
                    limits, although they extended in length 240, and in breadth 180 [<name type="ethnic">Roman</name>] miles.</p></div>
                        <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
                <p>Induced by these considerations, and influenced by the authority of
                        <name>Orgetorix</name>, they determined to provide such things as were
                    necessary for their expedition-to buy up as great a number as possible of beasts
                    of burden and wagons-to make their sowings as large as possible, so that on
                    their march plenty of corn might be in store-and to establish peace and
                    friendship with the neighboring states. They reckoned that a term of two years
                    would be sufficient for them to execute their designs; they fix by decree their
                    departure for the third year. <name>Orgetorix</name> is chosen to complete these
                    arrangements. He took upon himself the office of embassador to the states: on
                    this journey he persuades <name>Casticus</name>, the son of
                        <name>Catamantaledes</name> (one of the <name>Sequani</name>, whose father
                    had possessed the sovereignty among the people for many years, and had been
                    styled "friend" by the senate of the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people),
                    to seize upon the sovereignty in his own state, which his father had held before
                    him, and he likewise persuades <name>Dumnorix</name>, an <name>Aeduan</name>,
                    the brother of <name>Divitiacus</name>, who at that time possessed the chief
                    authority in the state, and was exceedingly beloved by the people, to attempt
                    the same, and gives him his daughter in marriage. He proves to them that to
                    accomplish their attempts was a thing very easy to be done, because he himself
                    would obtain the government of his own state; that there was no doubt that the
                        <name type="ethnic">Helvetii</name> were the most powerful of the whole of
                        <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>; he assures them that he will, with his own forces and his own
                    army, acquire the sovereignty for them. Incited by this speech, they give a
                    pledge and oath to one another, and hope that, when they have seized the
                    sovereignty, they will, by means of the three most powerful and valiant nations,
                    be enabled to obtain possession of the whole of <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>. </p></div>
                            <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
                <p>When this scheme was disclosed to the <name type="ethnic">Helvetii</name> by
                    informers, they, according to their custom, compelled <name>Orgetorix</name> to
                    plead his cause in chains; it was the law that the penalty of being burned by
                    fire should await him if condemned. On the day appointed for the pleading of his
                    cause, <name>Orgetorix</name> drew together from all quarters to the court, all
                    his vassals to the number of ten thousand persons; and led together to the same
                    place all his dependents and debtor-bondsmen, of whom he had a great number; by
                    means of those he rescued himself from [the necessity of] pleading his cause.
                    While the state, incensed at this act, was endeavoring to assert its right by
                    arms, and the magistrates were mustering a large body of men from the country,
                        <name>Orgetorix</name> died; and there is not wanting a suspicion, as the
                        <name type="ethnic">Helvetii</name> think, of his having committed suicide.
                        </p></div>

                <p>After his death, the <name type="ethnic">Helvetii</name> nevertheless attempt to
                    do that which they had resolved on, namely, to go forth from their territories.
                    When they thought that they were at length prepared for this undertaking, they
                    set fire to all their towns, in number about twelve-to their villages about four
                    hundred-and to the private dwellings that remained; they burn up all the corn,
                    except what they intend to carry with them; that after destroying the hope of a
                    return home, they might be the more ready for undergoing all dangers. They order

                    with <name type="pers">Caesar</name>:-that, "if the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people would make peace with the <name type="ethnic">Helvetii</name> they would go to that part and there remain, where <name type="pers">Caesar</name> might appoint and desire them to be; but if he
                    should persist in persecuting them with war that he ought to remember both the
                    ancient disgrace of the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people and the
                    characteristic valor of the <name type="ethnic">Helvetii</name>. As to his
                    having attacked one canton by surprise, [at a time] when those who had crossed
                    the river could not bring assistance to their friends, that he ought not on that
                    account to ascribe very much to his own valor, or despise them; that they had so
                    learned from their sires and ancestors, as to rely more on valor than on
                    artifice and stratagem. <name>Wherefore</name> let him not bring it to pass that
                    the place, where they were standing, should acquire a name, from the disaster of
                    the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people and the destruction of their army or
                    transmit the remembrance [of such an event to posterity]." </p></div>
                        <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="14">
                <p>To these words <name type="pers">Caesar</name> thus replied:-that "on that very
                    account he felt less hesitation, because he kept in remembrance those
                    circumstances which the <name>Helvetian</name> embassadors had mentioned, and
                    that he felt the more indignant at them, in proportion as they had happened
                    undeservedly to the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people: for if they had
                    been conscious of having done any wrong, it would not have been difficult to be
                    on their guard, but for that very reason had they been deceived, because neither
                    were they aware that any offense had been given by them, on account of which
                    they should be afraid, nor did they think that they ought to be afraid without
                    cause. But even if he were willing to forget their former outrage, could he also
                    lay aside the remembrance of the late wrongs, in that they had against his will
                    attempted a route through the Province by force, in that they had molested the
                        <name>Aedui</name>, the <name>Ambarri</name>, and the
                        <name>Allobroges</name>? That as to their so insolently boasting of their
                    victory, and as to their being astonished that they had so long committed their
                    outrages with impunity, [both these things] tended to the same point; for the
                    immortal gods are wont to allow those persons whom they wish to punish for their
                    guilt sometimes a greater prosperity and longer impunity, in order that they may
                    suffer the more severely from a reverse of circumstances. Although these things
                    are so, yet, if hostages were to be given him by them in order that he may be
                    assured these will do what they promise, and provided they will give
                    satisfaction to the <name>Aedui</name> for the outrages which they had committed
                    against them and their allies, and likewise to the <name>Allobroges</name>, he
                        [<name type="pers">Caesar</name>] will make peace with them."
                        <name>Divico</name> replied, that "the <name type="ethnic">Helvetii</name>
                    had been so trained by their ancestors, that they were accustomed to receive,
                    not to give hostages; of that fact the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people
                    were witness." Having given this reply, he withdrew. </p></div>
                            <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="15">
                <p>On the following day they move their camp from that place; <name type="pers">Caesar</name> does the same, and sends forward all his cavalry, to the
                    number of four thousand (which he had drawn together from all parts of the
                    Province and from the <name>Aedui</name> and their allies), to observe toward
                    what parts the enemy are directing their march. These, having too eagerly
                    pursued the enemy's rear, come to a battle with the cavalry of the <name type="ethnic">Helvetii</name> in a disadvantageous place, and a few of our
                    men fall. The <name>Helvetii</name>, elated with this battle, because they had
                    with five hundred horse repulsed so large a body of horse, began to face us more
                    boldly, sometimes too from their rear to provoke our men by an attack. <name type="pers">Caesar</name> [however] restrained his men from battle, deeming
                    it sufficient for the present to prevent the enemy from rapine, forage, and
                    depredation. They marched for about fifteen days in such a manner that there was
                    not more than five or six miles between the enemy's rear and our van. </p></div>
                <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="16">
                <p>Meanwhile, <name type="pers">Caesar</name> kept daily importuning the
                        <name>Aedui</name> for the corn which they had promised in the name of their
                    state; for, in consequence of the coldness (<name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, being as before said,
                    situated toward the north), not only was the corn in the fields not ripe, but
                    there was not in store a sufficiently large quantity even of fodder: besides he
                    was unable to use the corn which he had conveyed in ships up the river <name key="tgn,1129316" type="place" n="  +Saone [4.833,45.75] (river), France, Europe ">
                        <placeName key="tgn,1129316">Saone</placeName>
                    </name>, because the <name type="ethnic">Helvetii</name>, from whom he was
                    unwilling to retire had diverted their march from the <name key="tgn,1129316" type="place" n="  +Saone [4.833,45.75] (river), France, Europe ">

                    </name>. The <name>Aedui</name> kept deferring from day to day, and saying that
                    it was being collected-brought in-on the road." When he saw that he was put off
                    too long, and that the day was close at hand on which he ought to serve out the
                    corn to his soldiers;-having called together their chiefs, of whom he had a
                    great number in his camp, among them <name>Divitiacus</name> and
                        <name>Liscus</name> who was invested with the chief magistracy (whom the
                        <name>Aedui</name> style the <name>Vergobretus</name>, and who is elected
                    annually and has power of life or death over his countrymen), he severely
                    reprimands them, because he is not assisted by them on so urgent an occasion,
                    when the enemy were so close at hand, and when [corn] could neither be bought
                    nor taken from the fields, particularly as, in a great measure urged by their
                    prayers, he had undertaken the war; much more bitterly, therefore does he
                    complain of his being forsaken. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="17">
                <p>Then at length <name>Liscus</name>, moved by <name type="pers">Caesar</name>'s
                    speech, discloses what he had hitherto kept secret:-that there are some whose
                    influences with the people is very great, who, though private men, have more
                    power than the magistrates themselves: that these by seditions and violent
                    language are deterring the populace from contributing the corn which they ought
                    to supply; [by telling them] that, if they can not any longer retain the
                    supremacy of <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, it were better to submit
                    to the government of <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> than of <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>, nor ought they to doubt that, if the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> should overpower the <name type="ethnic">Helvetii</name>, they would wrest their freedom from the <name>Aedui</name>
                    together with the remainder of <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>. By these very men, [said
                    he], are our plans and whatever is done in the camp, disclosed to the enemy;
                    that they could not be restrained by him: nay more, he was well aware, that
                    though compelled by necessity, he had disclosed the matter to <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, at how great a risk he had done it; and for that reason, he
                    had been silent as long as he could." </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="18">
                <p><name type="pers">Caesar</name> perceived that by this speech of
                        <name>Liscus</name>, <name>Dumnorix</name>, the brother of
                        <name>Divitiacus</name>, was indicated; but, as he was unwilling that these
                    matters should be discussed while so many were present, he speedily dismisses:
                    the council, but detains <name>Liscus</name>: he inquires from him when alone,
                    about those things which he had said in the meeting. He <name>[Liscus]</name>
                    speaks more unreservedly and boldly. He <name>[Caesar]</name> makes inquiries on
                    the same points privately of others, and discovered that it is all true; that
                        "<name>Dumnorix</name> is the person, a man of the highest daring, in great
                    favor with the people on account of his liberality, a man eager for a
                    revolution: that for a great many years he has been in the habit of contracting
                    for the customs and all the other taxes of the <name>Aedui</name> at a small
                    cost, because when he bids, no one dares to bid against him. By these means he
                    has both increased his own private property, and amassed great means for giving
                    largesses; that he maintains constantly at his own expense and keeps about his
                    own person a great number of cavalry, and that not only at home, but even among
                    the neighboring states, he has great influence, and for the sake of
                    strengthening this influence has given his mother in marriage among the
                        <name>Bituriges</name> to a man the most noble and most influential there;
                    that he has himself taken a wife from among the <name type="ethnic">Helvetii</name>, and has given his sister by the mother's side and his
                    female relations in marriage into other states; that he favors and wishes well
                    to the <name type="ethnic">Helvetii</name> on account of this connection; and
                    that he hates <name type="pers">Caesar</name> and the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>, on his own account, because by their arrival his power was
                    weakened, and his brother, <name>Divitiacus</name>, restored to his former
                    position of influence and dignity: that, if any thing should happen to the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>, he entertains the highest hope of gaining the
                    sovereignty by means of the <name type="ethnic">Helvetii</name>, but that under
                    the government of the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people he despairs not
                    only of royalty, but even of that influence which he already has." <name type="pers">Caesar</name> discovered too, on inquiring into the unsuccessful
                    cavalry engagement which had taken place a few days before, that the
                    commencement of that flight had been made by <name>Dumnorix</name> and his
                    cavalry (for <name>Dumnorix</name> was in command of the cavalry which the
                        <name>Aedui</name> had sent for aid to <name type="pers">Caesar</name>);
                    that by their flight the rest of the cavalry were dismayed. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="19">
                <p>After learning these circumstances, since to these suspicions the most
                    unequivocal facts were added, viz., that he had led the <name type="ethnic">Helvetii</name> through the territories of the <name>Sequani</name>; that
                    he had provided that hostages should be mutually given; that he had done all
                    these things, not only without any orders of his <name>[Caesar</name>'s] and of
                    his own state's, but even without their [the <name>Aedui]</name> knowing any
                    thing of it themselves; that he [<name>Dumnorix</name>] was reprimanded: by the
                    [chief] magistrate of the <name>Aedui</name>; he [<name type="pers">Caesar</name>] considered that there was sufficient reason, why he should
                    either punish him himself, or order the state to do so. One thing [however]
                    stood in the way of all this-that he had learned by experience his brother
                        <name>Divitiacus</name>'s very high regard for the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people, his great affection toward him, his distinguished
                    faithfulness, justice, and moderation; for he was afraid lest by the punishment
                    of this man, he should hurt the feelings of <name>Divitiacus</name>. Therefore,
                    before he attempted any thing, he orders <name>Divitiacus</name> to be summoned
                    to him, and, when the ordinary interpreters had been withdrawn, converses with
                    him through <name>Caius Valerius Procillus</name>, chief of the province of
                        <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, an intimate friend of his, in whom he reposed the highest
                    confidence in every thing; at the same time he reminds him of what was said
                    about <name>Dumnorix</name> in the council of the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>, when he himself was present, and shows what each had said of
                    him privately in his <name>[Caesar</name>'s] own presence; he begs and exhorts
                    him, that, without offense to his feelings, he may either himself pass judgment
                    on him [<name>Dumnorix</name>] after trying the case, or else order the
                        [<name>Aeduan</name>] state to do so. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="20">
                <p><name>Divitiacus</name>, embracing <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, begins to
                    implore him, with many tears, that "he would not pass any very severe sentence
                    upon his brother; saying, that he knows that those charges are true, and that
                    nobody suffered more pain on that account than he himself did; for when he
                    himself could effect a very great deal by his influence at home and in the rest
                    of <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, and he [<name>Dumnorix</name>] very little on account of his
                    youth, the latter had become powerful through his means, which power and
                    strength he used not only to the lessening of his [<name>Divitiacus</name>]
                    popularity, but almost to his ruin; that he, however, was influenced both by
                    fraternal affection and by public opinion. But if any thing very severe from
                        <name type="pers">Caesar</name> should befall him [<name>Dumnorix</name>],
                    no one would think that it had been done without his consent, since he himself
                    held such a place in <name type="pers">Caesar</name>'s friendship: from which
                    circumstance it would arise, that the affections of the whole of <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name> would be estranged from him." As he was with tears begging
                    these things of <name type="pers">Caesar</name> in many words, <name type="pers">Caesar</name> takes his right hand, and, comforting him, begs him to make
                    an end of entreating, and assures him that his regard for him is so great, that
                    he forgives both the injuries of the republic and his private wrongs, at his
                    desire and prayers. He summons <name>Dumnorix</name> to him; he brings in his
                    brother; he points out what he censures in him; he lays before him what he of
                    himself perceives, and what the state complains of; he warns him for the future
                    to avoid all grounds of suspicion; he says that he pardons the past, for the
                    sake of his brother, <name>Divitiacus</name>. He sets spies over
                        <name>Dumnorix</name> that he may be able to know what he does, and with
                    whom he communicates. </p></div>

                <p>Being on the same day informed by his scouts, that the enemy had encamped at the
                    foot of a mountain eight miles from his own camp; he sent persons to ascertain

                    Word was brought back, that it was easy. During the third watch he orders

                    ascend to the highest ridge of the mountain with two legions, and with those as
                    guides who had examined the road; he explains what his plan is. He himself
                    during the fourth watch, hastens to them by the same route by which the enemy
                    had gone, and sends on all the cavalry before him. <name>Publius

                        <name>[Caesar</name>'s] own forces were seen near the enemy's camp, that the

                    having taken possession of the mountain, waiting for our men, and refraining
                    from battle. When, at length, the day was far advanced, <name type="pers">Caesar</name> learned through spies, that the mountain was in possession of
                    his own men, and that the <name type="ethnic">Helvetii</name> had moved their
                    camp, and that <name>Considius</name>, struck with fear, had reported to him, as
                    seen, that which he had not seen. On that day he follows the enemy at his usual
                    distance, and pitches his camp three miles from theirs. </p></div>

                    The <name>Helvetii</name>, either because they thought that the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>, struck with terror, were retreating from them,

                <p><name type="pers">Caesar</name>, when he observes this, draws off his forces to

                    himself, meanwhile, drew up on the middle of the hill a triple line of his four
                    veteran legions in such a manner, that he placed above him on the very summit

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="25">
                <p><name type="pers">Caesar</name>, having removed out of sight first his own horse,

                    the hope of flight, after encouraging his men, joined battle. His soldiers
                    hurling their javelins from the higher ground, easily broke the enemy's phalanx.
                    That being dispersed, they made a charge on them with drawn swords. It was a
                    great hinderance to the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> in fighting, that, when
                    several of their bucklers had been by one stroke of the (<name type="ethnic">Roman</name>) javelins pierced through and pinned fast together, as the
                    point of the iron had bent itself, they could neither pluck it out, nor, with
                    their left hand entangled, fight with sufficient ease; so that many, after
                    having long tossed their arm about, chose rather to cast away the buckler from
                    their hand, and to fight with their person unprotected. At length, worn out with
                    wounds, they began to give way, and, as there was in the neighborhood a mountain
                    about a mile off, to betake themselves thither. When the mountain had been

                    the <name type="ethnic">Helvetii</name> who had betaken themselves to the

                    having faced about, advanced to the attack in two divisions; the first and
                    second line, to withstand those who had been defeated and driven off the field;

                    had begun to do, betook themselves to the mountain; the other repaired to their
                    baggage and wagons. For during the whole of this battle, although the fight
                    lasted from the seventh hour [i.e. 12 (noon) 1 P. M.] to eventide, no one could
                    see an enemy with his back turned. The fight was carried on also at the baggage
                    till late in the night, for they had set wagons in the way as a rampart, and
                    from the higher ground kept throwing weapons upon our men, as they came on, and
                    some from between the wagons and the wheels kept darting their lances and
                    javelins from beneath, and wounding our men. After the fight had lasted some
                    time, our men gained possession of their baggage and camp. There the daughter

                <p>The <name>Helvetii</name>, compelled by the want of every thing, sent embassadors

                    arrived at that place, he demanded hostages, their arms, and the slaves who had

                    surrendered themselves, their flight might either be concealed or entirely

                    brought back, in the light of enemies; he admitted all the rest to a surrender,
                    upon their delivering up the hostages, arms, and deserters. He ordered the <name type="ethnic">Helvetii</name>, the <name>Tulingi</name>, and the

                    120,000 of them in <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>: that with these the
                        <name>Aedui</name> and their dependents had repeatedly struggled in
                    arms-that they had been routed, and had sustained a great calamity-had lost all
                    their nobility, all their senate, all their cavalry. And that broken by such
                    engagements and calamities, although they had formerly been very powerful in
                        <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, both from their own valor and from the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people's hospitality and friendship, they were now compelled
                    to give the chief nobles of their state, as hostages to the
                    <name>Sequani</name>, and to bind their state by an oath, that they would
                    neither demand hostages in return, nor supplicate aid from the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people, nor refuse to be forever under their sway
                    and empire. That he was the only one out of all the state of the
                        <name>Aedui</name>, who could not be prevailed upon to take the oath or to
                    give his children as hostages. On that account he had fled from his state and
                    had gone to the senate at <name key="perseus,Rome" type="place" n="  +Rome [12.4833,41.9] (Perseus) ">
                        <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>
                    </name> to beseech aid, as he alone was bound neither by oath nor hostages. But
                    a worse thing had befallen the victorious <name>Sequani</name> than the
                    vanquished <name>Aedui</name>, for <name>Ariovistus</name> the king of the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>, had settled in their territories, and had
                    seized upon a third of their land, which was the best in the whole of <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, and was now ordering them to depart from another third part,
                    because a few months previously 24,000 men of the <name>Harudes</name> had come
                    to him, for whom room and settlements must be provided. The consequence would
                    be, that in a few years they would all be driven from the territories of <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, and all the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> would cross the
                        <name key="tgn,7012611" type="place" n="Rhine [6,51.833] (river), Europe">

                    of the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>, nor must the habit of living of the
                    latter be put on a level with that of the former. Moreover, [as for]
                        <name>Ariovistus</name>, no sooner did he defeat the forces of the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> in a battle which took place at <name type="place">Magetobria</name>, than [he began] to lord it haughtily and
                    cruelly, to demand as hostages the children of all the principal nobles, and
                    wreak on them every kind of cruelty, if every thing was not done at his nod or
                    pleasure; that he was a savage, passionate, and reckless man, and that his
                    commands could no longer be borne. Unless there was some aid in <name type="pers">Caesar</name> and the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people,
                    the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> must all do the same thing that the <name type="ethnic">Helvetii</name> have done, [viz.] emigrate from their country,
                    and seek another dwelling place, other settlements remote from the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>, and try whatever fortune may fall to their
                    lot. If these things were to be disclosed to <name>Ariovistus</name>,
                        <name>[Divitiacus</name> adds] that he doubts not that he would inflict the
                    most severe punishment on all the hostages who are in his possession, [and says]
                    that <name type="pers">Caesar</name> could, either by his own influence and by
                    that of his army, or by his late victory, or by name of the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people, intimidate him, so as to prevent a greater number of
                        <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> being brought over the <name key="tgn,7012611" type="place" n="Rhine [6,51.833] (river), Europe">

                        <name>Ariovistus</name>. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="32">
                <p>When this speech had been delivered by <name>Divitiacus</name>, all who were
                    present began with loud lamentation to entreat assistance of <name type="pers">Caesar</name>. <name type="pers">Caesar</name> noticed that the
                        <name>Sequani</name> were the only people of all who did none of those
                    things which the others did, but, with their heads bowed down, gazed on the
                    earth in sadness. Wondering what was the reason of this conduct, he inquired of
                    themselves. No reply did the <name>Sequani</name> make, but silently continued
                    in the same sadness. When he had repeatedly inquired of them and could not
                    elicit any answer at all, the same <name>Divitiacus</name> the
                        <name>Aeduan</name> answered, that-"the lot of the <name>Sequani</name> was
                    more wretched and grievous than that of the rest, on this account, because they
                    alone durst not even in secret complain or supplicate aid; and shuddered at the
                    cruelty of <name>Ariovistus</name> [even when] absent, just as if he were
                    present; for, to the rest, despite of every thing there was an opportunity of
                    flight given; but all tortures must be endured by the <name>Sequani</name>, who
                    had admitted <name>Ariovistus</name> within their territories, and whose towns
                    were all in his power." </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="33">
                <p><name type="pers">Caesar</name>, on being informed of these things, cheered the
                    minds of the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> with his words, and promised that
                    this affair should be an object of his concern, [saying] that he had great hopes
                    that <name>Ariovistus</name>, induced both by his kindness and his power, would
                    put an end to his oppression. After delivering this speech, he dismissed the
                    assembly; and, besides those statements, many circumstances induced him to think
                    that this affair ought to be considered and taken up by him; especially as he
                    saw that the <name>Aedui</name>, styled [as they had been] repeatedly by the
                    senate "brethren" and "kinsmen," were held in the thraldom and dominion of the
                        <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>, and understood that their hostages were
                    with <name>Ariovistus</name> and the <name>Sequani</name>, which in so mighty an
                    empire [as that] of the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people he considered
                    very disgraceful to himself and the republic. That, moreover, the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> should by degrees become accustomed to cross
                    the <name key="tgn,7012611" type="place" n="Rhine [6,51.833] (river), Europe">
                        <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName>
                    </name>, and that a great body of them should come into <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, he saw [would
                    be] dangerous to the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people, and judged, that
                    wild and savage men would not be likely to restrain themselves, after they had
                    possessed themselves of all <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, from going forth into the
                    province and thence marching into <name key="tgn,1000080" type="place" n="Italy [12.833,42.833] (nation), Europe">Italy</name> (as the
                        <name>Cimbri</name> and <name>Teutones</name> had done before them),
                    particularly as the <name key="tgn,7023890" type="place" n="Rhone [4.833,43.333] (river), Europe">

                    </name> [was the sole barrier that] separated the <name>Sequani</name> from our
                    province. Against which events he thought he ought to provide as speedily as
                    possible. Moreover, <name>Ariovistus</name>, for his part, had assumed to
                    himself such pride and arrogance, that he was felt to be quite insufferable.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="34">
                <p>He therefore determined to send embassadors to <name>Ariovistus</name> to demand
                    of him to name some intermediate spot for a conference between the two, [saying]
                    that he wished to treat him on state-business and matters of the highest
                    importance to both of them. To this embassy <name>Ariovistus</name> replied,
                    that if he himself had had need of any thing from <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, he would have gone to him; and that if <name type="pers">Caesar</name> wanted any thing from him he ought to come to him. That,
                    besides, neither dare he go without an army into those parts of <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name> which <name type="pers">Caesar</name> had possession of, nor
                    could he, without great expense and trouble, draw his army together to one
                    place; that to him, moreover, it appeared strange, what business either <name type="pers">Caesar</name> or the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people at
                    all had in his own <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, which he had conquered in

                <p>When these answers were reported to <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, he sends
                    embassadors to him a second time with this message. "Since, after having been
                    treated with so much kindness by himself and the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people (as he had in his consulship been styled 'king and

                    recompense to [<name type="pers">Caesar</name>] himself and the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people, [viz.] that when invited to a conference
                    he demurs, and does not think that it concerns him to advise and inform himself
                    about an object of mutual interest, these are the things which he requires of
                    him; first, that he do not any more bring over any body of men across the <name key="tgn,7012611" type="place" n="Rhine [6,51.833] (river), Europe">

                    restore the hostages, which he has from the <name>Aedui</name>, and grant the

                    hostages which they have, and that he neither provoke the <name>Aedui</name> by
                    outrage nor make war upon them or their allies; if he would accordingly do
                    this," <name>[Caesar</name> says] that "he himself and the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people will entertain a perpetual feeling of favor and
                    friendship toward him; but that if he [<name type="pers">Caesar</name>] does not
                    obtain [his desires] that he (forasmuch as in the consulship of <name>Marcus
                        Messala</name> and <name>Marcus Piso</name> [<date when-custom="-61">61</date>
                    B.C.] the senate had decreed that, whoever should have the administration of the

                    do so consistently with the interests of the republic, protect the
                        <name>Aedui</name> and the other friends of the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people), will not overlook the wrongs of the

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="36">
                <p>To this <name>Ariovistus</name> replied, that "the right of war was, that they
                    who had conquered should govern those whom they had conquered, in what manner
                    they pleased; that in that way the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people were
                    wont to govern the nations which they had conquered, not according to the
                    dictation of any other, but according to their own discretion. If he for his
                    part did not dictate to the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people as to the
                    manner in which they were to exercise their right, he ought not to be obstructed
                    by the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people in his right; that the
                        <name>Aedui</name>, inasmuch as they had tried the fortune of war and had
                    engaged in arms and been conquered, had become tributaries to him; that <name type="pers">Caesar</name> was doing a great injustice, in that by his
                    arrival he was making his revenues less valuable to him; that he should not
                    restore their hostages to the <name>Aedui</name>, but should not make war
                    wrongfully either upon them or their allies, if they abided by that which had
                    been agreed on, and paid their tribute annually: if they did not continue to do
                    that, the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people's name of 'brothers' would
                    avail them naught. As to <name type="pers">Caesar</name>'s threatening him, that
                    he would not overlook the wrongs of the <name>Aedui</name>, [he said] that no
                    one had ever entered into a contest with him [<name>Ariovistus</name>] without
                    utter ruin to himself. That <name type="pers">Caesar</name> might enter the

                        <placeName key="tgn,7002933">Doubs</placeName>
                    </name> almost surrounds the whole town, as though it were traced round it with
                    a pair of compasses. A mountain of great height shuts in the remaining space,
                    which is not more than 600 feet, where the river leaves a gap, in such a manner
                    that the roots of that mountain extend to the river's bank on either side. A
                    wall thrown around it makes a citadel of this [mountain], and connects it with
                    the town. Hither <name type="pers">Caesar</name> hastens by forced marches by
                    night and day, and, after having seized the town, stations a garrison there.

                    incredible valor and practice in arms-that oftentimes they, on encountering
                    them, could not bear even their countenance, and the fierceness of their
                    eyes)-so great a panic on a sudden seized the whole army, as to discompose the
                    minds and spirits of all in no slight degree. This first arose from the tribunes
                    of the soldiers, the prefects and the rest, who, having followed <name type="pers">Caesar</name> from the city [<name key="perseus,Rome" type="place" n="  +Rome [12.4833,41.9] (Perseus) ">
                        <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>
                    </name>] from motives of friendship, had no great experience in military
                    affairs. And alleging, some of them one reason, some another, which they said
                    made it necessary for them to depart, they requested that by his consent they
                    might be allowed to withdraw; some, influenced by shame, stayed behind in order
                    that they might avoid the suspicion of cowardice. These could neither compose
                    their countenance, nor even sometimes check their tears: but hidden in their
                    tents, either bewailed their fate, or deplored with their comrades the general
                    danger. Wills were sealed universally throughout the whole camp. By the
                    expressions and cowardice of these men, even those who possessed great
                    experience in the camp, both soldiers and centurions, and those [the decurions]
                    who were in command of the cavalry, were gradually disconcerted. Such of them as
                    wished to be considered less alarmed, said that they did not dread the enemy,
                    but feared the narrowness of the roads and the vastness of the forests which lay
                    between them and <name>Ariovistus</name>, or else that the supplies could not be
                    brought up readily enough. Some even declared to <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, that when he gave orders for the camp to be moved and the troops
                    to advance, the soldiers would not be obedient to the command, nor advance in
                    consequence of their fear. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="40">
                <p>When <name type="pers">Caesar</name> observed these things, having called a
                    council, and summoned to it the centurions of all the companies, he severely
                    reprimanded them, "particularly, for supposing that it belonged to them to
                    inquire or conjecture, either in what direction they were marching, or with what
                    object. That <name>Ariovistus</name>, during his <name>[Caesar</name>'s]
                    consulship [<date when-custom="-59">59</date> B.C.], had most anxiously sought after
                    the friendship of the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people; why should any
                    one judge that he would so rashly depart from his duty? He for his part was
                    persuaded, that, when his demands were known and the fairness of the terms
                    considered, he would reject neither his nor the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name>
                    people's favor. But even if, driven on by rage and madness, he should make war
                    upon them, what after all were they afraid of?-or why should they despair either
                    of their own valor or of his zeal? Of that enemy a trial had been made within
                    our fathers' recollection, when, on the defeat of the <name>Cimbri</name> and
                        <name>Teutones</name> by <name>Caius Marius</name>, the army was regarded as
                    having deserved no less praise than their commander himself. It had been made
                    lately, too, in <name key="tgn,1000080" type="place" n="Italy [12.833,42.833] (nation), Europe">Italy</name>, during the
                    rebellion of the slaves, whom, however, the experience and training which they
                    had received from us, assisted in some respect. From which a judgment might be
                    formed of the advantages which resolution carries with it inasmuch as those whom
                    for some time they had groundlessly dreaded when unarmed, they had afterward
                    vanquished, when well armed and flushed with success. In short, that these were
                    the same men whom the <name type="ethnic">Helvetii</name>, in frequent
                    encounters, not only in their own territories, but also in theirs [the
                        <name>German]</name>, have generally vanquished, and yet can not have been a
                    match for our army. If the unsuccessful battle and flight of the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> disquieted any, these, if they made inquiries,
                    might discover that, when the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> had been tired
                    out by the long duration of the war, <name>Ariovistus</name>, after he had many
                    months kept himself in his camp and in the marshes, and had given no opportunity
                    for an engagement, fell suddenly upon them, by this time despairing of a battle
                    and scattered in all directions, and was victorious more through stratagem and
                    cunning than valor. But though there had been room for such stratagem against
                    savage and unskilled men, not even [<name>Ariovistus</name>] himself expected
                    that thereby our armies could be entrapped. That those who ascribed their fear
                    to a pretense about the [deficiency of] supplies and the narrowness of the
                    roads, acted presumptuously, as they seemed either to distrust their general's
                    discharge of his duty, or to dictate to him. That these things were his concern;
                    that the <name>Sequani</name>, the <name>Leuci</name>, and the <name key="tgn,7008343" type="place" n="  +Langres [5.333,47.883] (inhabited place), Haute-Marne, Champagne-Ardenne, France, Europe ">

                    that as to the road they would soon be able to judge for themselves. As to its
                    being reported that the soldiers would not be obedient to command, or advance,
                    he was not at all disturbed at that; for he knew, that in the case of all those
                    whose army had not been obedient to command, either upon some mismanagement of
                    an affair, fortune had deserted them, or, that upon some crime being discovered,
                    covetousness had been clearly proved [against them]. His integrity had been seen
                    throughout his whole life, his good fortune in the war with the <name type="ethnic">Helvetii</name>. That he would therefore instantly set about
                    what he had intended to put off till a more distant day, and would break up his
                    camp the next night, in the fourth watch, that he might ascertain, as soon as
                    possible, whether a sense of honor and duty, or whether fear had more influence
                    with them. But that, if no one else should follow, yet he would go with only the
                    tenth legion, of which he had no misgivings, and it should be his praetorian
                    cohort." This legion <name type="pers">Caesar</name> had both greatly favored,
                    and in it, on account of its valor, placed the greatest confidence. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="41">
                <p>Upon the delivery of this speech, the minds of all were changed in a surprising
                    manner, and the highest ardor and eagerness for prosecuting the war were
                    engendered; and the tenth legion was the first to return thanks to him, through
                    their military tribunes, for his having expressed this most favorable opinion of
                    them; and assured him that they were quite ready to prosecute the war. Then, the
                    other legions endeavored, through their military tribunes and the centurions of
                    the principal companies, to excuse themselves to <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, [saying] that they had never either doubted or feared, or
                    supposed that the determination of the conduct of the war was theirs and not
                    their general's. Having accepted their excuse, and having had the road carefully
                    reconnoitered by <name>Divitiacus</name>, because in him of all others he had
                    the greatest faith [he found] that by a circuitous route of more than fifty
                    miles he might lead his army through open parts; he then set out in the fourth
                    watch, as he had said [he would]. On the seventh day, as he did not discontinue
                    his march, he was informed by scouts that the forces of <name>Ariovistus</name>
                    were only four and twenty miles distant from ours. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="42">
                <p>Upon being apprized of <name type="pers">Caesar</name>'s arrival,
                        <name>Ariovistus</name> sends embassadors to him, [saying] that what he had
                    before requested as to a conference, might now, as far as his permission went,
                    take place, since he [<name type="pers">Caesar</name>] had approached nearer,
                    and he considered that he might now do it without danger. <name type="pers">Caesar</name> did not reject the proposal and began to think that he was
                    now returning to a rational state of mind as he spontaneously proffered that
                    which he had previously refused to him when requesting it; and was in great
                    hopes that, in consideration of his own and the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name>
                    people's great favors toward him, the issue would be that he would desist from
                    his obstinacy upon his demands being made known. The fifth day after that was
                    appointed as the day of conference. Meanwhile, as ambassadors were being often
                    sent to and fro between them, <name>Ariovistus</name> demanded that <name type="pers">Caesar</name> should not bring any foot-soldier with him to the
                    conference, [saying] that "he was afraid of being ensnared by him through
                    treachery; that both should come accompanied by cavalry; that he would not come
                    on any other condition." <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, as he neither wished
                    that the conference should, by an excuse thrown in the way, be set aside, nor
                    durst trust his life to the cavalry of the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>,
                    decided that it would be most expedient to take away from the
                        <name>Gallic</name> cavalry all their horses, and thereon to mount the
                    legionary soldiers of the tenth legion, in which he placed the greatest
                    confidence, in order that he might have a body-guard as trustworthy as possible,
                    should there be any need for action. And when this was done, one of the soldiers
                    of the tenth legion said, not without a touch of humor, "that <name type="pers">Caesar</name> did more for them than he had promised; he had promised to
                    have the tenth legion in place of his praetorian cohort; but he now converted
                    them into horse." </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="43">
                <p>There was a large plain, and in it a mound of earth of considerable size. This
                    spot was at nearly an equal distance from both camps. <name>Thither</name>, as
                    had been appointed, they came for the conference. <name type="pers">Caesar</name> stationed the legion, which he had brought [with him] on
                    horseback, 200 paces from this mound. The cavalry of <name>Ariovistus</name>
                    also took their stand at an equal distance. <name>Ariovistus</name> then
                    demanded that they should confer on horseback, and that, besides themselves,
                    they should bring with them ten men each to the conference. When they were come
                    to the place, <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, in the opening of his speech,
                    detailed his own and the senate's favors toward him [<name>Ariovistus</name>],
                    in that he had been styled king, in that [he had been styled] friend, by the
                    senate-in that very considerable presents had been sent him; which circumstance
                    he informed him had both fallen to the lot of few, and had usually been bestowed
                    in consideration of important personal services; that he, although he had
                    neither an introduction, nor a just ground for the request, had obtained these
                    honors through the kindness and munificence of himself [<name type="pers">Caesar</name>] and the senate. He informed him too, how old and how just
                    were the grounds of connection that existed between themselves [the
                        <name>Romans]</name> and the <name>Aedui</name>, what decrees of the senate
                    had been passed in their favor, and how frequent and how honorable; how from
                    time immemorial the <name>Aedui</name> had held the supremacy of the whole of
                        <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>; even [said <name>Caesar]</name> before they had sought our
                    friendship; that it was the custom of the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name>
                    people to desire not only that its allies and friends should lose none of their
                    property, but be advanced in influence, dignity, and honor: who then could
                    endure that what they had brought with them to the friendship of the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people should be torn from them?" He then made
                    the same demands which he had commissioned the embassadors to make, that
                        [<name>Ariovistus</name>] should not make war either upon the
                        <name>Aedui</name> or their allies, that he should restore the hostages;
                    that if he could not send back to their country any part of the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>, he should at all events suffer none of them
                    any more to cross the <name key="tgn,7012611" type="place" n="Rhine [6,51.833] (river), Europe">

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="44">
                <p><name>Ariovistus</name> briefly replied to the demands of <name type="pers">Caesar</name>; but expatiated largely on his own virtues, "that he had

                    great expectations and great rewards; that he had settlements in <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, granted by the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> themselves;
                    that the hostages had been given by their good-will; that he took by right of
                    war the tribute which conquerors are accustomed to impose on the conquered; that
                    he had not made war upon the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>, but the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> upon him; that all the states of <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name> came to attack him, and had encamped against him; that all
                    their forces had been routed and beaten by him in a single battle; that if they
                    chose to make a second trial, he was ready to encounter them again; but if they
                    chose to enjoy peace, it was unfair to refuse the tribute, which of their own
                    free-will they had paid up to that time. That the friendship of the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people ought to prove to him an ornament and a
                    safeguard, not a detriment; and that he sought it with that expectation. But if
                    through the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people the tribute was to be
                    discontinued, and those who surrendered to be seduced from him, he would
                    renounce the friendship of the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people no less
                    heartily than he had sought it. As to his leading over a host of <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> into <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, that he was doing this
                    with a view of securing himself, not of assaulting <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>: that there
                    was evidence of this, in that he did not come without being invited, and in that
                    he did not make war, but merely warded it off. That he had come into <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name> before the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people. That never
                    before this time did a <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> army go beyond the

                        [<name>Ariovistus</name>] domains?-that this was his province of <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, just as that is ours. As it ought not to be pardoned in him,
                    if he were to make an attack upon our territories; so, likewise, that we were
                    unjust, to obstruct him in his prerogative. As for <name type="pers">Caesar</name>'s saying that the <name>Aedui</name> had been styled
                    'brethren' by the senate, he was not so uncivilized nor so ignorant of affairs,
                    as not to know that the <name>Aedui</name> in the very last war with the
                        <name>Allobroges</name> had neither rendered assistance to the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>, nor received any from the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people in the struggles which the <name>Aedui</name> had been
                    maintaining with him and with the <name>Sequani</name>. He must feel suspicious,
                    that <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, though feigning friendship as the reason
                    for his keeping an army in <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, was keeping it with the
                    view of crushing him. And that unless he depart and withdraw his army from these
                    parts, he shall regard him not as a friend, but as a foe; and that, even if he
                    should put him to death, he should do what would please many of the nobles and
                    leading men of the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people; he had assurance of
                    that from themselves through their messengers, and could purchase the favor and
                    the friendship of them all by his <name>[Caesar</name>'s] death. But if he would
                    depart and resign to him the free possession of <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, he would
                    recompense him with a great reward, and would bring to a close whatever wars he
                    wished to be carried on, without any trouble or risk to him." </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="45">
                <p>Many things were stated by <name type="pers">Caesar</name> to the effect [to
                    show]; "why he could not waive the business, and that neither his nor the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people's practice would suffer him to abandon
                    most meritorious allies, nor did he deem that <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name> belonged to
                        <name>Ariovistus</name> rather than to the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name>
                    people; that the <name>Arverni</name> and the <name>Ruteni</name> had been
                    subdued in war by <name>Quintus Fabius Maximus</name>, and that the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people had pardoned them and had not reduced them
                    into a province or imposed a tribute upon them. And if the most ancient period
                    was to be regarded-then was the sovereignty of the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people in <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name> most just: if the decree of
                    the Senate was to be observed, then ought <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name> to be free, which they [the
                        <name>Romans]</name> had conquered in war, and had permitted to enjoy its
                    own laws." </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="46">
                <p>While these things are being transacted in the conference it was announced to
                        <name type="pers">Caesar</name> that the cavalry of <name>Ariovistus</name>
                    were approaching nearer the mound, and were riding up to our men, and casting
                    stones and weapons at them. <name type="pers">Caesar</name> made an end of his
                    speech and betook himself to his men; and commanded them that they should by no
                    means return a weapon upon the enemy. For though he saw that an engagement with
                    the cavalry would be without any danger to his chosen legion, yet he did not
                    think proper to engage, lest, after the enemy were routed, it might be said that
                    they had been insnared by him under the sanction of a conference. When it was
                    spread abroad among the common soldiery with what haughtiness
                        <name>Ariovistus</name> had behaved at the conference, and how he had
                    ordered the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> to quit <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, and how his
                    cavalry had made an attack upon our men, and how this had broken off the
                    conference, a much greater alacrity and eagerness for battle was infused into
                    our army. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="47">
                <p>Two days after, <name>Ariovistus</name> sends embassadors to <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, to state "that he wished to treat with him about those
                    things which had been begun to be treated of between them, but had not been
                    concluded;" [and to beg] that "he would either again appoint a day for a
                    conference; or, if he were not willing to do that, that he would send one of his
                    [officers] as an embassador to him." There did not appear to <name type="pers">Caesar</name> any good reason for holding a conference; and the more so as
                    the day before the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> could not be restrained
                    from casting weapons at our men. He thought he should not without great danger
                    send to him as embassador one of his [<name type="ethnic">Roman</name>]
                    officers, and should expose him to savage men. It seemed [therefore] most proper
                    to send to him <name type="pers">C. Valerius Procillus</name>, the son of <name type="pers">C. Valerius Caburus</name>, a young man of the highest courage
                    and accomplishments (whose father had been presented with the freedom of the
                    city by <name type="pers">C. Valerius Flaccus</name>), both on account of his
                    fidelity and on account of his knowledge of the <name>Gallic</name> language,
                    which <name>Ariovistus</name>, by long practice, now spoke fluently; and because
                    in his case the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> would have no motive for
                    committing violence; and [as his colleague] <name type="pers">M. Mettius</name>,
                    who had shared the hospitality of <name>Ariovistus</name>. He commissioned them
                    to learn what <name>Ariovistus</name> had to say, and to report to him. But when
                        <name>Ariovistus</name> saw them before him in his camp, he cried out in the
                    presence of his army, "Why were they come to him? Was it for the purpose of
                    acting as spies?" He stopped them when attempting to speak, and cast them into
                    chains. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="48">
                <p>The same day he moved his camp forward and pitched under a hill six miles from
                        <name type="pers">Caesar</name>'s camp. The day following he led his forces
                    past <name type="pers">Caesar</name>'s camp, and encamped two miles beyond him;
                    with this design that he might cut off <name type="pers">Caesar</name> from the
                    corn and provisions, which might be conveyed to him from the
                        <name>Sequani</name> and the <name>Aedui</name>. For five successive days
                    from that day, <name type="pers">Caesar</name> drew out his forces before the
                    camp, and put them in battle order, that, if <name>Ariovistus</name> should be
                    willing to engage in battle, an opportunity might not be wanting to him.
                        <name>Ariovistus</name> all this time kept his army in camp: but engaged
                    daily in cavalry skirmishes. The method of battle in which the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> had practiced themselves was this. There were
                    6,000 horse, and as many very active and courageous foot, one of whom each of
                    the horse selected out of the whole army for his own protection. By these [foot]
                    they were constantly accompanied in their engagements; to these the horse
                    retired; these on any emergency rushed forward; if any one, upon receiving a
                    very severe wound, had fallen from his horse, they stood around him: if it was
                    necessary to advance further than usual, or to retreat more rapidly, so great,
                    from practice, was their swiftness, that, supported by the manes of the horses,
                    they could keep pace with their speed. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="49">
                <p>Perceiving that <name>Ariovistus</name> kept himself in camp, <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, that he might not any longer be cut off from provisions,
                    chose a convenient position for a camp beyond that place in which the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> had encamped, at about 600 paces from them, and
                    having drawn up his army in three lines, marched to that place. He ordered the
                    first and second lines to be under arms; the third to fortify the camp. This
                    place was distant from the enemy about 600 paces, as has been stated.
                        <name>Thither Ariovistus</name> sent light troops, about 16,000 men in
                    number, with all his cavalry; which forces were to intimidate our men, and
                    hinder them in their fortification. <name type="pers">Caesar</name>
                    nevertheless, as he had before arranged, ordered two lines to drive off the
                    enemy: the third to execute the work. The camp being fortified, he left there
                    two legions and a portion of the auxiliaries; and led back the other four
                    legions into the larger camp. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="50">
                <p>The next day, according to his custom, <name type="pers">Caesar</name> led out
                    his forces from both camps, and having advanced a little from the larger one,
                    drew up his line of battle, and gave the enemy an opportunity of fighting. When
                    he found that they did not even then come out [from their intrenchments,] he led
                    back his army into camp about noon. Then at last <name>Ariovistus</name> sent
                    part of his forces to attack the lesser camp. The battle was vigorously
                    maintained on both sides till the evening. At sunset, after many wounds had been
                    inflicted and received, <name>Ariovistus</name> led back his forces into camp.
                    When <name type="pers">Caesar</name> inquired of his prisoners, wherefore
                        <name>Ariovistus</name> did not come to an engagement, he discovered this to
                    be the reason-that among the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> it was the
                    custom for their matrons to pronounce from lots and divination, whether it were
                    expedient that the battle should be engaged in or not; that they had said, "that
                    it was not the will of heaven that the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> should
                    conquer, if they engaged in battle before the new moon." </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="51">
                <p>The day following, <name type="pers">Caesar</name> left what seemed sufficient as
                    a guard for both camps; [and then] drew up all the auxiliaries in sight of the
                    enemy, before the lesser camp, because he was not very powerful in the number of
                    legionary soldiers, considering the number of the enemy; that [thereby] he might
                    make use of his auxiliaries for appearance. He himself, having drawn up his army
                    in three lines, advanced to the camp of the enemy. Then at last of necessity the
                        <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> drew their forces out of camp, and
                    disposed them canton by canton, at equal distances, the <name>Harudes</name>,
                        <name>Marcomanni</name>, <name>Tribocci</name>, <name>Vangiones</name>,
                        <name>Nemetes</name>, <name>Sedusii</name>, <name>Suevi</name>; and
                    surrounded their whole army with their chariots and wagons, that no hope might
                    be left in flight. On these they placed their women, who, with disheveled hair
                    and in tears, entreated the soldiers, as they went forward to battle, not to
                    deliver them into slavery to the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="52">
                <p><name type="pers">Caesar</name> appointed over each legion a lieutenant and a
                    questor, that every one might have them as witnesses of his valor. He himself
                    began the battle at the head of the right wing, because he had observed that
                    part of the enemy to be the least strong. Accordingly our men, upon the signal
                    being given, vigorously made an attack upon the enemy, and the enemy so suddenly
                    and rapidly rushed forward, that there was no time for casting the javelins at
                    them. Throwing aside [therefore] their javelins, they fought with swords hand to
                    hand. But the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>, according to their custom,
                    rapidly forming a phalanx, sustained the attack of our swords. There were found
                    very many of our soldiers who leaped upon the phalanx, and with their hands tore
                    away the shields, and wounded the enemy from above. Although the army of the
                    enemy was routed on the left wing and put to flight, they [still] pressed
                    heavily on our men from the right wing, by the great number of their troops. On
                    observing which, <name type="pers">P. Crassus</name>, a young man, who commanded
                    the cavalry-as he was more disengaged than those who were employed in the
                    fight-sent the third line as a relief to our men who were in distress.
                        </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="53">
                <p>Thereupon the engagement was renewed, and all the enemy turned their backs, nor
                    did they cease to flee until they arrived at the river <name key="tgn,7012611" type="place" n="Rhine [6,51.833] (river), Europe">
                        <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName>
                    </name>, about fifty miles from that place. There some few, either relying on
                    their strength, endeavored to swim over, or, finding boats, procured their
                    safety. Among the latter was <name>Ariovistus</name>, who meeting with a small
                    vessel tied to the bank, escaped in it; our horse pursued and slew all the rest
                    of them. <name>Ariovistus</name> had two wives, one a <name>Suevan</name> by
                    nation, whom he brought with him from home; the other a <name>Norican</name>,
                    the sister of king <name>Vocion</name>, whom he had married in <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, she having been sent [thither for that purpose] by her
                    brother. Both perished in that flight. Of their two daughters, one was slain,
                    the other captured. <name type="pers">C. Valerius Procillus</name>, as he was
                    being dragged by his guards in the fight, bound with a triple chain, fell into
                    the hands of <name type="pers">Caesar</name> himself, as he was pursuing the
                    enemy with his cavalry. This circumstance indeed afforded <name type="pers">Caesar</name> no less pleasure than the victory itself; because he saw a
                    man of the first rank in the province of <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, his intimate acquaintance
                    and friend, rescued from the hand of the enemy, and restored to him, and that
                    fortune had not diminished aught of the joy and exultation [of that day] by his
                    destruction. He <name>[Procillus]</name> said that, in his own presence, the
                    lots had been thrice consulted respecting him, whether he should immediately be
                    put to death by fire, or be reserved for another time: that by the favor of the
                    lots he was uninjured. <name type="pers">M. Mettius</name>, also, was found and

                    and he was also informed by letters from <name>Labienus</name>, that all the
                        <name>Belgae</name>, who we have said are a third part of <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, were entering into a confederacy against the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people, and giving hostages to one another; that
                    the reasons of the confederacy were these-first, because they feared that, after
                    all <name>[Celtic] <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName></name> was
                    subdued, our army would be led against them; secondly, because they were
                    instigated by several of the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>; some of whom as
                    [on the one hand] they had been unwilling that the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> should remain any longer in <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, so [on the
                    other] they were dissatisfied that the army of the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people should pass the winter in it, and settle there; and
                    others of them, from a natural instability and fickleness of disposition, were
                    anxious for a revolution; [the <name>Belgae</name> were instigated] by several,
                    also, because the government in <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name> was generally seized upon
                    by the more powerful persons and by those who had the means of hiring troops,
                    and they could less easily effect this object under our dominion. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
                <p>Alarmed by these tidings and letters, <name type="pers">Caesar</name> levied two

                    summer, sent <name type="pers">Q. Pedius</name>, his lieutenant, to conduct them
                    further into <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>. He, himself, as soon as
                    there began to be plenty of forage, came to the army. He gives a commission to
                    the <name key="tgn,1035697" type="place" n="  +Senones [6.983,48.4] (inhabited place), Vosges, Lorraine, France, Europe ">

                        <name>Belgae</name>, to learn what is going on among them [i.e. the

                    reported that troops were being raised, and that an army was being collected in
                    one place. Then, indeed, he thought that he ought not to hesitate about
                    proceeding toward them, and having provided supplies, moves his camp, and in
                    about fifteen days arrives at the territories of the <name>Belgae</name>.

                    have one government and one magistracy [in common] with themselves, from uniting

                    events, they assumed to themselves great authority and haughtiness in military
                    matters. The <name key="tgn,7011060" type="place" n="  +Reims [4.33,49.25] (inhabited place), Marne, Champagne-Ardenne, France, Europe ">

                    number, because being united to them by neighborhood and by alliances, they had
                    learned what number each state had in the general council of the

                    were the most powerful among them in valor, influence, and the number of men;
                    that these could muster 100,000 armed men, [and had] promised 60,000 picked men
                    out of that number, and demanded for themselves the command of the whole war.
                    That the <name>Suessiones</name> were their nearest neighbors and possessed a
                    very extensive and fertile country; that among them, even in our own memory,
                        <name>Divitiacus</name>, the most powerful man of all <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, had been king; who had held the government of a great part of

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5">
                <p><name type="pers">Caesar</name>, having encouraged the <name type="ethnic">Remi</name>, and addressed them courteously, ordered the whole senate to
                    assemble before him, and the children of their chief men to be brought to him as
                    hostages; all which commands they punctually performed by the day [appointed].
                    He, addressing himself to <name>Divitiacus</name>, the <name>Aeduan</name>, with
                    great earnestness, points out how much it concerns the republic and their common
                    security, that the forces of the enemy should be divided, so that it might not
                    be necessary to engage with so large a number at one time. [He asserts] that
                    this might be affected if the <name>Aedui</name> would lead their forces into
                    the territories of the <name>Bellovaci</name>, and begin to lay waste their
                    country. With these instructions he dismissed him from his presence. After he
                    perceived that all the forces of the <name>Belgae</name>, which had been
                    collected in one place, were approaching toward him, and learned from the scouts
                    whom he had sent out, and [also] from the <name type="ethnic">Remi</name>, that
                    they were then not far distant, he hastened to lead his army over the <name key="tgn,7012223" type="place" n="Aisne [0.416,49.45] (river), France, Europe">
                        <placeName key="tgn,7012223">Aisne</placeName>
                    </name>, which is on the borders of the <name type="ethnic">Remi</name>, and
                    there pitched his camp. This position fortified one side of his camp by the
                    banks of the river, rendered the country which lay in his rear secure from the
                    enemy, and furthermore insured that provisions might without danger be brought
                    to him by the <name type="ethnic">Remi</name> and the rest of the states. Over
                    that river was a bridge: there he places a guard; and on the other side of the
                    river he leaves <name type="pers">Q. Titurius Sabinus</name>, his lieutenant,
                    with six cohorts. He orders him to fortify a camp with a rampart twelve feet in
                    height, and a trench eighteen feet in breadth. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">
                <p>There was a town of the <name type="ethnic">Remi</name>, by name
                        <name>Bibrax</name>, eight miles distant from this camp. This the
                        <name>Belgae</name> on their march began to attack with great vigor. [The
                    assault] was with difficulty sustained for that day. The <name>Gauls</name>'
                    mode of besieging is the same as that of the <name>Belgae</name>: when after
                    having drawn a large number of men around the whole of the fortifications,
                    stones have begun to be cast against the wall on all sides, and the wall has
                    been stripped of its defenders, [then], forming a testudo, they advance to the
                    gates and undermine the wall: which was easily effected on this occasion; for
                    while so large a number were casting stones and darts, no one was able to
                    maintain his position upon the wall. When night had put an end to the assault,
                        <name>Iccius</name>, who was then in command of the town, one of the <name type="ethnic">Remi</name>, a man of the highest rank and influence among his
                    people, and one of those who had come to <name type="pers">Caesar</name> as
                    embassador [to sue] for peace, sends messengers to him, [to report] "That,
                    unless assistance were sent to him he could not hold out any longer." </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">
                <p><name>Thither</name>, immediately after midnight, <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, using as guides the same persons who had come to him as
                    messengers from <name>Iccius</name>, sends some <name>Numidian</name> and
                        <name>Cretan</name> archers, and some <name>Balearian</name> slingers as a
                    relief to the towns-people, by whose arrival both a desire to resist together
                    with the hope of [making good their] defense, was infused into the <name type="ethnic">Remi</name>, and, for the same reason, the hope of gaining the
                    town, abandoned the enemy. Therefore, after staying a short time before the
                    town, and laying waste the country of the <name type="ethnic">Remi</name>, when
                    all the villages and buildings which they could approach had been burned, they
                    hastened with all their forces to the camp of <name type="pers">Caesar</name>,
                    and encamped within less than two miles [of it]; and their camp, as was
                    indicated by the smoke and fires, extended more than eight miles in breadth.
                        </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="8">
                <p><name type="pers">Caesar</name> at first determined to decline a battle, as well
                    on account of the great number of the enemy as their distinguished reputation
                    for valor: daily, however, in cavalry actions, he strove to ascertain by
                    frequent trials, what the enemy could effect by their prowess and what our men
                    would dare. When he perceived that our men were not inferior, as the place
                    before the camp was naturally convenient and suitable for marshaling an army
                    (since the hill where the camp was pitched, rising gradually from the plain,
                    extended forward in breadth as far as the space which the marshaled army could
                    occupy, and had steep declines of its side in either direction, and gently
                    sloping in front gradually sank to the plain); on either side of that hill he
                    drew a cross trench of about four hundred paces, and at the extremities of that
                    trench built forts, and placed there his military engines, lest, after he had
                    marshaled his army, the enemy, since they were so powerful in point of number,
                    should be able to surround his men in the flank, while fighting. After doing
                    this, and leaving in the camp the two legions which he had last raised, that, if
                    there should be any occasion, they might be brought as a reserve, he formed the
                    other six legions in order of battle before the camp. The enemy, likewise, had
                    drawn up their forces which they had brought out of the camp. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="9">
                <p>There was a marsh of no great extent between our army and that of the enemy. The
                    latter were waiting to see if our men would pass this; our men, also, were ready
                    in arms to attack them while disordered, if the first attempt to pass should be
                    made by them. In the mean time battle was commenced between the two armies by a
                    cavalry action. When neither army began to pass the marsh, <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, upon the skirmishes of the horse [proving] favorable to our
                    men, led back his forces into the camp. The enemy immediately hastened from that
                    place to the river <name key="tgn,7012223" type="place" n="Aisne [0.416,49.45] (river), France, Europe">Aisne</name>, which it has
                    been; stated was behind our camp. Finding a ford there, they endeavored to lead
                    a part of their forces over it; with the design, that, if they could, they might
                    carry by storm the fort which <name type="pers">Q. Titurius</name>, <name type="pers">Caesar</name>'s lieutenant, commanded, and might cut off the
                    bridge; but, if they could not do that, they should lay waste the lands of the
                        <name type="ethnic">Remi</name>, which were of great use to us in carrying
                    on the war, and might hinder our men from foraging. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="10">
                <p><name type="pers">Caesar</name>, being apprized of this by <name type="pers">Titurius</name>, leads all his cavalry and light-armed
                        <name>Numidians</name>, slingers and archers, over the bridge, and hastens
                    toward them. There was a severe struggle in that place. Our men, attacking in
                    the river the disordered enemy, slew a great part of them. By the immense number
                    of their missiles they drove back the rest, who, in a most courageous manner
                    were attempting to pass over their bodies, and surrounded with their cavalry,
                    and cut to pieces those who had first crossed the river. The enemy, when they
                    perceived that their hopes had deceived them both with regard to their taking
                    the town by storm and also their passing the river, and did not see our men
                    advance to a more disadvantageous place for the purpose of fighting, and when
                    provisions began to fail them, having called a council, determined that it was
                    best for each to return to his country, and resolved to assemble from all
                    quarters to defend those into whose territories the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> should first march an army; that they might contend in their
                    own rather than in a foreign country, and might enjoy the stores of provision
                    which they possessed at home. Together with other causes, this consideration
                    also led them to that resolution, viz: that they had learned that
                        <name>Divitiacus</name> and the <name>Aedui</name> were approaching the
                    territories of the <name>Bellovaci</name>. And it was impossible to persuade the
                    latter to stay any longer, or to deter them from conveying succor to their own
                    people. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="11">
                <p>That matter being determined on, marching out of their camp at the second watch,
                    with great noise and confusion, in no fixed order, nor under any command, since
                    each sought for himself the foremost place in the journey, and hastened to reach
                    home, they made their departure appear very like a flight. <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, immediately learning this through his scouts, [but] fearing
                    an ambuscade, because he had not yet discovered for what reason they were
                    departing, kept his army and cavalry within the camp. At daybreak, the
                    intelligence having been confirmed by the scouts, he sent forward his cavalry to
                    harass their rear; and gave the command of it to two of his lieutenants, <name type="pers">Q. Pedius</name>, and <name type="pers">L. Aurunculeius
                        Cotta</name>. He ordered <name type="pers">T. Labienus</name>, another of
                    his lieutenants, to follow them closely with three legions. These, attacking
                    their rear, and pursuing them for many miles, slew a great number of them as
                    they were fleeing; while those in the rear with whom they had come up, halted,
                    and bravely sustained the attack of our soldiers; the van, because they appeared
                    to be removed from danger, and were not restrained by any necessity or command,
                    as soon as the noise was heard, broke their ranks, and, to a man, rested their
                    safety in flight. Thus without any risk [to themselves] our men killed as great
                    a number of them as the length of the day allowed; and at sunset desisted from
                    the pursuit, and betook themselves into the camp, as they had been commanded.

                    bring up the vineae, and to provide whatever things were necessary for the

                    that they had put their women, and those who through age appeared useless for
                    war, in a place to which there was no approach for an army, on account of the
                    marshes. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="17">
                <p>Having learned these things, he sends forward scouts and centurions to choose a
                    convenient place for the camp. And as a great many of the surrounding
                        <name>Belgae</name> and other <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>, following
                        <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, marched with him; some of these, as was
                    afterwards learned from the prisoners, having accurately observed, during those
                    days, the army's method of marching, went by night to the <name>Nervii</name>,
                    and informed them that a great number of baggage-trains passed between the
                    several legions, and that there would be no difficulty, when the first legion
                    had come into the camp, and the other legions were at a great distance, to
                    attack that legion while under baggage, which being routed, and the
                    baggage-train seized, it would come to pass that the other legions would not
                    dare to stand their ground. It added weight also to the advice of those who
                    reported that circumstance, that the <name>Nervii</name>, from early times,
                    because they were weak in cavalry, (for not even at this time do they attend to
                    it, but accomplish by their infantry whatever they can,) in order that they
                    might the more easily obstruct the cavalry of their neighbors if they came upon
                    them for the purpose of plundering, having cut young trees, and bent them, by
                    means of their numerous branches [extending] on to the sides, and the
                    quick-briars and thorns springing up between them, had made these hedges present
                    a fortification like a wall, through which it was not only impossible to enter,
                    but even to penetrate with the eye. Since [therefore] the march of our army
                    would be obstructed by these things, the <name>Nervii</name> thought that the
                    advice ought not to be neglected by them. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="18">
                <p>The nature of the ground which our men had chosen for the camp was this: A hill,
                    declining evenly from the top, extending to the river <name key="tgn,7008730" type="place" n="  +Sambre (river), Europe ">

                    </name>, which we have mentioned above: from this river there arose a [second]
                    hill of like ascent, on the other side and opposite to the former, and open for
                    about 200 paces at the lower part; but in the upper part, woody, (so much so)
                    that it was not easy to see through it into the interior. Within these woods the
                    enemy kept themselves in concealment; a few troops of horse-soldiers appeared on
                    the open ground, along the river. The depth of the river was about three feet.
                        </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="19">
                <p><name type="pers">Caesar</name>, having sent his cavalry on before, followed
                    close after them with all his forces; but the plan and order of the march was
                    different from that which the <name>Belgae</name> had reported to the
                        <name>Nervii</name>. For as he was approaching the enemy, <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, according to his custom, led on [as the van six legions
                    unencumbered by baggage; behind them he had placed the baggage-trains of the
                    whole army; then the two legions which had been last raised closed the rear, and
                    were a guard for the baggage-train. Our horse, with the slingers and archers,
                    having passed the river, commenced action with the cavalry of the enemy. While
                    they from time to time betook themselves into the woods to their companions, and
                    again made an assault out of the wood upon our men, who did not dare to follow
                    them in their retreat further than the limit to which the plain and open parts
                    extended, in the mean time the six legions which had arrived first, having
                    measured out the work, began to fortify the camp. When the first part of the
                    baggage train of our army was seen by those who lay hid in the woods, which had
                    been agreed on among them as the time for commencing action, as soon as they had
                    arranged their line of battle and formed their ranks within the woods, and had
                    encouraged one another, they rushed out suddenly with all their forces and made
                    an attack upon our horse. The latter being easily routed and thrown into
                    confusion, the <name>Nervii</name> ran down to the river with such incredible
                    speed that they seemed to be in the woods, the river, and close upon us almost
                    at the same time. And with the same speed they hastened up the hill to our camp,
                    and to those who were employed in the works. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="20">
                <p><name type="pers">Caesar</name> had every thing to do at one time: the standard
                    to be displayed, which was the sign when it was necessary to run to arms; the
                    signal to be given by the trumpet; the soldiers to be called off from the works;
                    those who had proceeded some distance for the purpose of seeking materials for
                    the rampart, to be summoned; the order of battle to be formed; the soldiers to
                    be encouraged; the watchword to be given. A great part of these arrangements was
                    prevented by the shortness of time and the sudden approach and charge of the
                    enemy. Under these difficulties two things proved of advantage; [first] the
                    skill and experience of the soldiers, because, having been trained by former
                    engagements, they could suggest to themselves what ought to be done, as
                    conveniently as receive information from others; and [secondly] that <name type="pers">Caesar</name> had forbidden his several lieutenants to depart
                    from the works and their respective legions, before the camp was fortified.
                    These, on account of the near approach and the speed of the enemy, did not then
                    wait for any command from <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, but of themselves
                    executed whatever appeared proper. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="21">
                <p><name type="pers">Caesar</name>, having given the necessary orders, hastened to
                    and fro into whatever quarter fortune carried him, to animate the troops, and
                    came to the tenth legion. Having encouraged the soldiers with no further speech
                    than that "they should keep up the remembrance of their wonted valor, and not be
                    confused in mind, but valiantly sustain the assault of the enemy ;" as the
                    latter were not further from them than the distance to which a dart could be
                    cast, he gave the signal for commencing battle. And having gone to another
                    quarter for the purpose of encouraging [the soldiers], he finds them fighting.
                    Such was the shortness of the time, and so determined was the mind of the enemy
                    on fighting, that time was wanting not only for affixing the military insignia,
                    but even for putting on the helmets and drawing off the covers from the shields.
                    To whatever part any one by chance came from the works (in which he had been
                    employed), and whatever standards he saw first, at these he stood, lest in
                    seeking his own company he should lose the time for fighting. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="22">
                <p>The army having been marshaled, rather as the nature of the ground and the
                    declivity of the hill and the exigency of the time, than as the method and order
                    of military matters required; while the legions in the different places were
                    withstanding the enemy, some in one quarter, some in another, and the view was
                    obstructed by the very thick hedges intervening, as we have before remarked,
                    neither could proper reserves be posted, nor could the necessary measures be
                    taken in each part, nor could all the commands be issued by one person.
                    Therefore, in such an unfavorable state of affairs, various events of fortune
                    followed. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="23">
                <p>The soldiers of the ninth and tenth legions, as they had been stationed on the
                    left part of the army, casting their weapons, speedily drove the
                        <name>Atrebates</name> (for that division had been opposed to them,) who
                    were breathless with running and fatigue, and worn out with wounds, from the
                    higher ground into the river; and following them as they were endeavoring to
                    pass it, slew with their swords a great part of them while impeded (therein).
                    They themselves did not hesitate to pass the river; and having advanced to a

                    put to flight the enemy, who had returned and were opposing them. In like
                    manner, in another quarter two different legions, the eleventh and the eighth,
                    having routed the <name>Veromandui</name>, with whom they had engaged, were
                    fighting from the higher ground upon the very banks of the river. But, almost
                    the whole camp on the front and on the left side being then exposed, since the
                    twelfth legion was posted in the right wing, and the seventh at no great
                    distance from it, all the <name>Nervii</name>, in a very close body, with
                        <name>Boduognatus</name>, who held the chief command, as their leader,
                    hastened toward that place; and part of them began to surround the legions on
                    their unprotected flank, part to make for the highest point of the encampment.

                    the right wing; where he perceived that his men were hard pressed, and that in
                    consequence of the standards of the twelfth legion being collected together in
                    one place, the crowded soldiers were a hinderance to themselves in the fight;
                    that all the centurions of the fourth cohort were slain, and the standard-bearer
                    killed, the standard itself lost, almost all the centurions of the other cohorts
                    either wounded or slain, and among them the chief centurion of the legion <name type="pers">P. Sextius Baculus</name>, a very valiant man, who was so
                    exhausted by many and severe wounds, that he was already unable to support
                    himself; he likewise perceived that the rest were slackening their efforts, and
                    that some, deserted by those in the rear, were retiring from the battle and
                    avoiding the weapons; that the enemy [on the other hand] though advancing from
                    the lower ground, were not relaxing in front, and were [at the same time]
                    pressing hard on both flanks; he also perceived that the affair was at a crisis,
                    and that there was not any reserve which could be brought up, having therefore
                    snatched a shield from one of the soldiers in the rear (for he himself had come
                    without a shield), he advanced to the front of the line, and addressing the
                    centurions by name, and encouraging the rest of the soldiers, he ordered them to
                    carry forward the standards, and extend the companies, that they might the more
                    easily use their swords. On his arrival, as hope was brought to the soldiers and
                    their courage restored, while every one for his own part, in the sight of his
                    general, desired to exert his utmost energy, the impetuosity of the enemy was a
                    little checked. </p></div>

                    stood close by him, was also hard pressed by the enemy, directed the tribunes of
                    the soldiers to effect a junction of the legions gradually, and make their
                    charge upon the enemy with a double front; which having been done, since they
                    brought assistance the one to the other, nor feared lest their rear should be
                    surrounded by the enemy, they began to stand their ground more boldly, and to
                    fight more courageously. In the mean time, the soldiers of the two legions which
                    had been in the rear of the army, as a guard for the baggage-train, upon the
                    battle being reported to them, quickened their pace, and were seen by the enemy
                    on the top of the hill; and <name>Titus Labienus</name>, having gained
                    possession of the camp of the enemy, and observed from the higher ground what
                    was going on in our camp, sent the tenth legion as a relief to our men, who,
                    when they had learned from the flight of the horse and the sutlers in what
                    position the affair was, and in how great danger the camp and the legion and the
                    commander were involved, left undone nothing [which tended] to dispatch.

                <p>By their arrival, so great a change of matters was made, that our men, even those
                    who had fallen down exhausted with wounds, leaned on their shields, and renewed
                    the fight: then the camp-retainers, though unarmed, seeing the enemy completely
                    dismayed, attacked [them though] armed; the horsemen too, that they might by
                    their valor blot the disgrace of their flight, thrust themselves before the
                    legionary soldiers in all parts of the battle. But the enemy, even in the last
                    hope of safety, displayed such great courage, that when the foremost of them had
                    fallen, the next stood upon them prostrate, and fought from their bodies; when
                    these were overthrown, and their corpses heaped up together, those who survived
                    cast their weapons against our men [thence], as from a mound, and returned our
                    darts which had fallen short between [the armies]; so that it ought not to be
                    concluded, that men of such great courage had injudiciously dared to pass a very
                    broad river, ascend very high banks, and come up to a very disadvantageous
                    place; since their greatness of spirit had rendered these actions easy, although

                    deserting all their towns and forts, they conveyed together all their
                    possessions into one town, eminently fortified by nature. While this town had on
                    all sides around it very high rocks and precipices, there was left on one side a
                    gently ascending approach, of not more than 200 feet in width; which place they
                    had fortified with a very lofty double wall: besides, they had placed stones of
                    great weight and sharpened stakes upon the walls. They were descended from the

                    neighbors, while one time they waged war offensively, and at another resisted it
                    when waged against them, concluded a peace with the consent of all, and chose

                <p>And on the first arrival of our army they made frequent sallies from the town,

                    a rampart of twelve feet [in height], and fifteen miles in circuit, they kept
                    themselves within the town. When, vineae having been brought up and a mound
                    raised, they observed that a tower also was being built at a distance, they at
                    first began to mock the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> from their wall, and
                    to taunt them with the following speeches. "For what purpose was so vast a
                    machine constructed at so great a distance? With what hands," or "with what
                    strength did they, especially [as they were] men of such very small stature"
                    (for our shortness of stature, in comparison to the great size of their bodies,

                    startled by the new and unaccustomed sight, they sent embassadors to <name type="pers">Caesar</name> [to treat] about peace; who spoke in the following
                    manner: "That they did not believe the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> waged
                    war without divine aid, since they were able to move forward machines of such a
                    height with so great speed, and thus fight from close quarters; that they
                    resigned themselves and all their possessions to <name>[Caesar</name>'s]
                    disposal: that they begged and earnestly entreated one thing, viz., that if
                    perchance, agreeable to his clemency and humanity, which they had heard of from
                    others, he should resolve that the <name>Aduatuci</name> were to be spared, he
                    would not deprive them of their arms; that all their neighbors were enemies to
                    them and envied their courage, from whom they could not defend themselves if
                    their arms were delivered up: that it was better for them, if they should be
                    reduced to that state, to suffer any fate from the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people, than to be tortured to death by those among whom they
                    had been accustomed to rule." </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="32">
                <p>To these things <name type="pers">Caesar</name> replied, "That he, in accordance
                    with his custom, rather than owing to their desert, should spare the state, if
                    they should surrender themselves before the battering-ram should touch the wall;
                    but that there was no condition of surrender, except upon their arms being
                    delivered up; that he should do to them that which he had done in the case of
                    the <name>Nervii</name>, and would command their neighbors not to offer any
                    injury to those who had surrendered to the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name>
                    people." The matter being reported to their countrymen, they said that they
                    would execute his commands. Having cast a very large quantity of their arms from
                    the wall into the trench that was before the town, so that the heaps of arms
                    almost equalled the top of the wall and the rampart, and nevertheless having
                    retained and concealed, as we afterward discovered, about a third part in the
                    town, the gates were opened, and they enjoyed peace for that day. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="33">
                <p>Toward evening <name type="pers">Caesar</name> ordered the gates to be shut, and
                    the soldiers to go out of the town, lest the towns-people should receive any
                    injury from them by night. They [the <name>Aduatuci]</name>, by a design before
                    entered into, as we afterwards understood, because they believed that, as a
                    surrender had been made, our men would dismiss their guards, or at least would
                    keep watch less carefully, partly with those arms which they had retained and
                    concealed, partly with shields made of bark or interwoven wickers, which they
                    had hastily covered over with skins, (as the shortness of time required) in the
                    third watch, suddenly made a sally from the town with all their forces [in that
                    direction] in which the ascent to our fortifications seemed the least difficult.
                    The signal having been immediately given by fires, as <name type="pers">Caesar</name> had previously commended, a rush was made thither [i. e. by
                    the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> soldiers] from the nearest fort; and the
                    battle was fought by the enemy as vigorously as it ought to be fought by brave
                    men, in the last hope of safety, in a disadvantageous place, and against those
                    who were throwing their weapons from a rampart and from towers; since all hope
                    of safety depended on their courage alone. About 4,000 of the men having been
                    slain, the rest were forced back into the town. The day after, <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, after breaking open the gates, which there was no one then
                    to defend, and sending in our soldiers, sold the whole spoil of that town. The
                    number of 53,000 persons was reported to him by those who had bought them.

                <p>When <name type="pers">Caesar</name> was setting out for <name key="tgn,1000080" type="place" n="Italy [12.833,42.833] (nation), Europe">Italy</name>, he
                    sent <name>Servius Galba</name> with the twelfth legion and part of the cavalry,
                    against the <name>Nantuates</name>, the <name>Veragri</name>, and
                        <name>Seduni</name>, who extend from the territories of the
                        <name>Allobroges</name>, and the lake of <name key="tgn,7007279" type="place" n="  +Geneve [6.15,46.216] (inhabited place), Geneve, Switzerland, Europe ">Geneva </name>, and the River <name key="tgn,7023890" type="place" n="Rhone [4.833,43.333] (river), Europe">Rhone </name> to the top of the
                        <name key="tgn,7007746" type="place" n="Alps (mountain system), Europe">Alps</name>. The reason for sending him was, that he desired that the pass
                    along the <name key="tgn,7007746" type="place" n="Alps (mountain system), Europe">Alps </name>, through which [the
                        <name>Roman]</name> merchants had been accustomed to travel with great
                    danger, and under great imposts, should be opened. He permitted him, if he
                    thought it necessary, to station the legion in these places, for the purpose of
                    wintering. <name>Galba</name> having fought some successful battles and stormed
                    several of their forts, upon embassadors being sent to him from all parts and
                    hostages given and a peace concluded, determined to station two cohorts among
                    the <name>Nantuates</name>, and to winter in person with the other cohorts of
                    that legion in a village of the <name>Veragri</name>, which is called
                        <name>Octodurus</name>; and this village being situated in a valley, with a
                    small plain annexed to it, is bounded on all sides by very high mountains. As
                    this village was divided into two parts by a river, he granted one part of it to
                    the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>, and assigned the other, which had been
                    left by them unoccupied, to the cohorts to winter in. He fortified this [latter]
                    part with a rampart and a ditch. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
                <p>When several days had elapsed in winter quarters, and he had ordered corn to be
                    brought in he was suddenly informed by his scouts that all the people had gone
                    off in the night from that part of the town which he had given up to the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>, and that the mountains which hung over it were
                    occupied by a very large force of the <name>Seduni</name> and
                        <name>Veragri</name>. It had happened for several reasons that the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> suddenly formed the design of renewing the war
                    and cutting off that legion. First, because they despised a single legion, on
                    account of its small number, and that not quite full (two cohorts having been
                    detached, and several individuals being absent, who had been dispatched for the
                    purpose of seeking provision); then, likewise, because they thought that on
                    account of the disadvantageous character of the situation, even their first
                    attack could not be sustained [by us] when they would rush from the mountains
                    into the valley, and discharge their weapons upon us. To this was added, that
                    they were indignant that their children were torn from them under the title of
                    hostages, and they were persuaded that the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>
                    designed to seize upon the summits of the <name key="tgn,7007746" type="place" n="Alps (mountain system), Europe">Alps </name>, and unite those parts to
                    the neighboring province [of <name>Gaul]</name>, not only to secure the passes,
                    but also a constant possession. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
                <p>Having received these tidings, <name>Galba</name>, since the works of the
                    winter-quarters and the fortifications were not fully completed, nor was
                    sufficient preparation made with regard to corn and other provisions (since, as
                    a surrender had been made, and hostages received, he had thought he need
                    entertain no apprehension of war), speedily summoning a council, began to
                    anxiously inquire their opinions. In which council, since so much sudden danger
                    had happened contrary to the general expectation, and almost all the higher
                    places were seen already covered with a multitude of armed men, nor could
                    [either] troops come to their relief, or provisions be brought in, as the passes
                    were blocked up [by the enemy]; safety being now nearly despaired of, some
                    opinions of this sort were delivered: that, "leaving their baggage, and making a
                    sally, they should hasten away for safety by the same routes by which they had
                    come thither." To the greater part, however, it seemed best, reserving that
                    measure to the last, to await the issue of the matter, and to defend the camp.
                        </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
                <p>A short time only having elapsed, so that time was scarcely given for arranging
                    and executing those things which they had determined on, the enemy, upon the
                    signal being given, rushed down [upon our men] from all parts, and discharged
                    stones and darts, upon our rampart. Our men at first, while their strength was
                    fresh, resisted bravely, nor did they cast any weapon ineffectually from their
                    higher station. As soon as any part of the camp, being destitute of defenders,
                    seemed to be hard pressed, thither they ran, and brought assistance. But they
                    were over-matched in this, that the enemy when wearied by the long continuance
                    of the battle, went out of the action, and others with fresh strength came in
                    their place; none of which things could be done by our men, owing to the
                    smallness of their number; and not only was permission not given to the wearied
                        [<name type="ethnic">Roman</name>] to retire from the fight, but not even to
                    the wounded [was liberty granted] to quit the post where he had been stationed,
                    and recover. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5">
                <p>When they had now been fighting for more than six hours, without cessation, and
                    not only strength, but even weapons were failing our men, and the enemy were
                    pressing on more rigorously, and had begun to demolish the rampart and to fill
                    up the trench, while our men were becoming exhausted, and the matter was now
                    brought to the last extremity, <name type="pers">P. Sextius Baculus</name>, a
                    centurion of the first rank, whom we have related to have been disabled by
                    severe wounds in the engagement with the <name>Nervii</name>, and also <name type="pers">C. Volusenus</name>, a tribune of the soldiers, a man of great
                    skill and valor, hasten to <name>Galba</name>, and assure him that the only hope
                    of safety lay in making a sally, and trying the last resource. Whereupon
                    assembling the centurions, he quickly gives orders to the soldiers to
                    discontinue the fight a short time, and only collect the weapons flung [at
                    them], and recruit themselves after their fatigue, and afterward, upon the
                    signal being given, sally forth from the camp, and place in their valor all
                    their hope of safety. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">
                <p>They do what they were ordered; and, making a sudden sally from all the gates [of
                    the camp], leave the enemy the means neither of knowing what was taking place,
                    nor of collecting themselves. Fortune thus taking a turn, [our men] surround on
                    every side, and slay those who had entertained the hope of gaining the camp and
                    having killed more than the third part of an army of more than 30,000 men (which
                    number of the barbarians it appeared certain had come up to our camp), put to
                    flight the rest when panic-stricken, and do not suffer them to halt even upon
                    the higher grounds. All the forces of the enemy being thus routed, and stripped
                    of their arms, [our men] betake themselves to their camp and fortifications.
                    Which battle being finished, inasmuch as <name>Galba</name> was unwilling to
                    tempt fortune again, and remembered that he had come into winter quarters with
                    one design, and saw that he had met with a different state of affairs; chiefly
                    however urged by the want of corn and provision, having the next day burned all
                    the buildings of that village, he hastens to return into the province; and as no
                    enemy opposed or hindered his march, he brought the legion safe into the
                    [country of the] <name>Nantuates</name>, thence into [that of] the
                        <name>Allobroges</name>, and there wintered. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">
                <p>These things being achieved, while <name type="pers">Caesar</name> had every
                    reason to suppose that <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name> was reduced to a state of
                    tranquillity, the <name>Belgae</name> being overcome, the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> expelled, the <name>Seduni</name> among the <name key="tgn,7007746" type="place" n="Alps (mountain system), Europe">Alps

                    sprang up in <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>. The occasion of that war
                    was this: <name type="pers">P. Crassus</name>, a young man, had taken up his
                    winter quarters with the seventh legion among the Andes, who border upon the
                        <name key="tgn,7014206" type="place" n="Atlantic Ocean [-40,1] (ocean)">[Atlantic] ocean</name>. He, as there was a scarcity of corn in those
                    parts, sent out some officers of cavalry, and several military tribunes among
                    the neighbouring states, for the purpose of procuring corn and provision; in
                    which number <name type="pers">T. Terrasidius</name> was sent among the
                        <name>Esubii</name>; <name type="pers">M. Trebius Gallus</name> among the

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="8">
                <p>The influence of this state is by far the most considerable of any of the
                    countries on the whole sea coast, because the <name>Veneti</name> both have a
                    very great number of ships, with which they have been accustomed to sail to
                        <name key="tgn,7008653" type="place" n="Great Britain (island), United Kingdom, Europe">Britain</name>, and
                    [thus] excel the rest in their knowledge and experience of nautical affairs; and
                    as only a few ports lie scattered along that stormy and open sea, of which they
                    are in possession, they hold as tributaries almost all those who are accustomed
                    to traffic in that sea. With them arose the beginning [of the revolt] by their
                    detaining <name type="pers">Silius</name> and <name type="pers">Velanius</name>;
                    for they thought that they should recover by their means the hostages which they
                    had given to <name type="pers">Crassus</name>. The neighboring people led on by
                    their influence (as the measures of the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> are
                    sudden and hasty), detain <name type="pers">Trebius</name> and <name type="pers">Terrasidius</name> for the same motive; and quickly sending embassadors, by
                    means of their leading men, they enter into a mutual compact to do nothing
                    except by general consent, and abide the same issue of fortune; and they solicit
                    the other states to choose rather to continue in that liberty which they had
                    received from their ancestors, than endure slavery under the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>. All the sea coast being quickly brought over to their
                    sentiments, they send a common embassy to <name type="pers">P. Crassus</name>
                    [to say], "If he wished to receive back his officers, let him send back to them
                    their hostages." </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="9">
                <p><name type="pers">Caesar</name>, being informed of these things by <name type="pers">Crassus</name>, since he was so far distant himself, orders
                    ships of war to be built in the mean time on the river <name key="tgn,7012249" type="place" n="  +Loire (river), France, Europe ">Loire </name>, which
                    flows into the ocean; rowers to be raised from the province; sailors and pilots
                    to be provided. These matters being quickly executed, he himself, as soon as the
                    season of the year permits, hastens to the army. The <name>Veneti</name>, and
                    the other states also, being informed of <name type="pers">Caesar</name>'s
                    arrival, when they reflected how great a crime they had committed, in that, the
                    embassadors (a character which had among all nations ever been sacred and
                    inviolable) had by them been detained and thrown into prison, resolve to prepare
                    for a war in proportion to the greatness of their danger, and especially to
                    provide those things which appertain to the service of a navy, with the greater
                    confidence, inasmuch as they greatly relied on the nature of their situation.
                    They knew that the passes by land were cut off by estuaries, that the approach
                    by sea was most difficult, by reason of our ignorance of the localities, [and]
                    the small number of the harbors, and they trusted that our army would not be
                    able to stay very long among them, on account of the insufficiency of corn; and
                    again, even if all these things should turn out contrary to their expectation,
                    yet they were very powerful in their navy. They well understood that the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> neither had any number of ships, nor were
                    acquainted with the shallows, the harbors, or the islands of those parts where
                    they would have to carry on the war; and the navigation was very different in a
                    narrow sea from what it was in the vast and open ocean. Having come to this
                    resolution, they fortify their towns, convey corn into them from the country
                    parts, bring together as many ships as possible to <name key="tgn,7018159" type="place" n="  +Venice [12.333,45.433] (inhabited place), Venezia, Veneto, Italy, Europe ">Venetia </name>, where it appeared <name type="pers">Caesar</name> would at

                <p>There were these difficulties which we have mentioned above, in carrying on the

                    that war;-the open insult offered to the state in the detention of the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> knights, the rebellion raised after surrendering,
                    the revolt after hostages were given, the confederacy of so many states, but
                    principally, lest if, [the conduct of] this part was overlooked, the other

                <p>The sites of their towns were generally such that, being placed on extreme points
                    [of land] and on promontories, they neither had an approach by land when the
                    tide had rushed in from the main ocean, which always happens twice in the space
                    of twelve hours; nor by ships, because, upon the tide ebbing again, the ships
                    were likely to be dashed upon the shoals. Thus, by either circumstance, was the
                    storming of their towns rendered difficult; and if at any time perchance the
                        <name>Veneti</name> overpowered by the greatness of our works, (the sea
                    having been excluded by a mound and large dams, and the latter being made almost
                    equal in height to the walls of the town) had begun to despair of their
                    fortunes; bringing up a large number of ships, of which they had a very great
                    quantity, they carried off all their property and betook themselves to the
                    nearest towns; there they again defended themselves by the same advantages of
                    situation. They did this the more easily during a great part of the summer,
                    because our ships were kept back by storms, and the difficulty of sailing was
                    very great in that vast and open sea, with its strong tides and its harbors far
                    apart and exceedingly few in number. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="13">
                <p>For their ships were built and equipped after this manner. The keels were
                    somewhat flatter than those of our ships, whereby they could more easily
                    encounter the shallows and the ebbing of the tide: the prows were raised very
                    high, and, in like manner the sterns were adapted to the force of the waves and
                    storms [which they were formed to sustain]. The ships were built wholly of oak,
                    and designed to endure any force and violence whatever; the benches which were
                    made of planks a foot in breadth, were fastened by iron spikes of the thickness
                    of a man's thumb; the anchors were secured fast by iron chains instead of
                    cables, and for sails they used skins and thin dressed leather. These [were
                    used] either through their want of canvas and their ignorance of its
                    application, or for this reason, which is more probable, that they thought that
                    such storms of the ocean, and such violent gales of wind could not be resisted
                    by sails, nor ships of such great burden be conveniently enough managed by them.
                    The encounter of our fleet with these ships' was of such a nature that our fleet
                    excelled in speed alone, and the plying of the oars; other things, considering
                    the nature of the place [and] the violence of the storms, were more suitable and
                    better adapted on their side; for neither could our ships injure theirs with
                    their beaks (so great was their strength), nor on account of their height was a
                    weapon easily cast up to them; and for the same reason they were less readily
                    locked in by rocks. To this was added, that whenever a storm began to rage and
                    they ran before the wind, they both could weather the storm more easily and
                    heave to securely in the shallows, and when left by the tide feared nothing from
                    rocks and shelves: the risk of all which things was much to be dreaded by our
                    ships. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="14">
                <p><name type="pers">Caesar</name>, after taking many of their towns, perceiving
                    that so much labor was spent in vain and that the flight of the enemy could not
                    be prevented on the capture of their towns, and that injury could not be done
                    them, he determined to wait for his fleet. As soon as it came up and was first
                    seen by the enemy, about 220 of their ships, fully equipped and appointed with
                    every kind of [naval] implement, sailed forth from the harbor, and drew up
                    opposite to ours; nor did it appear clear to <name type="pers">Brutus</name>,
                    who commanded the fleet, or to the tribunes of the soldiers and the centurions,
                    to whom the several ships were assigned, what to do, or what system of tactics
                    to adopt; for they knew that damage could not be done by their beaks; and that,
                    although turrets were built [on their decks], yet the height of the stems of the
                    barbarian ships exceeded these; so that weapons could not be cast up from [our]
                    lower position with sufficient effect, and those cast by the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> fell the more forcibly upon us. One thing provided by our men
                    was of great service, [viz.] sharp hooks inserted into and fastened upon poles,
                    of a form not unlike the hooks used in attacking town walls. When the ropes
                    which fastened the sail-yards to the masts were caught by them and pulled, and
                    our vessel vigorously impelled with the oars, they [the ropes] were severed; and
                    when they were cut away, the yards necessarily fell down; so that as all the
                    hope of the <name>Gallic</name> vessels depended on their sails and rigging,
                    upon these being cut away, the entire management of the ships was taken from
                    them at the same time. The rest of the contest depended on courage; in which our
                    men decidedly had the advantage; and the more so, because the whole action was
                    carried on in the sight of <name type="pers">Caesar</name> and the entire army;
                    so that no act, a little more valiant than ordinary, could pass unobserved, for
                    all the hills and higher grounds, from which there was a near prospect of the
                    sea were occupied by our army. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="15">
                <p>The sail yards [of the enemy], as we have said, being brought down, although two
                    and [in some cases] three ships [of theirs] surrounded each one [of ours], the
                    soldiers strove with the greatest energy to board the ships of the enemy; and,
                    after the barbarians observed this taking place, as a great many of their ships
                    were beaten, and as no relief for that evil could be discovered, they hastened
                    to seek safety in flight. And, having now turned their vessels to that quarter
                    in which the wind blew, so great a calm and lull suddenly arose, that they could
                    not move out of their place, which circumstance, truly, was exceedingly
                    opportune for finishing the business; for our men gave chase and took them one
                    by one, so that very few out of all the number, [and those] by the intervention
                    of night, arrived at the land, after the battle had lasted almost from the
                    fourth hour till sun-set. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="16">
                <p>By this battle the war with the <name>Veneti</name> and the whole of the sea

                    in whom there was any discretion or rank, had assembled in that battle; and they
                    had collected in that one place whatever naval forces they had anywhere; and
                    when these were lost, the survivors had no place to retreat to, nor means of
                    defending their towns. They accordingly surrendered themselves and all their
                    possessions to <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, on whom <name type="pers">Caesar</name> thought that punishment should be inflicted the more
                    severely, in order that for the future the rights of embassadors might be more
                    carefully respected by barbarians; having, therefore, put to death all their
                    senate, he sold the rest for slaves. </p></div>

                <p>While these things are going on among the <name>Veneti</name>, <name type="pers">Q. Titurius Sabinus</name> with those troops which he had received from
                        <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, arrives in the territories of the

                    held the chief command of all those states which had revolted; from which he had
                    collected a large and powerful army. And in those few days, the
                        <name>Aulerci</name> and the <name>Sexovii</name>, having slain their senate
                    because they would not consent to be promoters of the war, shut their gates
                    [against us] and united themselves to <name>Viridovix</name>; a great multitude
                    besides of desperate men and robbers assembled out of <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name> from all
                    quarters, whom the hope of plundering and the love of fighting had called away
                    from husbandry and their daily labor. <name type="pers">Sabinus</name> kept
                    himself within his camp, which was in a position convenient for everything;
                    while <name>Viridovix</name> encamped over against him at a distance of two
                    miles, and daily bringing out his forces, gave him an opportunity of fighting;
                    so that <name type="pers">Sabinus</name> had now not only come into contempt
                    with the enemy, but also was somewhat taunted by the speeches of our soldiers;
                    and furnished so great a suspicion of his cowardice that the enemy presumed to
                    approach even to the very rampart of our camp. He adopted this conduct for the
                    following reason: because he did not think that a lieutenant ought to engage in
                    battle with so great a force, especially while he who held the chief command was
                    absent, except on advantageous ground or some favorable circumstance presented
                    itself. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="18">
                <p>After having established this suspicion of his cowardice, he selected a certain
                    suitable and crafty <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, who was one of those whom
                    he had with him as auxiliaries. He induces him by great gifts and promises to go
                    over to the enemy; and informs [him] of what he wished to be done. Who, when he
                    arrives among them as a deserter, lays before them the fears of the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>; and informs them by what difficulties <name type="pers">Caesar</name> himself was harassed, and that the matter was not
                    far removed from this- that <name type="pers">Sabinus</name> would the next
                    night privately draw off his army out of the camp and set forth to <name type="pers">Caesar</name> for the purpose of carrying [him] assistance,
                    which, when they heard, they a11 cry out together that an opportunity of
                    successfully conducting their enterprise, ought not to be thrown away: that they
                    ought to go to the [<name type="ethnic">Roman</name>] camp. Many things
                    persuaded the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> to this measure; the delay of
                        <name type="pers">Sabinus</name> during the previous days; the positive
                    assertion of the [pretended] deserter; want of provisions, for a supply of which
                    they had not taken the requisite precautions; the hope springing from the
                        <name>Venetic</name> war; and [also] because in most cases men willingly
                    believe what they wish. Influenced by these things they do not discharge
                        <name>Viridovix</name> and the other leaders from the council, before they
                    gained permission from them to take up arms and hasten to [our] camp; which
                    being granted, rejoicing as if victory were fully certain, they collected
                    faggots and brushwood, with which to fill up the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> trenches, and hasten to the camp. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="19">
                <p>The situation of the camp was a rising ground, gently sloping from the bottom for
                    about a mile. <name>Thither</name> they proceeded with great speed (in order
                    that as little time as possible might be given to the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> to collect and arm themselves), and arrived quite out of
                    breath. <name type="pers">Sabinus</name> having encouraged his men, gives them
                    the signal, which they earnestly desired. While the enemy were encumbered by
                    reason of the burdens which they were carrying, he orders a sally to be made
                    suddenly from two gates [of the camp]. It happened, by the advantage of
                    situation, by the unskilfulness and the fatigue of the enemy, by the valor of
                    our soldiers, and their experience in former battles, that they could not stand
                    one attack of our men, and immediately turned their backs; and our men with full
                    vigor followed them while disordered, and slew a great number of them; the horse
                    pursuing the rest, left but few, who escaped by flight. Thus at the same time,
                        <name type="pers">Sabinus</name> was informed of the naval battle and <name type="pers">Caesar</name> of victory gained by <name type="pers">Sabinus</name>; and all the states immediately surrendered themselves to
                        <name type="pers">Titurius</name>: for as the temper of the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> is impetuous and ready to undertake wars, so

                    had heard that a town fortified by the nature of the place and by art, had been
                    taken by us in a few days after our arrival there, began to send embassadors
                    into all quarters, to combine, to give hostages one to another, to raise troops.
                        <name>Embassadors</name> also are sent to those states of Hither <name key="tgn,1000095" type="place" n="Spain [-4,40] (nation), Europe">Spain</name> which are nearest to <name key="tgn,7002878" type="place" n="Aquitaine [1,44.583] (region), France, Europe">Aquitania </name>, and
                    auxiliaries and leaders are summoned from them; on whose arrival they proceed to
                    carry on the war with great confidence, and with a great host of men. They who
                    had been with <name type="pers">Q. Sertorius</name> the whole period [of his war
                    in <name type="place">Spain]</name> and were supposed to have very great skill
                    in military matters, are chosen leaders. These, adopting the practice of the
                        <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people, begin to select [advantageous]
                    places, to fortify their camp, to cut off our men from provisions, which, when
                        <name type="pers">Crassus</name> observes, [and likewise] that his forces,
                    on account of their small number could not safely be separated; that the enemy
                    both made excursions and beset the passes, and [yet] left sufficient guard for
                    their camp; that on that account, corn and provision could not very conveniently
                    be brought up to him, and that the number of the enemy was daily increased, he
                    thought that he ought not to delay in giving battle. This matter being brought
                    to a council, when he discovered that all thought the same thing, he appointed
                    the next day for the fight. </p></div>

                <p>Having drawn out all his forces at the break of day, and marshaled them in a
                    double line, he posted the auxiliaries in the center, and waited to see what
                    measures the enemy would take. They, although on account of their great number
                    and their ancient renown in war, and the small number of our men, they supposed
                    they might safely fight, nevertheless considered it safer to gain the victory
                    without any wound, by besetting the passes [and] cutting off the provisions: and
                    if the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>, on account of the want of corn, should
                    begin to retreat, they intended to attack them while encumbered in their march
                    and depressed in spirit [as being assailed while] under baggage. This measure
                    being approved of by the leaders and the forces of the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> drawn out, the enemy [still] kept themselves in their camp.

                    the enemy, intimidated by their own delay, and by the reputation [i.e. for
                    cowardice arising thence] had rendered our soldiers more eager for fighting, and
                    the remarks of all were heard [declaring] that no longer ought delay to be made

                    and the auxiliaries, on whom <name type="pers">Crassus</name> did not much rely
                    in the battle, by supplying stones and weapons [to the soldiers], and by
                    conveying turf to the mound, presented the appearance and character of men

                    and their weapons, discharged from their higher position, fell with great

                    wished to have done. They, as they had been commanded, having brought out the
                    four cohorts, which, as they had been left as a guard for the camp, were not
                    fatigued by exertion, and having led them round by a some what longer way, lest
                    they could be seen from the camp of the enemy, when the eyes and minds of all
                    were intent upon the battle, quickly arrived at those fortifications which we
                    have spoken of, and, having demolished these, stood in the camp of the enemy
                    before they were seen by them, or it was known what was going on. And then, a
                    shout being heard in that quarter, our men, their strength having been
                    recruited, (which usually occurs on the hope of victory), began to fight more
                    vigorously. The enemy surrounded on all sides, [and] all their affairs being
                    despaired of, made great attempts to cast themselves down over the ramparts and
                    to seek safety in flight. These the cavalry pursued over the very open plains,
                    and after leaving scarcely a fourth part out of the number of 50,000, which it

                        <name>Morini</name> and the <name>Menapii</name> alone remained in arms, and
                    had never sent embassadors to him [to make a treaty] of peace, speedily led his
                    army thither, thinking that that war might soon be terminated. They resolved to
                    conduct the war on a very different method from the rest of the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>; for as they perceived that the greatest nations
                    [of <name>Gaul]</name> who had engaged in war, had been routed and overcome, and
                    as they possessed continuous ranges of forests and morasses, they removed
                    themselves and all their property thither. When <name type="pers">Caesar</name>
                    had arrived at the opening of these forests, and had began to fortify his camp,
                    and no enemy was in the mean time seen, while our men were dispersed on their
                    respective duties, they suddenly rushed out from all parts of the forest, and
                    made an attack on our men. The latter quickly took up arms and drove them back
                    again to their forests; and having killed a great many, lost a few of their own
                    men while pursuing them too far through those intricate places. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="29">
                <p>During the remaining days after this, <name type="pers">Caesar</name> began to
                    cut down the forests; and that no attack might be made on the flank of the
                    soldiers, while unarmed and not foreseeing it, he placed together (opposite to
                    the enemy) all that timber which was cut down, and piled it up as a rampart on
                    either flank. When a great space had been, with incredible speed, cleared in a
                    few days, when the cattle [of the enemy] and the rear of their baggage train
                    were already seized by our men, and they themselves were seeking for the
                    thickest parts of the forests, storms of such a kind came on that the work was
                    necessarily suspended, and, through the continuance of the rains, the soldiers
                    could not any longer remain in their tents. Therefore, having laid waste all
                    their country, [and] having burned their villages and houses, <name type="pers">Caesar</name> led back his army and stationed them in winter quarters among

                <p>The following winter (this was the year in which <name>Cn. Pompey</name> and
                        <name type="pers">M. Crassus</name> were consuls [<date when-custom="-55">55</date> B.C.]), those <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> [called] the
                        <name>Usipetes</name>, and likewise the <name>Tenchtheri</name>, with a
                    great number of men, crossed the <name key="tgn,7012611" type="place" n="Rhine [6,51.833] (river), Europe">Rhine </name>, not far from the place
                    at which that river discharges itself into the sea. The motive for crossing
                    [that river] was, that having been for several years harassed by the
                        <name>Suevi</name>, they were constantly engaged in war, and hindered from
                    the pursuits of agriculture. The nation of the <name>Suevi</name> is by far the
                    largest and the most warlike nation of all the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>. They are said to possess a hundred cantons, from each of
                    which they yearly send from their territories for the purpose of war a thousand
                    armed men: the others who remain at home, maintain [both] themselves and
                    those-engaged in the expedition. The latter again, in their turn, are in arms
                    the year after: the former remain at home. Thus neither husbandry, nor the art
                    and practice of war are neglected. But among them there exists no private and
                    separate land; nor are they permitted to remain more than one year in one place
                    for the purpose of residence. They do not live much on corn, but subsist for the
                    most part on milk and flesh, and are much [engaged] in hunting; which
                    circumstance must, by the nature of their food, and by their daily exercise and
                    the freedom of their life (for having from boyhood been accustomed to no
                    employment, or discipline, they do nothing at all contrary to their
                    inclination), both promote their strength and render them men of vast stature of
                    body. And to such a habit have they brought themselves, that even in the coldest
                    parts they wear no clothing whatever except skins, by reason of the scantiness
                    of which, a great portion of their body is bare, and besides they bathe in open
                    rivers. </p></div>

                    sell those things which they have taken in war, than because they need any
                    commodity to be imported to them. Moreover, even as to laboring cattle, in which
                    the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> take the greatest pleasure, and which they
                    procure at a great price, the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> do not employ
                    such as are imported, but those poor and ill-shaped animals, which belong to
                    their country; these, however, they render capable of the greatest labor by
                    daily exercise. In cavalry actions they frequently leap from their horses and
                    fight on foot; and train their horses to stand still in the very spot on which
                    they leave them, to which they retreat with great activity when there is
                    occasion; nor, according to their practice, is any thing regarded as more
                    unseemly, or more unmanly, than to use housings. Accordingly, they have the
                    courage, though they be themselves but few, to advance against any number
                    whatever of horse mounted with housings. They on no account permit wine to be
                    imported to them, because they consider that men degenerate in their powers of
                    enduring fatigue, and are rendered effeminate by that commodity. </p></div>

                    of the extent and population of their state, yet they made them tributaries, and
                    rendered them less distinguished and powerful [than they had ever been].

                    may have heard, or may know, respecting any matter; and in towns the common
                    people throng around merchants and force them to state from what countries they
                    come, and what affairs they know of there. They often engage in resolutions
                    concerning the most important matters, induced by these reports and stories

                    their friendship, they might be serviceable allies to them; and let them either
                    assign them lands, or permit them to retain those which they had acquired by
                    their arms; that they are inferior to the <name>Suevi</name> alone, to whom not

                    following day, that he might inquire into their demands. In the mean time he
                    sends messengers to the officers who had marched in advance with all the

                <p>But the enemy, as soon as they saw our horse, the number of which was 5000,
                    whereas they themselves had not more than 800 horse, because those which had

                    and that day had been requested by them as a period of truce, made an onset on
                    our men, and soon threw them into disorder. When our men, in their turn, made a
                    stand, they, according to their practice, leaped from their horses to their
                    feet, and stabbing our horses in the belly and overthrowing a great many of our

                    did not desist from their retreat till they had come in sight of our army. In
                    that encounter seventy-four of our horse were slain; among them, <name type="pers">Piso</name>, an <name type="ethnic">Aquitanian</name>, a most
                    valiant man, and descended from a very illustrious family; whose grandfather had
                    held the sovereignty of his state, and had been styled friend by our senate. He,
                    while he was endeavoring to render assistance to his brother who was surrounded
                    by the enemy, and whom he rescued from danger, was himself thrown from his
                    horse, which was wounded under him, but still opposed [his antagonists] with the
                    greatest intrepidity, as long as he was able to maintain the conflict. When at
                    length he fell, surrounded on all sides and after receiving many wounds, and his
                    brother, who had then retired from the fight, observed it from a distance, he
                    spurred on his horse, threw himself upon the enemy, and was killed. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="13">
                <p>After this engagement, <name type="pers">Caesar</name> considered that neither
                    ought embassadors to be received to audience, nor conditions be accepted by him
                    from those who, after having sued for peace by way of stratagem and treachery,
                    had made war without provocation. And to wait until the enemy's forces were
                    augmented and their cavalry had returned, he concluded, would be the greatest
                    madness; and knowing the fickleness of the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>, he
                    felt how much influence the enemy had already acquired among them by this one
                    skirmish. He [therefore] deemed that no time for concerting measures ought to be
                    afforded them. After having resolved on those things and communicated his plans
                    to his lieutenants and quaestor in order that he might not suffer any
                    opportunity for engaging to escape him, a very seasonable event occurred,
                    namely, that on the morning of the next day, a large body of <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>, consisting of their princes and old men, came to the camp
                    to him to practice the same treachery and dissimulation; but, as they asserted,
                    for the purpose of acquitting themselves for having engaged in a skirmish the
                    day before, contrary to what had been agreed and to what indeed, they themselves
                    had requested; and also if they could by any means obtain a truce by deceiving
                    him. <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, rejoicing that they had fallen into his
                    power, ordered them to be detained. He then drew all his forces out of the camp,
                    and commanded the cavalry, because he thought they were intimidated by the late
                    skirmish, to follow in the rear. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="14">
                <p>Having marshalled his army in three lines, and in a short time performed a march
                    of eight miles, he arrived at the camp of the enemy before the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> could perceive what was going on; who being
                    suddenly alarmed by all the circumstances, both by the speediness of our arrival
                    and the absence of their own officers, as time was afforded neither for
                    concerting measures nor for seizing their arms, are perplexed as to whether it
                    would be better to lead out their forces against the enemy, or to defend their
                    camp, or seek their safety by flight. Their consternation being made apparent by
                    their noise and tumult, our soldiers, excited by the treachery of the preceding

                    people; if he did not think it just for the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>
                    to pass over into <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name> against his consent, why
                    did he claim that any thing beyond the <name key="tgn,7012611" type="place" n="Rhine [6,51.833] (river), Europe">Rhine </name> should be subject to
                    his dominion or power?" The <name>Ubii</name>, also, who alone, out of all the
                    nations lying beyond the <name key="tgn,7012611" type="place" n="Rhine [6,51.833] (river), Europe">Rhine </name>, had sent embassadors
                    to <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, and formed an alliance and given hostages,
                    earnestly entreated "that he would bring them assistance, because they were
                    grievously oppressed by the <name>Suevi</name>; or, if he was prevented from
                    doing so by the business of the commonwealth, he would at least transport his
                    army over the <name key="tgn,7012611" type="place" n="Rhine [6,51.833] (river), Europe">Rhine </name>; that that would be
                    sufficient for their present assistance and their hope for the future; that so
                    great was the name and the reputation of his army, even among the most remote
                    nations of the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>, arising from the defeat of
                        <name>Ariovistus</name> and this last battle which was fought, that they
                    might be safe under the fame and friendship of the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people." They promised a large number of ships for
                    transporting the army. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="17">
                <p><name type="pers">Caesar</name>, for those reasons which I have mentioned, had
                    resolved to cross the <name key="tgn,7012611" type="place" n="Rhine [6,51.833] (river), Europe">Rhine </name>; but to cross by ships
                    he neither deemed to be sufficiently safe, nor considered consistent with his
                    own dignity or that of the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people. Therefore,
                    although the greatest difficulty in forming a bridge was presented to him, on
                    account of the breadth, rapidity, and depth of the river, he nevertheless
                    considered that it ought to be attempted by him, or that his army ought not
                    otherwise to be led over. He devised this plan of a bridge. He joined together
                    at the distance of two feet, two piles, each a foot and a half thick, sharpened
                    a little at the lower end, and proportioned in length, to the depth of the
                    river. After he had, by means of engines, sunk these into the river, and fixed
                    them at the bottom, and then driven them in with rammers, not quite
                    perpendicularly, dike a stake, but bending forward and sloping, so as to incline
                    in the direction of the current of the river; he also placed two [other piles]
                    opposite to these, at the distance of forty feet lower down, fastened together
                    in the same manner, but directed against the force and current of the river.
                    Both these, moreover, were kept firmly apart by beams two feet thick (the space
                    which the binding of the piles occupied), laid in at their extremities between
                    two braces on each side, and in consequence of these being in different
                    directions and fastened on sides the one opposite to the other, so great was the
                    strength of the work, and such the arrangement of the materials, that in
                    proportion as the greater body of water dashed against the bridge, so much the
                    closer were its parts held fastened together. These beams were bound together by
                    timber laid over them, in the direction of the length of the bridge, and were
                    [then] covered over with laths and hurdles; and in addition to this, piles were
                    driven into the water obliquely, at the lower side of the bridge, and these,
                    serving as buttresses, and being connected with every portion of the work,
                    sustained the force of the stream: and there were others also above the bridge,
                    at a moderate distance; that if trunks of trees or vessels were floated down the
                    river by the barbarians for the purpose of destroying the work, the violence of
                    such things might be diminished by these defenses, and might not injure the
                    bridge. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="18">
                <p>Within ten days after the timber began to be collected, the whole work was
                    completed, and the whole army led over. <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, leaving
                    a strong guard at each end of the bridge, hastens into the territories of the
                        <name>Sigambri</name>. In the mean time, embassadors from several nations
                    come to him, whom, on their suing for peace and alliance, he answers in a
                    courteous manner, and orders hostages to be brought to him. But the
                        <name>Sigambri</name>, at the very time the bridge was begun to be built,
                    made preparations for a flight (by the advice of such of the

                    and quitted their territories, and conveyed away all their possessions, and
                    concealed themselves in deserts and woods. </p></div>

                <p><name type="pers">Caesar</name>, having remained in their territories a few days,

                    assistance, if they were ever harassed by the <name>Suevi</name>, he learned
                    from them these particulars: that the <name>Suevi</name>, after they had by
                    means of their scouts found that the bridge was being built, had called a
                    council, according to their custom, and sent orders to all parts of their state
                    to remove from the towns and convey their children, wives, and all their
                    possessions into the woods, and that all who could bear arms should assemble in
                    one place; that the place thus chosen was nearly the centre of those regions
                    which the <name>Suevi</name> possessed; that in this spot they had resolved to
                    await the arrival of the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>, and give them battle
                    there. When <name type="pers">Caesar</name> discovered this, having already
                    accomplished all these things on account of which he had resolved to lead his
                    army over, namely, to strike fear into the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>,
                    take vengeance on the <name>Sigambri</name>, and free the <name>Ubii</name> from
                    the invasion of the <name>Suevi</name>, having spent altogether eighteen days

                    winters are early, nevertheless resolved to proceed into <name key="tgn,7008653" type="place" n="Great Britain (island), United Kingdom, Europe">Britain</name>, because he discovered that in almost all the wars with the
                        <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> succors had been furnished to our enemy
                    from that country; and even if the time of year should be insufficient for
                    carrying on the war, yet he thought it would be of great service to him if he
                    only entered the island, and saw into the character of the people, and got
                    knowledge of their localities, harbors, and landing-places, all which were for
                    the most part unknown to the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>. For neither does
                    any one except merchants generally go thither, nor even to them was any portion

                    all parts, he could learn neither what was the size of the island, nor what or
                    how numerous were the nations which inhabited it, nor what system of war they
                    followed, nor what customs they used, nor what harbors were convenient for a
                    great number of large ships. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="21">
                <p>He sends before him <name>Caius Volusenus</name> with a ship of war, to acquire a
                    knowledge of these particulars before he in person should make a descent into
                    the island, as he was convinced that this was a judicious measure. He
                    commissioned him to thoroughly examine into all matters, and then return to him
                    as soon as possible. He himself proceeds to the <name>Morini</name> with all his
                    forces. He orders ships from all parts of the neighboring countries, and the
                    fleet which the preceding summer he had built for the war with the
                        <name>Veneti</name>, to assemble in this place. In the mean time, his

                    that they will give hostages, and submit to the government of the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people. Having given them an audience, he after
                    promising liberally, and exhorting them to continue in that purpose, sends them
                    back to their own country, and [dispatches] with them <name>Commius</name>,
                    whom, upon subduing the <name>Atrebates</name>, he had created king there, a man
                    whose courage and conduct he esteemed, and who he thought would be faithful to
                    him, and whose influence ranked highly in those countries. He orders him to
                    visit as many states as he could, and persuade them to embrace the protection of
                    the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people, and apprize them that he would
                    shortly come thither. <name type="pers">Volusenus</name>, having viewed the
                    localities as far as means could be afforded one who dared not leave his ship
                    and trust himself to barbarians, returns to <name type="pers">Caesar</name> on
                    the fifth day, and reports what he had there observed. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="22">
                <p>While <name type="pers">Caesar</name> remains in these parts for the purpose of

                        <name>Morini</name>, to plead their excuse respecting their conduct on the
                    late occasion; alleging that it was as men uncivilized, and as those who were
                    unacquainted with our custom, that they had made war upon the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people, and promising to perform what he should
                    command. <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, thinking that this had happened
                    fortunately enough for him, because he neither wished to leave an enemy behind
                    him, nor had an opportunity for carrying on a war, by reason of the time of
                    year, nor considered that employment in such trifling matters was to be
                    preferred to his enterprise on <name key="tgn,7008653" type="place" n="Great Britain (island), United Kingdom, Europe">Britain</name>, imposes
                    a large number of hostages; and when these were brought, he received them to his
                    protection. Having collected together, and provided about eighty transport
                    ships, as many as he thought necessary for conveying over two legions, he
                    assigned such [ships] of war as he had besides to the quaestor, his lieutenants,
                    and officers of cavalry. There were in addition to these eighteen ships of
                    burden which were prevented, eight miles from that place, by winds, from being
                    able to reach the same port. These he distributed among the horse; the rest of
                    the army, he delivered to <name type="pers">Q. Titurius Sabinus</name> and <name type="pers">L. Aurunculeius Cotta</name>, his lieutenants, to lead into the
                    territories of the <name>Menapii</name> and those cantons of the
                        <name>Morini</name> from which embassadors had not come to him. He ordered
                        <name type="pers">P. Sulpicius Rufus</name>, his lieutenant, to hold
                    possession of the harbor, with such a garrison as he thought sufficient.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="23">
                <p>These matters being arranged, finding the weather favorable for his voyage, he
                    set sail about the third watch, and ordered the horse to march forward to the
                    further port, and there embark and follow him. As this was performed rather
                    tardily by them, he himself reached <name key="tgn,7008653" type="place" n="Great Britain (island), United Kingdom, Europe">Britain</name> with the
                    first squadron of ships, about the fourth hour of the day, and there saw the
                    forces of the enemy drawn up in arms on all the hills. The nature of the place
                    was this: the sea was confined by mountains so close to it that a dart could be
                    thrown from their summit upon the shore. Considering this by no means a fit
                    place for disembarking, he remained at anchor till the ninth hour, for the other
                    ships to arrive there. Having in the mean time assembled the lieutenants and
                    military tribunes, he told them both what he had learned from <name type="pers">Volusenus</name>, and what he wished to be done; and enjoined them (as the
                    principle of military matters, and especially as maritime affairs, which have a
                    precipitate and uncertain action, required) that all things should be performed
                    by them at a nod and at the instant. Having dismissed them, meeting both with
                    wind and tide favorable at the same time, the signal being given and the anchor
                    weighed, he advanced about seven miles from that place, and stationed his fleet
                    over against an open and level shore. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="24">
                <p>But the barbarians, upon perceiving the design of the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>, sent forward their cavalry and charioteers, a class of
                    warriors of whom it is their practice to make great use in their battles, and
                    following with the rest of their forces, endeavored to prevent our men landing.
                    In this was the greatest difficulty, for the following reasons, namely, because
                    our ships, on account of their great size, could be stationed only in deep
                    water; and our soldiers, in places unknown to them, with their hands
                    embarrassed, oppressed with a large and heavy weight of armor, had at the same
                    time to leap from the ships, stand amid the waves, and encounter the enemy;
                    whereas they, either on dry ground, or advancing a little way into the water,
                    free in all their limbs in places thoroughly known to them, could confidently
                    throw their weapons and spur on their horses, which were accustomed to this kind
                    of service. Dismayed by these circumstances and altogether untrained in this
                    mode of battle, our men did not all exert the same vigor and eagerness which
                    they had been wont to exert in engagements on dry ground. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="25">
                <p>When <name type="pers">Caesar</name> observed this, he ordered the ships of war,
                    the appearance of which was somewhat strange to the barbarians and the motion
                    more ready for service, to be withdrawn a little from the transport vessels, and
                    to be propelled by their oars, and be stationed toward the open flank of the
                    enemy, and the enemy to be beaten off and driven away, with slings, arrows, and
                    engines: which plan was of great service to our men; for the barbarians being
                    startled by the form of our ships and the motions of our oars and the nature of
                    our engines, which was strange to them, stopped, and shortly after retreated a
                    little. And while our men were hesitating [whether they should advance to the
                    shore], chiefly on account of the depth of the sea, he who carried the eagle of
                    the tenth legion, after supplicating the gods that the matter might turn out
                    favorably to the legion, exclaimed, "Leap, fellow soldiers, unless you wish to
                    betray your eagle to the enemy. I, for my part, will perform my duty to the
                    commonwealth and my general." When he had said this with a loud voice, he leaped
                    from the ship and proceeded to bear the eagle toward the enemy. Then our men,
                    exhorting one another that so great a disgrace should not be incurred, all
                    leaped from the ship. When those in the nearest vessels saw them, they speedily
                    followed and approached the enemy. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="26">
                <p>The battle was maintained vigorously on both sides. Our men, however, as they
                    could neither keep their ranks, nor get firm footing, nor follow their
                    standards, and as one from one ship and another from another assembled around
                    whatever standards they met, were thrown into great confusion. But the enemy,
                    who were acquainted with all the shallows, when from the shore they saw any
                    coming from a ship one by one, spurred on their horses, and attacked them while
                    embarrassed; many surrounded a few, others threw their weapons upon our
                    collected forces on their exposed flank. When <name type="pers">Caesar</name>
                    observed this, he ordered the boats of the ships of war and the spy sloops to be
                    filled with soldiers, and sent them up to the succor of those whom he had
                    observed in distress. Our men, as soon as they made good their footing on dry
                    ground, and all their comrades had joined them, made an attack upon the enemy,
                    and put them to flight, but could not pursue them very far, because the horse
                    had not been able to maintain their course at sea and reach the island. This
                    alone was wanting to <name type="pers">Caesar</name>'s accustomed success.

                <p>The enemy being thus vanquished in battle, as soon as they recovered after their
                    flight, instantly sent embassadors to <name type="pers">Caesar</name> to
                    negotiate about peace. They promised to give hostages and perform what he should
                    command. Together with these embassadors came <name>Commius</name> the
                        <name>Altrebatian</name>, who, as I have above said, had been sent by <name type="pers">Caesar</name> into <name key="tgn,7008653" type="place" n="Great Britain (island), United Kingdom, Europe">Britain</name>. Him
                    they had seized upon when leaving his ship, although in the character of
                    embassador he bore the general's commission to them, and thrown into chains:
                    then after the battle was fought, they sent him back, and in suing for peace
                    cast the blame of that act upon the common people, and entreated that it might
                    be pardoned on account of their indiscretion. <name type="pers">Caesar</name>,
                    complaining, that after they had sued for peace, and had voluntarily sent
                    embassadors into the continent for that purpose, they had made war without a
                    reason, said that he would pardon their indiscretion, and imposed hostages, a
                    part of whom they gave immediately; the rest they said they would give in a few
                    days, since they were sent for from remote places. In the mean time they ordered
                    their people to return to the country parts, and the chiefs assembled from all
                    quarter, and proceeded to surrender themselves and their states to <name type="pers">Caesar</name>. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="28">

                    eighteen ships, to which reference has been made above, and which conveyed the
                    cavalry, set sail from the upper port with a gentle gale, when, however, they
                    were approaching <name key="tgn,7008653" type="place" n="Great Britain (island), United Kingdom, Europe">Britain</name> and were
                    seen from the camp, so great a storm suddenly arose that none of them could
                    maintain their course at sea; and some were taken back to the same port from
                    which they had started;-others, to their great danger, were driven to the lower
                    part of the island, nearer to the west; which, however, after having cast
                    anchor, as they were getting filled with water, put out to sea through necessity
                    in a stormy night, and made for the continent. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="29">
                <p>It happened that night to be full moon, which usually occasions very high tides
                    in that ocean; and that circumstance was unknown to our men. Thus, at the same
                    time, the tide began to fill the ships of war which <name type="pers">Caesar</name> had provided to convey over his army, and which he had drawn
                    up on the strand; and the storm began to dash the ships of burden which were
                    riding at anchor against each other; nor was any means afforded our men of
                    either managing them or of rendering any service. A great many ships having been
                    wrecked, inasmuch as the rest, having lost their cables, anchors, and other
                    tackling, were unfit for sailing, a great confusion, as would necessarily
                    happen, arose throughout the army; for there were no other ships in which they
                    could be conveyed back, and all things which are of service in repairing vessels
                    were wanting, and, corn for the winter had not been provided in those places,
                    because it was understood by all that they would certainly winter in <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="30">
                <p>On discovering these things the chiefs of <name key="tgn,7008653" type="place" n="Great Britain (island), United Kingdom, Europe">Britain</name>, who had
                    come up after the battle was fought to perform those conditions which <name type="pers">Caesar</name> had imposed, held a conference, when they
                    perceived that cavalry, and ships, and corn were wanting to the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>, and discovered the small number of our soldiers
                    from the small extent of the camp (which, too, was on this account more limited
                    than ordinary, because <name type="pers">Caesar</name> had conveyed over his
                    legions without baggage), and thought that the best plan was to renew the war,
                    and cut off our men from corn and provisions and protract the affair till
                    winter; because they felt confident, that, if they were vanquished or cut off
                    from a return, no one would afterward pass over into <name key="tgn,7008653" type="place" n="Great Britain (island), United Kingdom, Europe">Britain</name> for the purpose of making war. Therefore, again entering
                    into a conspiracy, they began to depart from the camp by degrees and secretly
                    bring up their people from the country parts. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="31">
                <p>But <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, although he had not as yet discovered their
                    measures, yet, both from what had occurred to his ships, and from the
                    circumstance that they had neglected to give the promised hostages, suspected
                    that the thing would come to pass which really did happen. He therefore provided
                    remedies against all contingencies; for he daily conveyed corn from the country
                    parts into the camp, used the timber and brass of such ships as were most
                    seriously damaged for repairing the rest, and ordered whatever things besides
                    were necessary for this object to be brought to him from the continent. And
                    thus, since that business was executed by the soldiers with the greatest energy,
                    he effected that, after the loss of twelve ships, a voyage could be made well
                    enough in the rest. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="32">
                <p>While these things are being transacted, one legion had been sent to forage,
                    according to custom, and no suspicion of war had arisen as yet, and some of the
                    people remained in the country parts, others went backward and forward to the
                    camp, they who were on duty at the gates of the camp reported to <name type="pers">Caesar</name> that a greater dust than was usual was seen in
                    that direction in which the legion had marched. <name type="pers">Caesar</name>,
                    suspecting that which was [really the case],-that some new enterprise was
                    undertaken by the barbarians, ordered the two cohorts which were on duty, to
                    march into that quarter with him, and two other cohorts to relieve them on duty;
                    the rest to be armed and follow him immediately. When he had advanced some
                    little way from the camp, he saw that his men were overpowered by the enemy and
                    scarcely able to stand their ground, and that, the legion being crowded
                    together, weapons were being cast on them from all sides. For as all the corn
                    was reaped in every part with the exception of one, the enemy, suspecting that
                    our men would repair to that, had concealed themselves in the woods during the
                    night. Then attacking them suddenly, scattered as they were, and when they had
                    laid aside their arms, and were engaged in reaping, they killed a small number,
                    threw the rest into confusion, and surrounded them with their cavalry and
                    chariots. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="33">
                <p>Their mode of fighting with their chariots is this: firstly, they drive about in
                    all directions and throw their weapons and generally break the ranks of the
                    enemy with the very dread of their horses and the noise of their wheels; and
                    when they have worked themselves in between the troops of horse, leap from their
                    chariots and engage on foot. The charioteers in the mean time withdraw some
                    little distance from the battle, and so place themselves with the chariots that,
                    if their masters are overpowered by the number of the enemy, they may have a
                    ready retreat to their own troops. Thus they display in battle the speed of
                    horse, [together with] the firmness of infantry; and by daily practice and
                    exercise attain to such expertness that they are accustomed, even on a declining
                    and steep place, to check their horses at full speed, and manage and turn them
                    in an instant and run along the pole, and stand on the yoke, and thence betake
                    themselves with the greatest celerity to their chariots again. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="34">
                <p>Under these circumstances, our men being dismayed by the novelty of this mode of
                    battle, <name type="pers">Caesar</name> most seasonably brought assistance; for
                    upon his arrival the enemy paused, and our men recovered from their fear; upon
                    which thinking the time unfavorable for provoking the enemy and coming to an
                    action, he kept himself in his own quarter, and, a short time having intervened,
                    drew back the legions into the camp. While these things are going on, and all
                    our men engaged, the rest of the <name>Britons</name>, who were in the fields,
                    departed. Storms then set in for several successive days, which both confined
                    our men to the camp and hindered the enemy from attacking us. In the mean time
                    the barbarians dispatched messengers to all parts, and reported to their people
                    the small number of our soldiers, and how good an opportunity was given for
                    obtaining spoil and for liberating themselves forever, if they should only drive
                    the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> from their camp. Having by these means
                    speedily got together a large force of infantry and of cavalry they came up to
                    the camp. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="35">
                <p>Although <name type="pers">Caesar</name> anticipated that the same thing which
                    had happened on former occasions would then occur-that, if the enemy were
                    routed, they would escape from danger by their speed; still, having got about
                    thirty horse, which <name>Commius</name> the <name>Atrebatian</name>, of whom
                    mention has been made, had brought over with him [from <name>Gaul]</name>, he
                    drew up the legions in order of battle before the camp. When the action
                    commenced, the enemy were unable to sustain the attack of our men long, and
                    turned their backs; our men pursued them as far as their speed and strength
                    permitted, and slew a great number of them; then, having destroyed and burned
                    every thing far and wide, they retreated to their camp. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="36">
                <p>The same day, embassadors sent by the enemy came to <name type="pers">Caesar</name> to negotiate a peace. <name type="pers">Caesar</name> doubled
                    the number of hostages which he had before demanded; and ordered that they
                    should be brought over to the continent, because, since the time of the equinox
                    was near, he did not consider that, with his ships out of repair, the voyage
                    ought to be deferred till winter. Having met with favorable weather, he set sail
                    a little after midnight, and all his fleet arrived safe at the continent, except
                    two of the ships of burden which could not make the same port which the other
                    ships did, and were carried a little lower down. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="37">
                <p>When our soldiers, about 300 in number, had been drawn out of these two ships,

                    left in a state of peace, excited by the hope of spoil, at first surrounded them
                    with a small number of men, and ordered them to lay down their arms, if they did
                    not wish to be slain; afterward however, when they, forming a circle, stood on
                    their defense, a shout was raised and about 6000 of the enemy soon assembled;
                    which being reported, <name type="pers">Caesar</name> sent all the cavalry in
                    the camp as a relief to his men. In the mean time our soldiers sustained the
                    attack of the enemy, and fought most valiantly for more than four hours, and,
                    receiving but few wounds themselves, slew several of them. But after our cavalry
                    came in sight, the enemy, throwing away their arms, turned their backs, and a
                    great number of them were killed. </p></div>

                    ardor of the soldiers, amid the utmost scarcity of all materials, about six
                    hundred ships of that kind which we have described above and twenty-eight ships
                    of war, had been built, and were not far from that state, that they might be
                    launched in a few days. Having commended the soldiers and those who had presided
                    over the work, he informs them what he wishes to be done, and orders all the
                    ships to assemble at port <name>Itius</name>, from which port he had learned
                    that the passage into <name key="tgn,7008653" type="place" n="Great Britain (island), United Kingdom, Europe">Britain</name> was
                    shortest, [being only] about thirty miles from the continent. He left what
                    seemed a sufficient number of soldiers for that design; he himself proceeds into
                    the territories of the <name key="tgn,7004447" type="place" n="  +Trier [6.65,49.75] (inhabited place), Trier, Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany, Europe ">Treviri </name> with four legions without baggage, and 800 horse, because
                    they neither came to the general diets [of <name>Gaul]</name>, nor obeyed his
                    commands, and were moreover, said to be tampering with the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> beyond the <name key="tgn,7012611" type="place" n="Rhine [6,51.833] (river), Europe">Rhine </name>. </p></div>

                    supreme power; one of whom, as soon as the arrival of <name type="pers">Caesar</name> and his legions was known, came to him; assures him that he
                    and all his party would continue in their allegiance, and not revolt from the
                    alliance of the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people, and informs him of the

                    infantry, and make preparations for war, having concealed those who by reason of
                    their age could not be under arms, in the forest <name>Arduenna</name>, which is
                    of immense size, [and] extends from the <name key="tgn,7012611" type="place" n="Rhine [6,51.833] (river), Europe">Rhine </name> across the country of

                    But after that, some of the chief persons of the state, both influenced by their
                    friendship for <name>Cingetorix</name>, and alarmed at the arrival of our army,
                    came to <name type="pers">Caesar</name> and began to solicit him privately about
                    their own interests, since they could not provide for the safety of the state;
                        <name>Indutiomarus</name>, dreading lest he should be abandoned by all,
                    sends embassadors to <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, to declare that he
                    absented himself from his countrymen, and refrained from coming to him on this
                    account, that he might the more easily keep the state in its allegiance, lest on
                    the departure of all the nobility the commonalty should, in their indiscretion,
                    revolt. And thus the whole state was at his control; and that he, if <name type="pers">Caesar</name> would permit, would come to the camp to him, and
                    would commit his own fortunes and those of the state to his good faith.

                <p>There was together with the others, <name>Dumnorix</name>, the

                    particular, he had resolved to have with him, because he had discovered him to
                    be fond of change, fond of power, possessing great resolution, and great
                    influence among the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>. To this was added, that
                        <name>Dumnorix</name> had before said in an assembly of
                    <name>Aeduans</name>, that the sovereignty of the state had been made over to
                    him by <name type="pers">Caesar</name>; which speech the <name>Aedui</name> bore
                    with impatience and yet dared not send embassadors to <name type="pers">Caesar</name> for the purpose of either rejecting or deprecating [that
                    appointment]. That fact <name type="pers">Caesar</name> had learned from his own
                    personal friends. He at first strove to obtain by every entreaty that he should
                    be left in <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>; partly, because, being
                    unaccustomed to sailing, he feared the sea; partly because he said he was
                    prevented by divine admonitions. After he saw that this request was firmly
                    refused him, all hope of success being lost, he began to tamper with the chief
                    persons of the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>, to call them apart singly and
                    exhort them to remain on the continent; to agitate them with the fear that it
                    was not without reason that <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name> should be stripped of all
                    her nobility; that it was <name type="pers">Caesar</name>'s design, to bring
                    over to <name key="tgn,7008653" type="place" n="Great Britain (island), United Kingdom, Europe">Britain</name> and put
                    to death all those whom he feared to slay in the sight of <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, to pledge his honor to the rest, to ask for their oath that
                    they would by common deliberation execute what they should perceive to be
                    necessary for <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>. These things were reported
                    to <name type="pers">Caesar</name> by several persons. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">
                <p>Having learned this fact, <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, because he had
                    conferred so much honor upon the <name>Aeduan</name> state, determined that
                        <name>Dumnorix</name> should be restrained and deterred by whatever means he
                    could; and that, because he perceived his insane designs to be proceeding
                    further and further, care should be taken lest he might be able to injure him
                    and the commonwealth. Therefore, having stayed about twenty-five days in that
                    place, because the north wind, which usually blows a great part of every season,
                    prevented the voyage, he exerted himself to keep <name>Dumnorix</name> in his
                    allegiance [and] nevertheless learn all his measures: having at length met with
                    favorable weather, he orders the foot soldiers and the horse to embark in the
                    ships. But, while the minds of all were occupied, <name>Dumnorix</name> began to
                    take his departure from the camp homeward with the cavalry of the
                        <name>Aedui</name>, <name type="pers">Caesar</name> being ignorant of it.
                        <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, on this matter being reported to him,
                    ceasing from his expedition and deferring all other affairs, sends a great part
                    of the cavalry to pursue him, and commands that he be brought back; he orders
                    that if he use violence and do not submit, that he be slain; considering that
                        <name>Dumnorix</name> would do nothing as a rational man while he himself
                    was absent, since he had disregarded his command even when present. He, however,
                    when recalled, began to resist and defend himself with his hand, and implore the
                    support of his people, often exclaiming that "he was free and the subject of a
                    free state." They surround and kill the man as they had been commanded; but the
                        <name>Aeduan</name> horsemen all return to <name type="pers">Caesar</name>.

                    corn, and discover what was going on in <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, and take measures
                    according to the occasion and according to the circumstance; he himself, with
                    five legions and a number of horse, equal to that which he was leaving on the
                    continent, set sail at sun-set, and [though for a time] borne forward by a
                    gentle south-west wind, he did not maintain his course, in consequence of the
                    wind dying away about midnight, and being carried on too far by the tide, when
                    the sun rose, espied <name key="tgn,7008653" type="place" n="Great Britain (island), United Kingdom, Europe">Britain</name> passed
                    on his left. Then, again, following the change of tide, he urged on with the
                    oars that he might make that part of the island in which he had discovered the
                    preceding summer, that there was the best landing-place, and in this affair the
                    spirit of our soldiers was very much to be extolled; for they with the
                    transports and heavy ships, the labor of rowing not being [for a moment]
                    discontinued, equaled the speed of the ships of war. All the ships reached <name key="tgn,7008653" type="place" n="Great Britain (island), United Kingdom, Europe">Britain</name> nearly
                    at mid-day; nor was there seen a [single] enemy in that place, but, as <name type="pers">Caesar</name> afterward found from some prisoners, though large
                    bodies of troops had assembled there, yet being alarmed by the great number of
                    our ships, more than eight hundred of which, including the ships of the
                    preceding year, and those private vessels which each had built for his own
                    convenience, had appeared at one time, they had quitted the coast and concealed
                    themselves among the higher points. </p></div>

                <p><name type="pers">Caesar</name>, having disembarked his army and chosen a
                    convenient place for the camp, when he discovered from the prisoners in what
                    part the forces of the enemy had lodged themselves, having left ten cohorts and
                    300 horse at the sea, to be a guard to the ships, hastens to the enemy, at the
                    third watch, fearing the less for the ships, for this reason because he was
                    leaving them fastened at anchor upon an even and open shore; and he placed <name type="pers">Q. Atrius</name> over the guard of the ships. He himself, having
                    advanced by night about twelve miles, espied the forces of the enemy. They,
                    advancing to the river with their cavalry and chariots from the higher ground,
                    began to annoy our men and give battle. Being repulsed by our cavalry, they
                    concealed themselves in woods, as they had secured a place admirably fortified
                    by nature and by art, which, as it seemed, they had before prepared on account
                    of a civil war; for all entrances to it were shut up by a great number of felled
                    trees. They themselves rushed out of the woods to fight here and there, and
                    prevented our men from entering their fortifications. But the soldiers of the
                    seventh legion, having formed a testudo and thrown up a rampart against the
                    fortification, took the place and drove them out of the woods, receiving only a
                    few wounds. But <name type="pers">Caesar</name> forbade his men to pursue them
                    in their flight any great distance; both because he was ignorant of the nature
                    of the ground, and because, as a great part of the day was spent, he wished time
                    to be left for the fortification of the camp. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="10">
                <p>The next day, early in the morning, he sent both foot-soldiers and horse in three
                    divisions on an expedition to pursue those who had fled. These having advanced a
                    little way, when already the rear [of the enemy] was in sight, some horse came
                    to <name type="pers">Caesar</name> from <name>Quintus Atrius</name>, to report
                    that the preceding night, a very great storm having arisen, almost all the ships
                    were dashed to pieces and cast upon the shore, because neither the anchors and
                    cables could resist, nor could the sailors and pilots sustain the violence of
                    the storm; and thus great damage was received by that collision of the ships.

                    legions and cavalry to be recalled and to cease from their march; he himself
                    returns to the ships: he sees clearly before him almost the same things which he
                    had heard of from the messengers and by letter, so that, about forty ships being
                    lost, the remainder seemed capable of being repaired with much labor. Therefore
                    he selects workmen from the legions, and orders others to be sent for from the
                    continent; he writes to <name type="pers">Labienus</name> to build as many ships
                    as he could with those legions which were with him. He himself, though the
                    matter was one of great difficulty and labor, yet thought it to be most
                    expedient for all the ships to be brought up on shore and joined with the camp
                    by one fortification. In these matters he employed about ten days, the labor of
                    the soldiers being unremitting even during the hours of night. The ships having
                    been brought up on shore and the camp strongly fortified, he left the same
                    forces as he did before as a guard for the ships; he sets out in person for the
                    same place that he had returned from. When he had come thither, greater forces
                    of the <name>Britons</name> had already assembled at that place, the chief

                    inhabited by those of whom they say that it is handed down by tradition that
                    they were born in the island itself: the maritime portion by those who had
                    passed over from the country of the <name>Belgae</name> for the purpose of
                    plunder and making war; almost all of whom are called by the names of those
                    states from which being sprung they went thither, and having waged war,
                    continued there and began to cultivate the lands. The number of the people is
                    countless, and their buildings exceedingly numerous, for the most part very like
                    those of the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>: the number of cattle is great.
                    They use either brass or iron rings, determined at a certain weight, as their
                    money. Tin is produced in the midland regions; in the maritime, iron; but the
                    quantity of it is small: they employ brass, which is imported. There, as in

                    nothing, except that, by accurate measurements with water, we perceived the

                <p>The horse and charioteers of the enemy contended vigorously in a skirmish with
                    our cavalry on the march; yet so that our men were conquerors in all parts, and
                    drove them to their woods and hills; but, having slain a great many, they
                    pursued too eagerly, and lost some of their men. But the enemy, after some time
                    had elapsed, when our men were off their guard, and occupied in the
                    fortification of the camp, rushed out of the woods, and making an attack upon
                    those who were placed on duty before the camp, fought in a determined manner;
                    and two cohorts being sent by <name type="pers">Caesar</name> to their relief,
                    and these severally the first of two legions, when these had taken up their
                    position at a very small distance from each other, as our men were disconcerted
                    by the unusual mode of battle, the enemy broke through the middle of them most
                    courageously, and retreated thence in safety. That day, <name type="pers">Q.

                    since more cohorts were sent against them, were repulsed. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="16">
                <p>In the whole of this method of fighting since the engagement took place under the
                    eyes of all and before the camp, it was perceived that our men, on account of
                    the weight of their arms, inasmuch as they could neither pursue [the enemy when]
                    retreating, nor dare quit their standards, were little suited to this kind of
                    enemy; that the horse also fought with great danger, because they [the
                        <name>Britons]</name> generally retreated even designedly, and, when they
                    had drawn off our men a short distance from the legions, leaped from their
                    chariots and fought on foot in unequal [and to them advantageous] battle. But
                    the system of cavalry engagement is wont to produce equal danger, and indeed the
                    same, both to those who retreat and to those who pursue. To this was added, that
                    they never fought in close order, but in small parties and at great distances,
                    and had detachments placed [in different parts], and then the one relieved the
                    other, and the vigorous and fresh succeeded the wearied. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="17">
                <p>The following day the enemy halted on the hills, a distance from our camp, and
                    presented themselves in small parties, and began to challenge our horse to
                    battle with less spirit than the day before. But at noon, when <name type="pers">Caesar</name> had sent three legions, and all the cavalry, with <name type="pers">C. Trebonius</name>, the lieutenant, for the purpose of
                    foraging, they flew upon the foragers suddenly from all quarters, so that they
                    did not keep off [even] from the standards and the legions. Our men making an
                    attack on them vigorously, repulsed them; nor did they cease to pursue them
                    until the horse, relying on relief, as they saw the legions behind them, drove
                    the enemy precipitately before them, and slaying a great number of them, did not
                    give them the opportunity either of rallying, or halting, or leaping from their
                    chariots. Immediately after this retreat, the auxiliaries who had assembled from
                    all sides, departed; nor after that time did the enemy ever engage with us in
                    very large numbers. </p></div>

                    river can be forded in one place only and that with difficulty. When he had
                    arrived there, he perceives that numerous forces of the enemy were marshaled on
                    the other bank of the river; the bank also was defended by sharp stakes fixed in
                    front, and stakes of the same kind fixed under the water were covered by the
                    river. These things being discovered from [some] prisoners and deserters, <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, sending forward the cavalry, ordered the legions
                    to follow them immediately. But the soldiers advanced with such speed and such
                    ardor, though they stood above the water by their heads only, that the enemy
                    could not sustain the attack of the legions and of the horse, and quitted the

                    about 4,000 charioteers only being left, used to observe our marches and retire
                    a little from the road, and conceal himself in intricate and woody places, and
                    in those neighborhoods in which he had discovered we were about to march, he
                    used to drive the cattle and the inhabitants from the fields into the woods;
                    and, when our cavalry, for the sake of plundering and ravaging the more freely,
                    scattered themselves among the fields, he used to send out charioteers from the
                    woods by all the well-known roads and paths, and to the great danger of our
                    horse, engage with them; and this source of fear hindered them from straggling
                    very extensively. The result was, that <name type="pers">Caesar</name> did not
                    allow excursions to be made to a great distance from the main body of the

                    gave to <name type="pers">C. Fabius</name>, his lieutenant, to be marched into
                    the territories of the <name>Morini</name>; a second to <name type="pers">Q.

                    fourth he ordered to winter with <name type="pers">T. Labienus</name> among the
                        <name type="ethnic">Remi</name> in the confines of the <name key="tgn,7004447" type="place" n="  +Trier [6.65,49.75] (inhabited place), Trier, Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany, Europe ">Treviri </name>; he stationed three in <name key="tgn,1000063" type="place" n="  +Belgium [4,50.833] (nation), Europe ">Belgium </name>; over these he
                    appointed <name type="pers">M. Crassus</name>, his questor, and <name type="pers">L. Munatius Plancus</name> and <name type="pers">C.
                        Trebonius</name>, his lieutenants. One legion which he had raised last on
                    the other side of the <name>Po</name>, and five cohorts, he sent among the
                        <name>Eburones</name>, the greatest portion of whom lie between the <name key="tgn,7006865" type="place" n="  +Meuse [5,51.833] (river), Europe ">Meuse </name> and the <name key="tgn,7012611" type="place" n="Rhine [6,51.833] (river), Europe">Rhine </name>, [and] who were under
                    the government of <name>Ambiorix</name> and <name>Cativolcus</name>. He ordered

                        Aurunculeius Cotta</name>, his lieutenants, to take command of these
                    soldiers. The legions being distributed in this manner, he thought he could most
                    easily remedy the scarcity of corn and yet the winter-quarters of all these
                    legions (except that which he had given to <name type="pers">L. Roscius</name>,
                    to be led into the most peaceful and tranquil neighborhood) were comprehended
                    within [about] 100 miles. He himself in the mean while, until he had stationed
                    the legions and knew that the several winter-quarters were fortified, determined

                <p>About fifteen days after they had come into winter-quarters, the beginning of a

                    in a cavalry action, the enemy, despairing of success, drew off their troops

                    of a conference: before them <name>Ambiorix</name> spoke to this effect: "That
                    he confessed, that for <name type="pers">Caesar</name>'s kindness toward him, he
                    was very much indebted to him, inasmuch as by his aid he had been freed from a
                    tribute which he had been accustomed to pay to the <name>Aduatuci</name>, his
                    neighbors; and because his own son and the son of his brother had been sent back
                    to him, whom, when sent in the number of hostages, the <name>Aduatuci</name> had
                    detained among them in slavery and in chains; and that he had not done that
                    which he had done in regard to the attacking of the camp, either by his own
                    judgment or desire, but by the compulsion of his state; and that his government
                    was of that nature, that the people had as much authority over him as he over
                    the people. To the state moreover the occasion of the war was this-that it could
                    not withstand the sudden combination of the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>;
                    that he could easily prove this from his own weakness, since he was not so
                    little versed in affairs as to presume that with his forces he could conquer the
                        <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people; but that it was the common
                    resolution of <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>; that that day was
                    appointed for the storming of all <name type="pers">Caesar</name>'s
                    winter-quarters, in order that no legion should be able to come to the relief of
                    another legion, that <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> could not easily deny
                        <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>, especially when a measure seemed entered
                    into for recovering their common freedom. Since he had performed his duty to
                    them on the score of patriotism [he said], he has now regard to gratitude for
                    the kindness of <name type="pers">Caesar</name>; that he warned, that he prayed
                        <name type="pers">Titurius</name> by the claims of hospitality, to consult
                    for his and his soldiers' safely; that a large force of the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> had been hired and had passed the <name key="tgn,7012611" type="place" n="Rhine [6,51.833] (river), Europe">Rhine </name>; that it
                    would arrive in two days: that it was for them to consider whether they thought
                    fit, before the nearest people perceived it, to lead off their soldiers when
                    drawn out of winter-quarters, either to <name type="pers">Cicero</name> or to

                    from them, the other rather more; that this he promised and confirmed by oath,
                    that he would give them a safe passage through his territories; and when he did
                    that, he was both consulting for his own state, because it would be relieved
                    from the winter-quarters, and also making a requital to <name type="pers">Caesar</name> for his obligations." </p></div>

                    affair, though those things were spoken by an enemy, still thought they were not
                    to be disregarded; and they were especially influenced by this consideration,
                    that it was scarcely credible that the obscure and humble state of the

                    that they should not depart from the camp without <name type="pers">Caesar</name>'s orders;" they declared, "that any forces of the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>, however great, might be encountered by
                    fortified winter-quarters; that this fact was a proof [of it]; that they had
                    sustained the first assault of the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> most
                    valiantly, inflicting many wounds upon them; that they were not distressed for
                    corn; that in the mean time relief would come both from the nearest
                    winter-quarters and from <name type="pers">Caesar</name>; lastly, they put the
                    query, "what could be more undetermined, more undignified, than to adopt
                    measures respecting the most important affairs on the authority of an enemy?"

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="29">
                <p>In opposition to those things, <name type="pers">Titurius</name> exclaimed, "That

                    disaster had been received in the neighboring winter-quarters; that the
                    opportunity for deliberating was short; that he believed that <name type="pers">Caesar</name> had set forth into <name key="tgn,1000080" type="place" n="Italy [12.833,42.833] (nation), Europe">Italy</name>, as the

                    present, have come to the camp with so great defiance of us; that he did not
                    regard the enemy, but the fact, as the authority; that the <name key="tgn,7012611" type="place" n="Rhine [6,51.833] (river), Europe">Rhine
                    </name> was near; that the death of <name>Ariovistus</name> and our previous
                    victories were subjects of great indignation to the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>; that <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name> was inflamed, that after
                    having received so many defeats she was reduced under the sway of the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people, her pristine glory in military matters
                    being extinguished." Lastly, "who would persuade himself of this, that
                        <name>Ambiorix</name> had resorted to a design of that nature without sure
                    grounds? That his own opinion was safe on either side; if there be nothing very
                    formidable, they would go without danger to the nearest legion; if all <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name> conspired with the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>, their
                    only safety lay in dispatch. What issue would the advice of <name type="pers">Cotta</name> and of those who differed from him, have? from which, if
                    immediate danger was not to be dreaded, yet certainly famine, by a protracted

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="30">
                <p>This discussion having been held on the two sides, when opposition was offered

                    said it with a louder voice, that a great portion of the soldiers might hear
                    him; "nor am I the person among you," he said, "who is most powerfully alarmed
                    by the danger of death; these will be aware of it, and then, if any thing
                    disastrous shall have occurred, they will demand a reckoning at your hands;

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="31">
                <p>They rise from the council, detain both, and entreat, that "they do not bring the

                    was an easy one, if only they all thought and approved of the same thing,
                    whether they remain or depart; on the other hand, they saw no security in
                    dissension." The matter is prolonged by debate till midnight. At last <name type="pers">Cotta</name>, being overruled, yields his assent; the opinion of
                        <name type="pers">Sabinus</name> prevails. It is proclaimed that they will
                    march at day-break; the remainder of the night is spent without sleep, since
                    every soldier was inspecting his property, [to see] what he could carry with
                    him, and what, out of the appurtenances of the winter-quarters, he would be
                    compelled to leave; every reason is suggested to show why they could not stay
                    without danger, and how that danger would be increased by the fatigue of the
                    soldiers and their want of sleep. At break of day they quit the camp, in a very
                    extended line and with a very large amount of baggage, in such a manner as men
                    who were convinced that the advice was given by <name>Ambiorix</name>, not as an
                    enemy, but as most friendly [toward them]. </p></div>

                    ambuscade in two divisions in the woods, in a suitable and concealed place, two
                    miles from the camp, waited for the arrival of the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>: and when the greater part of the line of march had descended
                    into a considerable valley, they suddenly presented themselves on either side of
                    that valley, and began both to harass the rear and hinder the van from
                    ascending, and to give battle in a place exceedingly disadvantageous to our men.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="33">
                <p>Then at length <name type="pers">Titurius</name>, as one who had provided nothing
                    beforehand, was confused, ran to and fro, and set about arranging his troops;
                    these very things, however, he did timidly and in such a manner that all
                    resources seemed to fail him: which generally happens to those who are compelled
                    to take council in the action itself. But <name type="pers">Cotta</name>, who
                    had reflected that these things might occur on the march, and on that account
                    had not been an adviser of the departure, was wanting to the common safety in no
                    respect; both in addressing and encouraging the soldiers, he performed the
                    duties of a general, and in the battle those of a soldier. And since they [<name type="pers">Titurius</name> and <name type="pers">Cotta</name>] could less
                    easily perform every thing by themselves, and provide what was to be done in
                    each place, by reason of the length of the line of march, they ordered [the
                    officers] to give the command that they should leave the baggage and form
                    themselves into an orb, which measure, though in a contingency of that nature it
                    was not to be condemned, still turned out unfortunately; for it both diminished
                    the hope of our soldiers and rendered the enemy more eager for the fight,
                    because it appeared that this was not done without the greatest fear and
                    despair. Besides that happened, which would necessarily be the case, that the
                    soldiers for the most part quitted their ensigns and hurried to seek and carry
                    off from the baggage whatever each thought valuable, and all parts were filled
                    with uproar and lamentation. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="34">
                <p>But judgment was not wanting to the barbarians; for their leaders ordered [the

                    the booty was theirs, and for them was reserved whatever the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> should leave; therefore let them consider that all things
                    depended on their victory. Our men were equal to them in fighting, both in
                    courage and in number, and though they were deserted by their leader and by
                    fortune, yet they still placed all hope of safety in their valor, and as often
                    as any cohort sallied forth on that side, a great number of the enemy usually
                    fell. <name>Ambiorix</name>, when he observed this, orders the command to be
                    issued that they throw their weapons from a distance and do not approach too
                    near, and in whatever direction the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> should
                    make an attack, there give way (from the lightness of their appointments and
                    from their daily practice no damage could be done them); [but] pursue them when
                    betaking themselves to their standards again. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="35">
                <p>Which command having been most carefully obeyed, when any cohort had quitted the
                    circle and made a charge, the enemy fled very precipitately. In the mean time,
                    that part of the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> army, of necessity, was left
                    unprotected, and the weapons received on their open flank. Again, when they had
                    begun to return to that place from which they had advanced, they were surrounded
                    both by those who had retreated and by those who stood next them; but if, on the
                    other hand, they wish to keep their place, neither was an opportunity left for
                    valor, nor could they, being crowded together, escape the weapons cast by so
                    large a body of men. Yet, though assailed by so many disadvantages, [and] having
                    received many wounds, they withstood the enemy, and, a great portion of the day
                    being spent, though they fought from day-break till the eighth hour, they did
                    nothing which was unworthy of them. At length, each thigh of <name type="pers">T. Balventius</name>, who the year before had been chief centurion, a brave
                    man and one of great authority, is pierced with a javelin; <name type="pers">Q.
                        Lucanius</name>, of the same rank, fighting most valiantly, is slain while
                    he assists his son when surrounded by the enemy; <name type="pers">L.
                        Cotta</name>, the lieutenant, when encouraging all the cohorts and
                    companies, is wounded full in the mouth by a sling. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="36">
                <p>Much troubled by these events, <name type="pers">Q. Titurius</name>, when he had
                    perceived <name>Ambiorix</name> in the distance encouraging his men, sends to
                    him his interpreter, <name>Cn. Pompey</name>, to beg that he would spare him and
                    his soldiers. He, when addressed, replied, "If he wishes to confer with him, it
                    was permitted; that he hoped what pertained to the safety of the soldiers could
                    be obtained from the people; that to him however certainly no injury would be
                    done, and that he pledged his faith to that effect." He consults with <name type="pers">Cotta</name>, who had been wounded, whether it would appear
                    right to retire from battle, and confer with <name>Ambiorix</name>; [saying]
                    that he hoped to be able to succeed respecting his own and the soldiers' safety.
                        <name type="pers">Cotta</name> says he will not go to an armed enemy, and in
                    that perseveres. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="37">
                <p><name type="pers">Sabinus</name> orders those tribunes of the soldiers whom he
                    had at the time around him, and the centurions of the first ranks, to follow
                    him, and when he had approached near to <name>Ambiorix</name>, being ordered to
                    throw down his arms, he obeys the order and commands his men to do the same. In
                    the mean time, while they treat upon the terms, and a longer debate than
                    necessary is designedly entered into by <name>Ambiorix</name>, being surrounded
                    by degrees, he is slain. Then they, according to their custom, shout out
                    "Victory," and raise their war-cry, and, making an attack on our men, break
                    their ranks. <name type="pers">There L. Cotta</name>, while fighting, is slain,

                    great number of the enemy, threw the eagle within the intrenchments and is
                    himself slain while fighting with the greatest courage before the camp. They
                    with difficulty sustain the attack till night; despairing of safety, they all to
                    a man destroy themselves in the night. A few escaping from the battle, made

                    halts neither day nor night, and orders the infantry to follow him closely.
                    Having related the exploit and roused the <name>Aduatuci</name>, the next day he
                    arrived among the <name>Nervii</name>, and entreats "that they should not throw

                    them;" [he tells them] "that two lieutenants have been slain, and that a large
                    portion of the army has perished; that it was not a matter of difficulty for the
                    legion which was wintering with <name type="pers">Cicero</name> to be cut off,
                    when suddenly assaulted; he declares himself ready to cooperate in that design.
                    He easily gains over the <name>Nervii</name> by this speech. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="39">
                <p>Accordingly, messengers having been forthwith dispatched to the

                    the <name>Pleumoxii</name>, and the <name>Geiduni</name>, all of whom are under
                    their government, they assemble as large bodies as they can, and rush
                    unexpectedly to the winter-quarters of <name type="pers">Cicero</name>, the
                    report of the death of <name type="pers">Titurius</name> not having as yet been
                    conveyed to him. That also occurred to him, which was the consequence of a
                    necessary work-that some soldiers who had gone off into the woods for the
                    purpose of procuring timber and therewith constructing fortifications, were
                    intercepted by the sudden arrival of [the enemy's] horse. These having been
                    entrapped, the <name>Eburones</name>, the <name>Nervii</name>, and the
                        <name>Aduatici</name> and all their allies and dependents, begin to attack
                    the legion: our men quickly run together to arms and mount the rampart; they
                    sustained the attack that day with great difficulty, since the enemy placed all
                    their hope in dispatch, and felt assured that, if they obtained this victory,
                    they would be conquerors forever. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="40">
                <p>Letters are immediately sent to <name type="pers">Caesar</name> by <name type="pers">Cicero</name>, great rewards being offered [to the messengers]
                    if they carried them through. All these passes having been beset, those who were
                    sent are intercepted. During the night as many as 120 towers are raised with
                    incredible dispatch out of the timber which they had collected for the purpose
                    of fortification: the things which seemed necessary to the work are completed.
                    The following day the enemy, having collected far greater forces, attack the
                    camp [and] fill up the ditch. Resistance is made by our men in the same manner
                    as the day before; this same thing is done afterward during the remaining days.
                    The work is carried on incessantly in the night: not even to the sick, or
                    wounded, is opportunity given for rest: whatever things are required for
                    resisting the assault of the next day are provided during the night: many stakes
                    burned at the end, and a large number of mural pikes are procured: towers are
                    built up, battlements and parapets are formed of interwoven hurdles. <name type="pers">Cicero</name> himself, though he was in very weak health, did
                    not leave himself the night-time for repose, so that he was forced to spare
                    himself by the spontaneous movement and entreaties of the soldiers. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="41">
                <p>Then these leaders and chiefs of the <name>Nervii</name>, who had any intimacy
                    and grounds of friendship with <name type="pers">Cicero</name>, say they desire
                    to confer with him. When permission was granted, they recount the same things
                    which <name>Ambiorix</name> had related to <name type="pers">Titurius</name>,
                    namely, "that all <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name> was in arms, that the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> had passed the <name key="tgn,7012611" type="place" n="Rhine [6,51.833] (river), Europe">Rhine </name>, that the
                    winter-quarters of <name type="pers">Caesar</name> and of the others were
                    attacked." They report in addition also, about the death of <name type="pers">Sabinus</name>. They point to <name>Ambiorix</name> for the purpose of
                    obtaining credence; "they are mistaken," say they, "if they hoped for any relief
                    from those who distrust their own affairs; that they bear such feelings toward
                        <name type="pers">Cicero</name> and the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name>
                    people that they deny them nothing but winter-quarters, and are unwilling that
                    the practice should become constant; that through their [the
                    <name>Nervii</name>'s] means it is possible for them [the <name>Romans]</name>
                    to depart from their winter-quarters safely and to proceed without fear into
                    whatever parts they desire." To these <name type="pers">Cicero</name> made only
                    one reply: "that it is not the custom of the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name>
                    people to accept any condition from an armed enemy: if they are willing to lay
                    down their arms, they may employ him as their advocate and send embassadors to
                        <name type="pers">Caesar</name>: that he believed, from his
                        <name>[Caesar</name>'s] justice, they would obtain the things which they
                    might request." </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="42">
                <p>Disappointed in this hope, the <name>Nervii</name> surround the winter-quarters
                    with a rampart eleven feet high, and a ditch thirteen feet in depth. These
                    military works they had learned from our men in the intercourse of former years,
                    and, having taken some of our army prisoners, were instructed by them: but, as
                    they had no supply of iron tools which are requisite for this service, they were
                    forced to cut the turf with their swords, and to empty out the earth with their
                    hands and cloaks, from which circumstance, the vast number of the men could be
                    inferred; for in less than three hours they completed a fortification of ten
                    miles in circumference; and during the rest of the days they began to prepare
                    and construct towers of the height of the ramparts, and grappling irons, and
                    mantelets, which the same prisoners had taught them. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="43">
                <p>On the seventh day of the attack, a very high wind having sprung up, they began
                    to discharge by their slings hot balls made of burned or hardened clay, and
                    heated javelins, upon the huts, which, after the <name>Gallic</name> custom,
                    were thatched with straw. These quickly took fire, and by the violence of the
                    wind, scattered their flames in every part of the camp. The enemy following up
                    their success with a very loud shout, as if victory were already obtained and
                    secured, began to advance their towers and mantelets, and climb the rampart with
                    ladders. But so great was the courage of our soldiers, and such their presence
                    of mind, that though they were scorched on all sides, and harassed by a vast
                    number of weapons, and were aware that their baggage and their possessions were
                    burning, not only did no one quit the rampart for the purpose of withdrawing
                    from the scene, but scarcely did any one even then look behind; and they all
                    fought most vigorously and most valiantly. This day was by far the most
                    calamitous to our men; it had this result, however, that on that day the largest
                    number of the enemy was wounded and slain, since they had crowded beneath the
                    very rampart, and the hindmost did not afford the foremost a retreat. The flame
                    having abated a little, and a tower having been brought up in a particular place
                    and touching the rampart, the centurions of the third cohort retired from the
                    place in which they were standing, and drew off all their men: they began to
                    call on the enemy by gestures and by words, to enter if they wished; but none of
                    them dared to advance. Then stones having been cast from every quarter, the
                    enemy were dislodged, and their tower set on fire. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="44">
                <p>In that legion there were two very brave men, centurions, who were now
                    approaching the first ranks, <name type="pers">T. Pulfio</name>, and <name type="pers">L. Varenus</name>. These used to have continual disputes between
                    them which of them should be preferred, and every year used to contend for
                    promotion with the utmost animosity. When the fight was going on most vigorously
                    before the fortifications, <name type="pers">Pulfio</name>, one of them, says,
                    "Why do you hesitate, <name type="pers">Varenus</name>? or what [better]
                    opportunity of signalizing your valor do you seek? This very day shall decide
                    our disputes." When he had uttered these words, he proceeds beyond the
                    fortifications, and rushes on that part of the enemy which appeared the
                    thickest. Nor does <name type="pers">Varenus</name> remain within the rampart,
                    but respecting the high opinion of all, follows close after. Then, when an
                    inconsiderable space intervened, <name type="pers">Pulfio</name> throws his
                    javelin at the enemy, and pierces one of the multitude who was running up, and
                    while the latter was wounded and slain, the enemy cover him with their shields,
                    and all throw their weapons at the other and afford him no opportunity of
                    retreating. The shield of <name type="pers">Pulfio</name> is pierced and a
                    javelin is fastened in his belt. This circumstance turns aside his scabbard and
                    obstructs his right hand when attempting to draw his sword: the enemy crowd
                    around him when [thus] embarrassed. His rival runs up to him and succors him in
                    this emergency. Immediately the whole host turn from <name type="pers">Pulfio</name> to him, supposing the other to be pierced through by the
                    javelin. <name type="pers">Varenus</name> rushes on briskly with his sword and
                    carries on the combat hand to hand, and having slain one man, for a short time
                    drove back the rest: while he urges on too eagerly, slipping into a hollow, he
                    fell. To him, in his turn, when surrounded, <name type="pers">Pulfio</name>
                    brings relief; and both having slain a great number, retreat into the
                    fortifications amid the highest applause. Fortune so dealt with both in this
                    rivalry and conflict, that the one competitor was a succor and a safeguard to
                    the other, nor could it be determined which of the two appeared worthy of being
                    preferred to the other. </p></div>

                <p>In proportion as the attack became daily more formidable and violent, and
                    particularly, because, as a great number of the soldiers were exhausted with
                    wounds, the matter had come to a small number of defenders, more frequent
                    letters and messages were sent to <name type="pers">Caesar</name>; a part of

                    exhibited his fidelity to him. He persuades his slave, by the hope of freedom,
                    and by great rewards, to convey a letter to <name type="pers">Caesar</name>.
                    This he carries out bound about his javelin; and mixing among the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> without any suspicion by being a <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, he reaches <name type="pers">Caesar</name>. From him they

                    quickly be there: he entreats him to maintain his ancient valor. The <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name> apprehending danger, throws his spear as he has been directed.

                    assembly of the soldiers, and fills all with the greatest joy. Then the smoke of
                    the fires was seen in the distance, a circumstance which banished all doubt of
                    the arrival of the legions. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="49">
                <p>The <name>Gauls</name>, having discovered the matter through their scouts,
                    abandon the blockade, and march toward <name type="pers">Caesar</name> with all
                    their forces; these were about 60,000 armed men. <name type="pers">Cicero</name>, an opportunity being now afforded, again begs of that
                        <name>Vertico</name>, the <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, whom we mentioned above,
                    to convey back a letter to <name type="pers">Caesar</name>; he advises him to
                    perform his journey warily; he writes in the letter that the enemy had departed
                    and had turned their entire force against him. When this letter was brought to
                    him about the middle of the night, <name type="pers">Caesar</name> apprises his
                    soldiers of its contents, and inspires them with courage for fighting: the
                    following day, at the dawn, he moves his camp, and, having proceeded four miles,
                    he espies the forces of the enemy on the other side of a considerable valley and
                    rivulet. It was an affair of great danger to fight with such large forces in a
                    disadvantageous situation. For the present, therefore, inasmuch as he knew that
                        <name type="pers">Cicero</name> was released from the blockade, and thought
                    that he might, on that account, relax his speed, he halted there and fortifies a
                    camp in the most favorable position he can. And this, though it was small in
                    itself, [there being] scarcely 7,000 men, and these too without baggage, still
                    by the narrowness of the passages, he contracts as much as he can, with this
                    object, that he may come into the greatest contempt with the enemy. In the mean
                    while scouts having been sent in all directions, he examines by what most
                    convenient path he might cross the valley. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="50">
                <p>That day, slight skirmishes of cavalry having taken place near the river, both
                    armies kept in their own positions: the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>,
                    because they were awaiting larger forces which had not then arrived; <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, [to see] if perchance by pretense of fear he
                    could allure the enemy toward his position, so that he might engage in battle,
                    in front of his camp, on this side of the valley; if he could not accomplish
                    this, that, having inquired about the passes, he might cross the valley and the
                    river with the less hazard. At daybreak the cavalry of the enemy approaches to
                    the camp and joins battle with our horse. <name type="pers">Caesar</name> orders
                    the horse to give way purposely, and retreat to the camp: at the same time he
                    orders the camp to be fortified with a higher rampart in all directions, the
                    gates to be barricaded, and in executing these things as much confusion to be
                    shown as possible, and to perform them under the pretense of fear. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="51">
                <p>Induced by all these things, the enemy lead over their forces and draw up their
                    line in a disadvantageous position; and as our men also had been led down from
                    the ramparts, they approach nearer, and throw their weapons into the
                    fortification from all sides, and sending heralds round, order it to be
                    proclaimed that, if "any, either <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name> or <name type="ethnic">Roman</name>, was willing to go over to them before the third hour, it was
                    permitted; after that time there would not be permission;" and so much did they
                    disregard our men, that the gates having been blocked up with single rows of
                    turf as a mere appearance, because they did not seem able to burst in that way,
                    some began to pull down the rampart with their hands, others to fill up the
                    trenches. Then <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, making a sally from all the
                    gates, and sending out the cavalry, soon puts the enemy to flight, so that no
                    one at all stood his ground with the intention of fighting; and he slew a great
                    number of them, and deprived all of their arms. </p></div>

                    same day with all his forces safe. He witnesses with surprise the towers,
                    mantelets, and [other] fortifications belonging to the enemy: the legion having
                    been drawn out, he finds that even every tenth soldier had not escaped without
                    wounds. From all these things he judges with what danger and with what great
                    courage matters had been conducted; he commends <name type="pers">Cicero</name>
                    according to his desert, and likewise the legion; he addresses individually the
                    centurions and the tribunes of the soldiers, whose valor he had discovered to
                    have been signal. He receives information of the death of <name type="pers">Sabinus</name> and <name type="pers">Cotta</name> from the prisoners. An
                    assembly being held the following day, he states the occurrence; he consoles and

                    occasioned by the misconduct and rashness of his lieutenant, should be borne
                    with a patient mind, because by the favor of the immortal gods and their own
                    valor, neither was lasting joy left to the enemy, nor very lasting grief to

                    into all quarters, inquiring what further measure they should take, and holding

                        <name type="ethnic">Remi</name>, devastate their lands, and attack the camp
                    of <name type="pers">Labienus</name>: before he does that, he informs them of
                    what he desires to be done. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="57">
                <p><name type="pers">Labienus</name>, since he was confining himself within a camp
                    strongly fortified by the nature of the ground and by art, had no apprehensions
                    as to his own and the legion's danger, but was devising that he might throw away
                    no opportunity of conducting the war successfully. Accordingly, the speech of
                        <name>Indutiomarus</name>, which he had delivered in the council, having
                    been made known [to him] by <name>Cingetorix</name> and his allies, he sends
                    messengers to the neighboring states and summons horse from all quarters: he
                    appoints to them a fixed day for assembling. In the mean time,
                        <name>Indutiomarus</name>, with all his cavalry, nearly every day used to
                    parade close to his <name>[Labienus</name>'] camp; at one time, that he might
                    inform himself of the situation of the camp; at another time, for the purpose of
                    conferring with or of intimidating him. <name type="pers">Labienus</name>
                    confined his men within the fortifications, and promoted the enemy's belief of
                    his fear by whatever methods he could. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="58">
                <p>Since <name>Indutiomarus</name> was daily advancing up to the camp with greater
                    defiance, all the cavalry of the neighboring states which he [<name type="pers">Labienus</name>] had taken care to have sent for, having been admitted in
                    one night, he confined all his men within the camp by guards with such great
                    strictness, that that fact could by no means be reported or carried to the <name key="tgn,7004447" type="place" n="  +Trier [6.65,49.75] (inhabited place), Trier, Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany, Europe ">Treviri </name>. In the mean while, <name>Indutiomarus</name>, according to
                    his daily practice, advances up to the camp and spends a great part of the day
                    there: his horse cast their weapons, and with very insulting language call out
                    our men to battle. No reply being given by our men, the enemy, when they thought
                    proper, depart toward evening in a disorderly and scattered manner, <name type="pers">Labienus</name> unexpectedly sends out all the cavalry by two
                    gates; he gives this command and prohibition, that, when the enemy should be
                    terrified and put to flight (which he foresaw would happen, as it did), they
                    should all make for <name>Indutiomarus</name>, and no one wound any man before
                    he should have seen him slain, because he was unwilling that he should escape,
                    in consequence of gaining time by the delay [occasioned by the pursuit] of the
                    rest. He offers great rewards for those who should kill him: he sends up the
                    cohorts as a relief to the horse. The issue justifies the policy of the man, and
                    since all aimed at one, <name>Indutiomarus</name> is slain, having been
                    overtaken at the very ford of the river, and his head is carried to the camp,
                    the horse, when returning, pursue and slay all whom they can. This affair having
                    been known, all the forces of the <name>Eburones</name> and the
                        <name>Nervii</name> which had assembled, depart; and for a short time after

                    should appear so great that if any loss should be sustained in war, not only

                    had arrived by the order of <name type="pers">Caesar</name>. Having pitched
                    their camp fifteen miles off, they resolve to await the support of the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>. <name type="pers">Labienus</name>, having
                    learned the design of the enemy, hoping that through their rashness there would

                    cavalry, and, leaving the space of a mile between them, fortifies his camp.
                    There was between <name type="pers">Labienus</name> and the enemy a river
                    difficult to cross, and with steep banks: this neither did he himself design to
                    cross, nor did he suppose the enemy would cross it. Their hope of auxiliaries
                    was daily increasing. He <name>[Labienus]</name> openly says in a council that
                    "since the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> are said to be approaching, he
                    would not bring into uncertainty his own and the army's fortunes, and the next
                    day would move his camp at early dawn." These words are quickly carried to the
                    enemy, since out of so large a number of cavalry composed of <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>, nature compelled some to favor the <name>Gallic</name>

                    camp to be moved with greater noise and confusion than was usual with the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people. By these means he makes his departure
                    [appear] like a retreat. These things, also, since the camps were so near, are

                    hands the anticipated booty, that it was a tedious thing, while the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> were panic-stricken, to be waiting for the aid
                    of the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>, and that their dignity did not suffer
                    them to fear to attack with such great forces so small a band, particularly when
                    retreating and encumbered," do not hesitate to cross the river and give battle
                    in a disadvantageous position. <name type="pers">Labienus</name> suspecting that
                    these things would happen, was proceeding quietly, and using the same pretense
                    of a march, in order that he might entice them across the river. Then, having
                    sent forward the baggage some short distance and placed it on a certain
                    eminence, he says, "Soldiers, you have the opportunity you have sought: you hold
                    the enemy in an encumbered and disadvantageous position: display to us, your
                    leaders, the same valor you have ofttimes displayed to your general: imagine
                    that he is present and actually sees these exploits." At the same time he orders
                    the troops to face about toward the enemy and form in line of battle, and,
                    dispatching a few troops of cavalry as a guard for the baggage, he places the
                    rest of the horse on the wings. Our men, raising a shout, quickly throw their
                    javelins at the enemy. They, when, contrary to their expectation, they saw those
                    whom they believed to be retreating, advance toward them with threatening
                    banners, were not able to sustain even the charge, and, being put to flight at
                    the first onslaught, sought the nearest woods; <name type="pers">Labienus</name>
                    pursuing them with the cavalry, upon a large number being slain, and several

                    power and government were delivered to <name>Cingetorix</name>, whom we have

                    </name>; one of which was, because they had sent assistance to the <name key="tgn,7004447" type="place" n="  +Trier [6.65,49.75] (inhabited place), Trier, Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany, Europe ">Treviri </name> against him; the other, that <name>Ambiorix</name> might
                    not have a retreat among them. Having determined on these matters, he began to
                    build a bridge a little above that place where he had before conveyed over his
                    army. The plan having been known and laid down, the work is accomplished in a
                    few days by the great exertion of the soldiers. Having left a strong guard at
                    the bridge on the side of the <name key="tgn,7004447" type="place" n="  +Trier [6.65,49.75] (inhabited place), Trier, Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany, Europe ">Treviri </name>, lest any commotion should suddenly arise among them, he
                    leads over the rest of the forces and the cavalry. The <name>Ubii</name>, who
                    before had sent hostages and come to a capitulation, send embassadors to him,
                    for the purpose of vindicating themselves, to assure him that "neither had

                    they entreat and beseech him "to spare them, lest, in his common hatred of the

                    of the guilty: they promise to give more hostages, if he desire them." Having
                    investigated the case, <name type="pers">Caesar</name> finds that the
                    auxiliaries had been sent by the <name>Suevi</name>; he accepts the apology of

                    giving orders to those nations which are under their government to send
                    auxiliaries of infantry and of cavalry. Having learned these things, he provides
                    a supply of corn, selects a proper place for his camp, and commands the
                        <name>Ubii</name> to drive off their cattle and carry away all their
                    possessions from the country parts into the towns, hoping that they, being a
                    barbarous and ignorant people, when harassed by the want of provisions, might be
                    brought to an engagement on disadvantageous terms: he orders them to send

                <p>Since we have come to the place, it does not appear to be foreign to our subject
                    to lay before the reader an account of the manners of <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name> and <name key="tgn,7000084" type="place" n="  +Germany [10.5,51.5] (nation), Europe ">Germany </name>, and wherein

                    in all the states, and in all the cantons and their divisions, but almost in
                    each family, and of these factions those are the leaders who are considered
                    according to their judgment to possess the greatest influence, upon whose will
                    and determination the management of all affairs and measures depends. And that
                    seems to have been instituted in ancient times with this view, that no one of
                    the common people should be in want of support against one more powerful; for,
                    none [of those leaders] suffers his party to be oppressed and defrauded, and if
                    he do otherwise, he has no influence among his party. This same policy exists
                    throughout the whole of <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>; for all the states are
                    divided into two factions. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="12">
                <p>When <name type="pers">Caesar</name> arrived in <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, the
                        <name>Aedui</name> were the leaders of one faction, the <name>Sequani</name>
                    of the other. Since the latter were less powerful by themselves, inasmuch as the
                    chief influence was from of old among the <name>Aedui</name>, and their
                    dependencies were great, they had united to themselves the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> and <name>Ariovistus</name>, and had brought them over to
                    their party by great sacrifices and promises. And having fought several
                    successful battles and slain all the nobility of the <name>Aedui</name>, they
                    had so far surpassed them in power, that they brought over, from the
                        <name>Aedui</name> to themselves, a large portion of their dependents and
                    received from them the sons of their leading men as hostages, and compelled them
                    to swear in their public character that they would enter into no design against
                    them; and held a portion of the neighboring land, seized on by force, and
                    possessed the sovereignty of the whole of <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>. <name>Divitiacus</name>
                    urged by this necessity, had proceeded to <name key="perseus,Rome" type="place" n="  +Rome [12.4833,41.9] (Perseus) ">Rome </name> to the senate, for the
                    purpose of entreating assistance, and had returned without accomplishing his
                    object. A change of affairs ensued on the arrival of <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, the hostages were returned to the <name>Aedui</name>, their
                    old dependencies restored, and new acquired through <name type="pers">Caesar</name> (because those who had attached themselves to their alliance
                    saw that they enjoyed a better state and a milder government), their other
                    interests, their influence, their reputation were likewise increased, and in
                    consequence, the <name>Sequani</name> lost the sovereignty. The <name key="tgn,7011060" type="place" n="  +Reims [4.33,49.25] (inhabited place), Marne, Champagne-Ardenne, France, Europe ">Remi </name> succeeded to their place, and, as it was perceived that they
                    equaled the <name>Aedui</name> in favor with <name type="pers">Caesar</name>,
                    those, who on account of their old animosities could by no means coalesce with
                    the <name>Aedui</name>, consigned themselves in clientship to the <name type="ethnic">Remi</name>. The latter carefully protected them. Thus they
                    possessed both a new and suddenly acquired influence. Affairs were then in that
                    position that the <name>Aedui</name> were considered by far the leading people,
                    and the <name type="ethnic">Remi</name> held the second post of honor.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="13">
                <p>Throughout all <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name> there are two orders of
                    those men who are of any rank and dignity: for the commonality is held almost in
                    the condition of slaves, and dares to undertake nothing of itself, and is
                    admitted to no deliberation. The greater part, when they are pressed either by
                    debt, or the large amount of their tributes, or the oppression of the more
                    powerful, give themselves up in vassalage to the nobles, who possess over them
                    the same rights without exception as masters over their slaves. But of these two
                    orders, one is that of the <name>Druids</name>, the other that of the knights.
                    The former are engaged in things sacred, conduct the public and the private
                    sacrifices, and interpret all matters of religion. To these a large number of
                    the young men resort for the purpose of instruction, and they [the
                        <name>Druids]</name> are in great honor among them. For they determine
                    respecting almost all controversies, public and private; and if any crime has
                    been perpetrated, if murder has been committed, if there be any dispute about an
                    inheritance, if any about boundaries, these same persons decide it; they decree
                    rewards and punishments; if any one, either in a private or public capacity, has
                    not submitted to their decision, they interdict him from the sacrifices. This
                    among them is the most heavy punishment. Those who have been thus interdicted
                    are esteemed in the number of the impious and the criminal: all shun them, and
                    avoid their society and conversation, lest they receive some evil from their
                    contact; nor is justice administered to them when seeking it, nor is any dignity
                    bestowed on them. Over all these <name>Druids</name> one presides, who possesses
                    supreme authority among them. Upon his death, if any individual among the rest
                    is pre-eminent in dignity, he succeeds; but, if there are many equal, the
                    election is made by the suffrages of the <name>Druids</name>; sometimes they
                    even contend for the presidency with arms. These assemble at a fixed period of
                    the year in a consecrated place in the territories of the <name>Carnutes</name>,
                    which is reckoned the central region of the whole of <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>. Hither all,
                    who have disputes, assemble from every part, and submit to their decrees and
                    determinations. This institution is supposed to have been devised in <name key="tgn,7008653" type="place" n="Great Britain (island), United Kingdom, Europe">Britain</name>, and to
                    have been brought over from it into <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>; and now those who desire
                    to gain a more accurate knowledge of that system generally proceed thither for
                    the purpose of studying it. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="14">
                <p>The <name>Druids</name> do not go to war, nor pay tribute together with the rest;
                    they have an exemption from military service and a dispensation in all matters.
                    Induced by such great advantages, many embrace this profession of their own
                    accord, and [many] are sent to it by their parents and relations. They are said
                    there to learn by heart a great number of verses; accordingly some remain in the
                    course of training twenty years. Nor do they regard it lawful to commit these to
                    writing, though in almost all other matters, in their public and private
                    transactions, they use <name>Greek</name> characters. That practice they seem to
                    me to have adopted for two reasons; because they neither desire their doctrines
                    to be divulged among the mass of the people, nor those who learn, to devote
                    themselves the less to the efforts of memory, relying on writing; since it
                    generally occurs to most men, that, in their dependence on writing, they relax
                    their diligence in learning thoroughly, and their employment of the memory. They
                    wish to inculcate this as one of their leading tenets, that souls do not become
                    extinct, but pass after death from one body to another, and they think that men
                    by this tenet are in a great degree excited to valor, the fear of death being
                    disregarded. They likewise discuss and impart to the youth many things
                    respecting the stars and their motion, respecting the extent of the world and of
                    our earth, respecting the nature of things, respecting the power and the majesty
                    of the immortal gods. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="15">
                <p>The other order is that of the knights. These, when there is occasion and any war
                    occurs (which before <name type="pers">Caesar</name>'s arrival was for the most
                    part wont to happen every year, as either they on their part were inflecting
                    injuries or repelling those which others inflected on them), are all engaged in
                    war. And those of them most distinguished by birth and resources, have the
                    greatest number of vassals and dependents about them. They acknowledge this sort
                    of influence and power only. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="16">
                <p>The nation of all the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> is extremely devoted to
                    superstitious rites; and on that account they who are troubled with unusually
                    severe diseases, and they who are engaged in battles and dangers, either
                    sacrifice men as victims, or vow that they will sacrifice them, and employ the
                        <name>Druids</name> as the performers of those sacrifices; because they
                    think that unless the life of a man be offered for the life of a man, the mind
                    of the immortal gods can not be rendered propitious, and they have sacrifices of
                    that kind ordained for national purposes. Others have figures of vast size, the
                    limbs of which formed of osiers they fill with living men, which being set on
                    fire, the men perish enveloped in the flames. They consider that the oblation of
                    such as have been taken in theft, or in robbery, or any other offense, is more
                    acceptable to the immortal gods; but when a supply of that class is wanting,
                    they have recourse to the oblation of even the innocent. </p></div>

                    deities they have for the most part the same belief as other nations: that <name type="pers">Apollo</name> averts diseases, that <name type="pers">Minerva</name> imparts the invention of manufactures, that <name key="tgn,1125260" type="place" n="  +Jupiter (river), Anticosti Island, Quebec, Canada, North and Central America ">Jupiter </name> possesses the sovereignty of the heavenly powers; that

                    determined to engage in battle, they commonly vow those things which they shall
                    take in war. When they have conquered, they sacrifice whatever captured animals
                    may have survived the conflict, and collect the other things into one place. In
                    many states you may see piles of these things heaped up in their consecrated
                    spots; nor does it often happen that any one, disregarding the sanctity of the
                    case, dares either to secrete in his house things captured, or take away those
                    deposited; and the most severe punishment, with torture, has been established
                    for such a deed. </p></div>

                    Among the other usages of their life, they differ in this from almost all other

                    rank, has died, his relations assemble, and, if the circumstances of his death
                    are suspicious, hold an investigation upon the wives in the manner adopted
                    toward slaves; and, if proof be obtained, put them to severe torture, and kill
                    them. Their funerals, considering the state of civilization among the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>, are magnificent and costly; and they cast into

                    the sun, fire, and the moon; they have not heard of the other deities even by

                    military art; from childhood they devote themselves to fatigue and hardships.
                    Those who have remained chaste for the longest time, receive the greatest

                <p>It is the greatest glory to the several states to have as wide deserts as
                    possible around them, their frontiers having been laid waste. They consider this
                    the real evidence of their prowess, that their neighbors shall be driven out of
                    their lands and abandon them, and that no one dare settle near them; at the same
                    time they think that they shall be on that account the more secure, because they
                    have removed the apprehension of a sudden incursion. When a state either repels
                    war waged against it, or wages it against another, magistrates are chosen to
                    preside over that war with such authority, that they have power of life and
                    death. In peace there is no common magistrate, but the chiefs of provinces and
                    cantons administer justice and determine controversies among their own people.
                    Robberies which are committed beyond the boundaries of each state bear no
                    infamy, and they avow that these are committed for the purpose of disciplining
                    their youth and of preventing sloth. And when any of their chiefs has said in an
                    assembly "that he will be their leader, let those who are willing to follow,
                    give in their names;" they who approve of both the enterprise and the man arise
                    and promise their assistance and are applauded by the people; such of them as
                    have not followed him are accounted in the number of deserters and traitors, and
                    confidence in all matters is afterward refused them. To injure guests they
                    regard as impious; they defend from wrong those who have come to them for any
                    purpose whatever, and esteem them inviolable; to them the houses of all are open

                    begins at the frontiers of the <name type="ethnic">Helvetii</name>,
                        <name>Nemetes</name>, and <name>Rauraci</name>, and extends in a right line

                    in a different direction from the river, and owing to its extent touches the
                    confines of many nations; nor is there any person belonging to this part of

                    journey of sixty days, or has heard in what place it begins. It is certain that
                    many kinds of wild beast are produced in it which have not been seen in other
                    parts; of which the following are such as differ principally from other animals,
                    and appear worthy of being committed to record. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="26">
                <p>There is an ox of the shape of a stag, between whose ears a horn rises from the
                    middle of the forehead, higher and straighter than those horns which are known
                    to us. From the top of this, branches, like palms, stretch out a considerable
                    distance. The shape of the female and of the male is the, same; the appearance
                    and the size of the horns is the same. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="27">
                <p>There are also [animals] which are called elks. The shape of these, and the
                    varied color of their skins, is much like roes, but in size they surpass them a
                    little and are destitute of horns, and have legs without joints and ligatures;
                    nor do they lie down for the purpose of rest, nor, if they have been thrown down
                    by any accident, can they raise or lift themselves up. Trees serve as beds to
                    them; they lean themselves against them, and thus reclining only slightly, they
                    take their rest; when the huntsmen have discovered from the footsteps of these
                    animals whither they are accustomed to betake themselves, they either undermine
                    all the trees at the roots, or cut into them so far that the upper part of the
                    trees may appear to be left standing. When they have leant upon them, according
                    to their habit, they knock down by their weight the unsupported trees, and fall
                    down themselves along with them. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="28">
                <p>There is a third kind, consisting of those animals which are called uri. These
                    are a little below the elephant in size, and of the appearance, color, and shape
                    of a bull. Their strength and speed are extraordinary; they spare neither man
                    nor wild beast which they have espied. These the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> take with much pains in pits and kill them. The young men
                    harden themselves with this exercise, and practice themselves in this kind of
                    hunting, and those who have slain the greatest number of them, having produced
                    the horns in public, to serve as evidence, receive great praise. But not even
                    when taken very young can they be rendered familiar to men and tamed. The size,
                    shape, and appearance of their horns differ much from the horns of our oxen.
                    These they anxiously seek after, and bind at the tips with silver, and use as
                    cups at their most sumptuous entertainments. </p></div>

                        <name>Ambiorix</name> himself, to the place in which he was said to be with
                    a few horse. Fortune accomplishes much, not only in other matters, but also in
                    the art of war. For as it happened by a remarkable chance, that he fell upon
                        [<name>Ambiorix</name>] himself unguarded and unprepared, and that his
                    arrival was seen by the people before the report or information of his arrival
                    was carried thither; so it was an incident of extraordinary fortune that,
                    although every implement of war which he was accustomed to have about him was
                    seized, and his chariots and horses surprised, yet he himself escaped death. But
                    it was effected owing to this circumstance, that his house being surrounded by a

                    who, for the purpose of avoiding heat, mostly seek the neighborhood of woods and
                    rivers), his attendants and friends in a narrow spot sustained for a short time
                    the attack of our horse. While they were fighting, one of his followers mounted
                    him on a horse; the woods sheltered him as he fled. Thus fortune tended much

                    into the extensive morasses; those who were nearest the ocean concealed
                    themselves in the islands which the tides usually form; many, departing from
                    their territories, committed themselves and all their possessions to perfect

                    they did that, he will not injure their territories. Then, having divided his
                    forces into three parts, he sent the baggage of all the legions to
                        <name>Aduatuca</name>. That is the name of a fort. This is nearly in the

                    fortifications of the previous year remained, in order that he might relieve the
                    labor of the soldiers. He left the fourteenth legion as a guard for the baggage,

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="34">
                <p>There was, as we have above observed, no regular army, nor a town, nor a garrison
                    which could defend itself by arms; but the people were scattered in all
                    directions. Where either a hidden valley, or a woody spot, or a difficult morass
                    furnished any hope of protection or of security to any one, there he had fixed
                    himself. These places were known to those who dwelt in the neighborhood, and the
                    matter demanded great attention, not so much in protecting the main body of the
                    army (for no peril could occur to them altogether from those alarmed and
                    scattered troops), as in preserving individual soldiers; which in some measure
                    tended to the safety of the army. For both the desire of booty was leading many
                    too far, and the woods with their unknown and hidden routes would not allow them
                    to go in large bodies. If he desired the business to be completed and the race
                    of those infamous people to be cut off, more bodies of men must be sent in
                    several directions and the soldiers must be detached on all sides; if he were
                    disposed to keep the companies at their standards, as the established discipline
                    and practice of the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> army required, the
                    situation itself was a safeguard to the barbarians, nor was there wanting to
                    individuals the daring to lay secret ambuscades and beset scattered soldiers.
                    But amid difficulties of this nature as far as precautions could be taken by
                    vigilance, such precautions were taken; so that some opportunities of injuring
                    the enemy were neglected, though the minds of all were burning to take revenge,
                    rather than that injury should be effected with any loss to our soldiers. <name type="pers">Caesar</name> dispatches messengers to the neighboring states;
                    by the hope of booty he invites all to him, for the purpose of plundering the
                        <name>Eburones</name>, in order that the life of the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> might be hazarded in the woods rather than the legionary
                    soldiers; at the same time, in order that a large force being drawn around them,
                    the race and name of that state may be annihilated for such a crime. A large
                    number from all quarters speedily assembles. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="35">
                <p>These things were going on in all parts of the territories of the
                        <name>Eburones</name>, and the seventh day was drawing near, by which day
                        <name type="pers">Caesar</name> had purposed to return to the baggage and
                    the legion. Here it might be learned how much fortune achieves in war, and how
                    great casualties she produces. The enemy having been scattered and alarmed, as
                    we related above, there was no force which might produce even a slight occasion
                    of fear. The report extends beyond the <name key="tgn,7012611" type="place" n="Rhine [6,51.833] (river), Europe">Rhine </name> to the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> that the <name>Eburones</name> are being
                    pillaged, and that all were without distinction invited to the plunder. The

                    </name> in ships and barks thirty miles below that place where the bridge was
                    entire and the garrison left by <name type="pers">Caesar</name>; they arrive at
                    the frontiers of the <name>Eburones</name>, surprise many who were scattered in
                    flight, and get possession of a large amount of cattle, of which barbarians are
                    extremely covetous. <name>Allured</name> by booty, they advance further; neither
                    morass nor forest obstructs these men, born amid war and depredations; they
                    inquire of their prisoners in what part <name type="pers">Caesar</name> is; they
                    find that he has advanced further, and learn that all the army has removed.
                    Thereon one of the prisoners says, "Why do you pursue such wretched and trifling
                    spoil; you, to whom it is granted to become even now most richly endowed by
                    fortune? In three hours you can reach <name>Aduatuca</name>; there the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> army has deposited all its fortunes; there is so
                    little of a garrison that not even the wall can be manned, nor dare any one go
                    beyond the fortifications." A hope having been presented them, the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> leave in concealment the plunder they had
                    acquired; they themselves hasten to <name>Aduatuca</name>, employing as their
                    guide the same man by whose information they had become informed of these
                    things. </p></div>

                    he could be injured, within three miles of the camp, while nine legions and all
                    the cavalry were under arms, and the enemy scattered and almost annihilated,
                    sent five cohorts into the neighboring corn-lands, between which and the camp
                    only one hill intervened, for the purpose of foraging. Many soldiers of the
                    legions had been left invalided in the camp, of whom those who had recovered in
                    this space of time, being about 300, are sent together under one standard; a
                    large number of soldiers' attendants besides, with a great number of beasts of
                    burden, which had remained in the camp, permission being granted, follow them.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="37">
                <p>At this very time, the <name type="ethnic">German</name> horse by chance came up,
                    and immediately, with the same speed with which they had advanced, attempt to
                    force the camp at the <name>Decuman</name> gate, nor were they seen, in
                    consequence of woods lying in the way on that side, before they were just
                    reaching the camp: so much so, that the sutlers who had their booths under the
                    rampart had not an opportunity of retreating within the camp. Our men, not
                    anticipating it, are perplexed by the sudden affair, and the cohort on the
                    outpost scarcely sustains the first attack. The enemy spread themselves on the
                    other sides to ascertain if they could find any access. Our men with difficulty
                    defend the gates; the very position of itself and the fortification secures the
                    other accesses. There is a panic in the entire camp, and one inquires of another
                    the cause of the confusion, nor do they readily determine whither the standards
                    should be borne, nor into what quarter each should betake himself. One avows
                    that the camp is already taken, another maintains that, the enemy having
                    destroyed the army and commander-in-chief, are come hither as conquerors; most
                    form strange superstitious fancies from the spot, and place before their eyes
                    the catastrophe of <name type="pers">Cotta</name> and <name type="pers">Titurius</name>, who had fallen in the same fort. All being greatly
                    disconcerted by this alarm, the belief of the barbarians is strengthened that
                    there is no garrison within, as they had heard from their prisoner. They
                    endeavor to force an entrance and encourage one another not to cast from their
                    hands so valuable a prize. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="38">
                <p><name type="pers">P. Sextius Baculus</name>, who had led a principal century
                    under <name type="pers">Caesar</name> (of whom we have made mention in previous
                    engagements), had been left an invalid in the garrison, and had now been five
                    days without food. He, distrusting his own safety and that of all, goes forth
                    from his tent unarmed; he sees that the enemy are close at hand and that the
                    matter is in the utmost danger; he snatches arms from those nearest, and
                    stations himself at the gate. The centurions of that cohort which was on guard
                    follow him; for a short time they sustain the fight together. <name type="pers">Sextius</name> faints, after receiving many wounds; he is with difficulty
                    saved, drawn away by the hands of the soldiers. This space having intervened,
                    the others resume courage so far as to venture to take their place on the
                    fortifications and present the aspect of defenders. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="39">
                <p>The foraging having in the mean time been completed, our soldiers distinctly hear
                    the shout; the horse hasten on before and discover in what danger the affair is.
                    But here there is no fortification to receive them, in their alarm: those last
                    enlisted, and unskilled in military discipline turn their faces to the military
                    tribune and the centurions; they wait to find what orders may be given by them.
                    No one is so courageous as not to be disconcerted by the suddenness of the
                    affair. The barbarians, espying our standard in the distance, desist from the
                    attack; at first they suppose that the legions, which they had learned from
                    their prisoners had removed further off, had returned; afterward, despising
                    their small number, they make an attack on them at all sides. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="40">
                <p>The camp-followers run forward to the nearest rising ground; being speedily
                    driven from this they throw themselves among the standards and companies: they
                    thus so much the more alarm the soldiers already affrighted. Some propose that,
                    forming a wedge, they suddenly break through, since the camp was so near; and if
                    any part should be surrounded and slain, they fully trust that at least the rest
                    may be saved; others, that they take their stand on an eminence, and all undergo
                    the same destiny. The veteran soldiers whom we stated to have set out together
                    [with the others] under a standard, do not approve of this. Therefore
                    encouraging each other, under the conduct of <name>Caius Trebonius</name>, a
                        <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> knight, who had been appointed over them,
                    they break through the midst of the enemy, and arrive in the camp safe to a man.
                    The camp attendants and the horse following close upon them with the same
                    impetuosity, are saved by the courage of the soldiers. But those who had taken
                    their stand upon the eminence having even now acquired no experience of military
                    matters, neither could persevere in that resolution which they approved of,
                    namely, to defend themselves from their higher position, nor imitate that vigor
                    and speed which they had observed to have availed others; but, attempting to
                    reach the camp, had descended into an unfavorable situation. The centurions,
                    some of whom had been promoted for their valor from the lower ranks of other
                    legions to higher ranks in this legion, in order that they might not forfeit
                    their glory for military exploits previously acquired, fell together fighting
                    most valiantly. The enemy having been dislodged by their valor, a part of the
                    soldiers arrived safe in camp contrary to their expectations; a part perished,
                    surrounded by the barbarians. </p></div>

                    the most trivial casualty; that fortune had exercised great influence in the

                    each beheld, were on fire: spoil was being driven off from all parts; the corn
                    not only was being consumed by so great numbers of cattle and men, but also had
                    fallen to the earth, owing to the time of the year and the storms; so that if

                    And frequently it came to that point, as so large a body of cavalry had been

                    made for other districts and quarters, with no greater guard than that of four

                    far as they could, and strike as great a panic as possible into the enemy. These
                    proceedings are speedily announced to <name>Vercingetorix</name> by rumor and
                    his messengers. Around him all the <name>Arverni</name> crowd in alarm, and
                    solemnly entreat him to protect their property, and not to suffer them to be
                    plundered by the enemy, especially as he saw that all the war was transferred
                    into their country. Being prevailed upon by their entreaties he moves his camp

                    command of these forces; he gives him instructions that the cavalry should range

                    when the tributaries of the <name>Aedui</name> were subdued, because it would
                    appear that there was in him no protection for his friends; but if he should
                    draw them too soon out of their winter quarters, he might be distressed by the
                    want of provisions, in consequence of the difficulty of conveyance. It seemed
                    better, however, to endure every hardship than to alienate the affections of all

                    orders their arms to be brought together, their cattle to be brought forth, and
                    six hundred hostages to be given. He leaves <name>Caius Trebonius</name> his

                    day, and orders his soldiers to prepare whatever was necessary for that
                    enterprise; and as a bridge over the <name key="tgn,7012249" type="place" n="  +Loire (river), France, Europe ">Loire </name> connected the town of

                    legions which he had ordered to be ready, and obtains possession of the town so
                    completely, that very few of the whole number of the enemy escaped being taken
                    alive, because the narrowness of the bridge and the roads prevented the
                    multitude from escaping. He pillages and burns the town, gives the booty to the

                    orders their arms to be collected, their horses to be brought forth, and
                    hostages to be given. A part of the hostages being now delivered up, when the

                    assistance, raising a shout, they began to take up arms, shut the gates, and
                    line the walls. When the centurions in the town understood from the

He impresses on them
                    "that the war must be prosecuted on a very different system from that which had
                    been previously adopted; but they should by all means aim at this object, that
                    the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> should be prevented from foraging and
                    procuring provisions; that this was easy, because they themselves were well
                    supplied with cavalry, and were likewise assisted by the season of the year;
                    that forage could not be cut; that the enemy must necessarily disperse, and look
                    for it in the houses, that all these might be daily destroyed by the horse.
                    Besides that the interests of private property must be neglected for the sake of
                    the general safety; that the villages and houses ought to be fired, over such an
                    extent of country in every direction from <name>Boia</name>, as the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> appeared capable of scouring in their search for
                    forage. That an abundance of these necessaries could be supplied to them,
                    because they would be assisted by the resources of those in whose territories
                    the war would be waged: that the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> either would
                    not bear the privation, or else would advance to any distance from the camp with
                    considerable danger; and that it made no difference whether they slew them or
                    stripped them of their baggage, since, if it was lost, they could not carry on
                    the war. Besides that, the towns ought to be burned which were not secured
                    against every danger by their fortifications or natural advantages; that there
                    should not be places of retreat for their own countrymen for declining military
                    service, nor be exposed to the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> as inducements
                    to carry off abundance of provisions and plunder. If these sacrifices should
                    appear heavy or galling, that they ought to consider it much more distressing
                    that their wives and children should be dragged off to slavery, and themselves
                    slain; the evils which must necessarily befall the conquered. </p></div>

                <p>This opinion having been approved of by unanimous consent, more than twenty towns

                    they laid before themselves this consolation, that, as the victory was certain,

                    by a river and a marsh, it had only one entrance, and that very narrow."
                    Permission being granted to them at their earnest request,
                        <name>Vercingetorix</name> at first dissuades them from it, but afterward
                    concedes the point, owing to their entreaties and the compassion of the

                    inflicted severe loss upon them; although the evil was remedied by our men, as

                    that they should consider it a disgrace if they abandoned the siege after

                    the forage, had pitched his camp nearer <name key="tgn,7017415" type="place" n="  +Bourges [2.383,47.83] (inhabited place), Cher, Centre, France, Europe ">Avaricum </name>, and that he himself with the cavalry and light-armed
                    infantry, who generally fought among the horse, had gone to lay an ambuscade in
                    that quarter, to which he thought that our troops would come the next day to
                    forage. On learning these facts, he set out from the camp secretly at midnight,
                    and reached the camp of the enemy early in the morning. They having quickly
                    learned the arrival of <name type="pers">Caesar</name> by scouts, hid their cars
                    and baggage in the thickest parts of the woods, and drew up all their forces in
                    a lofty and open space: which circumstance being announced, <name type="pers">Caesar</name> immediately ordered the baggage to be piled, and the arms to
                    be got ready. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="19">
                <p>There was a hill of a gentle ascent from the bottom; a dangerous and impassable
                    marsh, not more than fifty feet broad, begirt it on almost every side. The
                        <name>Gauls</name>, having broken down the bridges, posted themselves on
                    this hill, in confidence of their position, and being drawn up in tribes
                    according to their respective states, held all the fords and passages of that
                    marsh with trusty guards, thus determined that if the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> should attempt to force the marsh, they would overpower them
                    from the higher ground while sticking in it, so that whoever saw the nearness of
                    the position, would imagine that the two armies were prepared to fight on almost
                    equal terms; but whoever should view accurately the disadvantage of position,
                    would discover that they were showing off an empty affectation of courage. <name type="pers">Caesar</name> clearly points out to his soldiers, who were
                    indignant that the enemy could bear the sight of them at the distance of so
                    short a space, and were earnestly demanding the signal for action, "with how
                    great loss and the death of how many gallant men the victory would necessarily
                    be purchased: and when he saw them so determined to decline no danger for his
                    renown, that he ought to be considered guilty of the utmost injustice if he did
                    not hold their life dearer than his personal safety." Having thus consoled his
                    soldiers, he leads them back on the same day to the camp, and determined to
                    prepare the other things which were necessary for the siege of the town.

                <p><name>Vercingetorix</name>, when he had returned to his men, was accused of
                    treason, in that he had moved his camp nearer the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>, in that he had gone away with all the cavalry, in that he
                    had left so great forces without a commander, in that, on his departure, the
                        <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> had come at such a favorable season, and
                    with such dispatch; that all these circumstances could not have happened
                    accidentally or without design; that he preferred holding the sovereignty of
                        <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name> by the grant of <name type="pers">Caesar</name> to acquiring it
                    by their favor. Being accused in such a manner, he made the following reply to
                    these charges:-"That his moving his camp had been caused by want of forage, and
                    had been done even by their advice; that his approaching near the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> had been a measure dictated by the favorable
                    nature of the ground, which would defend him by its natural strength; that the
                    service of the cavalry could not have been requisite in marshy ground, and was
                    useful in that place to which they had gone; that he, on his departure, had
                    given the supreme command to no one intentionally, lest he should be induced by
                    the eagerness of the multitude to hazard an engagement, to which he perceived
                    that all were inclined, owing to their want of energy, because they were unable
                    to endure fatigue any longer. That, if the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> in
                    the mean time came up by chance, they [the <name>Gauls]</name> should feel
                    grateful to fortune; if invited by the information of some one they should feel
                    grateful to him, because they were enabled to see distinctly from the higher
                    ground the smallness of the number of their enemy, and despise the courage of
                    those who, not daring to fight, retreated disgracefully into their camp. That he
                    desired no power from <name type="pers">Caesar</name> by treachery, since he
                    could have it by victory, which was now assured to himself and to all the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>; nay, that he would even give them back the
                    command, if they thought that they conferred honor on him, rather than received
                    safety from him. That you may be assured," said he, "that I speak these words
                    with truth; -listen to these <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> soldiers!" He
                    produces some camp-followers whom he had surprised on a foraging expedition some
                    days before, and had tortured by famine and confinement. They being previously
                    instructed in what answers they should make when examined, say, "That they were
                    legionary soldiers, that, urged by famine and want, they had recently gone forth
                    from the camp, [to see] if they could find any corn or cattle in the fields;
                    that the whole army was distressed by a similar scarcity, nor had any one now
                    sufficient strength, nor could bear the labor of the work; and therefore that
                    the general was determined, if he made no progress in the siege, to draw off his
                    army in three days." "These benefits," says <name>Vercingetorix</name>, "you
                    receive from me, whom you accuse of treason-me, by whose exertions you see so
                    powerful and victorious an army almost destroyed by famine, without shedding one
                    drop of your blood; and I have taken precautions that no state shall admit
                    within its territories this army in its ignominious flight from this place."

                    that they had no doubt of his honor; that the war could not be conducted with
                    greater prudence. They determine that ten thousand men should be picked out of

                <p>To the extraordinary valor of our soldiers, devices of every sort were opposed by
                    the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>; since they are a nation of consummate
                    ingenuity, and most skillful in imitating and making those things which are
                    imparted by any one; for they turned aside the hooks with nooses, and when they
                    had caught hold of them firmly, drew them on by means of engines, and undermined
                    the mound the more skillfully on this account, because there are in their
                    territories extensive iron mines, and consequently every description of mining
                    operations is known and practiced by them. They had furnished, more over, the
                    whole wall on every side with turrets, and had covered them with skins. Besides,
                    in their frequent sallies by day and night, they attempted either to set fire to
                    the mound, or attack our soldiers when engaged in the works; and, moreover, by
                    splicing the upright timbers of their own towers, they equaled the height of
                    ours, as fast as the mound had daily raised them, and countermined our mines,
                    and impeded the working of them by stakes bent and sharpened at the ends, and
                    boiling pitch and stones of very great weight, and prevented them from
                    approaching the walls. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="23">
                <p>But this is usually the form of all the <name>Gallic</name> walls. Straight
                    beams, connected lengthwise and two feet distant from each other at equal
                    intervals, are placed together on the ground; these are mortised on the inside,
                    and covered with plenty of earth. But the intervals which we have mentioned, are
                    closed up in front by large stones. These being thus laid and cemented together,
                    another row is added above, in such a manner, that the same interval may be
                    observed, and that the beams may not touch one another, but equal spaces
                    intervening, each row of beams is kept firmly in its place by a row of stones.
                    In this manner the whole wall is consolidated, until the regular height of the
                    wall be completed. This work, with respect to appearance and variety, is not
                    unsightly, owing to the alternate rows of beams and stones, which preserve their
                    order in right lines; and, besides, it possesses great advantages as regards
                    utility and the defense of cities; for the stone protects it from fire, and the
                    wood from the battering ram, since it [the wood] being mortised in the inside
                    with rows of beams, generally forty feet each in length, can neither be broken

                <p>The siege having been impeded by so many disadvantages, the soldiers, although
                    they were retarded during the whole time by the mud, cold, and constant showers,
                    yet by their incessant labor overcame all these obstacles, and in twenty-five
                    days raised a mound three hundred and thirty feet broad and eighty feet high.
                    When it almost touched the enemy's walls, and <name type="pers">Caesar</name>,
                    according to his usual custom, kept watch at the work, and encouraged the
                    soldiers not to discontinue the work for a moment: a little before the third
                    watch they discovered that the mound was sinking, since the enemy had set it on
                    fire by a mine; and at the same time a shout was raised along the entire wall,
                    and a sally was made from two gates on each side of the turrets. Some at a
                    distance were casting torches and dry wood from the wall on the mound, others
                    were pouring on it pitch, and other materials, by which the flame might be
                    excited, so that a plan could hardly be formed, as to where they should first
                    run to the defense, or to what part aid should be brought. However, as two
                    legions always kept guard before the camp by <name type="pers">Caesar</name>'s
                    orders, and several of them were at stated times at the work, measures were
                    promptly taken, that some should oppose the sallying party, others draw back the
                    towers and make a cut in the rampart; and moreover, that the whole army should
                    hasten from the camp to extinguish the flames. </p></div>

                <p>When the battle was going on in every direction, the rest of the night being now
                    spent, and fresh hopes of victory always arose before the enemy: the more so on
                    this account because they saw the coverings of our towers burnt away, and
                    perceived, that we, being exposed, could not easily go to give assistance, and
                    they themselves were always relieving the weary with fresh men, and considered
                    that all the safety of <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name> rested on this crisis;
                    there happened in my own view a circumstance which, having appeared to be worthy
                    of record, we thought it ought not to be omitted. A certain <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name> before the gate of the town, who was casting into the fire
                    opposite the turret balls of tallow and fire which were passed along to him, was
                    pierced with a dart on the right side and fell dead. One of those next him
                    stepped over him as he lay, and discharged the same office: when the second man
                    was slain in the same manner by a wound from a cross-bow, a third succeeded him,
                    and a fourth succeeded the third: nor was this post left vacant by the besieged,
                    until, the fire of the mound having been extinguished, and the enemy repulsed in
                    every direction, an end was put to the fighting. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="26">
                <p>The <name>Gauls</name> having tried every expedient, as nothing had succeeded,
                    adopted the design of fleeing from the town the next day, by the advice and
                    order of <name>Vercingetorix</name>. They hoped that, by attempting it at the
                    dead of night, they would effect it without any great loss of men, because the
                    camp of <name>Vercingetorix</name> was not far distant from the town, and the
                    extensive marsh which intervened, was likely to retard the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> in the pursuit. And they were now preparing to execute this
                    by night, when the matrons suddenly ran out-into the streets, and weeping cast
                    themselves at the feet of their husbands, and requested of them, with every
                    entreaty, that they should not abandon themselves and their common children to
                    the enemy for punishment, because the weakness of their nature and physical
                    powers prevented them from taking to flight. When they saw that they (as fear
                    does not generally admit of mercy in extreme danger) persisted in their
                    resolution, they began to shout aloud, and give intelligence of their flight to
                    the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>. The <name>Gauls</name> being intimidated
                    by fear of this, lest the passes should be pre-occupied by the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> cavalry, desisted from their design. </p></div>

                <p>The next day <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, the tower being advanced, and the
                    works which he had determined to raise being arranged, a violent storm arising,
                    thought this no bad time for executing his designs, because he observed the
                    guards arranged on the walls a little too negligently, and therefore ordered his
                    own men to engage in their work more remissly, and pointed out what he wished to
                    be done. He drew up his soldiers in a secret position within the vineae, and
                    exhorts them to reap, at least, the harvest of victory proportionate to their
                    exertions. He proposed a reward for those who should first scale the walls, and
                    gave the signal to the soldiers. They suddenly flew out from all quarters and
                    quickly filled the walls. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="28">
                <p>The enemy being alarmed by the suddenness of the attack, were dislodged from the
                    wall and towers, and drew up, in form of a wedge, in the market place and the
                    open streets, with this intention that, if an attack should be made on any side,
                    they should fight with their line drawn up to receive it. When they saw no one
                    descending to the level ground, and the enemy extending themselves along the
                    entire wall in every direction, fearing lest every hope of flight should be cut
                    off, they cast away their arms, and sought, without stopping, the most remote
                    parts of the town. A part was then slain by the infantry when they were crowding
                    upon one another in the narrow passage of the gates; and a part having got
                    without the gates, were cut to pieces by the cavalry: nor was there one who was
                    anxious for the plunder. Thus, being excited by the massacre at <name key="tgn,7008337" type="place" n="  +Orleans [1.9,47.9] (inhabited place), Loiret, Centre, France, Europe ">Genabum </name> and the fatigue of the siege, they spared neither those
                    worn out with years, women, or children. Finally, out of all that number, which
                    amounted to about forty thousand, scarcely eight hundred, who fled from the town
                    when they heard the first alarm, reached <name>Vercingetorix</name> in safety:
                    and he, the night being now far spent, received them in silence after their
                    flight (fearing that any sedition should arise in the camp from their entrance
                    in a body and the compassion of the soldiers), so that, having arranged his
                    friends and the chiefs of the states at a distance on the road, he took
                    precautions that they should be separated and conducted to their fellow
                    countrymen, to whatever part of the camp had been assigned to each state from

                    unacquainted; that whoever expected every event in the war to be favorable,
                    erred; that it never was his opinion that <name key="tgn,7017415" type="place" n="  +Bourges [2.383,47.83] (inhabited place), Cher, Centre, France, Europe ">Avaricum </name> should be defended, of the truth of which statement he had

                    loss was sustained; that, however, he would soon compensate it by superior
                    advantages; for that he would, by his exertions, bring over those states which
                    severed themselves from the rest of the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>, and
                    would create a general unanimity throughout the whole of <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, the union of
                    which not even the whole earth could withstand, and that he had it already
                    almost effected; that in the mean time it was reasonable that he should prevail
                    on them, for the sake of the general safety, to begin to fortify their camp, in
                    order that they might the more easily sustain the sudden attacks of the enemy."

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="30">
                <p>This speech was not disagreeable to the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>,
                    principally, because he himself was not disheartened by receiving so severe a
                    loss, and had not concealed himself, nor shunned the eyes of the people: and he
                    was believed to possess greater foresight and sounder judgment than the rest,
                    because, when the affair was undecided, he had at first been of opinion that
                        <name key="tgn,7017415" type="place" n="  +Bourges [2.383,47.83] (inhabited place), Cher, Centre, France, Europe ">Avaricum </name> should be burnt, and afterward that it should be
                    abandoned. Accordingly, as ill success weakens the authority of other generals,
                    so, on the contrary, his dignity increased daily, although a loss was sustained:
                    at the same time they began to entertain hopes, on his assertion, of uniting the
                    rest of the states to themselves, and on this occasion, for the first time, the
                        <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> began to fortify their camps, and were so
                    alarmed that although they were men unaccustomed to toil, yet they were of
                    opinion that they ought to endure and suffer every thing which should be imposed
                    upon them. </p></div>

                <p>Nor did <name>Vercingetorix</name> use less efforts than he had promised, to gain
                    over the other states, and [in consequence] endeavored to entice their leaders
                    by gifts and promises. For this object he selected fitting emissaries, by whose
                    subtle pleading or private friendship, each of the nobles could be most easily
                    influenced. He takes care that those who fled to him on the storming of <name key="tgn,7017415" type="place" n="  +Bourges [2.383,47.83] (inhabited place), Cher, Centre, France, Europe ">Avaricum </name> should be provided with arms and clothes. At the same time
                    that his diminished forces should be recruited, he levies a fixed quota of
                    soldiers from each state, and defines the number and day before which he should
                    wish them brought to the camp, and orders all the archers, of whom there was a
                    very great number in <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, to be collected and sent
                    to him. By these means, the troops which were lost at <name key="tgn,7017415" type="place" n="  +Bourges [2.383,47.83] (inhabited place), Cher, Centre, France, Europe ">Avaricum </name> are speedily replaced. In the mean time,

                    provisions, refreshed his army after their fatigue and privation. The winter
                    being almost ended, when he was invited by the favorable season of the year to
                    prosecute the war and march against the enemy, [and try] whether he could draw
                    them from the marshes and woods, or else press them by a blockade; some noblemen
                    of the <name>Aedui</name> came to him as embassadors to entreat "that in an
                    extreme emergency he should succor their state; that their affairs were in the
                    utmost danger, because, whereas single magistrates had been usually appointed in
                    ancient times and held the power of king for a single year, two persons now
                    exercised this office, and each asserted that he was appointed according to
                    their laws. That one of them was <name>Convictolitanis</name>, a powerful and
                    illustrious youth; the other <name>Cotus</name>, sprung from a most ancient
                    family, and personally a man of very great influence and extensive connections.
                    His brother <name>Valetiacus</name> had borne the same office during the last
                    year: that the whole state was up in arms; the senate divided, the people
                    divided; that each of them had his own adherents; and that, if the animosity
                    would be fomented any longer, the result would be that one part of the state
                    would come to a collision with the other; that it rested with his activity and
                    influence to prevent it." </p></div>

                <p>Although <name type="pers">Caesar</name> considered it ruinous to leave the war

                    fostered and honored in every respect, should have recourse to violence and

                    summon aid from <name>Vercingetorix</name>, he determined to anticipate this
                    movement; and because, by the laws of the <name>Aedui</name>, it was not
                    permitted those who held the supreme authority to leave the country, he
                    determined to go in person to the <name>Aedui</name>, lest he should appear to

                    When almost all the state had assembled there, and he was informed that one
                    brother had been declared magistrate by the other, when only a few persons were
                    privately summoned for the purpose, at a different time and place from what he
                    ought, whereas the laws not only forbade two belonging to one family to be
                    elected magistrates while each was alive, but even deterred them from being in
                    the senate, he compelled <name>Cotus</name> to resign his office; he ordered

                    broke down all the bridges over the river and began to march on the other bank

                <p>When each army was in sight of the other, and was pitching their camp almost
                    opposite that of the enemy, scouts being distributed in every quarter, lest the
                        <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> should build a bridge and bring over their
                    troops; it was to <name type="pers">Caesar</name> a matter attended with great
                    difficulties, lest he should be hindered from passing the river during the
                    greater part of the summer, as the <name key="tgn,1121116" type="place" n="Allier [3.616,45.83] (river), Haute-Loire, Auvergne, France, Europe">Allier</name> can not generally be forded before the autumn. Therefore,
                    that this might not happen, having pitched his camp in a woody place opposite to
                    one of those bridges which <name>Vercingetorix</name> had taken care should be
                    broken down, the next day he stopped behind with two legions in a secret place;
                    he sent on the rest of the forces as usual, with all the baggage, after having
                    selected some cohorts, that the number of the legions might appear to be
                    complete. Having ordered these to advance as far as they could, when now, from
                    the time of day, he conjectured they had come to an encampment, he began to
                    rebuild the bridge on the same piles, the lower part of which remained entire.
                    Having quickly finished the work and led his legions across, he selected a fit
                    place for a camp, and recalled the rest of his troops.
                        <name>Vercingetorix</name>, on ascertaining this fact, went before him by
                    forced marches, in order that he might not be compelled to come to an action
                    against his will. </p></div>

                    on viewing the situation of the city, which, being built on a very high
                    mountain, was very difficult of access, he despaired of taking it by storm, and
                    determined to take no measures with regard to besieging it before he should
                    secure a supply of provisions. But <name>Vercingetorix</name>, having pitched
                    his camp on the mountain near the town, placed the forces of each state
                    separately and at small intervals around himself, and having occupied all the
                    hills of that range as far as they commanded a view [of the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> encampment], he presented a formidable appearance; he ordered
                    the rulers of the states, whom he had selected as his council of war, to come to
                    him daily at the dawn, whether any measure seemed to require deliberation or
                    execution. Nor did he allow almost any day to pass without testing in a cavalry
                    action, the archers being intermixed, what spirit and valor there was in each of
                    his own men. There was a hill opposite the town, at the very foot of that
                    mountain, strongly fortified and precipitous on every side (which if our men
                    could gain, they seemed likely to exclude the enemy from a great share of their
                    supply of water, and from free foraging; but this place was occupied by them
                    with a weak garrison): however, <name type="pers">Caesar</name> set out from the
                    camp in the silence of night, and dislodging the garrison before succor could
                    come from the town, he got possession of the place and posted two legions there,
                    and drew from the greater camp to the less a double trench twelve feet broad, so
                    that the soldiers could even singly pass secure from any sudden attack of the

                    magistrate and the bribe, when they declared that they would even be leaders in
                    the plot, a plan for accomplishing it was considered, because they were
                    confident their state could not be induced to undertake the war on slight
                    grounds. It was resolved that <name>Litavicus</name> should have the command of

                    are brought forward whom he had instructed in what he would have them say, and
                    make the same statements to the soldiery as <name>Litavicus</name> had made:
                    that all the knights of the <name>Aedui</name> were slain because they were said

                    themselves among the multitude of soldiers, and had escaped from the midst of
                    the slaughter. The <name>Aedui</name> shout aloud and conjure
                        <name>Litavicus</name> to provide for their safety. As if, said he, it were
                    a matter of deliberation, and not of necessity, for us to go to <name key="tgn,6002232" type="place" n="  +Gergovie [3.116,45.716] (deserted settlement), Puy-de-Dome, Auvergne, France, Europe ">Gergovia </name> and unite ourselves to the <name>Arverni</name>. Or have

                    on his protection. He immediately seizes a great quantity of corn and
                    provisions, cruelly tortures them, and then puts them to death, sends messengers
                    throughout the entire state of the <name>Aedui</name>, and rouses them
                    completely by the same falsehood concerning the slaughter of their knights and
                    nobles; he earnestly advises them to avenge, in the same manner as he did, the

                        <name>Viridomarus</name>, of equal age and influence, but of inferior birth,
                    whom <name type="pers">Caesar</name> had raised from a humble position to the

                    in the number of horse, being summoned by <name type="pers">Caesar</name> by
                    name. These had a dispute with each other for precedence, and in the struggle
                    between the magistrates they had contended with their utmost efforts, the one

                    lays the matter before <name type="pers">Caesar</name> almost at midnight; he
                    entreats that <name type="pers">Caesar</name> should not suffer their state to
                    swerve from the alliance with the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people, owing
                    to the depraved counsels of a few young men which he foresaw would be the
                    consequence if so many thousand men should unite themselves to the enemy, as
                    their relations could not neglect their safety, nor the state regard it as a

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="40">
                <p><name type="pers">Caesar</name> felt great anxiety on this intelligence, because
                    he had always especially indulged the state of the <name>Aedui</name>, and,
                    without any hesitation, draws out from the camp four light-armed legions and all
                    the cavalry: nor had he time, at such a crisis, to contract the camp, because
                    the affair seemed to depend upon dispatch. He leaves <name>Caius Fabius</name>,
                    his lieutenant, with two legions to guard the camp. When he ordered the brothers
                    of <name>Litavicus</name> to be arrested, he discovers that they had fled a
                    short time before to the camp of the enemy. He encouraged his soldiers "not to
                    be disheartened by the labor of the journey on such a necessary occasion," and,
                    after advancing twenty-five miles, all being most eager, he came in sight of the
                    army of the <name>Aedui</name>, and, by sending on his cavalry, retards and
                    impedes their march; he then issues strict orders to all his soldiers to kill no
                    one. He commands <name>Eporedirix</name> and <name>Viridomarus</name>, who they
                    thought were killed, to move among the cavalry and address their friends. When
                    they were recognized and the treachery of <name>Litavicus</name> discovered, the
                        <name>Aedui</name> began to extend their hands to intimate submission, and,
                    laying down their arms, to deprecate death. <name>Litavicus</name>, with his
                    clansmen, who after the custom of the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> consider

                    army, while fresh men were frequently relieving the wearied, and exhausting our
                    soldiers by the incessant toil, since on account of the size of the camp, they
                    had constantly to remain on the rampart; that many had been wounded by the
                    immense number of arrows and all kinds of missiles; that the engines were of
                    great service in withstanding them; that <name type="pers">Fabius</name>, at
                    their departure, leaving only two gates open, was blocking up the rest, and was
                    adding breast-works to the ramparts, and was preparing himself for a similar
                    casualty on the following day. <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, after receiving
                    this information, reached the camp before sunrise owing to the very great zeal
                    of his soldiers. </p></div>

                    the truth of those statements. Some are stimulated by avarice, others by revenge
                    and credulity, which is an innate propensity in that race of men to such a
                    degree that they consider a slight rumor as an ascertained fact. They plunder
                    the property of the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> citizens, and either
                    massacre them or drag them away to slavery. <name>Convictolitanis</name>
                    increases the evil state of affairs, and goads on the people to fury, that by
                    the commission of some outrage they may be ashamed to return to propriety. They
                    entice from the town of <name>Cabillonus</name>, by a promise of safety,

                    his legion; they compel those who had settled there for the purpose of trading
                    to do the same. By constantly attacking them on their march they strip them of
                    all their baggage; they besiege day and night those that resisted; when many
                    were slain on both sides, they excite a great number to arms. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="43">
                <p>In the mean time, when intelligence was brought that all their soldiers were in

                        <name>Aristius</name>; they assure him that nothing had been done by public
                    authority; they order an inquiry to be made about the plundered property; they
                    confiscate the property of <name>Litavicus</name> and his brothers; they send
                    embassadors to <name type="pers">Caesar</name> for the purpose of clearing
                    themselves. They do all this with a view to recover their soldiers; but being
                    contaminated by guilt, and charmed by the gains arising from the plundered
                    property, as that act was shared in by many, and being tempted by the fear of
                    punishment, they began to form plans of war and stir up the other states by
                    embassies. Although <name type="pers">Caesar</name> was aware of this
                    proceeding, yet he addresses the embassadors with as much mildness as he can:
                    "That he did not think worse of the state on account of the ignorance and
                    fickleness of the mob, nor would diminish his regard for the
                    <name>Aedui</name>." He himself, fearing a greater commotion in <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, in order to prevent his being surrounded by all the states,
                    began to form plans as to the manner in which he should return from <name key="tgn,6002232" type="place" n="  +Gergovie [3.116,45.716] (deserted settlement), Puy-de-Dome, Auvergne, France, Europe ">Gergovia </name> and again concentrate his forces, lest a departure arising
                    from the fear of a revolt should seem like a flight. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="44">
                <p>While he was considering these things an opportunity of acting successfully
                    seemed to offer. For, when he had come into the smaller camp for the purpose of
                    securing the works, he noticed that the hill in the possession of the enemy was
                    stripped of men, although, on the former days, it could scarcely be seen on
                    account of the numbers on it. Being astonished, he inquires the reason of it
                    from the deserters, a great number of whom flocked to him daily. They all
                    concurred in asserting, what <name type="pers">Caesar</name> himself had already
                    ascertained by his scouts, that the back of that hill was almost level; but
                    likewise woody and narrow, by which there was a pass to the other side of the
                    town; that they had serious apprehensions for this place, and had no other idea,
                    on the occupation of one hill by the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>, than
                    that, if they should lose the other, they would be almost surrounded, and cut
                    off from all egress and foraging; that they were all summoned by
                        <name>Vercingetorix</name> to fortify this place. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="45">
                <p><name type="pers">Caesar</name>, on being informed of this circumstance, sends
                    several troops of horse to the place immediately after midnight; he orders them
                    to range in every quarter with more tumult than usual. At dawn he orders a large
                    quantity of baggage to be drawn out of the camp, and the muleteers with helmets,
                    in the appearance and guise of horsemen, to ride round the hills. To these he
                    adds a few cavalry, with instructions to range more widely to make a show. He
                    orders them all to seek the same quarter by a long circuit; these proceedings
                    were seen at a distance from the town, as <name key="tgn,6002232" type="place" n="  +Gergovie [3.116,45.716] (deserted settlement), Puy-de-Dome, Auvergne, France, Europe ">Gergovia </name> commanded a view of the camp, nor could the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> ascertain at so great a distance, what certainty
                    there was in the maneuver. He sends one legion to the same hill, and after it
                    had marched a little, stations it in the lower ground, and congeals it in the
                    woods. The suspicion of the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> are increased, and
                    all their forces are marched to that place to defend it. <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, having perceived the camp of the enemy deserted, covers the
                    military insignia of his men, conceals the standards, and transfers his soldiers
                    in small bodies from the greater to the less camp, and points out to the
                    lieutenants whom he had placed in command over the respective legions, what he
                    should wish to be done; he particularly advises them to restrain their men from
                    advancing too far, through their desire of fighting, or their hope of plunder,
                    he sets before them what disadvantages the unfavorable nature of the ground
                    carries with it; that they could be assisted by dispatch alone: that success
                    depended on a surprise, and not on a battle. After stating these particulars, he
                    gives the signal for action, and detaches the <name>Aedui</name> at the same
                    time by another ascent on the right. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="46">
                <p>The town wall was <date when-custom="1200">1200</date> paces distant from the plain and
                    foot of the ascent, in a straight line, if no gap intervened; whatever circuit
                    was added to this ascent, to make the hill easy, increased the length of the
                    route. But almost in the middle of the hill, the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> had previously built a wall six feet high, made of large
                    stones, and extending in length as far as the nature of the ground permitted, as
                    a barrier to retard the advance of our men; and leaving all the lower space
                    empty, they had filled the upper part of the hill, as far as the wall of the
                    town, with their camps very close to one another. The soldiers, on the signal
                    being given, quickly advance to this fortification, and passing over it, make
                    themselves masters of the separate camps. And so great was their activity in
                    taking the camps, that <name>Teutomarus</name>, the king of the

                    gone to rest at noon, with difficulty escaped from the hands of the plunderers,
                    with the upper part of his person naked, and his horse wounded. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="47">
                <p><name type="pers">Caesar</name>, having accomplished the object which he had in
                    view, ordered the signal to be sounded for a retreat; and the soldiers of the
                    tenth legion, by which he was then accompanied, halted. But the soldiers of the
                    other legions, not hearing the sound of the trumpet, because there was a very
                    large valley between them, were however kept back by the tribunes of the
                    soldiers and the lieutenants, according to <name type="pers">Caesar</name>'s
                    orders; but being animated by the prospect of speedy victory, and the flight of
                    the enemy, and the favorable battles of former periods, they thought nothing so
                    difficult that their bravery could not accomplish it; nor did they put an end to
                    the pursuit, until they drew nigh to the wall of the town and the gates. But
                    then, when a shout arose in every quarter of the city, those who were at a
                    distance being alarmed by the sudden tumult, fled hastily from the town, since
                    they thought that the enemy were within the gates. The matrons begin to cast
                    their clothes and silver over the wall, and bending over as far as the lower
                    part of the bosom, with outstretched hands beseech the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> to spare them, and not to sacrifice to their resentment even
                    women and children, as they had done at <name key="tgn,7017415" type="place" n="  +Bourges [2.383,47.83] (inhabited place), Cher, Centre, France, Europe ">Avaricum </name>. Some of them let themselves down from the walls by their
                    hands, and surrendered to our soldiers. <name>Lucius Fabius</name> a centurion
                    of the eighth legion, who, it was ascertained, had said that day among his
                    fellow soldiers that he was excited by the plunder of <name key="tgn,7017415" type="place" n="  +Bourges [2.383,47.83] (inhabited place), Cher, Centre, France, Europe ">Avaricum </name>, and would not allow any one to mount the wall before him,
                    finding three men of his own company, and being raised up by them, scaled the
                    wall. He himself, in turn, taking hold of them one by one drew them up to the
                    wall. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="48">
                <p>In the mean time those who had gone to the other part of the town to defend it,
                    as we have mentioned above, at first, aroused by hearing the shouts, and,
                    afterward, by frequent accounts, that the town was in possession of the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>, sent forward their cavalry, and hastened in
                    larger numbers to that quarter. As each first came he stood beneath the wall,
                    and increased the number of his countrymen engaged in action. When a great
                    multitude of them had assembled, the matrons, who a little before were
                    stretching their hands from the walls to the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>,
                    began to beseech their countrymen, and after the <name>Gallic</name> fashion to
                    show their disheveled hair, and bring their children into public view. Neither
                    in position nor in numbers was the contest an equal one to the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>; at the same time, being exhausted by running
                    and the long continuation of the fight, they could not easily withstand fresh

                    men driven from the ground, he should deter the enemy from following too
                    closely. He himself, advancing with the legion a little from that place where he

                    at least provide for your safety, since I, allured by the love of glory, led you
                    into this danger, do you save yourselves when an opportunity is given." At the
                    same time he rushed into the midst of the enemy, and slaying two of them, drove
                    back the rest a little from the gate. When his men attempted to aid him, "In
                    vain," he says, "you endeavor to procure me safety, since blood and strength are
                    now failing me, therefore leave this, while you have the opportunity, and
                    retreat to the legion." Thus he fell fighting a few moments after, and saved his
                    men by his own death. </p></div>

                    issue of actions: and that he required in his soldiers forbearance and

                    from them with the utmost insult; and to what condition and to what greatness he
                    had raised them, [so much so] that they had not only recovered their former

                <p>When he had arrived there, the enemy's scouts, as they were stationed along every
                    part of the river, not expecting an attack, because a great storm had suddenly
                    arisen, were surprised by our soldiers: the infantry and cavalry are quickly
                    transported, under the superintendence of the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name>
                    knights, whom he had appointed to that office. Almost at the same time, a little
                    before daylight, intelligence was given to the enemy that there was an unusual
                    tumult in the camp of the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>, and that a strong
                    force was marching up the river, and that the sound of oars was distinctly heard
                    in the same quarter, and that soldiers were being conveyed across in ships a
                    little below. On hearing these things, because they were of opinion that the
                    legions were passing in three different places, and that the entire army, being
                    terrified by the revolt of the <name>Aedui</name>, were preparing for flight,
                    they divided their forces also into three divisions. For leaving a guard
                    opposite to the camp and sending a small body in the direction of
                        <name>Metiosedum</name>, with orders to advance as far as the ships would
                    proceed, they led the rest of their troops against <name type="pers">Labienus</name>. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="62">
                <p>By day-break all our soldiers were brought across, and the army of the enemy was
                    in sight. <name type="pers">Labienus</name>, having encouraged his soldiers "to
                    retain the memory of their ancient valor, and so many most successful actions,
                    and imagine <name type="pers">Caesar</name> himself, under whose command they
                    had so often routed the enemy, to be present," gives the signal for action. At
                    the first onset the enemy are beaten and put to flight in the right wing, where
                    the seventh legion stood: on the left wing, which position the twelfth legion
                    held, although the first ranks fell transfixed by the javelins of the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>, yet the rest resisted most bravely; nor did any
                    one of them show the slightest intention of flying. <name>Camulogenus</name>,
                    the general of the enemy, was present and encouraged his troops. But when the
                    issue of the victory was still uncertain, and the circumstances which were
                    taking place on the left wing were announced to the tribunes of the seventh
                    legion, they faced about their legion to the enemy's rear and attacked it: not
                    even then did any one retreat, but all were surrounded and slain.
                        <name>Camulogenus</name> met the same fate. But those who were left as a
                    guard opposite the camp of <name type="pers">Labienus</name>, when they heard
                    that the battle was commenced, marched to aid their countrymen and take
                    possession of a hill, but were unable to withstand the attack of the victorious
                    soldiers. In this manner, mixed with their own fugitives, such as the woods and
                    mountains did not shelter were cut to pieces by our cavalry. When this battle
                    was finished, <name type="pers">Labienus</name> returns to
                        <name>Agendicum</name>, where the baggage of the whole army had been left:

                    influence, authority, or money, they strive to excite the state [to revolt].
                    Having got possession of the hostages whom <name type="pers">Caesar</name> had

                    communicate his plans of conducting the war. On obtaining this request they
                    insist that the chief command should be assigned to them; and when the affair
                    became a disputed question, a council of all <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name> is summoned to

                        <name>Aedui</name> are highly indignant at being deprived of the chief
                    command; they lament the change of fortune, and miss <name type="pers">Caesar</name>'s indulgence toward them; however, after engaging in the war,
                    they do not dare to pursue their own measures apart from the rest.

                    for this proceeding; he orders all the cavalry, fifteen thousand in number, to
                    quickly assemble here; he says that he will be content with the infantry which
                    he had before, and would not tempt fortune nor come to a regular engagement; but
                    since he had abundance of cavalry, it would be very easy for him to prevent the
                        <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> from obtaining forage or corn, provided
                    that they themselves should resolutely destroy their corn and set fire to their
                    houses; by which sacrifice of private property they would evidently obtain
                    perpetual dominion and freedom. After arranging these matters, he levies ten
                    thousand infantry on the <name>Aedui</name> and <name>Segusiani</name>, who
                    border on our province: to these he adds eight hundred horse. He sets over them

                <p>The only guards provided against all these contingencies were twenty-two cohorts,

                    On their arrival, as they were mounted on unserviceable horses, he takes horses
                    from the military tribunes and the rest, nay, even from the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> knights and veterans, and distributes them among the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>. </p></div>

                        <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>; that this was sufficient for obtaining immediate freedom; but
                    was of little moment in acquiring peace and tranquillity for the future; for the
                        <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> would return after assembling greater
                    forces and would not put an end to the war. Therefore they should attack them on
                    their march, when encumbered. If the infantry should [be obliged to] relieve
                    their cavalry, and be retarded by doing so, the march could not be accomplished:
                    if, abandoning their baggage they should provide for their safety (a result
                    which, he trusted, was more like to ensue), they would lose both property and
                    character. For as to the enemy's horse, they ought not to entertain a doubt that
                    none of them would dare to advance beyond the main body. In order that they [the
                        <name>Gauls]</name> may do so with greater spirit, he would marshal all
                    their forces before the camp, and intimidate the enemy. The cavalry unanimously
                    shout out, "That they ought to bind themselves by a most sacred oath, that he
                    should not be received under a roof, nor have access to his children, parents,
                    or wife, who shall not twice have ridden through the enemy's army." </p></div>

                <p>This proposal receiving general approbation, and all being forced to take the

                    these divisions made a demonstration on our two flanks; while one in front began
                    to obstruct our march. On this circumstance being announced, <name type="pers">Caesar</name> orders his cavalry also to form three divisions and charge
                    the enemy. Then the action commences simultaneously in every part: the main body
                    halts; the baggage is received within the ranks of the legions. If our men
                    seemed to be distressed, or hard pressed in any quarter, <name type="pers">Caesar</name> usually ordered the troops to advance, and the army to wheel
                    round in that quarter; which conduct retarded the enemy in the pursuit, and
                    encouraged our men by the hope of support. At length the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>, on the right wing, having gained the top of the hill,
                    dislodge the enemy from their position and pursue them even as far as the river

                    several of them. The rest, on observing this action, fearing lest they should be
                    surrounded, betake themselves to flight. A slaughter ensues in every direction,
                    and three of the noblest of the <name>Aedui</name> are taken and brought to

                    they placed their chief reliance, were beaten, he encouraged his men to endure
                    the toil, and began to draw a line of circumvallation round <name key="tgn,7008213" type="place" n="  +Alise-Sainte-Reine [4.5,47.55] (inhabited place), Cote-d'Or, Burgundy, France, Europe ">Alesia </name>. </p></div>

                <p>The town itself was situated on the top of a hill, in a very lofty position, so

                    rivers, on two different sides, washed the foot of the hill. Before the town lay
                    a plain of about three miles in length; on every other side hills at a moderate
                    distance, and of an equal degree of height, surrounded the town. The army of the

                    comprising a part of the hill which looked to the rising sun, and had drawn in

                    fortification, which was commenced by the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>,
                    comprised eleven miles. The camp was pitched in a strong position, and
                    twenty-three redoubts were raised in it, in which sentinels were placed by day,
                    lest any sally should be made suddenly; and by night the same were occupied by

                    increased by the additional support of the legions; the enemy being put to
                    flight, hinder one another by their numbers, and as only the narrower gates were
                    left open, are crowded together in them; then the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> pursue them with vigor even to the fortifications. A great
                    slaughter ensues; some leave their horses, and endeavor to cross the ditch and

                    night, before the fortifications should be completed by the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>. He charges them when departing "that each of them should go
                    to his respective state, and press for the war all who were old enough to bear
                    arms; he states his own merits, and conjures them to consider his safety, and
                    not surrender him who had deserved so well of the general freedom, to the enemy
                    for torture; he points out to them that, if they should be remiss, eighty
                    thousand chosen men would perish with him; that upon making a calculation, he
                    had barely corn for thirty days, but could hold out a little longer by economy."
                    After giving these instructions he silently dismisses the cavalry in the second
                    watch, [on that side] where our works were not completed; he orders all the corn
                    to be brought to himself; he ordains capital punishment to such as should not
                    obey; he distributes among them, man by man, the cattle, great quantities of
                    which had been driven there by the <name>Mandubii</name>; he began to measure
                    out the corn sparingly, and by little and little; he receives into the town all
                    the forces which he had posted in front of it. In this manner he prepares to
                    await the succors from <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, and carry on the war.

                <p><name type="pers">Caesar</name>, on learning these proceedings from the deserters
                    and captives, adopted the following system of fortification; he dug a trench
                    twenty feet deep, with perpendicular sides, in such a manner that the base of
                    this trench should extend so far as the edges were apart at the top. He raised
                    all his other works at a distance of four hundred feet from that ditch; [he did]
                    that with this intention, lest (since he necessarily embraced so extensive an
                    area, and the whole works could not be easily surrounded by a line of soldiers)
                    a large number of the enemy should suddenly, or by night, sally against the
                    fortifications; or lest they should by day cast weapons against our men while
                    occupied with the works. Having left this interval, he drew two trenches fifteen
                    feet broad, and of the same depth; the innermost of them, being in low and level
                    ground, he filled with water conveyed from the river. Behind these he raised a
                    rampart and wall twelve feet high; to this he added a parapet and battlements,
                    with large stakes cut like stags' horns, projecting from the junction of the
                    parapet and battlements, to prevent the enemy from scaling it, and surrounded
                    the entire work with turrets, which were eighty feet distant from one another.
                        </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="73">
                <p>It was necessary, at one and the same time, to procure timber [for the rampart],
                    lay in supplies of corn, and raise also extensive fortifications, and the
                    available troops were in consequence of this reduced in number, since they used
                    to advance to some distance from the camp, and sometimes the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> endeavored to attack our works, and to make a sally from the
                    town by several gates and in great force. <name type="pers">Caesar</name>
                    thought that further additions should be made to these works, in order that the
                    fortifications might be defensible by a small number of soldiers. Having,
                    therefore, cut down the trunks of trees or very thick branches, and having
                    stripped their tops of the bark, and sharpened them into a point, he drew a
                    continued trench every where five feet deep. These stakes being sunk into this
                    trench, and fastened firmly at the bottom, to prevent the possibility of their
                    being torn up, had their branches only projecting from the ground. There were
                    five rows in connection with, and intersecting each other; and whoever entered
                    within them were likely to impale themselves on very sharp stakes. The soldiers
                    called these "cippi." Before these, which were arranged in oblique rows in the
                    form of a quincunx, pits three feet deep were dug, which gradually diminished in
                    depth to the bottom. In these pits tapering stakes, of the thickness of a man's
                    thigh; sharpened at the top and hardened in the fire, were sunk in such a manner
                    as to project from the ground not more than four inches; at the same time for
                    the purpose of giving them strength and stability, they were each filled with
                    trampled clay to the height of one foot from the bottom: the rest of the pit was
                    covered over with osiers and twigs, to conceal the deceit. Eight rows of this
                    kind were dug, and were three feet distant from each other. They called this a
                    lily from its resemblance to that flower. Stakes a foot long, with iron hooks
                    attached to them, were entirely sunk in the ground before these, and were
                    planted in every place at small intervals; these they called spurs. </p></div>

                    considering the nature of the country, and having inclosed an area of fourteen
                    miles, he constructed, against an external enemy, fortifications of the same
                    kind in every respect, and separate from these, so that the guards of the
                    fortifications could not be surrounded even by immense numbers, if such a

                    would support it, the speech of <name>Critognatus</name> ought not to be omitted
                    for its singular and detestable cruelty. He sprung from the noblest family among
                    the <name>Arverni</name>, and possessing great influence, says, "I shall pay no
                    attention to the opinion of those who call a most disgraceful surrender by the
                    name of a capitulation; nor do I think that they ought to be considered as
                    citizens, or summoned to the council. My business is with those who approve of a
                    sally: in whose advice the memory of our ancient prowess seems to dwell in the
                    opinion of you all. To be unable to bear privation for a short time is
                    disgraceful cowardice, not true valor. Those who voluntarily offer themselves to
                    death are more easily found than those who would calmly endure distress. And I
                    would approve of this opinion (for honor is a powerful motive with me), could I
                    foresee no other loss, save that of life; but let us, in adopting our design,
                    look back on all <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, which we have stirred up
                    to our aid. What courage do you think would our relatives and friends have, if
                    eighty thousand men were butchered in one spot, supposing that they should be
                    forced to come to an action almost over our corpses? Do not utterly deprive them
                    of your aid, for they have spurned all thoughts of personal danger on account of
                    your safety; nor by your folly, rashness, and cowardice, crush all <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name> and doom it to an eternal slavery. Do you doubt their fidelity
                    and firmness because they have not come at the appointed day? What then? Do you
                    suppose that the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> are employed every day in the
                    outer fortifications for mere amusement? If you can not be assured by their
                    dispatches, since every avenue is blocked up, take the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> as evidence that there approach is drawing near; since they,
                    intimidated by alarm at this, labor night and day at their works. What,
                    therefore, is my design? To do as our ancestors did in the war against the
                        <name>Cimbri</name> and <name>Teutones</name>, which was by no means equally
                    momentous who, when driven into their towns, and oppressed by similar
                    privations, supported life by the corpses of those who appeared useless for war
                    on account of their age, and did not surrender to the enemy: and even if we had
                    not a precedent for such cruel conduct, still I should consider it most glorious
                    that one should be established, and delivered to posterity. For in what was that
                    war like this? The <name>Cimbri</name>, after laying <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name> waste, and
                    inflicting great calamities, at length departed from our country, and sought
                    other lands; they left us our rights, laws, lands, and liberty. But what other
                    motive or wish have the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>, than, induced by
                    envy, to settle in the lands and states of those whom they have learned by fame
                    to be noble and powerful in war, and impose on them perpetual slavery? For they
                    never have carried on wars on any other terms. But if you know not these things
                    which are going on in distant countries, look to the neighboring <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>, which being reduced to the form of a province, stripped of its
                    rights and laws, and subjected to <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> despotism, is
                    oppressed by perpetual slavery." </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="78">
                <p>When different opinions were expressed, they determined that those who, owing to
                    age or ill health, were unserviceable for war, should depart from the town, and
                    that themselves should try every expedient before they had recourse to the
                    advice of <name>Critognatus</name>: however, that they would rather adopt that
                    design, if circumstances should compel them and their allies should delay, than
                    accept any terms of a surrender or peace. The <name>Mandubii</name>, who had
                    admitted them into the town, are compelled to go forth with their wives and
                    children. When these came to the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name>
                    fortifications, weeping, they begged of the soldiers by every entreaty to
                    receive them as slaves and relieve them with food. But <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, placing guards on the rampart, forbade them to be admitted.

                    place, and post them on the higher ground. The town <name key="tgn,7008213" type="place" n="  +Alise-Sainte-Reine [4.5,47.55] (inhabited place), Cote-d'Or, Burgundy, France, Europe ">Alesia </name> commanded a view of the whole plain. The besieged run
                    together when these auxiliaries were seen; mutual congratulations ensue, and the
                    minds of all are elated with joy. Accordingly, drawing out their troops, they
                    encamp before the town, and cover the nearest trench with hurdles and fill it up
                    with earth, and make ready for a sally and every casualty. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="80">
                <p><name type="pers">Caesar</name>, having stationed his army on both sides of the
                    fortifications, in order that, if occasion should arise, each should hold and
                    know his own post, orders the cavalry to issue forth from the camp and commence
                    action. There was a commanding view from the entire camp, which occupied a ridge
                    of hills; and the minds of all the soldiers anxiously awaited the issue of the
                    battle. The <name>Gauls</name> had scattered archers and light-armed infantry
                    here and there, among their cavalry, to give relief to their retreating troops,
                    and sustain the impetuosity of our cavalry. Several of our soldiers were
                    unexpectedly wounded by these, and left the battle. When the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> were confident that their countrymen were the conquerors in
                    the action, and beheld our men hard pressed by numbers, both those who were
                    hemmed in by the line of circumvallation and those who had come to aid them,
                    supported the spirits of their men by shouts and yells from every quarter. As
                    the action was carried on in sight of all, neither a brave nor cowardly act
                    could be concealed; both the desire of praise and the fear of ignominy, urged on
                    each party to valor. After fighting from noon almost to sunset, without victory
                    inclining in favor of either, the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>, on one
                    side, made a charge against the enemy in a compact body, and drove them back;
                    and, when they were put to flight, the archers were surrounded and cut to
                    pieces. In other parts, likewise, our men pursued to the camp the retreating
                    enemy, and did not give them an opportunity of rallying. But those who had come
                    forth from <name key="tgn,7008213" type="place" n="  +Alise-Sainte-Reine [4.5,47.55] (inhabited place), Cote-d'Or, Burgundy, France, Europe ">Alesia </name> returned into the town dejected and almost despairing of
                    success. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="81">
                <p>The <name>Gauls</name>, after the interval of a day and after making, during that
                    time, an immense number of hurdles, scaling-ladders, and iron hooks, silently
                    went forth from the camp at midnight and approached the fortifications in the
                    plain. Raising a shout suddenly, that by this intimation those who were beseiged
                    in the town might learn their arrival, they began to cast down hurdles and
                    dislodge our men from the rampart by slings, arrows, and stones, and executed
                    the other movements which are requisite in storming. At the same time,
                        <name>Vercingetorix</name>, having heard the shout, gives the signal to his
                    troops by a trumpet, and leads them forth from the town. Our troops, as each
                    man's post had been assigned him some days before, man the fortifications; they
                    intimidate the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> by slings, large stones, stakes
                    which they had placed along the works, and bullets. All view being prevented by
                    the darkness, many wounds are received on both sides; several missiles, are
                    thrown from the engines. But <name>Marcus Antonius</name>, and <name>Caius
                        Trebonius</name>, the lieutenants, to whom the defense of these parts had
                    been allotted, draughted troops from the redoubts which were more remote, and
                    sent them to aid our troops, in whatever direction they understood that they
                    were hard pressed. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="82">
                <p>While the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> were at a distance from the
                    fortification, they did more execution, owing to the immense number of their
                    weapons: after they came nearer, they either unawares empaled themselves on the
                    spurs, or were pierced by the mural darts from the ramparts and towers, and thus
                    perished. After receiving many wounds on all sides, and having forced no part of
                    the works, when day drew nigh, fearing lest they should be surrounded by a sally
                    made from the higher camp on the exposed flank, they retreated to their
                    countrymen. But those within, while they bring forward those things which had
                    been prepared by <name>Vercingetorix</name> for a sally, fill up the nearest
                    trenches; having delayed a long time in executing these movements, they learned
                    the retreat of their countrymen before they drew nigh to the fortifications.
                    Thus they returned to the town without accomplishing their object. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="83">
                <p>The <name>Gauls</name>, having been twice repulsed with great loss, consult what
                    they should do; they avail themselves of the information of those who were well
                    acquainted with the country; from them they ascertain the position and
                    fortification of the upper camp. There was, on the north side, a hill, which our
                    men could not include in their works, on account of the extent of the circuit,
                    and had necessarily made their camp in ground almost disadvantageous, and pretty
                    steep. <name>Caius Antistius Reginus</name>, and <name>Caius Caninius
                        Rebilus</name>, two of the lieutenants, with two legions, were in possession
                    of this camp. The leaders of the enemy, having reconnoitered the country by
                    their scouts, select from the entire army sixty thousand men, belonging to those
                    states, which bear the highest character for courage; they privately arrange
                    among themselves what they wished to be done, and in what manner; they decide
                    that the attack should take place when it should seem to be noon. They appoint
                    over their forces <name>Vergasillaunus</name>, the <name>Arvernian</name>, one
                    of the four generals, and a near relative of <name>Vercingetorix</name>. He,
                    having issued from the camp at the first watch, and having almost completed his
                    march a little before the dawn, hid himself behind the mountain, and ordered his
                    soldiers to refresh themselves after their labor during the night. When noon now
                    seemed to draw nigh, he marched hastily against that camp which we have
                    mentioned before; and, at the same time, the cavalry began to approach the
                    fortifications in the plain, and the rest of the forces to make a demonstration
                    in front of the camp. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="84">
                <p><name>Vercingetorix</name>, having beheld his countrymen from the citadel of
                        <name key="tgn,7008213" type="place" n="  +Alise-Sainte-Reine [4.5,47.55] (inhabited place), Cote-d'Or, Burgundy, France, Europe ">Alesia </name>, issues forth from the town; he brings forth from the camp
                    long hooks, movable pent-houses, mural hooks, and other things, which he had
                    prepared for the purpose of making a sally. They engage on all sides at once and
                    every expedient is adopted. They flocked to whatever part of the works seemed
                    weakest. The army of the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> is distributed along
                    their extensive lines, and with difficulty meets the enemy in every quarter. The
                    shouts which were raised by the combatants in their rear, had a great tendency
                    to intimidate our men, because they perceived that their danger rested on the
                    valor of others: for generally all evils which are distant most powerfully alarm
                    men's minds. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="85">
                <p><name type="pers">Caesar</name>, having selected a commanding situation, sees
                    distinctly whatever is going on in every quarter, and sends assistance to his
                    troops when hard pressed. The idea uppermost in the minds of both parties is,
                    that the present is the time in which they would have the fairest opportunity of
                    making a struggle; the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> despairing of all
                    safety, unless they should succeed in forcing the lines: the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> expecting an end to all their labors if they should gain the
                    day. The principal struggle is at the upper lines, to which as we have said
                        <name>Vergasillaunus</name> was sent. The least elevation of ground, added
                    to a declivity, exercises a momentous influence. Some are casting missiles,
                    others, forming a testudo, advance to the attack; fresh men by turns relieve the
                    wearied. The earth, heaped up by all against the fortifications, gives the means
                    of ascent to the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>, and covers those works which
                    the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> had concealed in the ground. Our men have
                    no longer arms or strength. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="86">
                <p><name type="pers">Caesar</name>, on observing these movements, sends <name type="pers">Labienus</name> with six cohorts to relieve his distressed
                    soldiers: he orders him, if he should be unable to withstand them, to draw off
                    the cohorts and make a sally; but not to do this except through necessity. He
                    himself goes to the rest, and exhorts them not to succumb to the toil; he shows
                    them that the fruits of all former engagements depend on that day and hour. The
                        <name>Gauls</name> within, despairing of forcing the fortifications in the
                    plains on account of the greatness of the works, attempt the places precipitous
                    in ascent: hither they bring the engines which they had prepared; by the immense
                    number of their missiles they dislodge the defenders from the turrets: they fill
                    the ditches with clay and hurdles, then clear the way; they tear down the
                    rampart and breast-work with hooks. </p></div>

                    leads up fresh men to the assistance of his soldiers. After renewing the action,
                    and repulsing the enemy, he marches in the direction in which he had sent <name type="pers">Labienus</name>, drafts four cohorts from the nearest redoubt,
                    and orders part of the cavalry to follow him, and part to make the circuit of
                    the external fortifications and attack the enemy in the rear. <name type="pers">Labienus</name>, when neither the ramparts or ditches could check the onset
                    of the enemy, informs <name type="pers">Caesar</name> by messengers of what he

                    A shout being raised by both sides, it was succeeded by a general shout along
                    the ramparts and whole line of fortifications. Our troops, laying aside their
                    javelins, carry on the engagement with their swords. The cavalry is suddenly
                    seen in the rear of the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>; the other cohorts
                    advance rapidly; the enemy turn their backs; the cavalry intercept them in their
                    flight, and a great slaughter ensues. <name>Sedulius</name> the general and

                    the slaughter and flight of their countrymen, despairing of safety, lead back
                    their troops from the fortifications. A flight of the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> from their camp immediately ensues on hearing of this
                    disaster, and had not the soldiers been wearied by sending frequent
                    reinforcements, and the labor of the entire day, all the enemy's forces could
                    have been destroyed. Immediately after midnight, the cavalry are sent out and
                    overtake the rear, a great number are taken or cut to pieces, the rest by flight
                    escape in different directions to their respective states.
                        <name>Vercingetorix</name>, having convened a council the following day,
                    declares, "That he had undertaken that war, not on account of his own exigences,

                        <name type="pers">Caesar</name>'s writings. For it is agreed on all hands,
                    that no composition was ever executed with so great care, that it is not
                    exceeded in elegance by these Commentaries, which were published for the use of
                    historians, that they might not want memoirs of such achievements; and they
                    stand so high in the esteem of all men, that historians seem rather deprived of,
                    than furnished with material. At which we have more reason to be surprised than
                    other men; for they can only appreciate the elegance and correctness with which
                    he finished them, while we know with what ease and expedition. <name type="pers">Caesar</name> possessed not only an uncommon flow of language and elegance
                    of style, but also a thorough knowledge of the method of conveying his ideas.
                    But I had not even the good fortune to share in the <name>Alexandrian</name> or
                        <name>African</name> war; and though these were partly communicated to me by
                        <name type="pers">Caesar</name> himself, in conversation, yet we listen with
                    a different degree of attention to those things which strike us with admiration
                    by their novelty, and those which we design to attest to posterity. But, in
                    truth, while I urge every apology, that I may not be compared to <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, I incur the charge of vanity, by thinking it
                    possible that I can in the judgment of any one be put in competition with him.
                    Farewell. </p></div>

                    before they had time to fly to their towns. For the usual sign of an enemy's

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">

                    troops of horse all round the country, to take prisoners, from whom he might
                    learn the enemy's plan. The horse, having executed his orders bring him back
                    word, that but few were found in the houses: and that even these had not stayed

                    answer, "that all the <name>Bellovaci</name>, fit for carrying arms, had
                    assembled in one place, and along with them the <name>Ambiani</name>,
                        <name>Aulerci</name>, <name>Caletes</name>, <name>Velocasses</name>, and

                    position, surrounded by a dangerous morass: that they had conveyed all their
                    baggage into the most remote woods: that several noblemen were united in the
                    management of the war; but that the people were most inclined to be governed by
                        <name>Correus</name>, because they knew that he had the strongest aversion
                    to the name of the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> people: that a few days
                    before <name>Comius</name> had left the camp to engage the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> to their aid whose nation bordered on theirs, and whose
                    numbers were countless: that the <name>Bellovaci</name> had come to a
                    resolution, with the consent of all the generals and the earnest desire of the
                    people, if <name type="pers">Caesar</name> should come with only three legions,
                    as was reported, to give him battle, that they might not be obliged to encounter
                    his whole army on a future occasion, when they should be in a more wretched and
                    distressed condition; but if he brought a stronger force, they intended to
                    remain in the position they had chosen, and by ambuscade to prevent the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> from getting forage (which at that season was
                    both scarce and much scattered), corn, and other necessaries. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="8">
                <p>When <name type="pers">Caesar</name> was convinced of the truth of this account
                    from the concurring testimony of several persons, and perceived that the plans
                    which were proposed were full of prudence, and very unlike the rash resolves of
                    a barbarous people, he considered it incumbent on him to use every exertion, in
                    order that the enemy might despise his small force and come to an action. For he
                    had three veteran legions of distinguished valor, the seventh, eighth and ninth.
                    The eleventh consisted of chosen youth of great hopes, who had served eight
                    campaigns, but who, compared with the others, had not yet acquired any great
                    reputation for experience and valor. Calling therefore a council, and laying
                    before it the intelligence which he had received, he encouraged his soldiers. In
                    order if possible to entice the enemy to an engagement by the appearance of only
                    three legions, he ranged his army in the following manner, that the seventh,
                    eighth, and ninth legions should march before all the baggage; that then the
                    eleventh should bring up the rear of the whole train of baggage (which however
                    was but small, as is usual on such expeditions), so that the enemy could not get
                    a sight of a greater number than they themselves were willing to encounter. By
                    this disposition he formed his army almost into a square, and brought them
                    within sight of the enemy sooner than was anticipated. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="9">
                <p>When the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>, whose bold resolutions had been
                    reported to <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, saw the legions advance with a
                    regular motion, drawn up in battle array; either from the danger of an
                    engagement, or our sudden approach, or with the design of watching our
                    movements, they drew up their forces before the camp, and did not quit the
                    rising ground. Though <name type="pers">Caesar</name> wished to bring them to
                    battle, yet being surprised to see so vast a host of the enemy, he encamped
                    opposite to them, with a valley between them, deep rather than extensive. He
                    ordered his camp to be fortified with a rampart twelve feet high, with
                    breastworks built on it proportioned to its height and two trenches, each
                    fifteen feet broad, with perpendicular sides to be sunk: likewise several
                    turrets, three stories high, to be raised, with a communication to each other by
                    galleries laid across and covered over; which should be guarded in front by
                    small parapets of osiers; that the enemy might be repulsed by two rows of
                    soldiers. The one of whom, being more secure from danger by their height might
                    throw their darts with more daring and to a greater distance; the other which
                    was nearer the enemy, being stationed on the rampart, would be protected by
                    their galleries from darts falling on their heads. At the entrance he erected
                    gates and turrets of a considerable height. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="10">
                <p><name type="pers">Caesar</name> had a double design in this fortification; for he
                    both hoped that the strength of his works, and his [apparent] fears would raise
                    confidence in the barbarians; and when there should be occasion to make a
                    distant excursion to get forage or corn, he saw that his camp would be secured
                    by the works with a very small force. In the mean time there were frequent
                    skirmishes across the marsh, a few on both sides sallying out between the two
                    camps. Sometimes, however, our <name>Gallic</name> or <name type="ethnic">German</name> auxiliaries crossed the marsh, and furiously pursued the
                    enemy; or on the other hand the enemy passed it and beat back our men. Moreover
                    there happened in the course of our daily foraging, what must of necessity
                    happen, when corn is to be collected by a few scattered men out of private
                    houses, that our foragers dispersing in an intricate country were surrounded by
                    the enemy; by which, though we suffered but an inconsiderable loss of cattle and
                    servants, yet it raised foolish hopes in the barbarians; but more especially,
                    because <name>Comius</name>, who I said had gone to get aid from the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>, returned with some cavalry, and though the
                        <name type="ethnic">Germans</name> were only 500, yet the barbarians were

                    number, to guard his foraging parties, and to support them in case of any sudden
                    attack of the enemy. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="12">
                <p>As this continued for several days, and their vigilance was relaxed by custom (an
                    effect which is generally produced by time), the <name>Bellovaci</name>, having
                    made themselves acquainted with the daily stations of our horse, lie in ambush
                    with a select body of foot in a place covered with woods; to it they sent their
                    horse the next day, who were first to decoy our men into the ambuscade, and then
                    when they were surrounded, to attack them. It was the lot of the <name type="ethnic">Remi</name> to fall into this snare, to whom that day had been
                    allotted to perform this duty; for, having suddenly got sight of the enemy's
                    cavalry, and despising their weakness, in consequence of their superior numbers,
                    they pursued them too eagerly, and were surrounded on every side by the foot.
                    Being, by this means thrown into disorder they returned with more precipitation
                    than is usual in cavalry actions, with the loss of <name>Vertiscus</name> the
                    governor of their state, and the general of their horse, who, though scarcely
                    able to sit on horseback through years, neither, in accordance with the custom
                    of the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name>, pleaded his age in excuse for not
                    accepting the command, nor would he suffer them to fight without him. The
                    spirits of the barbarians were puffed up, and inflated at the success of this
                    battle, in killing the prince, and general of the <name type="ethnic">Remi</name>; and our men were taught by this loss, to examine the country,
                    and post their guards with more caution, and to be more moderate in pursuing a
                    retreating enemy. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="13">
                <p>In the mean time daily skirmishes take place continually in view of both camps;
                    these were fought at the ford and pass of the morass. In one of these contests
                    the <name type="ethnic">Germans</name>, whom <name type="pers">Caesar</name> had
                    brought over the <name key="tgn,7012611" type="place" n="Rhine [6,51.833] (river), Europe">Rhine </name>, to fight, intermixed
                    with the horse, having resolutely crossed the marsh, and slain the few who made
                    resistance, and boldly pursued the rest, so terrified them, that not only those
                    who were attacked hand to hand, or wounded at a distance, but even those who
                    were stationed at a greater distance to support them, fled disgracefully; and
                    being often beaten from the rising grounds, did not stop till they had retired
                    into their camp, or some, impelled by fear, had fled further. Their danger threw
                    their whole army into such confusion, that it was difficult to judge whether
                    they were more insolent after a slight advantage or more dejected by a trifling
                    calamity. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="14">
                <p>After spending several days in the same camp, the guards of the
                        <name>Bellovaci</name>, learning that <name>Caius Trebonius</name> was
                    advancing nearer with his legions, and fearing a siege like that of <name key="tgn,7008213" type="place" n="  +Alise-Sainte-Reine [4.5,47.55] (inhabited place), Cote-d'Or, Burgundy, France, Europe ">Alesia </name>, send off by night all who were disabled by age or
                    infirmity, or unarmed, and along with them their whole baggage. While they are
                    preparing their disorderly and confused troop for march (for the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> are always attended by a vast multitude of
                    wagons, even when they have very light baggage), being overtaken by day-light,
                    they drew their forces out before their camp, to prevent the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> attempting a pursuit before the line of their baggage had
                    advanced to a considerable distance. But <name type="pers">Caesar</name> did not
                    think it prudent to attack them when standing on their defense, with such a
                    steep hill in their favor, nor keep his legions at such a distance that they
                    could quit their post without danger: but, perceiving that his camp was divided
                    from the enemy's by a deep morass, so difficult to cross that he could not
                    pursue with expedition, and that the hill beyond the morass, which extended
                    almost to the enemy's camp, was separated from it only by a small valley, he
                    laid a bridge over the morass and led his army across, and soon reached the
                    plain on the top of the hill, which was fortified on either side by a steep
                    ascent. Having there drawn up his army in order of battle, he marched to the
                    furthest hill, from which he could, with his engines, shower darts upon the
                    thickest of the enemy. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="15">
                <p>The <name>Gauls</name>, confiding in the natural strength of their position,
                    though they would not decline an engagement if the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> attempted to ascend the hill, yet dared not divide their
                    forces into small parties, lest they should be thrown into disorder by being
                    dispersed, and therefore remained in order of battle. <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, perceiving that they persisted in their resolution, kept
                    twenty cohorts in battle array, and, measuring out ground there for a camp,
                    ordered it to be fortified. Having completed his works, he drew up his legions
                    before the rampart and stationed the cavalry in certain positions, with their
                    horses bridled. When the <name>Bellovaci</name> saw the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> prepared to pursue them, and that they could not wait the
                    whole night, or continue longer in the same place without provisions, they
                    formed the following plan to secure a retreat. They handed to one another the
                    bundles of straw and sticks on which they sat (for it is the custom of the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> to sit when drawn up in order of battle, as has
                    been asserted in former commentaries), of which they had great plenty in their
                    camp, and piled them in the front of their line; and at the close of the day, on
                    a certain signal, set them all on fire at one and the same time. The continued
                    blaze soon screened all their forces from the sight of the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>, which no sooner happened than the barbarians fled with the
                    greatest precipitation. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="16">
                <p>Though <name type="pers">Caesar</name> could not perceive the retreat of the
                    enemy for the intervention of the fire, yet, suspecting that they had adopted
                    that method to favor their escape, he made his legions advance, and sent a party
                    of horse to pursue them; but, apprehensive of an ambuscade, and that the enemy
                    might remain in the same place and endeavor to draw our men into a
                    disadvantageous situation, he advances himself but slowly. The horse, being
                    afraid to venture into the smoke and dense line of flame, and those who were
                    bold enough to attempt it being scarcely able to see their horse's heads, gave
                    the enemy free liberty to retreat, through fear of an ambuscade. Thus by a
                    flight, full at once of cowardice and address, they advanced without any loss
                    about ten miles, and encamped in a very strong position. From which, laying
                    numerous ambuscades, both of horse and foot, they did considerable damage to the
                        <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> foragers. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="17">
                <p>After this had happened several times, <name type="pers">Caesar</name> discovered
                    from a certain prisoner, that <name>Correus</name>, the general of the
                        <name>Bellovaci</name>, had selected six thousand of his bravest foot and a
                    thousand horse, with which he designed to lie in ambush in a place to which he
                    suspected the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name> would send to look for forage,
                    on account of the abundance of corn and grass. Upon receiving information of
                    their design <name type="pers">Caesar</name> drew out more legions than he
                    usually did, and sent forward his cavalry as usual, to protect the foragers.
                    With these he intermixed a guard of light infantry, and himself advanced with
                    the legions as fast as he could. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="18">
                <p>The <name>Gauls</name>, placed in ambush, had chosen for the seat of action a
                    level piece of ground, not more than a mile in extent, inclosed on every side by
                    a thick wood or a very deep river, as by a toil, and this they surrounded. Our
                    men, apprised of the enemy's design, marched in good order to the ground, ready
                    both in heart and hand to give battle, and willing to hazard any engagement when
                    the legions were at their back. On their approach, as <name>Correus</name>
                    supposed that he had got an opportunity of effecting his purpose, he at first
                    shows himself with a small party and attacks the foremost troops. Our men
                    resolutely stood the charge, and did not crowd together in one place, as
                    commonly happens from surprise in engagements between the horse, whose numbers
                    prove injurious to themselves. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="19">
                <p>When by the judicious arrangement of our forces only a few of our men fought by
                    turns, and did not suffer themselves to be surrounded, the rest of the enemy
                    broke out from the woods while <name>Correus</name> was engaged. The battle was
                    maintained in different parts with great vigor, and continued for a long time
                    undecided, till at length a body of foot gradually advanced from the woods in
                    order of battle and forced our horse to give ground: the light infantry, which
                    were sent before the legions to the assistance of the cavalry, soon came up,
                    and, mixing with the horse, fought with great courage. The battle was for some
                    time doubtful, but, as usually happens, our men, who stood the enemy's first
                    charge, became superior from this very circumstance that, though suddenly
                    attacked from an ambuscade, they had sustained no loss. In the mean time the
                    legions were approaching, and several messengers arrived with notice to our men
                    and the enemy that the [<name type="ethnic">Roman</name>] general was near at
                    hand, with his forces in battle array. Upon this intelligence, our men,
                    confiding in the support of the cohorts, fought most resolutely, fearing, lest
                    if they should be slow in their operations they should let the legions
                    participate in the glory of the conquest. The enemy lose courage and attempt to
                    escape by different ways. In vain; for they were themselves entangled in that
                    labyrinth in which they thought to entrap the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>.
                    Being defeated and put to the rout, and having lost the greater part of their
                    men, they fled in consternation whithersoever chance carried them; some sought
                    the woods, others the river, but were vigorously pursued by our men and put to
                    the sword. Yet, in the mean time, <name>Correus</name>, unconquered by calamity,
                    could not be prevailed on to quit the field and take refuge in the woods, or
                    accept our offers of quarter, but, fighting courageously and wounding several,
                    provoked our men, elated with victory, to discharge their weapons against him.

                    news of so great a defeat, would be so depressed that they would abandon their
                    camp, which was not above eight miles distant from the scene of action, though
                    he saw his passage obstructed by the river, yet he marched his army over and

                    were persuaded from his usual clemency and mercy, he never would have inflicted;
                    that the power of the <name>Bellovaci</name> was crushed by the cavalry action;
                    that many thousand of their choicest foot had fallen, that scarce a man had

                    and was aware that the guilt of a crime was easily transferred to the dead; but
                    that no one person could have such influence, as to be able by the feeble

                    country both of inhabitants, cattle, and buildings, so that from the abhorrence
                    of his countrymen, if fortune suffered any to survive, he might be excluded from

                    halt, to assist their horse against ours. The battle was warmly contested. For
                    our men, despising the enemy whom they had conquered the day before, and knowing
                    that the legions were following them, animated both by the disgrace of
                    retreating, and a desire of concluding the battle expeditiously by their own
                    courage, fought most valiantly against the foot: and the enemy, imagining that
                    no more forces would come against them, as they had experienced the day before,
                    thought they had got a favorable opportunity of destroying our whole cavalry.

                    every side, poured round them as they ran, and as long as their horses had

                    leave part of their troops behind, and set out with their light troops to bring
                    in corn. The scheme having met with approbation, the following night Drapes and

                    and others were unable to prevent their taking it) they collected a great store.
                    Sometimes also attacks were made on our little forts by sallies at night. For
                    this reason <name>Caninius</name> deferred drawing his works round the whole
                    town, lest he should be unable to protect them when completed, or by disposing
                    his garrisons in several places, should make them too weak. </p></div>

                    department. Drapes stayed behind in the camp with part of the army to protect
                    it; <name>Luterius</name> conveys the train with provisions into the town.
                    Accordingly, having disposed guards here and there along the road, about the
                    tenth hour of the night, he set out by narrow paths through the woods, to fetch
                    the corn into the town. But their noise being heard by the sentinels of our
                    camp, and the scouts which we had sent out, having brought an account of what
                    was going on, <name>Caninius</name> instantly with the ready-armed cohorts from
                    the nearest turrets made an attack on the convoy at the break of day. They,
                    alarmed at so unexpected an evil, fled by different ways to their guard: which
                    as soon as our men perceived, they fell with great fury on the escort, and did
                    not allow a single man to be taken alive. <name>Luterius</name> escaped thence
                    with a few followers, but did not return to the camp. </p></div>

                <p>After this success, <name>Caninius</name> learned from some prisoners, that a

                    being confirmed by several, supposing that after the defeat of one general, the
                    rest would be terrified, and might be easily conquered, he thought it a most
                    fortunate event that none of the enemy had fled back from the slaughter to the
                    camp, to give Drapes notice of the calamity which had befallen him. And as he
                    could see no danger in making the attempt, he sent forward all his cavalry and
                    the <name type="ethnic">German</name> foot, men of great activity, to the
                    enemy's camp. He divides one legion among the three camps, and takes the other
                    without baggage along with him. When he had advanced near the enemy, he was
                    informed by scouts, which he had sent before him, that the enemy's camp, as is
                    the custom of barbarians, was pitched low, near the banks of a river, and that
                    the higher grounds were unoccupied: but that the <name type="ethnic">German</name> horse had made a sudden attack on them, and had begun the
                    battle. Upon this intelligence, he marched up with his legion, armed and in
                    order of battle. Then, on a signal being suddenly given on every side, our men
                    took possession of the higher grounds. Upon this the <name type="ethnic">German</name> horse observing the <name type="ethnic">Roman</name> colors,
                    fought with great vigor. Immediately all the cohorts attack them on every side;
                    and having either killed or made prisoners of them all, gained great booty. In
                    that battle, Drapes himself was taken prisoner. </p></div>

                    cohorts, that the <name>Belgae</name> might have no opportunity of forming new
                    plans in future. He himself visits the other states, demands a great number of
                    hostages, and by his encouraging language allays the apprehensions of all. When
                    he came to the <name>Carnutes</name>, in whose state he has in a former
                    commentary mentioned that the war first broke out; observing, that from a
                    consciousness of their guilt, they seemed to be in the greatest terror: to
                    relieve the state the sooner from its fear, he demanded that
                        <name>Guturvatus</name>, the promoter of that treason, and the instigator of
                    that rebellion, should be delivered up to punishment. And though the latter did
                    not dare to trust his life even to his own countrymen, yet such diligent search
                    was made by them all, that he was soon brought to our camp. <name type="pers">Caesar</name> was forced to punish him, by the clamors of the soldiers,
                    contrary to his natural humanity, for they alleged that all the dangers and
                    losses incurred in that war, ought to be imputed to <name>Guturvatus</name>.
                    Accordingly, he was whipped to death, and his head cut off. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="39">
                <p>Here <name type="pers">Caesar</name> was informed by numerous letters from
                        <name>Caninius</name> of what had happened to Drapes and
                        <name>Luterius</name>, and in what conduct the town's people persisted: and
                    though he despised the smallness of their numbers, yet he thought their
                    obstinacy deserving a severe punishment, lest <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name> in general
                    should adopt an idea that she did not want strength but perseverance to oppose
                    the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>; and lest the other states, relying on the
                    advantage of situation, should follow their example and assert their liberty;
                    especially as he knew that all the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> understood
                    that his command was to continue but one summer longer, and if they could hold
                    out for that time, that they would have no further danger to apprehend. He
                    therefore left <name>Quintus Calenus</name>, one of his lieutenants, behind him,
                    with two legions, and instructions to follow him by regular marches. He hastened
                    as much as he could with all the cavalry to <name>Caninius</name>. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="40">
                <p>Having arrived at <name type="place">Uxellodunum</name>, contrary to the general
                    expectation, and perceiving that the town was surrounded by the works, and that
                    the enemy had no possible means of retiring from the assault, and being likewise
                    informed by the deserters that the townsmen had abundance of corn, he
                    endeavoured to prevent their getting water. A river divided the valley below,
                    which almost surrounded the steep craggy mountain on which
                        <name>Uxellodunum</name> was built. The nature of the ground prevented his
                    turning the current: for it ran so low down at the foot of the mountain, that no
                    drains could be sunk deep enough to draw it off in any direction. But the
                    descent to it was so difficult, that if we made opposition, the besieged could
                    neither come to the river nor retire up the precipice without hazard of their
                    lives. <name type="pers">Caesar</name> perceiving the difficulty, disposed
                    archers and slingers, and in some places, opposite to the easiest descents,
                    placed engines, and attempted to hinder the townsmen from getting water at the
                    river, which obliged them afterward to go all to one place to procure water.
                        </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="41">
                <p>Close under the walls of the town, a copious spring gushed out on that part,
                    which for the space of nearly three hundred feet, was not surrounded by the
                    river. While every other person wished that the besieged could be debarred from
                    this spring, <name type="pers">Caesar</name> alone saw that it could be
                    effected, though not without great danger. Opposite to it he began to advance
                    the vineae toward the mountain, and to throw up a mound, with great labor and
                    continual skirmishing. For the townsmen ran down from the high ground, and
                    fought without any risk, and wounded several of our men, yet they obstinately
                    pushed on and were not deterred from moving forward the vineae, and from
                    surmounting by their assiduity the difficulties of situation. At the same time
                    they work mines, and move the crates and vineae to the source of the fountain.
                    This was the only work which they could do without danger or suspicion. A mound
                    sixty feet high was raised; on it was erected a turret of ten stories, not with
                    the intention that it should be on a level with the wall (for that could not be
                    effected by any works), but to rise above the top of the spring. When our
                    engines began to play from it upon the paths that led to the fountain, and the
                    townsmen could not go for water without danger, not only the cattle designed for
                    food and the working cattle, but a great number of men also died of thirst.
                        </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="42">
                <p>Alarmed at this calamity, the townsmen fill barrels with tallow, pitch, and dried
                    wood: these they set on fire, and roll down on our works. At the same time, they
                    fight most furiously, to deter the <name type="ethnic">Romans</name>, by the
                    engagement and danger, from extinguishing the flames. Instantly a great blaze
                    arose in the works. For whatever they threw down the precipice, striking against
                    the vineae and agger, communicated the fire to whatever was in the way. Our
                    soldiers on the other hand, though they were engaged in a perilous sort of
                    encounter, and laboring under the disadvantages of position, yet supported all
                    with very great presence of mind. For the action happened in an elevated
                    situation, and in sight of our army; and a great shout was raised on both sides;
                    therefore every man faced the weapons of the enemy and the flames in as
                    conspicuous a manner as he could, that his valor might be the better known and
                    attested. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="43">
                <p><name type="pers">Caesar</name>, observing that several of his men were wounded,
                    ordered the cohorts to ascend the mountain on all sides, and, under pretense of
                    assailing the walls, to raise a shout: at which the besieged being frightened,
                    and not knowing what was going on in other places, call off their armed troops
                    from attacking our works, and dispose them on the walls. Thus our men without
                    hazarding a battle, gained time partly to extinguish the works which had caught
                    fire, and partly to cut off the communication. As the townsmen still continued
                    to make an obstinate resistance, and even, after losing the greatest part of
                    their forces by drought, persevered in their resolution: at last the veins of
                    the spring were cut across by our mines, and turned from their course. By this
                    their constant spring was suddenly dried up, which reduced them to such despair
                    that they imagined that it was not done by the art of man, but the will of the
                    gods; forced, therefore, by necessity, they at length submitted. </p></div>

                    states should attempt to rebel in like manner and in different places, resolved
                    to deter others by inflicting an exemplary punishment on these. Accordingly he
                    cut off the hands of those who had borne arms against him. Their lives he
                    spared, that the punishment of their rebellion might be the more conspicuous.

                    pursuit of the enemy's cavalry; now <name type="pers">Volusenus</name> added to
                    that valor which was pre-eminent in him, a great aversion to
                    <name>Comius</name>, on which account he executed the more willingly the orders
                    which he received. Having, therefore, laid ambuscades, he had several encounters
                    with his cavalry and came off successful. At last, when a violent contest
                    ensued, and <name type="pers">Volusenus</name>, through eagerness to intercept
                        <name>Comius</name>, had obstinately pursued him with a small party; and
                        <name>Comius</name> had, by the rapidity of his flight, drawn <name type="pers">Volusenus</name> to a considerable distance from his troops, he,
                    on a sudden, appealed to the honor of all about him for assistance not to suffer
                    the wound, which he had perfidiously received, to go without vengeance; and,
                    wheeling his horse about, rode unguardedly before the rest up to the commander.
                    All his horse following his example, made a few of our men turn their backs and
                    pursued them. <name>Comius</name>, clapping spurs to his horse, rode up to <name type="pers">Volusenus</name>, and, pointing his lance, pierced him in the
                    thigh with great force. When their commander was wounded, our men no longer
                    hesitated to make resistance, and, facing about, beat back the enemy. When this
                    occurred, several of the enemy, repulsed by the great impetuosity of our men,
                    were wounded, and some were trampled to death in striving to escape, and some
                    were made prisoners. Their general escaped this misfortune by the swiftness of
                    his horse. Our commander, being severely wounded, so much so that he appeared to
                    run the risk of losing his life, was carried back to the camp. But
                        <name>Comius</name>, having either gratified his resentment, or, because he
                    had lost the greatest part of his followers, sent embassadors to
                        <name>Antonius</name>, and assured him that he would give hostages as a
                    security that he would go wherever <name>Antonius</name> should prescribe, and
                    would comply with his orders, and only entreated that this concession should be
                    made to his fears, that he should not be obliged to go into the presence of any
                        <name type="ethnic">Roman</name>. As <name>Antonius</name> judged that his
                    request originated in a just apprehension, he indulged him in it and accepted
                    his hostages. <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, I know, has made a separate
                    commentary of each year's transactions, which I have not thought it necessary

                    was further from his wishes than to be under the necessity of engaging in
                    another war at his departure; lest, when he was drawing his army out of the
                    country, any war should be left unfinished, which the <name type="ethnic">Gauls</name> would cheerfully undertake, when there was no immediate
                    danger. Therefore, by treating the states with respect, making rich presents to
                    the leading men, imposing no new burdens, and making the terms of their
                    subjection lighter, he easily kept <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name> (already exhausted by so
                    many unsuccessful battles) in obedience. </p></div>

                <p>When the winter quarters were broken up he himself, contrary to his usual

                    possible stages, in order to visit the free towns and colonies, that he might
                    recommend to them the petition of <name>Marcus Antonius</name>, his treasurer,
                    for the priesthood. For he exerted his interest both cheerfully in favor of a
                    man strongly attached to him, whom he had sent home before him to attend the
                    election, and zealously to oppose the faction and power of a few men, who, by
                    rejecting <name>Marcus Antonius</name>, wished to undermine <name type="pers">Caesar</name>'s influence when going out of office. Though <name type="pers">Caesar</name> heard on the road, before he reached <name key="tgn,1000080" type="place" n="Italy [12.833,42.833] (nation), Europe">Italy</name> that he was created augur, yet he thought himself in honor
                    bound to visit the free towns and colonies, to return them thanks for rendering
                    such service to <name>Antonius</name> by their presence in such great numbers
                    [at the election], and at the same time to recommend to them himself, and his
                    honor in his suit for the consulate the ensuing year [<date when-custom="-48">48</date> B.C.]. For his adversaries arrogantly boasted that <name>Lucius
                        Lentulus</name> and <name>Caius Marcellus</name> had been appointed consuls,
                    who would strip <name type="pers">Caesar</name> of all honor and dignity: and
                    that the consulate had been injuriously taken from <name>Sergius Galba</name>,
                    though he had been much superior in votes and interest, because he was united to
                        <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, both by friendship, and by serving as
                    lieutenant under him. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="51">
                <p><name type="pers">Caesar</name>, on his arrival, was received by the principal
                    towns and colonies with incredible respect and affection; for this was the first
                    time he came since the war against united <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name>. Nothing was omitted which
                    could be thought of for the ornament of the gates, roads, and every place
                    through which <name type="pers">Caesar</name> was to pass. All the people with
                    their children went out to meet him. Sacrifices were offered up in every
                    quarter. The market places and temples were laid out with entertainments, as if
                    anticipating the joy of a most splendid triumph. So great was the magnificence
                    of the richer and zeal of the poorer ranks of the people. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="52">
                <p>When <name type="pers">Caesar</name> had gone through all the states of
                        <name>Cisalpine Gaul</name>, he returned with the greatest haste to the army
                    at <name key="tgn,7008468" type="place" n="  +Arras [2.766,50.283] (inhabited place), Pas-de-Calais, Nord-Pas-de-Calais, France, Europe ">Nemetocenna </name>; and having ordered all his legions to march from

                        Labienus</name> governor of <name>Cisalpine Gaul</name>, that he might be
                    the more inclined to support him in his suit for the consulate. He himself made
                    such journeys as he thought would conduce to the health of his men by change of
                    air; and though he was frequently told that <name type="pers">Labienus</name>
                    was solicited by his enemies, and was assured that a scheme was in agitation by
                    the contrivance of a few, that the senate should interpose their authority to
                    deprive him of a part of his army; yet he neither gave credit to any story
                    concerning <name type="pers">Labienus</name>, nor could be prevailed upon to do
                    any thing in opposition to the authority of the senate; for he thought that his
                    cause would be easily gained by the free voice of the senators. For <name>Caius
                        Curio</name>, one of the tribunes of the people, having undertaken to defend
                        <name type="pers">Caesar</name>'s cause and dignity, had often proposed to
                    the senate, "that if the dread of <name type="pers">Caesar</name>'s arms
                    rendered any apprehensive, as <name>Pompey</name>'s authority and arms were no
                    less formidable to the forum, both should resign their command, and disband
                    their armies. That then the city would be free, and enjoy its due rights." And
                    he not only proposed this, but of himself called upon the senate to divide on
                    the question. But the consuls and <name>Pompey</name>'s friends interposed to
                    prevent it; and regulating matters as they desired, they broke up the meeting.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="53">
                <p>This testimony of the unanimous voice of the senate was very great, and
                    consistent with their former conduct; for the preceding year, when <name type="pers">Marcellus</name> attacked <name type="pers">Caesar</name>'s
                    dignity, he proposed to the senate, contrary to the law of <name>Pompey</name>
                    and <name type="pers">Crassus</name>, to dispose of <name type="pers">Caesar</name>'s province, before the expiration of his command, and when
                    the votes were called for, and <name type="pers">Marcellus</name>, who
                    endeavored to advance his own dignity, by raising envy against <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, wanted a division, the full senate went over to the opposite
                    side. The spirit of <name type="pers">Caesar</name>'s foes was not broken by
                    this, but it taught them, that they ought to strengthen their interest by
                    enlarging their connections, so as to force the senate to comply with whatever
                    they had resolved on. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="54">
                <p>After this a decree was passed by the senate, that one legion should be sent by
                        <name>Pompey</name>, and another by <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, to the
                        <name>Parthian</name> war. But these two legions were evidently drawn from
                        <name type="pers">Caesar</name> alone. For the first legion which
                        <name>Pompey</name> sent to <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, he gave <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, as if it belonged to himself, though it was
                    levied in <name type="pers">Caesar</name>'s province. <name type="pers">Caesar</name>, however, though no one could doubt the design of his
                    enemies, sent the legion back to <name>Cneius Pompey</name>, and in compliance
                    with the decree of the senate, ordered the fifteenth, belonging to himself, and
                    which was quartered in <name type="place">Cisalpine Gaul</name>, to be delivered
                    up. In its room he sent the thirteenth into <name key="tgn,1000080" type="place" n="Italy [12.833,42.833] (nation), Europe">Italy</name>, to protect the
                    garrisons from which he had drafted the fifteenth. He disposed his army in
                    winter quarters, placed <name>Caius Trebonius</name>, with four legions among
                    the <name>Belgae</name>, and detached <name>Caius Fabius</name>, with four more,
                    to the <name>Aedui</name>; for he thought that <name key="tgn,1000070" type="place" n="France [2,46] (nation), Europe">Gaul</name> would be most
                    secure, if the <name>Belgae</name>, a people of the greatest valor, and the
                        <name>Aedui</name>, who possessed the most powerful influence, were kept in
                    awe by his armies. </p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="55">
                <p>He himself set out for <name key="tgn,1000080" type="place" n="Italy [12.833,42.833] (nation), Europe">Italy</name>; where he was
                    informed on his arrival, that the two legions sent home by him, and which by the
