<div1 type="book" n="praefatio"><head>PREFACE TO THE MOST GLORIOUS KING CEOLWULF,1 BEDE THE SERVANT OF CHRIST AND PRIEST</head><p>
</p><p>The history of things done in the Church of the English 2 nation, which of late I had set forth, I did both first on your desire very gladly send your Grace to have a sight and proof thereof, and now do send it to you again, to the intent you may copy it out and more fully at your leisure consider it: and I cannot but highly commend this your unfeigned zeal, not only to give diligent ear to the words of Holy Scripture, but also exercise a watchful care to know of things done or spoken by worthy men before your time, and specially of our own country. For whether an history shall contain good things concerning good men, the careful hearer is thereby stirred up and provoked to follow after well-doing; or whether it shall report evil things concerning froward men, the devout and well-disposed hearer or reader none the less, by flying that is evil and noisome to his soul, is himself moved thereby more earnestly to follow after the things he knoweth
<pb id="p.5"/>
to be good and acceptable to God. Which very thing you too, most warily pondering, (out of the respect you have to the common good), desire to have the said history more widely published, both to the instruction of yourself and also to the edifying of such other whom the authority of God hath committed unto your governance.
</p><p>And to the intent I may put both you and all other that shall hear or read the said History out of all doubt of the verity in those things I have written, I will be careful briefly to show you what authors I have chiefly followed in the making thereof. The chiefest author and aider I had in compiling this small work was the most reverend abbot Albinus,1 a man instructed in all manner of knowledge; which being brought up in the church of Canterbury under archbishop Theodore,2 of blessed memory, and abbot Hadrian, men of great worship and learning, hath diligently procured and sent unto me all such things as were done by the disciples of the blessed pope Gregory in the province of Canterbury itself, either also in other places adjoining and bordering upon the same: which things the said abbot had learned partly by writings, partly also by tradition of elders; and such of these things as seemed deserving of record he hath sent unto me by the hands of Nothelm,3 a devout priest of the church of London, to be received either in writing, either by mouth and relation of the said Nothelm. Which same Nothelm going after unto Rome was permitted by Gregory 4 the bishop which is now head of the selfsame Church of pope Gregory 5 to search the closets of the said holy Church of Rome, where he found out certain epistles of the blessed pope
<pb id="p.7"/>
</p><p>Gregory 1 as well as of other bishops there, and at his return hath delivered unto us the said epistles to be put into our History with the counsel and advice of the most reverend father Albinus above mentioned. So that from the beginning of this book unto the time that the English nation received the faith of Christ we learned such things as to publish, the same being gathered from divers quarters out of the works chiefly of such as had wrote thereof before our time. And from thence unto this present, such things as hath been done in the church of Canterbury by the disciples of the blessed pope Gregory or their successors, or under what kings they have been done, we have known by the industry of the said abbot Albinus by the hand, as we have said, of Nothelm. Who also have brought me in some part of knowledge of such things as were done in the provinces of the East and West Saxons, and also of the East English and of the Northumbrians; that is, to wit, by what bishop's preaching and under what king each of the said provinces received the grace of the Gospel. And, to be short, by the exhortation of the said Albinus I was chiefly provoked and emboldened to set upon this enterprise. Moreover, Daniel 2 also the most reverend bishop of the West Saxons (which is yet alive), hath instructed me by writing in certain points of the ecclesiastical history of his province, and at the same time of the next adjoining province of the South Saxons and also of the Isle of Wight. Now in what sort either the province of Mercia attained to the faith which they knew not before, or the province of the East Saxons recovered the faith which they had rejected before (both by the ministry of Cedd and Chad,3 devout priests of Christ),
<pb id="p.9"/>
and how the two said fathers both lived and died, we have diligently learned of the brothers of the monastery named Lastingham 1 by the said two erected. Furthermore, the things done in the Church throughout the province of the East English we have learned partly from the writings or traditions of men of former time, partly by the relation of the most reverend abbot Esi. 2 But as for such things as were done in the territory of Lindsey 3 touching the furtherance of the faith of Christ, or what bishops there succeeded from time to time, we have learned either by the writings of the most reverend bishop Cynibert, 4 either by the lively voice of other men of good credit.5 Moreover, the ecclesiastical history of the province of the Northumbrians, throughout the divers divisions thereof, from the time they received the faith of Christ unto this present, I have gotten, not by any one author, but by relation of innumerable faithful witnesses which might know and remember the same, besides all that by my own experience I might know. Among which you shall note that such things as I have wrote of the most holy father and bishop Cuthbert 6 either in this book, either in the treatise that I have made of his life and acts, I have taken partly out of those things which I found before written of him by the brothers of the church of Lindisfarne, following simply the faith of the history which I read; but partly also have been careful to add skilfully thereunto such things as I could learn myself by the sure testimony of men of good credit. And I humbly beseech the reader, that if he shall find anything set down otherwise than truth in this that I have written, he will not impute it unto us,
<pb id="p.11"/>
as the which have endeavoured with all sincerity to put in writing to the instruction of our after comers such things as we have gathered by common report, which is the true law of history.
</p><p>Furthermore, I earnestly pray all men unto whom this same History of our nation shall come, that, whether they read it or hear it, they will not cease to offer up intercessions before the heavenly Mercy for my infirmities both of mind and body; and that all men in their several provinces may render me the recompense of their reward, to the intent that, having diligently endeavoured to set forth concerning those provinces or yet more exalted places, such things as I thought worthy to be recorded and well-pleasing to the inhabitants thereof, I may have of all men the fruit of their pious supplications.</p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="1"><p>
</p><p>Of the situation of Britain and Ireland, and of the people who inhabited these of old time.
</p><p>BRITAIN,1 an island of the Ocean, which of old time was called Albion, doth stand betwixt the north and the west, right over against Germany, Gaul and Spain,2 three of the greatest countries of Europe, albeit divided from them by a far gap. Which island being 800 miles of length northward is but 200 miles broad, except only you reckon the capes or
<pb id="p.13"/>
points of divers mountains which runneth out a long far into the sea, whereby the island is in compass full forty-eight times 75 miles. On the south side it hath Belgic Gaul, to the nearest coast whereof the town called the haven of Rutubus (which is corruptly called Reptacaestir 1 by the English nation) giveth access for men passing over from Britain, by a journey of 50 miles or, as some have written, of 450 furlongs across the sea dividing it from Gessoriacum,2 the nearest coast of the nation of the Morini. On the backside of it, where it lieth open unto the main ocean, it hath the isles called Orkney.
</p><p>It is an island very batful 3 of fruits of the earth and trees, and fit for the rearing of cattle and beasts of burden. In some places also it beareth vines; it hath, moreover, plenty of fowls of divers sorts, both by sea and land; it hath good fame too for rivers full of fish and plentiful springs, and specially both it abound in salmon 4 and eels. And there be many times taken seals, dolphins, as well as whales, beside many kinds of shell-fish; amongst others of mussels in whom be found pearls 5 of all colours, as red, purple, sapphire and green, but specially white: there is also exceeding great store of cockles, whereof is made the dye of crimson, whose fair rudde will be appalled neither ever with heat of the sun neither with wet of weather, but the older it is the more bright and beautiful gloss it casteth. The island hath springs fit to make salt, it hath too others of hot waters where are builded places meet for all ages according to their needs, as well for men as women to bathe themselves severally. For water (as
<pb id="p.15"/>
</p><p>Saint Basil writeth 1), running through certain metals, receiveth thereof such virtue of heat, that it is not only made warm thereby but also scalding hot. This island also is stored with mines of sundry metals, as of copper, iron, lead and silver; it bringeth forth too, great plenty of the jet stone and that of the best, and this stone is glossy black and burneth being put to the fire, and then is of virtue good to chase away serpents. If you rub him till he be warm he holdeth fast such things as are laid unto him, even as amber doth. This island too had in it sometime 28 fair cities,2 besides an innumerable sort of castles which same also were well and strongly fenced with walls, turrets, gates and bulwarks.3
</p><p>And forasmuch as it is placed right in manner under the North Pole of the heavens, it hath light nights in the summer, so that at midnight many times men looking doubteth whether it be yet of the evening past or break of the day following, since the sun at night dwelleth not long beneath the earth but returneth shortly to the east through the northern regions: whereby too the days be of a great length there in summer, as contrary the nights in winter, that is to wit 18 hours, by reason for sure the sun then goeth away to the regions of Libya: and so in like manner the nights in summer are there very short, and the days in the winter, that is to wit six equinoctial 4 hours only: whereas in Armenia, Macedonia, Italy and the other countries subject to the same line,5 the longest day or night passeth not 15, the shortest 9 hours in all.
<pb id="p.17"/>
<note type="margin">THE PICTS</note>
</p><p>This island at this present, with five sundry languages equal to the number of the books in which the Divine Law hath been written, doth study and set forth one and the same knowledge of the highest truth and true majesty, that is, with the language of the English, the Britons, the Scots, the Redshanks and the Latin,1 which last by study of the Scriptures is made common to all the rest.
</p><p>And at the first this island was inhabited of none other nation but only of the Britons, of whom it received his name: which Britons sailing from tin region of Armoriea,2 as it is thought, chose unto themselves the south part of this land. And after, when they moving from the south forward had in their possession the most part of the island, it chanced that certain people of the Redshanks from Seythia,3 as it is said, travelling upon the seas with a few long ships (the wind driving .them in compass about), and passing outside all the coasts of Britain, came aland on Ireland's side, on the north parts thereof, which they finding inhabited of the Seots 4 besought them to allow them also some part of the land,-where they might plant themselves, but they con d not obtain their desire. This Ireland next unto Britain is the greatest island of the ocean sea, and standeth westward of Britain; but as northward it is not so long as it, so southward it extendeth far beyond the boundaries of Britain and reaeheth out to face the north parts of Spain, albeit with wide space of water running betwixt. The Redshanks then (as we have said) arriving as far as Ireland in their navy, required
<pb id="p.19"/>
of the inhabitants that they too might be suffered there to rest and plant themselves. The Scots answered that the island was not big enough to hold them both: <q> but we can give you good counsel</q> (quoth they) <q>what we think best for you to do. We know well there is another island not far from ours, standing eastwards from hence, which we may often see from afar in a fair sunny day. If you will go thither, you are strong enough to inhabit there at will; or if there be any resistance made against you, rely on us to aid you!</q> Whereupon the Redshanks making for Britain began to plant themselves throughout the north parts of the island, for as for the south parts the Britons had taken them up before. And whereas the Redshanks having no wives did require of the Scots to marry their daughters, the Scots agreed to grant them their boon under condition only, that as often as the matter was in doubt, they should choose their king rather of the female than the male line of the royal house; which order it is well known the Redshanks keepeth to this day.1
</p><p>Now in process of years, after the Britons and the Redshanks, the Scottish folk beside the other two were received into Britain in the portion held by the Redshanks; which coming out of Ireland under Reuda their captain, either by friendship or the sword, chose for themselves amongst the Redshanks the country which they inhabit even now:2 and from their captain even unto this day they are called Dalreudings,3 for in their language daal signifieth part.
</p><p>Now Ireland both in extent of its breadth,4 wholesomeness and fineness of air, far passeth Britain, so that there snow remaineth scant three days together: no man there for stress of winter either cutteth hay
<pb id="p.21"/>
in the summer or buildeth stalls for his cattle: there is no noisome creeping beast to be seen there, no serpent that can live there: for many times serpents which hath been brought thither out of Britain, as soon as (the ship drawing near unto the land) they are touched with the smell of the air thereof, they dieth out of hand: yea, more than that, all things in manner that cometh from the said island is of sovereign virtue against poison. And this we saw with our own eyes, that when certain men that were stinged of venomous serpents had taken the scraped leaves of tree-stems 1 which had been of Ireland, and the serapings of the same had been put in water and given to the stinged men for drink, forthwith all the force of the spreading venom was staunched and the swelling of the inflamed body utterly assuaged. This island is rich in milk and honey, nor void of vines, fish or fowl; moreover, too, it is famed for hunting of stags and wild-goats. And this is properly the country of the Scots,2 out of which they issuing added a third nation to the Britons and Redshanks in Britain.
</p><p>And there is a mighty creek of the sea 3 which severed of old times the nation of the Britons from the Redshanks, which from the west runneth far into the land, where unto this day there is a city of the Britons, very strong and well fenced, called Alelyde 4: at the north side of the which creek the Scots, as we said, hath come and made their dwelling country.

<note type="margin">JULIUS CAESAR</note>
</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="2"><p>
</p><p>How that Gaius Julius was the first of the Romans that came into Britain. 55-54 B.C.
</p><p>Now the Romans had never access unto the said land of Britain nor knowledge thereof until Gaius .Julius Caesar came: who the 693rd year from the building of Rome but the 60th before the time of the incarnation of the Lord,1 after filling the office of consul with Lucius Bibulus, at the time that he had battle against the nations of Germany and Gaul (which two countries only the river Rhine doth sever) came in the land of the Morini, whence is a very nigh and short passage into Britain, and with about 80 ships charged with warfare provision, and swift sailers, passed over into Britain; where he being first tried with a very sharp and hot bickering, and after shaken by a contrary tempest, was fain to return into Gaul with the loss of a great part of his navy, and no small number of his soldiers, and of the most part of all his horsemen. And so for that season he was forced to send his men into winter quarters, and gave command for 600 ships of both services 2 to be built: with the which he sailed over again into Britain in the early spring 3: where after he had arrived and was now marching towards his enemy with his main host, his ships riding at the anchor were with a violent storm rent and cast either one upon the other, either upon the quicksands, and there broken in pieces: in such sort that 40 of them were lost out of hand, and the rest with much ado repaired. Caesar's horsemen at the first encounter
<pb id="p.25"/>
were overthrown of the Britons, and Labienus,1 one of his colonels, slain: at the second encounter, with great loss and danger of his army, he routed the Britons and put them to flight: from thence he set out to the river Thames. On the farther side thereof a vast host of the Britons warded the banks under Cassivellaunus their captain, which had sticked the bank of the river and well-nigh all the ford 2 thick of sharpened stakes, of which stakes certain remnants unto this day are to be seen on the same spot, and it is plain to view that each of them (of the bigness of a man's thigh and covered with lead) had been sticked fast in the bottom of the river: which when the Romans had espied and escaped, the barbarians not being able to stand the assault of the legions, hid themselves in the woods; out of which they often breaking out many times greatly endomaged tin Romans. In the meantime the mighty state of the Trinovantes with their captain Androgius 3 yielded unto Caesar, delivering 40 hostages: which example other more cities following fell in league with the Romans. By advertisement of the same cities Caesar having intelligence of a stronghold that Cassivellaunus had budded between two marishes (well fenced beside with the cover of woods and farsed with plenty of all things) assailed it with great force and at length overcame it. After that returning from Britain into Gaul, having dismissed his army for the winter season, he was suddenly beset with great tumults of war raised against him on every side.4

<div2 type="chapter" n="3"><p>
</p><p>How Claudius was the second of the Romans who came to the same land, which did also add the Orkney Isles unto the Roman empire. Moreover, how Vespasian sent by him did subdue the Isle of Wight under the Romans. 43 A.D.
</p><p>Now in the 798th year 1 from the building of Rome. Claudius, the fourth emperor after Augustus, being-much desirous to show himself a prince profitable unto the commonwealth, sought war on all sides and victory whencesoever it might come. And so he made a voyage unto Britain, which was all in a mutiny, it seemed, for that such as were treacherously fled from them were not restored. He passed over into the island, whither, nor before Julius Caesar nor after, any durst adventure, and there without battle or bloodshed within very few days received by submission the greatest part of the island. Also he brought into subjection to the Roman empire the Orkney Isles 2 which lieth in the ocean above Britain, which done he returned to Rome the sixth month after that he departed thence, and caused his son to be surnamed Britannicus. And this war was brought to an end in the fourth year of his empire; which was the 46th year of the incarnation of our Lord: in the which year also there fell a great famine throughout all Syria, which in the Acts of the Apostles 3 is shewed to be fore-spoken by tin mouth of Agabus the prophet.

<note type="margin">KING LUCIUS</note>
</p><p>Vespasian, which after Nero was emperor, being sent of the same Claudius into Britain, subdued also unto the seigniory of the Romans the Isle of Wight, standing nigh Britain southward; which is of length from east to west about 30 miles, from south to north 12, being in the east part by 6 miles, in the west 3 miles off from the south shore of Britain. Nero, however, succeeding Claudius in the empire, never durst meddle at all with warlike matters. Whereby among other many hindrances which befell in his time unto the empire, one was that he had almost lost Britain: for under him two 1 most noble towns were there taken and overthrown.

</p><p>How that Lucius king of the Britons wrote to pope Eleutherus desiring to be christened.
</p><p>The 156th year of the incarnation of our Lord Marcus Antoninus Verus,2 the 14-th emperor after Augustus, governed the empire with his brother Aurelius Commodus 3: in whose time Eleutherus, a holy man, being pope of the Church of Rome, Lucius 4 Icing of the Britains wrote unto him a letter, desiring that by his commandment he might be made Christian: which his pious request shortly was

<note type="margin">SEVERUS' DYKE</note>
granted him, whereby the Britons receiving then the faith kept it sound, and undefiled in rest and peace until Diocletian the emperor's time.

</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="5"><p>
</p><p>How Severus by a dyke drawn overthwart severed that part of Britain which he had recovered from the other. 193-211.
</p><p>The 189th 1 year of the incarnation of our Lord Severus, born in Africa at the town of Leptis in the district of Tripolis, the 17th emperor after Augustus, reigned 17 years. This man being rough of nature, at all times tried with much wars, governed the commonwealth very valiantly but with much travail. After then he had vanquished his civil enemies with which he was very sore assailed, he is drawn into the provinces of Britain by the falling away of nigh all the allies, where, after fighting many great and grievous battles, he thought fit to have a partition made betwixt the part of the island he had recovered and the other wild and savage people, not with building a wall of stone (as some suppose) but with a dyke or rampart.2 For a wall is built with stones, but a rampart, whereby a camp is fenced to ward off the force of enemies, is made with turfs, wherewith, when they are cut about, as it were a wall is raised out of the earth high above the earth, so that in front there be the trench whence the turfs were lifted, and above it be sticked stakes of the stoutest timber. And in such manner Severus caused a
</p><p>Tyne to Hadrian. What Severus did must be regarded as uncertain. There is an earthwork immediately behind the wall of Hadrian, but its origin and object are disputed.
<pb id="p.33"/>
great trench and rampart thick fenced beside with many turrets to be drawn from one sea to the other: and in Britain at the town of York he fell sick and died. He left behind him two sons, Bassianus and Geta, of which Geta being condemned of treason died: Bassianus taking upon him the surname of Antoninus 1 became master of the empire.

</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="6"><p>
</p><p>Of the reign of Diocletian and of the persecution he raised against the Christians.
</p><p>The 286th 2 year of our Lord's incarnation, Diocletian, the 33rd emperor after Augustus, being chosen of the army, reigned 20 years, and he created Maximian, named Herculius, his fellow in government of the empire. In whose time one Carausius, a man of low degree in birth but valiant in arms and politic in counsel, Mas appointed to ward the sea-coast against the Franks and the Saxons, which then with continual robberies much wasted that country, but he so behaved himself that he did more hurt than advantage to the commonwealth; for such pillage as he had wrested from the robbers he did not in any part restore it to the right owners, but reserved to himself alone; whereby he kindled suspicion that by not paying heed to his charge he even suffered the enemy to assail the boundaries at their pleasure. Whereupon being commanded to be put to death of Maximian, he took upon him the princely authority and usurped the governance of the British provinces; which, after he had taken and kept seven years right valiantly, at length by treason of his fellow Allectus
<pb id="p.35"/>
he was slain. Which Allectus after kept the possession of the island, which he had wrested from Carausius, three years; whom Asclepiodotus, commander of the emperor's guard, overcame and received Britain in his possession the tenth year after it was usurped.
</p><p>In the meantime Diocletian in the East, Maximian Herculius in the West, raising the tenth persecution after Nero, commanded the churches to be spoiled, the Christians to be tormented and killed: which persecution was longer and also crueller than well-nigh all which had been before; for by the space of ten years it continued in burning the churches, in outlawry of innocents, in murdering the martyrs and never ceased. Briefly, among other places Britain also was then exalted with the exceeding great glory of the confession of faith offered to God.

<div2 type="chapter" n="7"><p>
</p><p>The passion of Saint Alban and his fellows, which at the same time did shed their blood for the Lord,
</p><p>Inasmuch as 1 in that persecution there suffered Saint Alban 2 of whom Fortunatus, 3 priest, in the book he wrote in the Praise of Virgins, speaking of the blessed martyrs which from all coasts of the world came unto the Lord, saith:
</p><p>The fruit abounding land of Brittany Bringeth forth Alban a Martyr right worthy.
</p><p>This Alban to wit being yet but a pagan, when the cruel commandments of the unbelieving princes were
<pb id="p.37"/>
now fierce against the Christians, received into his house one of the clergy which was flying from the persecutors: whom he perceiving both night and day to continue instant in prayer and watching, being suddenly touched with the grace of God began to follow the example of his faith and virtue, and by little and little instructed by his wholesome exhortations, forsaking his blind idolatry became Christian with his whole heart. And whereas the said person of the clergy tarried with him certain days, it came to the ears of the wicked prince that this holy confessor of Christ (for whom the place of martyrdom had not yet been appointed) lay hid in Alban's house. Whence he commanded his soldiers at once to search for him with all diligence. And when they were come to the cot of the martyr, Saint Alban in the stead of his guest and master, and apparelled in the garment, that is to say, the hooded cloak,1 wherewith the said guest was clad, shortly offered himself to the soldiers and so was brought bound unto the judge.
</p><p>Now it chanced that the judge, the same time Alban was brought unto him, was doing sacrifice unto the devils before the altars. And when he had seen Alban, forthwith being all chafed with anger, for that he feared not voluntarily to offer himself unto the soldiers and come in peril of his life for the guest whom he had harboured, he commanded him to be dragged before the idols of devils before whom he was stood: <q> And for so much,</q> quoth he, <q> as thou hadst rather to conceal the rebel and traitor to our gods than deliver him up unto the soldiers, that he might sustain due punishment for his blasphemous despising of the gods; look, what pains
<pb id="p.39"/>
he should have suffered, the same shalt thou suffer, if thou assay to forsake the rites of our religion.</q> But Saint Alban, which voluntarily had before discovered himself to the persecutors of the faith to be a Christian, in no wise heeded the menaces of the prince; but being thoroughly fenced with the armour of spiritual warfare, told him plainly to his face that he would not obey his commandment. Then said the judge: <q> Of what house or descent art thou?</q> Alban answered: <q>What is that to thee of what stock I am come? But if thou be desirous to know of what religion I am, be it known unto thee that I am now a Christian, and that I employ myself to Christian manners and exercises!</q> The judge saith: <q>I ask thy name, and tell me this without delay!</q> <q>My parents,</q> quoth he, <q> named me Alban, and I honour ever and worship the true and living God which made all things.</q> Then the judge being very wroth said: <q> If thou wilt enjoy the happiness of long life, come off and do sacrifice unto the great gods!</q> Alban answered: <q>These sacrifices which you offer up unto the devils, neither can help them that are subject unto them, nor obtain for their worshippers their desires or prayers. Nay, rather, whosoever shall do sacrifice to these idols shall receive for his reward eternal pains in hell fire.</q> The judge hearing this, being stirred with rage and fury, commanded the holy confessor of God to be all beaten of the tormentors, thinking the constancy of his heart would relent at stripes, which refused to yield to words; but he shewed himself not only patient but rather joyful in the bearing of his sharp torments. But the judge, when he saw he could be neither turned with torments
<pb id="p.41"/>
nor won with words from the worship of Christ's religion, commanded that he should be beheaded.
</p><p>And in the way, as he was led to death, he came to a flood 1 which with a very swift course ran betwixt the town wall and the open place where he should suffer: and he saw there a great company of all sexes, degrees and ages (moved thereto beyond doubt by inspiration of God), following along with the blessed confessor and martyr, and so great numbers had possession of the bridge over the said flood that it would be toward night ere they all could get over. To be short, whereas nigh all had gone forth, the judge was left alone in the town without any to attend upon him. Therefore Saint Alban, in whom there was a fervent longing of mind to haste to his martyrdom, coming to the river-side and lifting up his eyes unto heaven, saw forthwith the bottom to have been dried up and the water to have given place to make a path for his steps. Which when among other the executioner who was to behead him did also himself see, he made haste to meet the martyr, when he had come to the place appointed for his death: and there (doubtless not without the holy inspiration of God) he fell down flat before his feet, and casting from him the sword which he had held in his hand ready drawn, earnestly desired that he should himself rather be found worthy to be executed, either with the martyr or for the martyr upon whom he was ordered to do execution. When therefore it fell that this man was made a fellow of the truth and faith whereof before he was persecutor, and the executioners were right staggered over the sword lying on the ground before them, the most reverend confessor of God climbed a hill with
<pb id="p.43"/>
the people there assembled: which hill, fitly gay and comely with excellent beauty, was about half a mile from the appointed place, and was garnished, indeed clothed everywhere, with divers flowering herbs; whereon was no sudden rise, nothing steep, nothing sheer, but the sides lengthways and breadthways were drawn by nature into the fashion of a smooth slope, plainly rendering it worthy and meet from of old (for its delectable natural grace) to be sanctified with the blood of the blessed martyr. Unto the top whereof when he was ascended, Saint Alban required of God to give him water, and straightway there arose a spring of fair flowing water narrowed in his channel, whereby all might perceive that the river too before had done obedience to the martyr: for it might not have been that he which had left no water in the stream would have required it on the high top of the mountain, but that he saw that it was expedient. For behold the stream, his service accomplished, his offering fully made, leaving behind the testimony of his obedience returned to his nature again.1
</p><p>In this place accordingly the most valiant martyr, being beheaded, received the crown of life which God hath promised to them that love him. But he which set unholy hands upon godly necks was not suffered to have joy over the dead: for his eyes fell unto the ground along with the head of the blessed martyr. There also was beheaded at that time the soldier, which, suddenly touched before with the sign from on high, refused to strike the holy confessor of God: of whom it is open and plain that though he was not christened in the font of baptism, yet he was cleansed in the laver of his blood and so
<pb id="p.45"/>
made worthy to enter into the heavenly kingdom. Then the judge, amazed by the sight of such wondrous strange and heavenly miracles, gave shortly commandment that the persecution should cease, beginning to give due honour to the slaughter of the saints, by the which he thought at first they could be stayed from the devotion of the Christian faith. Now the blessed Alban suffered the 22nd day of June, nigh unto the city of Verulamium 1 (which is now of the English called Verlamacaestir or Vaeclingacaestir), where, after, when the settled calm of Christian times returned, there was a church builded of a marvellous rich work and worthy of such a martyrdom. In the which place truly even unto this day are sick persons cured, and the doing of manifold mighty works ceaseth not to be openly wrought.
</p><p>There suffered about that time Aaron and Julius, i own-dwellers of the City of Legions,2 and many others, both men and women, in sundry places, which, after divers fell and cruel torments and their bodies torn by unheard of rending of their limbs, yielded their souls to the joys of the heavenly city when their warfare was accomplished.

In which time one Maximus passed over into Gaul, a valiant man and a good, and worthy of the dignity of Augustus, had it not been that contrary to his oath and allegiance he had risen by usurpation, half in manner against his will being created emperor by the army in Britain.

Valentinian fleeing for succour into the East, and there with all fatherly piety being received of Theodosius, was also shortly restored unto the empire; while Maximus the tyrant, being shut up by siege within the walls of Aquileia, was there taken and slain by them.

</p><p>How that Honorius being emperor, Gratian and Constantine were made tyrants in Britain, where the first shortly after was slam and the other in Gaul.
</p><p>THE 407th 1 year of the Lord's incarnation, Honorius Augustus, younger son of Theodosius, being emperor in the 44th place after Augustus, two years before that Rome was invaded by Alaric king of the Goths (when the nations of the Alani, the Suevi and the Vandals, and many such other with them, having beaten down the Franks, passed the Rhine and raged throughout all the provinces of Gaul), about that time Gratian a burgher is created tyrant in the Britains and is slain. In his place Constantine, being but a common soldier, was chosen, only for the sake of the hope given by his name without any desert of merit: which, so soon as he had usurped the empire, passed over into the Gauls; where being oft deluded by the barbarous nations, as uncertainly making his league with them, very greatly endomaged the commonwealth: whereupon, Honorius sending count Constantius into Gaul with an army, Constantine was besieged at Aries and there taken and slain: and Constans his son, whom of a monk he had made Caesar, was slain at Vienne by Gerontius,2 his own officer.
</p><p>Rome was broken of the Goths the 1164th year after it was builded, after which time the Romans left to rule in Britain, being almost 470 years since Gaius Julius Caesar first entered the said island. Now they dwelt within the dyke which (as we have
<pb id="p.55"/>
<note type="margin">SCOTS AND PICTS</note>
said) Severus drew overthwart the island, at the south part, which thing may appear by the cities, towers,1 bridges and paved streets made in the same: notwithstanding they had in possession and under their dominion the farther parts of Britain and also the islands which are above Britain.

</p><p>How the Britons being spoiled of the Scots and Redshanks sought aid of the Romans, which at the second time of their coming builded a wall across the island; but when this was shortly after broken by the aforesaid enemies they were oppressed with greater miseries than ever they were in before.
</p><p>HENCEFORTH Britain in the part held of the Britons, being robbed of all men at arms, the whole of their provision for war, and the full flower of their lusty youth (which led away by the rashness of the tyrants never returned home again), lay only for a prey to the spoiler, forasmuch as the people was altogether ignorant of the handling of weapons of war: in short upon a sudden for many years together they groaned helplessly under the oppression of two most cruel and outlandish nations, the Scots from the west and the Redshanks from the north. Now I call these nations outlandish,2 not that they were out of the circuit of Britain, but that they were divided from the part held by the Britons by two arms of the sea 3 running betwixt them, of the which one from the east sea, the other from the west runneth in far and wide into the lands of Britain, though they may not reach to the other. In the middle of the east
<pb id="p.57"/>
<note type="margin">ROMAN HELP</note>
creek there is a city builded called Giudi 1; above the west creek, that is to say, toward the right hand, standeth a city called Alclyde, 2 which in their language is as much as to say as the rock Clyde; for it standeth by a flood of that name.
</p><p>The Britons then being thus afflicted by the said nations sent their ambassadors with letters unto Rome with lamentable supplications, 3 requiring of them aid and succour, promising them their continual fealty, so that the enemy which threatened them were kept to a farther distance. Whereupon shortly there was sent unto them a legion of armed soldiers, which coming to the island and encountering with the enemies overthrew a great number of them, and drave the rest out of the frontiers of their allies: and so, setting them meanwhile at liberty and free from the misery with which they were before so grievously overcharged, counselled them to build a wall athwart the island between the two seas, which might be of force to keep out their enemies: and that done they returned home with great triumph. But the islanders, building the wall which they were bid to make, not of stone, as they were willed, but of turf, as having none among them that had skill for so great an undertaking, raised it to be of use for no purpose. And this wall they made between the two great arms or creeks of the sea (whereof we have already spoken), many miles long: in such sort that, whereas the fence of the water lacked, there by the help of the dyke they might keep their boundaries free from the breaking in of their enemies: of which piece of work, that is, of the very broad and high dyke, there remaineth even unto this clay most assured tokens to be seen on the
<pb id="p.59"/>
same spot it was made. Now it beginneth about two miles off from the monastery of Aebbercurnig,1 to the west, in a place which in the Piet's language is called Peanfahel, but in the English tongue called Penneltun; and running out westward is ended by the city of Alclyde.
</p><p>But the former enemies when they had once perceived that the Roman soldiers were gone, forthwith being set on land by boats invadeth the borders and maketh havoc of all things, and as it were corn ready to be cut, they moweth, trampleth and passeth over all before them: whereupon ambassadors be sent again to Rome, with lamentable voice requiring their suecour, beseeching them they would not suffer their miserable country to be utterly destroyed, lest the name of Roman province, which through them had so long flourished, should now thus despite-fully be extinguished by the wicked cruelty of their foreign people. Again there is sent a legion, which in the autumn-time 2 coming upon the sudden made a great slaughter of the enemies, and them that could escape, they chased over the seas, which before were wont to gather booty yearly to take over the seas without resistance.
</p><p>Then the Romans told the Britons plain that it was not for their ease to take any more such travailous journeys for their defence: and bid them rather to snatch up their weapons themselves, and undertake to learn to withstand their enemy, whom nothing else did make stronger than they but their own faint and cowardous hearts. Moreover also, for so much they thought that would be some help and strength unto their allies whom they were now forced to forsake, they builded up a wall of hard stone 3 from
<pb id="p.61"/>
sea to sea with a straight course between the two cities which were made for fear of the enemy, in the same place where Severus before had east the trench: which wall indeed (which even to this day remaineth famous and to be seen) they did build with public and private charges, the Britons also putting to their helping hands. It was eight foot broad and twelve high, right as it were by a line from east to west, as it doth to this day plainly appear: which being soon made they gave the fearful people straight warning, they furnish patterns for fashioning weapons. Moreover, too, by the seaside southward where their ships lay at anchor, because on that side also there was fear of the invasion of the barbarians, they maketh up towers to have view of the sea, one somewhat distant from the other, and this done biddeth their allies farewell as minded no more to return. And when these were on the way back to their home, the Scots and Redshanks, having intelligence that they had made promise, they would come no more, returneth forthwith again to their wonted business, and heartened yet more than they were wont, taketh for their own all the north and end part of the island right as far as the wall. To meet this assault the fearful array of the Britons is set on the height of the fortress where with faint hand and trembling heart they wasted away day and night. But over against them the grappling weapons of the enemy cease not to be plied: the cowardous defenders were miserably pulled from the walls and dashed against the ground. Why say more? Leaving the cities and the wall they fly, and they are scattered. The enemy followeth upon them, hasteth to slay more cruelly than ever he did before. For even as
<pb id="p.63"/>
the lambs of the wild beasts, so were the wretched citizens mangled of their enemies: whereupon being driven out of their own homes and possessions they falleth a robbing and spoiling one the other of them, to stay the peril of hunger that threatened them, thus increasing the mischief of the foreign enemy with their civil commotions, until all the country was brought to that exigent, that they had none other sustenance of victual but that relief they got by hunting of wild beasts.

</p><p>How in the reign of Theodosius the younger the Britons sought help of Aetius then consul, but could not obtain it: and how hi his time Palladius was sent to the Scots which believed in Christ.
</p><p>The 423rd year of the incarnation of our Lord, Theodosius the younger, succeeding Honorius, came to the throne, which he held 26 years, being the 45th emperor after Augustus; in the eighth year of whose empire Palladius 1 was sent of Celestine, bishop of the Roman Church, to the Scots 2 which believed in Christ, to be their first bishop. And the 23rd year of his reign, Aetius, a man of the degree of illustrious 3 (as the which was also a patrician), for the third time held the consulship with Symmachus. The wretched leaving of the Britons directed unto him a letter whereof this was the beginning: <q> to Aetius, thrice consul, the groan of the Britons</q>: and in the process of this epistle they thus setteth forth
<pb id="p.65"/>
their pitiful estate: <q> the barbarous enemy driveth us upon the sea, the sea again upon the enemy; between these twain riseth two manner of deaths, either we are killed or drowned.</q> And yet for all their suit they could obtain no aid of him, as he which had then both his hands full of grievous wars with Blaedla and Attila, kings of the Huns. And though, the year before, Blaedla was murdered by the wily treason of his brother Attila, yet he alone remained so intolerable an enemy unto the commonwealth, that he wasted almost all Europe, assaulting and destroying both cities and castles. Moreover, too, about the same time a famine attacked Constantinople, and without pause followed the pestilence; further, too, a great part of the walls of the said city fell to the ground with 57 towers 1; many cities too being overthrown with earthquake, hunger and the pestilential stench of the air destroyed yet more thousands of men and beasts.

</p><p>How the Britons being forced by a notable famine drove the barbarous people out of their boundaries; and without delay there ensued plenty of corn, riot, pestilence and destruction of the people.
</p><p>In the mean season their aforesaid hunger more and more prevailing against the Britons (insomuch that many years after it left to later men remembrance of the hurt it did) drove many of them to yield themselves beaten into the hands of the robbers which assaulted them; but others would never so do, but, rather trusting in God where man's help failed them, from the caves in the mountains and
<pb id="p.67"/>
brakes where they lurked, ceased not to make resistance; and by such means then first of all they began to make overthrow of the enemy which many years together had been plundering in the land. Therefore the shameless Irish robbers drew homeward, intending not long after to return; the Redshanks at that time and long time after kept themselves quiet in the farthest part of the island, save only that notwithstanding they ceased not now and then to come forth and plunder and afflict the nation of the Britons.
</p><p>Now when the pilling of the enemy ceased, there came to be such plentiful store of grain as never was seen the like before in the island, as far as man could remember: whereof the people grew to loose and wanton living, and straight after there hasted to ensue this a plague of all manner of lewdness, specially cruelty, hate of truth and love of lying, insomuch that, if any were gentler and seemed somewhat more given to truth than other, against him all men would hurl the darts of their hate without regard, as one that sought to overthrow Britain. And this did not only the lay folk, but also the very flock of the Lord and the shepherds thereof; casting from them the light yoke of Christ and submitting their necks to drunkenness, high-mindedness, variance, strife, envy and all other such wickedness. In the mean season of a sudden a bitter plague seized upon the men of debased mind, consuming in short time such a multitude of people that the quick were not sufficient even to bury the dead: but not even their friends' death, neither the fear of their own, could call the remnant back from the murrain of their soul, which brought
<pb id="p.69"/>
them low through their sinful living: whereby, not long after, a greater stroke of vengeance for their abominable iniquity ensued upon the sinful nation. For they devised with themselves what was best to do, and where they might seek rescue to escape or beat off the cruel and continual assaults of the northern nations; and they agreed all with their king Vurtigern 1 to call to their aid the nation of the Saxons beyond the seas: which thing doubtless was done by God's appointment, that the wicked people might be thereby plagued, as by the end it hath right manifestly been shewn.

</p><p>How the nation of the English being sent for into Britain did at first cast out the enemy to a farther distance, but shortly after joining themselves in league with them turned their weapons upon their allies.
</p><p>The 449th year of the incarnation of our Lord, Marcian having with Valentinian obtained the kingdom, the 46th in succession from Augustus, held it seven years. In whose time the nation of the English or Saxons,2 being sent for of the said king into Britain, landed there in three long ships, and by the same king's commandment is appointed to abide in the east part of the island, as to defend the country like friends, but indeed, as it proved afterward, as minded to conquer it as enemies. Encountering therefore with the enemy who had come to battle from the north, the Saxons had the better. Whereof they sending word home, as also
</p><p>Roman times as the Saxon Shore, and there may well have been Saxon settlements in Britain before 450.
<pb id="p.71"/>
of the batfulness of the island and the cowardice of the Britons, the Saxons forthwith sent thither a larger navy with a stronger band of men-at-arms, which being now joined with the former company, drew to a stronger army than the Britons were able to overcome. They then who came were allowed by the Britons a place to dwell among them, with that condition that the one should war for the peace and safety of the country against the enemy, the other should pay them due wages for their warfare. Now the strangers had come from three of the more mighty nations in Germany, that is, the Saxons, the Angles and the Jutes. Of the Jutes came the people of Kent and the settlers in Wight, that is the folk that hold the Isle of Wight, and they which in the province of the West Saxons are called unto this day the nation of the Jutes, right over against the Isle of Wight. Of the Saxons, that is, of that region which now is called of the Old Saxons,1 descended the East Saxons, the South Saxons and the West Saxons. Further, of the Angles, that is, of that country which is called Angeln 2 and from that time to this is said to stand deserted between the provinces of the Jutes and the Saxons, descendeth the East Angles, the Uplandish Angles, the Mercians and all the progeny of the Northumbrians, that is, of that people that inhabiteth the north side of the flood Humber, and the other nations of the Angles. The first captains of the strangers are said to have been two brothers, Hengist and Horsa; of the which, Horsa being after slain in battle of the Britons was buried in the east parts of Kent, where his tomb bearing his name is yet to shew. And they were sons of Wictgils, whose father was Witta, whose
<pb id="p.73"/>
father was Wecta, whose father was Woden, of whose issue the royal house of many provinces had their original. Now then great companies of the said nations flocking emulously into the island, the stranger folk began to wax so great that the natives of the country who had called them in stood themselves also in great fear of their puissance. Then suddenly taking league for a season with the Redshanks, whom they had by now driven farther off by fighting, the strangers began to turn their force upon their allies. And the first thing they did require of them to furnish more plenty of victuals, and picking matter of falling out with them threateneth them that, except more abundant store of provision be given them, they would break off with them and spoil all parts of the island. And they were in no manner more backward in carrying out their threats in deed than in making them: insomuch as, to be short, the fire once kindled in the hands of the pagans took God's just revenge of the wickedness of the people, not much unlike unto that fire which sometime kindled of the Chaldees, consumed the walls, nay rather all the buildings of Jerusalem. For so also this fire (the wicked conqueror handling it, or rather the righteous Judge disposing it), raging first upon all the cities and country next unto it, after (from the east sea unto the west, without any resistance made to quench it), carried on the destruction and overwhelmed almost the whole face of the perishing island. Both public and private houses fell to the ground, the priests far and wide were slain standing at the altar, the bishops with their Hock were cut off by sword as well as by fire without respect of their dignity, nor was there any that
<pb id="p.75"/>
would give burial to them that had been cruelly slain. And so some of the miserable leavings being taken in the hills were there killed in heaps: other being starved with hunger were fain to come forth and submit themselves to the enemy, as minded to buy the sustenance of victual with sale of their liberties for ever, if yet they were not killed out of hand: other in sorrow made for lands oversea: other tarrying still in their country in fear of death passed their life in want in the mountains, woods and high cliffs with minds ever in apprehension of evil.

They had then for their captain Ambrosius Aurelianus, a gentle-natured man, which only of the Roman people chanced then to remain alive from the aforenamed calamity, his parents being slain in the same, which bore the name and token of kings.

</p><p>How Germanus the bishop, sailing with Lupus into Britain, ceased both first the tempest of the sea and, after, the tempest of the Pelagians by the power of God.
</p><p>A FEW years 2 in deed before the coming of the strangers, the Pelagian heresy being brought in by Agricola, the son of Severian, a Pelagian bishop, had stained the faith of the provinces of Britain with that vile pestilence. But the Britons, being nowise willing either to receive their lewd doctrine by blaspheming the grace of Christ, neither able by controversy to refute their wily and wicked persuasions, they devised this wholesome counsel, to seek for aid of the bishops of Gaul in their spiritual warfare. And so these calling a great council consulted together among themselves, whom of them to send to Britain to help the faith: and by the assent of them all there were chosen two apostolic priests, Germanus bishop of Auxerre and Lupus bishop of the town of Troyes, which should pass over into Britain to confirm the faith of heavenly grace. Which, with ready obedience accepting the commands in answer to the prayers of the holy Church, set sail on the ocean, and until they were half-way over the passage from the shore of Gaul to Britain
<pb id="p.79"/>
the ship speeded safe before prosperous winds. Then suddenly, as they were sailing, the might of evil spirits cometh to withstand them, much envying that men of such worth and power should go to recover the salvation of the people: they raiseth tempests, they take away the day from heaven with a night of clouds; the sails are not able to bear the boisterous fury of the winds; the mariners in despair gave over their office; the ship was guided by prayer rather than by power of men; and their captain and bishop Germanus himself, his strength being spent, had chanced to fall asleep through weariness. Thereupon, as though none was left to withstand it, the might of the storm grew greater, and the ship was now like to sink beneath the waves that poured over it. Then blessed Lupus and the other in their trouble wakeneth and calleth upon their elder that he might withstand the fury of the elements; who, made more resolute by the fearfulness of the tempest, calleth upon Christ and, taking in the name of the Holy Trinity a few sprinkles of water, he breaketh the raging of the waves, cheereth his fellow, encourageth all, and prayer is poured forth with one mouth and voice: God deferreth not His help, their foes are chased away, a clear calm ensueth, the winds which were against them returneth to forward their voyage, and running over the face of the sea they shortly after are peacefully set aland in the coast where they desired. There a great multitude coming together from sundry parts received the bishops, of whose coming too the enemies which resisted them gave warning before they landed. For the evil spirits proclaimed their fear, which afterward, when they were expelled.
<pb id="p.81"/>
by commandment of the bishops, out of the bodies of them that were possessed, declared both the ordering of the tempest which they had raised, and the danger which they had brought the bishops, and did not deny that they were overcome by their merits and commandment.
</p><p>Meanwhile the apostolic priests in short time after their arrival filled the. island of the Britains with their good name, their preaching and their powers; and the word of God was through them daily preached not only in the churches but through the open streets and through the fields; in such sort that in all places both the faithful Catholics were confirmed, and they that before swerved out of the right way were amended. Like the apostles they had both honour and authority by reason of a good conscience, learning given by letters, and powers the fruit of good desert. And so in short time the whole country had readily come over to their opinion. The authors of the perverse teaching lay lurking in hiding, and, like the evil spirit much spited that the people making a way to escape were lost to them, and at length after long advisement used they taketh upon them to try the matter by open disputation. They came forth richly appointed, gorgeously apparelled, accompanied by a number of flattering favourers, choosing rather to commit their cause to the hazard of open contention, than fall into the shame of speechlessness, for fear that in the eyes of the people, whom they had subverted, they should seem to have given sentence against themselves by their own silence. Thither had assembled a truly great concourse of men stirred up to come with their wives and children as well; the people
<pb id="p.83"/>
was there to see and to judge: the parties there were far unlike of condition: on the one side was divine faith, on the other man's presumption: on the one side godliness, on the other pride: on the one side Pelagius for authority, on the other Christ. First of all the blessed bishops gave their adversaries leave to speak, which for long time vainly occupied both the time and ears of the people with nought but naked words: after, the venerable bishops poured out the streams of their own eloquence with speech of apostles and evangelists like showers of rain: they joined with their own words the words of God, and after the grievous assault of their own declarations they read the witness of others upon the same: the vanity of heretics is convicted, unbelief is confuted; so that at every objection they were forced to confess their error, not being able to answer them: the people that was umpire had much to do to keep their hands from them, yet shewed their judgment by their shouting.

</p><p>How the same Germanus restored the blind daughter of the tribune to her sight, and after, coming to Saint Alban's shrine, did in that same place both take the relics of the saint himself and set there relics of the blessed apostles and other martyrs.
</p><p>This done, suddenly a certain man of the dignity of the tribunes cometh forth amongst them with his wife, offering his daughter of ten years old, which was blind, to be cured by the bishops. They bid him have her to the adversaries; but these made fearful by pricking of their conscience, joyneth their
<pb id="p.85"/>
prayers together with the parents and desireth the bishops to do their cure upon the girl: which, seeing their adversaries to yield, in short while pour forth prayer; and after Germanus, full of the Holy Ghost, calleth upon the Trinity; and straight teareth from his neck a little bugget 1 which he had by his side full of the relics of saints, and seizing it in his hands in the sight of them all putteth it to the eyes of the maiden, which straight were emptied of darkness and filled with the light of truth. The parents much joy thereat, the people are all amazed at the sight of the miracle; and after that day the perverse doctrine was so pulled out of the minds of all that with thirsty longing they embraced the teaching of the bishops.
</p><p>Thus the damnable heresy being suppressed and the authors thereof utterly confuted and all men's minds quieted with the purity of the faith, the bishops went unto the blessed martyr Alban's tomb, to give thanks to God by the saint, and there Germanus having with him relics of all the apostles and of divers martyrs, making his prayer ordered the tomb to be opened, intending to leave in that same place those precious treasures; thinking good that the members of the saints gotten in divers countries should have the shelter of one tomb, being like of merits, they had been all received into heaven. Which being left there with much honour and mingled together, he took a clot of dust from the very spot where the blessed martyr's blood had been shed, to carry away with him, wherein it was made clear by the abiding of the blood that the sanctuary of the martyrs had remained ruddy while the persecutor waxed pale.2 Which things being
<pb id="p.87"/>
thus disposed a very great multitude of people was that same day converted to the Lord.

</p><p>How the same being driven by sickness to remain in that place, did both quench a great fire among the houses with his prayers, and was by a vision himself healed of his infirmity.
</p><p>As they were coming back thence, the crafty enemy, by the procurement of snares that fell in the way, bruised the foot of Germanus by means of a fall he had. Little knew the devil that by the affliction of the body (as it was in blessed Job) the merits of the holy man should be thereby the more increased; and whiles for the time by the reason of his weakness he was forced to tarry still in one place, the next hut to that he lodged in was set on fire, so that, after it had consumed the houses about, that were there thatched with reed, it was now being carried through the blowing of the wind to that lodging wherein this good man was lying. All came running in great haste to the bishop, willing to carry him in their arms out of the danger that threatened: whom he rebuking, through confidence in his faith, would not be removed out of the place he was in. Yet the crowd all frighted with fear and despair came running to quench the fire. But that the power of God might appear the plainer, the fire still consumed whatsoever the people sought to save; but what the sick man lying in his bed did defend, that the fire skipped, as being afraid of the holy man's refuge that lay open to it; and both above and beneath fiercely burned without stay,
<pb id="p.89"/>
so that in the middle of the flakes and flames of the fire the lodging, that the imprisoned dweller kept, shone forth sound and untouched. The people much joyed at the miracle, and rejoiced in God to see His power to save that their labour could not. Before the cottage lay there watching day and night a multitude of people of the poorer sort without number, some to be cured of the maladies of their souls, some of their bodies. The works cannot be told which Christ wrought in His servant who did cures when he was sick: and in the mean, suffering no remedies to be applied unto his own infirmities, on a certain night he saw a person clad all in shining white apparel to stand by his bedside, which stretching out his hand seemed to lift him up as he lay in his bed and bid him stand upright upon his feet: after which time his pains being-assuaged, he was so restored unto his former health, that as soon as it was day, he underwent the toil of travel without fear.

</p><p>How the said bishops by the power of God aided the Britons in battle, and so returned home.
</p><p>In this meantime the Saxons and Redshanks waged war with united forces against the Britons, which had been assembled together in camp by the same .need of making face against them; and through fear judging that they on their side should fall short of proving a match for them, they required the help of the holy bishops: which hastening their promised coming put their fearful hearts in such confidence, as though a great army had been come at that instant
<pb id="p.91"/>
to aid them. And so, they being their apostolic captains, Christ warred with them in their camp. This also happened in the forty days of solemn season, which were the more devoutly observed through the presence of the bishops, insomuch that being instructed with daily preaching the people eagerly flocked to receive the grace of baptism. For the greatest part of the army required the water of the health-giving laver, and against the day of the Lord's resurrection they made the likeness of a church framed of leafy boughs, and so prepared it for an army in the field as it had been in a city. Moistened with the water of baptism the army marcheth forth, the people be cometh fervent in faith and bold in the hope of God's help, which before were in despair of their own arms. The enemy had word of the manner and form of their pure living, whereupon they thinking easily to obtain the victory over them as over an army that were unarmed, maketh all the haste they could towards them; but yet by scouts their coming is known in good time. And now the holy days of Easter being past, the greater part of the host goeth fresh from baptism to their armour and to make ready for war. Among them Germanus,1 declaring himself as captain in the battle, picketh a certain number of light soldiers, overrunneth the surrounding country and, on the side by which it was thought the enemy would pass, observeth a valley beset with hills on every side. In the which place he posteth the army now made new,2 with himself as leader of the march. And shortly after cometh on the proud host of the enemy, which when they that were set in the ambush perceived to approach, Germanus
<pb id="p.93"/>
bearing the standard suddenly giveth warning unto them all and proclaimeth that as they heard him begin, all they should cry and answer the same; and the enemy being heedless, as having assurance that their coming was unlooked for, the priests cried out thrice together <q>Alleluia.</q> All the rest straight answereth the same, and the sound of their voices is caught up and often repeated by the echo rebounding from the mountains wherewith it was shut in: the host of the enemy is cast down with fear as they tremble, not only at the rocks that encompassed them, but also the very frame of the heaven above them, and believed that the speed of their feet could scarce avail them to escape the terror that was flung upon them: they fly in all directions, casting away their weapons and thinking it enough if they might with even their naked bodies snatch themselves from the danger: the more part also in the hurry of their fear were swallowed up in the river which lay between them and home.1 The army that did them no hurt beholdeth the revenge of their enemies, and seeth themselves made to look upon a victory that had been granted to them without deed of theirs. The spoils are collected and set out to be seen, and the soldiers devoutly acknowlegeth with joy the glory that was due to heaven. The bishops triumpheth to see the enemy put to flight without bloodshed, and the victory to have been gotten by faith and not by might of man.
</p><p>Thus the island being set in safety in manifold measure, the enemies whether invisible or visible in the flesh being overcome, the bishops set about their return homeward. To whom calm passage is granted, both for their own virtues' sake and also
<pb id="p.95"/>
at the intercession of the blessed martyr Alban, and the happy vessel restored them in peace to their own people that longed after them.

<div2 type="chapter" n="21"><p>
</p><p>How, the slips of the Pelagian pestilence shooting forth again, Germanus returning to Britain with Severus first restored to a lame young man the power of walking, then also, condemning or correcting the heretics, restored the steps of the faith to the people of God.
</p><p>AND not long after, there was word brought out of the same island, that the Pelagian frowardness began of new to grow and multiply by means of certain few that were helpers thereof: and again are directed to the blessed man the prayers of all the clergy that he would maintain the cause of God which he had taken in hand before. Whose petition he quickly accepteth. For joyning to himself Severus, a man of all holiness (as the which was the disciple of the blessed father Lupus, bishop of Troyes, and at that time was ordained bishop of the Treveri and preached the word to the Upper 1 Germany), he took ship and with the help of the elements maketh for the coasts of Britain with prosperous voyage.
</p><p>In this mean season, the evil spirits fleeing about the island did foreshew everywhere by constrained prophecies that Germanus was coming; insomuch that Elafius, one of the chief of that country, without the report of any manifest messenger, hastened to meet the holy men at their arrival, bringing with him his son, which in the very flower of his youth
<pb id="p.97"/>
was under judgment of grievous infirmity. For through the dryth of his sinews the hollow of the knee was so shrunk, that by the numbing of his leg he could not set foot upon the ground. Close after this Elafius cometh the whole province: the bishops arrive, the ignorant folk meet them, forthwith blessing is given and the doctrine of godly discourse poured out. They find the people as touching their faith in the selfsame stay as they left them: they learneth the fault to remain in a few, after whom they seek and finding them out they condemn them. This done, upon a sudden Elafius falleth down at the feet of the bishops, offering them his son, whose pitiful case of itself alone needed no prayers to intreat for the relief thereof: every man of himself pitied the young man, especially the bishops, who altogether (according to the pity they felt) beseeched the clemency of God; and forthwith blessed Germanus made the young man sit down, he feeleth the knee bowed inward by the infirmity, and with his curing right hand runneth over all the affected place as far as the grief went, and each part as soon as it felt his healing touch quickly became sound. Dryth returned to moisture, the sinews to their natural course, and in the sight of all health is restored to the son, the son to his father. The people are filled with astonishment at the sight of the miracle, and in all their hearts is the catholic faith confirmed and strengthened. After that he turneth to preach to the people of the redress of the abandonment of faith, and by the assent of them all the first authors of corruption, who had been banished the land, are delivered unto the bishops to be conveyed to parts
<pb id="p.99"/>
<note type="margin">CIVIL WARS</note>
removed from the sea, that both the country might be rid of them and they have the fruit of correction. Whereby it came to pass that in those parts the faith long after remained undefiled.
</p><p>And all things thus ordered the blessed bishops returned with like good speed as they came. Furthermore, Germanus went after this to Ravenna to treat for peace for the people of the Armoricans,1 and there with great reverence being received of Valentinian and Placidia his mother he departed unto Christ. Whose corpse with an honourable company was conveyed to his city, not without the effectual working of his virtues by the way. And not long after Valentinian is killed 2 of the soldiers of Aetius the patrician whom he had slain, in the sixth year of Marcian's reign, and with him the West Empire decayed and came to ruin.

</p><p>How the Britons, being free for a time from all foreign wars, wore themselves away with civil wars and therewithal were plunged into greater mischiefs.
</p><p>IN the meantime there came for a season an end of foreign wars in Britain, but not of war within themselves. The ruins remained of the cities which the enemy had destroyed and left wasted, and the citizens which had escaped the hands of the enemies were now fighting against their own fellows. But yet having still as fresh in mind the late calamities and slaughters they had sustained, their kings, priests, peers and subjects in some sort observed each of them his several rank. But after their death the generation that followed, little knowing
<pb id="p.101"/>
the storms past in their fathers' days, and having only experience of that peaceful estate in the which they then lived, were so set to shake and overthrow all good orders of truth and justice that, I do not say no token, but not even any remembrance thereof remained, save only in few, and that in very few. Among other of their evil deeds not to be spoke of, which their historiographer Gildus 1 doth lamentably set forth in writing, this also is added, that they never took care to preach the word of faith to the folk of the Saxons or English which inhabited the land along with them. But yet the goodness of God did not so forsake His people which He foreknew to be saved, but provided for the said folk much more worthy heralds of the truth, by whom they might be brought unto His faith.

<pb id="p.103"/>
year of the coming of the English into Britain, being moved by inspiration of God thereunto, sent the servant of God Augustine 1 and other more monks fearing the Lord with him to preach the word of God unto the nation of the English. Which obeying the bishop's commandment, when they began to take the said enterprise in hand and had already travelled some small part of the way,2 being stricken with sluggish cowardice bethought themselves it should be better for them to return home again than to_go unto that barbarous, savage and unbelieving nation whose language even they knew not, and this by common consent they determined to do, as being the more sure way. Whereupon they sendeth Augustine back again to the blessed Gregory (by whom he had been appointed to be ordained bishop there, if they were received of the English), humbly to require him that they might not have to go forward in that so perilous, so painful and uncertain journeying. Whom he yet exhorted by letter that, putting their trust in God, they should proceed to the work of the word. Of the which letter to wit this is the copy:
<quote><p>Gregory, the servant of the servants of God, to the servants of our Lord. For so much as better it were never to begin a good work, than after this is once begun to go from it again in the inward thought, you must needs, my beloved sons, now fulfil the good work which by the help of God you have taken in hand. Let therefore neither the travail of the journey nor the talk of evil-tongued men dismay you: but with all force and all fervour make up that you have by the motion of God begun: assuring yourselves that after your great labour the greater

glory of eternal reward shall follow. And be you in all points humbly obedient to Augustine your provost, that now returneth to you, whom also we have made to be your abbot: knowing that shall profit in all things your souls whatsoever you shall fulfil in obedienee of his commandment. The Almighty God defend you with His grace, and grant me to see the fruit of your labours in the eternal country; that, though I cannot myself labour with you, I may be found to enjoy part of your reward along with you, for that surely I have a will to labour.

</p><p>I low that Augustine coming unto Britain first preached unto the king of Kent in the Isle of Thanet; and so being licensed of him came after into Kent to preach.
</p><p>AUGUSTINE therefore being much encouraged with the comfort of the blessed father Gregory, returned
<pb id="p.109"/>
to the work of the word with the servants of Christ which were with him, and came into Britain. Ethelbert at that time was king in Kent, a man of great puissance, as the which had enlarged the frontiers of his empire as far as the. bound of the great flood Humbert by the which the south and north folk of the English are divided. Now at the east end of Kent there is Thanet, an isle of goodly size, that is to say, containing 600 hides 1 according to the custom of the estimation of the English, which island is parted from the land by the flood Wantsum,2 which is of about three furlongs breadth and in two places only passable: for both the heads of him runneth to the sea. In this island then was Augustine the servant of the Lord set on land, and his fellows to the number, it is said, of almost 40 persons. And they took with them certain Franks by command of the blessed pope Gregory to be their interpreters, and sending unto Ethelbert, Augustine informed him that he came from Rome, and that he bi*ought him very good tidings, which promised that such as did obey him, should have without any doubt everlasting joys in heaven and a kingdom without end with the living and true God. And he, hearing this, commanded that they should tarry in that island whereunto they were come, and be furnished with things needful until he should see what was his pleasure about them. For the bruit of the Christian religion had come also before unto him, as the which had married a Christian woman of the royal family of the Franks, named Bertha 3; whom he had married with these conditions taken from her parents, that it should be lawful for her to keep 
unbroken the rites of her faith and religion, with
<pb id="p.111"/>
<note type="margin">MEETING IN THANET</note>
her bishop, Liudhard by name, whom they had appointed her to help her in matters of her faith.
</p><p>Within therefore some days hereof the king came unto the island, and sitting in an open place he bid Augustine with his fellows to come to commune with him therein. For he would not, by reason of an old superstition, suffer him to come unto him in any house, lest, if they were skilful in sorcery, they might the rather by surprise deceive him and prevail against him. But they came not armed with the force of the devil but with the strength of God, carrying before them in place of a banner a cross of silver and the image of the Lord Saviour painted in a table, and singing the litanies, prayed the Lord both for their own eternal salvation and that of them as well to whom and for whose sake they had come thither. And when they sitting down, as the king did bid them, preached unto him the word of life and also to all his household there present, he answered them, saying: <q> The words and promises you give us are fair; but yet, for that they are strange and uncertain, I cannot rashly assent unto them, forsaking those things which this long time I have observed with all the people of the English. But for so much as you are come hither so far, and, as I seem to have discerned, have longing to impart to us also such knowledge as you took to be right good and true, we will not seek your trouble: nay rather with all courtesy will receive you, and be careful to minister you such things as are behoveful for your livelihood: neither do we let but that you may win unto the faith of your religion with your preaching as many as you may.</q> He allowed them, therefore, a lodging in the city of Canterbury,
<pb id="p.113"/>
<note type="margin">MISSION IN KENT</note>
which was the head city of all his dominion, and. as he promised, provided them of temporal necessaries and did not withhold the licence of preaching as well. Moreover, it is said that, as they approached near the city, having the holy cross and image of the mighty King our Lord Jesus Christ, as their manner was, before them, they sung all in one tune this litany following: <q>We beseech Thee, Lord, in all Thy mercy, that Thy fury and anger may be taken from this city and from Thy holy house, because we have sinned.1 Alleluia.</q>

</p><p>How the said Augustine living in Kent did follow the primitive Church both in teaching and living, and received the seat of his bishopric in the king's city.
</p><p>BUT after they were now entered into their lodging, they began to follow the apostolical life of the primitive Church; that is to wit by submitting to continual prayer, watching and fasting, preaching the word of life to as many as they could, despising all the commodities of this world as things none of their own, taking of them whom they instructed only so much as might serve their necessities, living themselves in all things according to what they taught other, and having a spirit ready to suffer all adversities or even death in defence of that truth they preached. Why make delay?_Some believed and were baptized, marvelling much,at the_simplicity_of_their innocent life and the sweetness of their heavenly, doctrine. Now there was right close to the city at the east end a church built of ancient time in honour of Saint Martin, made while the Romans were yet dwelling
<pb id="p.115"/>
in Britain, in the which the queen (which as we have said was a Christian woman) did use commonly to pray. They also themselves therefore began at first to assemble in the same church, to sing service, pray, say mass, preach and christen; until such time as, the king being converted to the faith, they received more ample licence of preaching where they would, and either to build of new or repair old churches.
</p><p>But when the king himself too among other (being much delighted with the purity of the holy men's life as likewise with their sweet promises which to be true they had proved by the shewing also of many miracles) did believe and was baptized, there began more and more to resort together to hear the word, and renouncing the rites of their kinsfolk to join themselves by believing to the unity of the holy Church of Christ. Of whose faith and conversion though, it is said, the king much rejoiced, yet he would force none to become Christian, but only embrace the believers with a closer affection, as being fellow-citizens with him of the heavenly kingdom. For he had learned of the masters and authors of his salvation that the-service of Christ must be voluntary and not forced. And without further delay he granted to his said teachers a place wherein to settle 1 seemly for their degree, in his head city of Canterbury, and at the same time bestowed on them possessions in divers kinds necessary for the maintenance thereof.

</p><p>How the same being created bishop did advertise Gregory the pope of such things as he had done in Britain, and likewise requiring his answers upon matters necessary, received the same.
</p><p>IN the meantime the man of the Lord, Augustine, came to Aries, and was ordained archbishop of the nation of the English by Etherius, archbishop of the said city,1 according to the commandments they had received from the holy father Gregory; and returning unto Britain he sent forthwith Laurence, a priest, and Peter, a monk, unto Rome, which should make relation to the blessed pope Gregory how that the nation of the English had received the faith of Christ, and he was made their bishop: at the same time too requiring his advice upon certain doubts necessary for him to be informed of. And without delay 2 he received fitting answer to his inquisition; which also we thought good to put into this our History.
1. Question of the blessed Augustine, bishop of the Church of the men of Kent. <q> Concerning bishops, how they should behave themselves among their clergy, or concerning the gifts made to the altar by the offerings of the faithful; what portions should be distributed and what is the bishop's office in the Church.</q>
</p><p>Gregory pope of the city of Rome answered. <q><p>The Holy Scripture testifieth, the which I am sure you know well, and specially the epistles of the blessed Paul unto Timothy, in the which he goeth about to instruct him after what sort he ought to be con-
<pb id="p.119"/>
<note type="margin">QUESTIONS</note>
versant in the house of God. Now the manner of the see apostolic is to give commandment unto such as be made bishops, that all manner of oblations that be given should be divided into four portions; to wit, the one thereof given unto the bishop and his household towards his hospitality and entertaining of guests; the second to the clergy; the third to the poor; the fourth to the reparation of the churches. But for so much as you, brother, being brought up under regular discipline, must not by the order of your rule live apart from your clergy, in the Church of the English (which is as yet but newly brought by the motion of God to the faith), you must follow that manner of living which was used in the beginning at the birth of the Church among our fathers; among whom there was none that said anything to be his of the things that they possessed, but all their things were common.
</p><p>If now there be any among the clergy out of holy orders, which cannot have continency, they shall take wives and have their stipend allowed them without. For too of the same fathers of which we have spoken before, we know it is written, that it was divided to every man according as he had need.1 You must also think and provide for their stipend, and they are to be kept under the ecclesiastical rule, and seen unto that they live honestly, and ply their psalmody, and keep both heart and tongue and body from all unlawful things by the help of God. But as for them that liveth after the common sort what need I to speak now, either what portions they shall give, either what hospitality they shall keep, either what work of mercy they shall fulfil? Seeing that it is commanded that all which
<pb id="p.121"/>
is superfluous should be employed upon godly and devout uses; according as the Lord, the Master of all, doth teach us: 1 'Of that which is left, give alms, and lo! all shall be clean unto you.'</p></q>
</p><p>II. Question of Augustine. <q> Whereas there is but one faith, why be there sundry customs of Churches, and one custom of masses be observed in the holy Roman Chureh, another in the Church of France?</q>
</p><p>Gregory, pope, answereth. <q> Your brotherhood knoweth the custom of the Church of Rome, in the which you remember that you were brought up. But it pleaseth me, if you have found anything (be it other in the Church of Rome, of France or any other, that may more please Almighty God), that you zealously choose and spread in the Church of the English (which as yet is but late come to the faith), by the best order you can choose, the things that you have been able to gather from many Churches. For the things are not to be loved for the place, but the place is to be loved for the good things that are in it. Choose then out of each Church that that is godly, that is religious, that is right in any of them, and these being gathered as it were in a bundle deliver unto them and inure the minds of the English thereunto.</q>
</p><p>III. Question of Augustine. <q> I pray you, how shall he be punished, which by theft taketh anything from the Church?</q>
</p><p>Gregory answereth. <q> This your brotherhood may consider by the person of the thief in what sort it be good for him to be corrected. For there be some which having otherwise to live, yet stealeth; and some there be which in this matter are driven to err by need: whereby some must be merced with
<pb id="p.123"/>
fines but some must be punished with stripes, and some more sharply but some more lightly. And when punishment a little more sharp is exercised, it must be done in charity and not in fury: for therefore is punishment dealt to the selfsame man that is corrected, that he might not be delivered to the fires of hell. For so ought we to exercise correction upon the faithful as the good fathers useth with their carnal children, whom though they punish with stripes for their faults, yet they seek to have for their heirs the very same whom they visiteth with pains; and their possessions they keepeth for the very same whom they seem to chasten in their anger. This charity therefore is to be kept in mind, and of itself enjoyneth that correction is to be so measured that the mind exceedeth in no way the rule of reason. Thou shalt also tell them in what way they must make restitution of such things as they have taken by theft from the churches. But God forbid that the Church should look to receive back with increase of gain such earthly things as it seemeth to lose, and to be greedy of lucre from that which is vanity.</q>
</p><p>IV. Question of Augustine. <q> Whether two german brothers may marry two sisters which be many degrees from them in kin?</q>
</p><p>Gregory answereth. <q> That may be done lawfully by all means, for there is nothing found in the sacred utterances such as seemeth to be contrary to this head.</q>
</p><p>V. Question of Augustine. <q> Unto what generation should the faithful be joined together in wedlock with their kinsfolk? And is it lawful to be joined together in wedlock with a stepmother or a brother's wife?</q>
<pb id="p.125"/>
</p><p>Gregory answereth. <q><p>It is permitted by a secular law of the Roman commonwealth 1 that the son and daughter of a brother and sister 2 or of two brothers german or two sisters may be joined together. But experience sheweth that of such wedlock there can grow up no children: and the holy law forbiddeth that we should reveal the nakedness 3 of our kindred. Wherefore it is necessary that it be not until the third or fourth generation that believers should be permitted to marry: for the second (of which we have already spoken) must in any wise forbear one from the other. But to marry with a stepmother, it is a grievous offence, for it is written too in the Law: ' Thou shalt not reveal the nakedness of thy father.'4 How? for the son cannot reveal the nakedness of his father. But because it is written: ' They too shall be one flesh '; he that presumeth to reveal the nakedness of his stepmother, which was one flesh with his father, he truly revealeth the nakedness of his father. It is also forbidden thee to marry withal thy brother's wife, for that by her former marriage she was one flesh with thy brother. For which cause also John Baptist was beheaded and suffered holy martyrdom, who though he was not told to deny Christ, yet was he killed for the confession of Christ; but in that the same our Lord Jesus Christ had said: ' I am the truth '; for that John was slain for the truth, surely also he shed his blood for Christ.
</p><p>But whereas there be many of the people of the English which, while they were yet infidels, are said to have been coupled in this infamous wedlock, when they cometh to the faith they are to be warned that they forbear, and take it to be a right grievous 
<pb id="p.127"/>
offence. Teach them to fear the dreadful judgment of God, lest for the sake of carnal affection they run in danger of eternal torment. Yet for this thing are they not to be kept from the communion of the sacred body and blood of the Lord, lest you may seem to punish such things in them, wherein they have bound themselves through ignorance before coming to the laver of baptism. For at this present time the holy Church with a zeal doth punish some things, some other of a meekness it doth tolerate, at some other it winketh upon consideration, yea, it so beareth and winketh thereat that often the evil which it hateth, by bearing and winking at, it checketh. But all such as cometh to the faith are to be warned that they dare not to do any such thing. And if there be any that then do so, they are to be restrained from the communion of the Lord's body and blood: for as they are somewhat to be borne withal, which of ignorance hath offended, so they are sharply to be corrected, which wittingly fear not to sin.</p></q>
</p><p>VI. Question of Augustine. <q> If the bishops are so far apart from the other that they cannot conveniently assemble together, whether one may be ordained a bishop without the presence of other bishops.</q>
</p><p>Gregory answereth. <q> It is true that in the Church of the English in which thou only art as yet found to be bishop, thou canst ordain none but without other bishops. For when come there any bishops out of France that might be present as witnesses at the ordination of a bishop? But we will your brotherhood to ordain bishops, yet so that the selfsame bishops be the least distance separated one
<pb id="p.129"/>
from the other; in order that there be no lack but that there ought easily to come together at the ordination of a bishop other pastors also, whose presence is right useful. When then by the help of God the bishops shall be so ordained that they be not far asunder one from the other, there ought not to be made anywhere ordination of bishops without three or four bishops assemble together. For in spiritual matters themselves, how they may be wisely and providently disposed, we may take example even from carnal matters. For assuredly when marriages are solemnized in the world, all that are married are called thereunto, that such as have gone forward already in the way of wedlock should have their part in the joy of such as are married after. Why then may it not be like also in this spiritual ordinance (in the which by spiritual ministry a man is joined unto God), that such then should resort together, which either may rejoice in the promotion of him that is made bishop, or may pour forth prayers together unto Almighty God for his keeping of his charge?</q>
</p><p>VII. Question of Augustine. <q> How ought we to deal with the bishops of the provinces of France and Britain?</q>
</p><p>Gregory answereth. <q> We give thee none authority over the bishops of France: for that of ancient time of my predecessors the bishop of Aries received his pall,1 whom we must not in the least degree deprive of the authority he hath obtained. If therefore it chance that your brotherhood go over to France, you shall treat with the said bishop of Aries how such defaults as are in the bishops may be redressed. Who if perchance he be lukewarm in the
<pb id="p.131"/>
execution of discipline, your brotherhood must move him and prick him forward thereunto. To whom also we have written that, joyning with your holiness being there present, he will also himself with all readiness of mind help to restrain from the manners of the bishops all such ways as are contrary to the command of our Creator. But you yourself outside your own authority shall not be able to give judgment upon the bishops of France; but by persuading, by courteously entreating, by giving example also of good works for them to follow, reform to the pursuits of holiness the minds of the evil disposed: for why? it is written in the Law: ' He that passeth through another man's field shall not thrust his sickle in the corn, but rub the ears with his hand and so eat them.' For thou canst not thrust the sickle of thy judgment into the corn that seemeth to have been committed to the other man's charge; but with the love of thy well-doing rub off from the Lord's corn the chaff of the sins found therein, and by treating and persuading with them convert them in the body of the Church as a man doth the meat he eateth in his own body. But whatsoever there is to be done by authority, let it be done along with the aforesaid bishop of Aries, lest that order should be neglected which was devised by the ancient institution of our forefathers. But as for all the bishops of the Britains,1 we commit them unto the charge of your brotherhood, that the unlearned may be instructed, the weak by good persuasions be strengthened, the froward be corrected by authority.</q>
</p><p>VIII. Question of Augustine. <q> Whether a woman that is great with child ought to be baptized? Or
<pb id="p.133"/>
how long, after she is brought a-bed shall she tarry ere she can enter a church? Or also the child that is born, how many days shall it tarry before it may receive the sacrament of holy baptism, lest it be prevented by death? Or how long after she is brought a-bed shall her husband forbear her carnal company? Or if she be in her monthly custom, whether she may come to the church or receive the sacrament of holy communion? Or the man, after he hath carnally known his wife, whether he may enter the church before he be washed with water? or also may draw near to the mystery of holy communion? Of all the which the rude nation of the English hath need to be informed.</q>
</p><p>Gregory answereth. <q><p>I doubt not but your brotherhood hath been required counsel in these matters, and I think also I have made you already answer therein. Yet that which yourself could say and judge therein I think you would have it confirmed with my answer. For instance, the woman with child, why should she not be baptized, seeing to be teeming is no blame before the eyes of Almighty God? For our first parents, when they had sinned in Paradise, by the right judgment of God lost the immortality which they had received. For so much as accordingly Almighty God would not utterly destroy mankind for his sin, in punishment for his sin he also took from man the benefit of immortality; and yet of His mercy and goodness He reserved unto him the increase of issue. That then which of the gift of Almighty God is reserved unto the nature of man, by what reason can it be restrained from the grace of holy baptism? For in that mystery, in the which all blame is utterly taken away, it, is great
<pb id="p.135"/>
folly to think that the gift seem able to be contrary to the grace.
</p><p>Further, when the woman is delivered, how many days after she should enter the church, you have learnt by the commandment of the Old Testament,1 that for a man child she should forbear 33 days, but for a female child, 66 days. Which yet is to be known that it is taken as said in a parable. For if the same hour that she is delivered she entereth the church to give thanks, she is burdened with the weight of no sin: for it is the pleasure of the flesh, not the pain that is to be blamed. But the pleasure is in the carnal begetting, for in the travail of bearing is the suffering. Whereupon it is said also to the first mother of all herself,2 ' Thou shalt bring-forth in sorrow.' If then we forbid the woman that is delivered to come to the church, we reckon her punishment itself for a blame to her.
</p><p>Moreover, by no ways is it forbidden to baptize either the woman that is delivered or the child whereof she is delivered, if it be beset with peril of death, or the woman herself the same hour that she beareth, either that which is brought forth in the same hour it be born: for the grace of the holy mystery, as it is to be given unto the living and such as are discerning with great discretion, so it is to be offered without any delay to them which draweth towards their death; lest while time convenient to give the mystery of our redemption is yet sought for, by means of a small moment of delay the party that should be redeemed have not strength to be found.
</p><p>Moreover, the man shall not carnally accompany with his wife until the child that is born be weaned. But a corrupt custom hath risen up in the manners
<pb id="p.137"/>
of them that are married, that the women think scorn to nurse the sons born of their own body and commit them to the charge of other women to nurse, which thing surely seemeth to have been found out only of incontinence: for therefore they refuse to give suck to their own children, because they will not forbear the company of their husbands. Wherefore such as of an evil custom do put our their children to nurse, shall not lie with their husband until the day of their purification be fully complete: seeing that also without excuse of childbirth they are forbid to keep company with their husbands in the time of their flowers; so that the holy Law 1 doth punish with death them which hath to do with a woman in that case. Which woman yet is not to be forbidden to come to church whilst she suffereth the monthly custom; because the superfluity of nature cannot be imputed to her for sin: and for that she suffereth that against her will, it is no reason she should be restrained from coming into the church. For we know that the woman which was diseased with the bloody flux, coming humbly behind our Lord touched the hem of His garment, and thereby forthwith her malady departed. If then the woman which had the bloody flux might laudably touch the garment of the Lord, why may not she enter into the church, that suffereth her monthly flowers? But you say: ' As for her, her malady forced her to seek remedy; but she of whom we speak is taken of her customable weakness.' Consider, however, this with thyself, my dear brother, that all that we suffer in this mortal flesh by feebleness of nature, it was by the just judgment of God ordained after fault committed;
<pb id="p.139"/>
as hunger, thirst, heat, cold, weariness proceedeth of the infirmity of nature. And what other thing is it to seek food against hunger, drink against thirst, open air against heat, garment against cold, rest against weariness, but to search out a remedy in deed against distresses? And so unto the woman that monthly flow of her blood is a distress. If then she did well presume, which being sick touched the garment of the Lord, that which is granted to one woman having a malady, why should it not be granted to all women which have malady by the fault of their nature?
</p><p>Moreover, she ought not to be forbidden in the said days to receive the mystery of the holy communion. But if of a great reverence she hath thereunto, she doth not presume to receive she is to be praised; but if she shall receive it, she is not to be judged. For it is the point of well-disposed minds even there to acknowledge their fault in some way, where there is no fault; for many times that is committed without fault which yet proceeded of a fault: whereupon too to eat when we are hungry is no fault, and yet hunger in us began and sprang first of the fault of the first man. As that monthly custom is not any fault to the woman, for that it cometh naturally. But yet because nature itself is so corrupted, that even without inclination of will it seemeth to be defiled, corruption cometh of fault, to the intent human nature might therein know of itself what it is become through the judgment of God. And that man which did commit fault with his will should bear the accusation of blame against his will. And further, therefore, let women consider with themselves herein, and if in the monthly
<pb id="p.141"/>
custom they should meeky refuse to come to the sacrament of the Lord's body and blood, they are to be commended of their good consideration; whiles, however, of the custom of religious life 1 they have a fervent love of the said mystery by receiving the same, they are not to be forbidden, as we have said before.
</p><p>For as in the Old Testament outward works are observed, so in the New Testament that is not regarded so straitly and carefully which is outwardly done, as that which is inwardly thought, so that it may be punished with discerning judgment. For whereas the Law forbiddeth us to eat many things as unclean; yet in the Gospel the Lord saith: 2 ' Not that which entereth into the mouth defileth the man, but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth the man.' And shortly after He addeth, expounding the same: 'Out of the heart cometh evil thoughts.'3 Where it is abundantly declared, that that is shewn by the Almighty God to be unclean in deed which springeth out of the root of an unclean heart. Whereupon the Apostle Paul also saith:4 ' Unto the pure all things are pure, but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure.' And soon after declaring farther the cause of the said defilement, he addeth: ' For even their mind and conscience is defiled.' If then the meat be not unclean unto him which hath not an unclean mind, why is that which the woman, having a clean mind, doth suffer of nature to be reckoned unto her as impurity?
</p><p>Now as for the man which sleepeth with his own wife, he shall not come into the church except he be washed with water; but he shall not either,
<pb id="p.143"/>
if he be washed, enter forthwith. Moreover, the Law commanded the old people that the man which hath had to do with a woman shall both wash himself with water and not enter the church before the going down of the sun: which saying may yet be spiritually construed; for then the man hath to do with the woman when the mind doth delight himself in being joined in thought to unlawful lust; for, except the fire of lust be first quenched in the mind, he shall not think himself worthy the company of the brethren, which findeth himself under tin-burden of the iniquity of unchaste desire. Though of this thing divers countries are of divers minds, and some keepeth one way, some another; yet the manner of the Romans was ever of ancient time, after the company of their own wives, both to purify themselves in the bath and of reverence awhile to forbear coming into the church.
</p><p>And we say not this for that we reckon marriage to be blame; but, for that the very lawful company of man and wife cannot be without pleasure of the flesh, he should forbear from entering a holy place; for that pleasure itself can in no way be without blame. For he was not born of adultery or fornication but of lawful wedlock, which said: ' Behold, I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me.' For he which knew himself to have been shapen in iniquity mourned to remember Iris sinful birth: seeing the tree doth bear in his branch the corrupt humour which he drew of the root. In the which words yet he doth not call the carnal company of man and wife iniquity, but only assuredly the pleasure therein. For there be many things which are approved to be lawful and allowable, and
<pb id="p.145"/>
yet in the doing of them we are somewhat defiled; as oftentimes being angry we punish other men's faults, whereby the calmness of our mind is troubled: and though it be well done that we do, yet it is not commendable that in doing it our mind is put out of quiet. For he was angry with the vice of the offenders which said:1 ' Mine eye is troubled with anger.' For whereas the mind cannot lift himself up to the light of contemplation except it be still and quiet, therefore he sorrowed to see his eye distempered in his anger: for while he looked downward to punish the transgressions, he was forced to be withdrawn in his trouble from the contemplation of things which are above. And therefore it is a commendable thing to be angry against error, and yet it is a grief, by the trouble of which he judged that he fell under some accusation of guilt.
</p><p>Accordingly the right use of carnal union is to breed offspring, not pleasure; and the carnal company between man and wife is for the sake of the procreation of children, not the satisfaction of lusts. If however any man doth use his wife (not being carried away by desire of pleasure, but to the end of procreation only), this man truly is to be left unto his own discretion, whether for coming into the church, whether for the taking of the mystery of the Lord's body and blood; for he is not to be kept from receiving by us, which being in the fire cannot be burned. But when, not the love of begetting issue, but pleasure beareth the chiefest rule in the work of copulation, they have both cause also to bewail their coining together. For though holy declaration doth grant them so much, yet doth it not so grant it them that their mind be not shaken with
<pb id="p.147"/>
fear. For when Paul the Apostle said: ' He that cannot contain, let him have his wife;'1 he was careful straight to say farther: ' Now this I say by permission, not of commandment.' 2 For there is no permission of that which is lawful, seeing it is right. Wherefore in that he used this word permission he shewed it to be faulty.
</p><p>Moreover, it is to be pondered with good heed that the Lord intending to speak to the people in the mount of Sinai, first gave commandment that the same people should abstain from women. And if the purity of the body was there so earnestly required, where the Lord by means of a creature made subject to Him did speak unto men, that they which should hear the words of God should be free from women; how much more the women which receive the body of the Almighty Lord shall seek to preserve in themselves the cleanness of the flesh, lest they may take hurt by the very greatness of that inestimable mystery. Hereof also it is said by the priest 3 unto David as touching his servants, that, if they were clean from women, they should eat of the Shew Bread, which otherwise they should no way be suffered to take, except David would first say that they were clean from women. Then, moreover, the man who hath been washed with water after the carnal knowledge of his wife may also receive the mystery of the holy Communion, when according to the judgment before laid down he may come also to the church.</p></q>
</p><p>IX. Question of Augustine. <q> Whether after the illusion which is wont to befall unto a man in his dream, either anyone may receive the body of the Lord or, if he be priest, celebrate the holy mysteries?</q>
<pb id="p.149"/>
</p><p>Gregory answereth. <q><p>The Testament of the old Law indeed, as we have said already under a former head, saith him to be defiled, and suffereth him not to enter the church before evening, and not but first bathed. Which thing yet the spiritual people otherwise understanding, shall take it in like sense as we have above declared: for he is deluded as it were by dream, which being tempted with uncleanness is defiled with true imaginations in his thoughts: but he is to be washed with water that so he may cleanse with tears the faults of his thoughts: and except the fire of temptation go out, let him take himself guilty, as it were, unto the evening. But there is in this same manner of illusion a difference very much to be had, for a man must narrowly examine of what cause this thing cometh into his mind when he is asleep: for sometimes it cometh of surfeit, sometimes of superfluity or weakness of nature, sometimes of thought.
</p><p>It is true that when it cometh of superfluity or infirmity of nature, this illusion is nothing to be feared; for the mind is more to be pitied that it hath unwittingly suffered, than that it hath anything committed. When, however, the man is carried away through inordinate gluttonous desire in diet, whereby the vessels of the humours are overburdened, the mind thereby is not clear of fault, yet it is not guilty of so great fault that the man thereby is to be withholden either from receiving the holy mystery, either from celebrating the solemnity of mass: when it may happen that either holy-day requireth, either of necessity the party is forced to show the mystery, for that there is no other priest to be gotten in his place. For if there
<pb id="p.151"/>
be other at hand able to fulfil the ministry, yet the illusion coming only of surfeit is no sufficient cause to make a man forbear the receipt of the holy mystery; yet from the sacrifice of the holy mystery he ought (as I think) meekly forbear; though not from receiving, except the mind in sleep be troubled with foul phantasies. For there be some to whom the illusion cometh for the most part in such manner that their mind, even in his place in the sleeping body, is not defiled with foul phantasies. Wherein one thing is clearly there shewn, to wit, that the mind of itself is guilty, and (when the person, albeit with the body asleep, doth not remember that he hath seen anything, yet, with the body awake, remembereth that he hath offended in gluttonous feeding) is not clear notwithstanding by his own judgment. But if indeed the illusion in sleep riseth of foul thoughts which he had waking, his offence is manifest to the mind: for he doth see out of what root that pollution did spring, for the evil that he wittingly thought upon, this unwittingly he suffered.
</p><p>But we must consider whether the selfsame thought befell of suggestion or delight or, which is weightier, by sinful consent. For in three ways all manner of sin is fulfilled, to wit, suggestion, delight, consent. For suggestion is by the devil, delight by the flesh, consent by the spirit: for that also the serpent was prompter to the first fault. Eve, as it were the flesh, took delight therein, but Adam, as it were the spirit, consented: and herein is requisite great discretion, that the mind as judge over himself should discern betwixt suggestion and delight, betwixt delight and consent. For when the evil spirit doth raise the motion unto sin in the
<pb id="p.153"/>
mind, if there shall follow no delight in sin, there is no sin at. all committed: but when the flesh beginneth to take delight therein, then sin beginneth to spring: if, moreover, advisedly he doth also agree thereunto, then sin is found to be perfected.
</p><p>So then in suggestion is the beginning, in delight comes the feeding, in consent the finishing of sin. And it oft chanceth that the evil that the wicked spirit soweth in the thought, the flesh draweth unto delight, and yet the soul doth not agree to the same delight. And though the flesh can feel no delight without the mind, yet the mind himself striving against the pleasures of the flesh is in a measure against his will bound in the pleasure of the flesh, in such sort that with reason he doth gainsay it, lest he should agree unto it; and yet is bound with delight, but so that he much lamenteth his band. Whereupon that principal champion of the heavenly army, Saint Paul, bewaileth himself, saying,1' I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.' Now if he was in captivity, least of all did he fight; but yet too he did fight: wherefore he was both in captivity and therefore strove with the law of his mind, against the which the law, which is in our members, did fight. But if he fought, he was not in captivity. Lo! then man, that I may so speak, is in captivity and free; free through righteousness which he loveth, in captivity through delight which he beareth against his will.</p></q>

<note type="margin">HEATHEN TEMPLES</note>
</p><p>Almighty God shall bring you unto our most reverend brother Augustine, bishop, tell him what I have long time devised with myself of the cause of the. English: that is, to wit, that the temples, of the idols in the said country ought not to be. broken; but the idols alone which be in them; that holy water be made and sprinkled about the same temples, altars builded, relics placed: for if the said temples be well built, it is needful that they be altered from the worshipping of devils into the service of the true God; that whiles the people doth not see these their said temples spoilt, they may forsake their error of heart and be moved with more readiness to haunt their wonted place to the knowledge and honour of the true God. And for that they are wont to kill many oxen in sacrifice to the devils, some solemnity shall be granted also by way of exchange in this matter: as that in the dedication days or birthdays of holy martyrs of whom the relics be there placed, they make them bowers of branches of trees about the said churches which have been changed from temples, and hold solemn feast together after a religious sort; and that they no more sacrifice animals to the devil but kill them to the refreshing of themselves to the praise of God, and render thanks to the Giver of all things for their abundance: that whiles some outward comforts are reserved unto them, they may be brought the more readily to agree to accept the inward comforts. For it is doubtless impossible to cut off all abuses at once from rough hearts, seeing that he too that laboureth to climb up into a high place, goeth upward by steps and paces but not by leaps. So unto the children of Israel, being in Egypt, the Lord did indeed make Himself

known; but yet he retained unto them the use of the sacrifices (which they were wont to offer to the devil) in His own worship, by requiring them to slay the animals in sacrifice to Him; in order that with change of heart they should lose one thing in the sacrifice but preserve another: that is, that the beasts they offered before they should now offer still, but yet in slaying them unto the true God and not unto idols they should not be the same sacrifices as they were before. These then be the things which I think it expedient for your love to declare unto our said brother, to the intent that he being there at this present may consider with himself how each thing is to be disposed. God keep you in safety, my dearly beloved son.

</p><p>How he exhorted Augustine by a letter that he should not glory in himself of his miracles.
</p><p>About this time he sent also to Augustine an epistle touching such miracles as he had known to be done by the said Augustine, in the which epistle he exhorteth him that he should not come into danger of pride of mind for the number of them, in these words:
</p><p><q> I know, my dear brother, that it pleaseth Almighty God to shew by thy love great miracles among the people whom He hath willed to be chosen: whereupon it is needful that of the same
<pb id="p.167"/>
heavenly gift both thou joyest with fear and fearest with joy. Thou hast to joy, namely, for that by means of outward miracles the souls of the English are won to inward grace: but thou hast to fear, lest, in the midst of the miracles which be done, thy weak heart be lifted up in exaltation of thyself, falling as far inwardly by vainglory as thou art outwardly raised to honour. For we must remember that the disciples returning with joy from their preaching, when they said unto their heavenly Master:1 'Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name; ' forthwith heard the words: ' In this rejoice not, but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.' For they had fastened their mind upon a private and temporal joy, when they joyed of their miracles; but they are called back from private joy unto common, and from temporal to eternal, to whom it is said: ' In this rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.' For not all the chosen of God doth miracles; but yet all their names are recorded in heaven. For why? They which be the disciples of the truth ought to joy in nothing, but only in that good thing which they have in common with all, and whereof they have joy without end. This therefore remaineth, dear beloved brother, that of the things which by the power of God thou workest outwardly, thou exactly ever discuss with thyself inwardly, and accurately understand both thyself who thou art, and what plenty of grace there is in that same country for whose sake (to the intent it might be the rather converted) thou hast received the gift of working miracles. And if thou remember that thou hast at any time either by word or deed offended
<pb id="p.169"/>
our Creator, call that ever back to thy remembrance, that the oft thinking upon thy guilt may press down the mounting pride of thy heart. And whatsoever grace thou either hast received or shalt receive to work miracles, think that they have been granted not unto thee but unto them for whose salvation they have been bestowed upon thee.</q>

</p><p>How he sent a letter and presents to the Icing Ethelbert.
</p><p>The said blessed pope Gregory at the selfsame time also sent unto king Ethelbert a letter as well as a number of gifts withal of divers sorts: being much occupied also to glorify the king with temporal honours, which through his diligent travail he rejoiced was grown to knowledge of the glory of heaven. Now the copy of the said letter is this:
<quote><p>Unto the right honourable and his most worthy son, Ethelbert, King of the English, Gregory bishop.
</p><p>God Almighty for this cause doth call all that are good to the governance of His people, that by their hands He may distribute the gifts of His goodness unto all such over whom they have the governance. Which thing we know to have been done among the nation of the English over whom your glory is therefore set to rule, that by the gifts employed upon you, the blessings from on high might be given to all such as are under your dominion. And therefore, O noble son, labour diligently to keep the grace which you have received from God. seek with speed to set forth the faith of Christ to
<pb id="p.171"/>
the people subject unto you, increase the zeal of your righteousness in their conversion, set yourself against the worshipping of idols, overthrow the buildings of their temples,1 edify the manners of your subjects by the great purity of your life, with words of exhortation, fear, fair speech, correction and shewing example of well-doing: that you may find Him to be your rewarder in heaven, whose knowledge and name you make to be enlarged upon the earth. For He will Himself also make your name the more famous unto posterity, whose honour you seek and maintain among the nations.
</p><p>For so Constantine, being sometimes a most religious emperor, called the Roman commonwealth from the corrupt worshipping of idols and brought it with himself under the obeisance of the Almighty God our Lord Jesus Christ, turning to Him with his whole mind together with them that were subject to his rule. Whereby it was brought to pass that his name was of higher renown than any of the princes that went before him, and so much in glory excelled his ancestors, how much also he passed them in well-doing. Wherefore let your highness also hasten now to spread among the kings and countries subject to your dominion the knowledge of one God, the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, to the intent thereby you may pass in honourable fame the ancient kings of your nation, and how much the more you wipe out also the sins of other among your subjects, you may have also so much the less fear of your own sins before the dreadful bench of Almighty God's justice.
</p><p>Our most reverend brother Augustine, bishop, being brought up in the rule of a monastery, filled
<pb id="p.173"/>
with the knowledge of Holy Scripture, and endued by the grace of God with good works, whatsoever he adviseth you to do, gladly hear it, devoutly do it, diligently remember it: for if you hear him in that he speaketh unto you in the Almighty Lord's behalf, the same Almighty God the sooner heareth him entreating for you. For if (as God forbid) you forbear to give heed to his words, when can Almighty God hear him in your behalf, whom you despise to hear in God's behalf? Wherefore with all your heart join yourself closely with him in zealousness of faith, and assist his endeavour with the excellency that God hath given you, that He may Himself make you partaker of His kingdom Whose faith you in your kingdom cause to be received and observed.
</p><p>Furthermore, we will your highness to know that (according as we are taught in the Holy Scriptures by the words of the Almighty Lord) the end of the present world now draweth onward, and the kingdom of the saints shall follow, which can never have an end. And the same end of the world approaching, many things are at hand which have not been heard of before: that is, to wit, changes of the air, terrible sights from the heaven, tempests contrary to the ordering of seasons, wars, famines, pestilences, earthquakes in divers places; all which yet shall not fall in our days, but all shall follow close after our days. Wherefore if you know any of these to be in your land, let not your mind in any way be dismayed therewith; for therefore are these signs of the end of the world sent before the time, to the intent we should the more diligently tender the health of our souls, live in expectation
<pb id="p.175"/>
of the hour of death and be found ready prepared in good works for the coming of our Judge. Thus much have I now said in few words, right honourable son, intending also to speak more at large as I shall hear the Christian faith to be enlarged in your kingdom, and being so much the more ready to speak, how much the more manifold comfort I shall conceive by the conversions of your country when it is completed.
</p><p>I have sent you, moreover, small presents 1 which shall not seem small unto you, if you shall accept them as hallowed with the blessing of the blessed apostle Peter. And so Almighty God make perfect in you His grace according as He hath begun, and prolong your life, both here through the course of many years, and after long time receive you in the assembly of the heavenly country. The grace from on high keep your highness in safety, my lord son!

to have been there built of old by the work of Romans which believed, and did dedicate it in the name of the Holy Saviour God and our Lord Jesus Christ, and there made a house for him and all his successors.1 And not far from the city itself eastward he builded also a monastery 2 in the which Ethelbert through his advice builded from the foundations a church in the honour of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul, and enriched it with sundry gifts, in which both the body of Augustine himself and of all the bishops of Canterbury as well as also of the kings of Kent might be interred. Which church yet not Augustine himself, but Laurentius his successor did consecrate. Moreover, the first abbot of the same monastery was one Peter, a priest, which being sent legate unto Gaul was drowned in a creek of the sea called Amfleat,3 and buried after a homely manner of the inhabitants of the same place. But Almighty God intending to have it known how worthy a man he was, made that every night there appeared a light from heaven upon the place where he lay buried, until the neighbours about, which saw the light, gathering thereby that he was some holy man that was buried there, and searching out what and from whence he was, removed his body from thence, and buried it in the church 4 in the town of Boulogne according to the honour convenient for so worthy a person.

</p><p>How Ethelfrith king of the Northumbers did crash the tribes of the Scots in battle and drove them from the boundaries of the English.
</p><p>About this time Ethelfrith. a man very valiant and much desirous of renown, was king of Northumberland, one that more wasted the people of the Britons than any of the princes of the English; so that it seemed he might be compared unto Saul, sometimes king of the Israelite people, save only that he was ignorant of God's religion. For none of all the colonels,1 none of all the kings did conquer more of the land of the Britons (either driving the natives clean out of the country or subduing them, or making them tributary or planting the Angles in their places) than did this Ethelfrith.

</p><p>Of the death of the blessed pope Gregory.
</p><p>At this time, that is to say, in the 605th year of the Lord's incarnation, the blessed pope Gregory, after he had most gloriously governed the see of the Roman and apostolic Church 13 years, 6 months and 10 days,1 departed this life and was translated to the eternal see in the Kingdom of Heaven. Of whom it becometh us in this our Ecelesiastieal History to speak more largely, because by his diligence he converted our nation, that is the English, from the power of Satan to the faith of Christ, whom we may well and must call our apostle. For as soon as he was high bishop over the whole world and was made governor to the Churches long since converted to the belief of the truth, he made our nation a Church of Christ, which had been ever till that time the bondslave of idols, so that we may lawfully pronounce of him that saying of the apostle: 2 that if he be not an apostle to others, yet is he so to us; for the seal of his apostleship are we in the Lord.
</p><p>Now Gregory was a Roman born, his father's name Gordian, his lineage from far back not only noble but also religious. In fact Felix,3 a man of great glory in Christ and in the Church, sometime bishop of that same see apostolic was his ancestor in past generations.4 But the nobility of religion
<pb id="p.187"/>
he himself kept and maintained with no less virtuous devotion than his parents and kinsmen had done before him. That nobility, however, which he seemed to have before the world, by the gift of God's grace he turned altogether to the purchasing of the glory of heavenly honour. For changing suddenly his secular habit he went into a monastery, where he began to live in such grace of perfection, that unto his mind (as often after he was wont to witness with weeping tears) all transitory things were in the lower place, that he was lifted above all things that are subject unto change, that he was wont to think of nothing but heavenly things, that, even though clogged with the body, he already by contemplation did pass the very barriers of the flesh, and that he loved death also (which to almost all men is a punishment) as being certes an entrance of life to him and reward of his labour. Now these things he was himself wont to say of himself, not craking of his increase in virtues but rather lamenting the failing of them, in which he thought himself to have fallen by reason of his pastoral charge. In short, talking on a time secretly with Peter, his deacon, when he had recounted the old gifts of his mind, straightway he added sorrowfully: <q> But now by means of my pastoral charge my mind is encombered with the affairs of the men of this world, and after so beautiful a vision of its peace, it is now defiled with the dust of earthly business. And when out of indulgence to many it is dispersed upon outward matters, then, even when desiring inward thoughts, it returneth thereunto beyond doubt the weaker. Therefore I weigh with myself what I do now endure, 1 weigh with myself what I have forgone: and 
<pb id="p.189"/>
while I behold what I have lost, this that I carry waxeth more grievous.</q>
</p><p>Thus it was this holy man spake, of a great and passing humility: but we should believe that he lost none of his monastical perfection by reason of his pastoral charge, nay rather that he gained greater advantage from the labour of the conversion of many than he had had with the private peace of his former conversation: chiefly because, even in the discharge of his priestly office, he was careful to order his house like a monastery; and when first he was taken out of the monastery and ordained to the ministry of the altar, being afterwards sent as legate 1 from the see apostolic, to Constantinople he for all that, in the earthly prince's palace, lived so that he never gave up his purpose of heavenly life. For he began to have with him certain brethren of his monastery (which for the sake of brotherly love followed him to the imperial city) for the better keeping of the monastic observance; namely, that alway by their example (for so he writeth) he might be fastened as with the cable of an anchor to the peaceful shore of prayer, whensoever he were tossed by the restless rushing of worldly cares, and might strengthen his mind by the daily communing of diligent reading with them, whensoever it should be shaken with worldly affairs. By these men's company therefore he was not only defended from the assaults of earthly troubles, but also more and more stirred up to the exercises of heavenly life.
</p><p>For they exhorted him that he would discuss and expound by allegorical interpretation the book of blessed Job, which was enwrapped with great obscurities; neither could he deny them his pains,
<pb id="p.191"/>
which of brotherly love laid upon him a labour to serve for the profit of many. But he hath marvellously taught in 35 books of exposition how the same book is to be understanded according to the letter, in what sort it may be referred to Christ and the sacraments of the Church, and in what sense it may be applied to every particular faithful man. And this work, namely, he began to write while he was legate in the imperial city, but finished it when he had now become bishop of Rome. And when he was still in office in the imperial city, he suppressed a new heresy concerning the state of our resurrection (which then there arose) in the very beginning of its rising, with the aid of the grace of catholic truth. For Eutychius, bishop of the said city, began to teach the doctrine that our body in that glory of the resurrection should be so subtle as is neither the wind nor the air, so that it should not be able to be felt or touched; which when Gregory heard he proved this teaching to be quite contrary to the orthodox faith by the reasoning of truth and also by the example of the Lord's resurrection. For the Catholic faith believeth that our body, being exalted in that glory of immortality, shall indeed be subtle by the effect of spiritual power, but able to be felt and touched by reason of our true nature: according to the example of the Lord's body of which, now risen from the dead, Himself saith to his disciples:X <q>Touch ye and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</q> In the assertion of this faith the venerable father Gregory did labour so earnestly against the upstart heresy in its beginning, and crushed it with such diligence (being helped thereto also by the most religious emperor Tiberius Constantine), that from
<pb id="p.193"/>
theneeforth no man was found which durst revive it again.
</p><p>He made also another excellent book which is called the Pastoral; wherein he declareth plainly what manner of men should be chosen to rule the Church, how the rulers thereof ought themselves to live, with what discretion they should instruct each several person of their hearers, and with how great consideration they should daily weigh their own weakness. Moreover too he wrote homilies to the number of 40 upon the Gospel, which he hath divided by equal share into two volumes. He made also four books of Dialogues in which, at the request of his deacon Peter, he hath gathered the virtuous deeds of holy men which himself could either know in Italy or hear of for their fame, to the example of good life for posterity: that, like as in his books of expositions he hath thoroughly taught in what virtues a man must labour, so also by describing of holy men's miracles he might shew what the excellency of the same virtues is. Furthermore, because the first and last parts of Ezekiel the prophet seemed somewhat obscure, he hath fully shewed by 22 homilies how much light is within them. We need not speak of his small book of Answers 1 which he wrote back to the questions of holy Augustine, the first bishop of the English people, as also we have declared before, placing the whole book itself in this history; neither too of the small circular letter 2 which with the bishops of Italy he hath written most profitably concerning the necessary affairs of the Church, nor of his familiar letters sent unto divers men. And this is the more marvellous that he was able to write so many and such great volumes,3 being
<pb id="p.195"/>
(to speak in his own words) almost in all his youth tortured with frequent pains in his bowels, at all hours and instants wearied with the weakness of his stomach, and his breathing made difficult by low fevers which yet never left him. But in these griefs of his, by counting carefully with himself that the Scripture saith,1 <q>Every son which is received, is scourged,</q> the harder he was kept down by the present adversities, the more certainly did the assurance of everlasting comfort revive him.
</p><p>Let thus much be said in the praise of his excellent wit which could not, with so great suffering of the body, be anything quenched. For whereas other bishops of Rome bestowed their labour in building of churches and decking the same with gold and silver, this man gave himself altogether to the profit of souls. Whatsoever he had in possession, he was careful to distribute diligently and give to poor men, that his righteousness might remain world without end and his horn be exalted in glory; so that he might truly utter that saying of blessed Job:2 <q>When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me it gave witness to me, because I had delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless child that had none to help him. The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me, and the heart of the widow did I comfort. I have put on righteousness and it clothed me as with a garment and precious crown in my judgment. I have been an eye to the blind and a foot to the lame. I was a father of poor men, and the cause which I knew not I diligently searched out. I did break in pieces the jaws of the unjust man, and out of his teeth did I pluck the prey.</q> And a little after:3 <q>If I have
<pb id="p.197"/>
denied to poor men their desire, and have made the eyes of the widow look long for her help. If I have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless child hath not eaten thereof with me. For from mine infancy mercy hath grown with me and out of my mother's womb it came forth with me.</q>
</p><p>To the work of this Gregory's piety and righteousness this pertaineth also, that he hath made our nation, by preachers which he sent hither, to be partakers of eternal liberty, westing us from the teeth of our old enemy: and rejoicing with our faith and salvation, and commending the same with worthy praise, he saith thus in his exposition of blessed Job: <q> Behold the tongue of Britain, which once knew nothing but to gnash the teeth rudely, hath long since begun to sing the Hebrew Alleluia in giving praise to God. Behold the ocean sea once swelling high, now made calm, obeyeth to the feet of holy men; and the furious floods thereof which earthly princes with force could never fray, the same for fear of God the lips of priests doth bind with bare words; and though that sea had no fear at all of the unbelieving hosts of fighting men, yet doth it now tremble at the tongues of humble believers. For whereas by receiving of heavenly words and the manifest shewing forth of miracles beside, the excellency of the knowledge of God is poured into it, by the terror of that same divine nature it is so bridled that now it feareth to act frowardly and most earnestly desireth to come to the grace of eternity.</q> By which words the blessed Gregory declareth this also, that holy Augustine and his company brought the English nation to the knowledge of truth, not by preaching to them of words only but also by shewing them heavenly signs.
<pb id="p.199"/>
</p><p>Amongst his other doings the blessed pope Gregory caused that in the churches of the holy apostles Peter and Paul masses should be said over their bodies. Moreover too in the very celebration of these masses he added three petitions full of the highest perfection: <q> And dispose our days in thy peace, and command us to be taken from eternal damnation, and to be numbered in the flock of thine elect.</q>
</p><p>Now he governed the Church in the days of the emperors Maurice and Focas. But in the second year of the said Focas' empire, departing out of this life he passed to the true life which is in heaven. His body was buried in deed in the church of the blessed apostle Peter before the vestry, the 12th day of March, with the which same body he shall rise again hereafter in glory with the other pastors of the holy Church: and on the tomb which he had for himself was written such an epitaph as followeth:
<pb id="p.201"/>
</p><p>Nor must we here with silence pass over the report which the tradition of our elders hath brought unto our knowledge concerning the blessed Gregory: to wit, upon what occasion he was moved to bestow such diligent labour for the salvation of our people. Men say that on a certain day, when many merchants newly arriving in Rome had brought into the marketplace divers wares to be sold, and many had flocked hither to buy, amongst others Gregory too came thither, and amongst other things he saw boys set out to be sold, of white skin and comely countenance and hair also of excellent beauty. And beholding them a while he demanded, as they say, out of what region or land they had been brought. And it was answered that they came from the isle of Britain, where such was the appearance of the inhabitants. Again he asked whether the people of that same island were Christian men or were yet intangled in the paynims' errors. And the answer was made that they were paynims. Then this good man, heavily sighing from the bottom of his heart: <q> Alas!</q> quoth he, <q> it is a piteous ease, that the author of darkness possesseth such bright beautied people and that men of such a gracious outward shew do bear a mind void of inward grace.</q> Again therefore he enquired what was the name of that people. Answer was given that they were called Angles. Whereon he said: <q> Well are they so called, for they have too an angel's face, and it is meet such men were inheritors with the angels in heaven. What is the name of the particular province from which those boys of yours were brought?</q> The merchants answered that the people of that same province were called Deirans. <q>Marry!</q> quoth he, <q>well are they
<pb id="p.203"/>
called Deirans,1 being plucked from the ire of God and called to the mercy of Christ. How is the king of that province called?</q> It was answered that his name was Aella, 2 Whereupon Gregory playing upon the name saith: <q> Alleluia! the praise of God the Creator must be sounded in those parts.</q> And coming to the bishop of the Roman and apostolic see (for himself was not yet chosen bishop thereof), he_besought him that he would send to the English people in Britain some ministers of the weird, by whom they might be converted unto Christ; saying that he himself was ready to carry out this work with the help of the Lord, yet only if it should please the pope apostolic to permit of the same. And while he was not able to accomplish this (for though the bishop would have granted him that he had asked, yet the burghers of Rome could not have suffered him to depart so far from the city), afterward, as soon as himself_ entered upon the office of bishop, he brought to pass the work he had before so long desired: sending indeed other preachers, but himself helping to make their preaching fruitful by_his exhortations and prayers. This much according to the report which we have heard from days of old we have thought fitting to put in the History of our Church.

</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="2"><p>
</p><p>How Augustine exhorted the bishops of the Britons in behalf of Catholic peace, with a heavenly miracle done before them; and what vengeance fell upon them after for dispising his words.
</p><p>MEANWHILE 1 Augustine by the aid and help of king Ethelbert called together the bishops and doctors of the province of the Britons nearest to him to commune with them in a place which till this date is called in the English tongue Augustine's ac, that is, Augustine's oak, being in the borders of the Hwiccas 2 and West Saxons; and began with brotherly admonition to persuade them to be at Catholic peace with him, and to undertake the common labour of preaching the Gospel to the nations for the Lord's sake. For they kept not the Easter Sunday in due time, but from the 14th to the 20th moon;3 which count is concluded in the compass of 84 years. They used, moreover, many other things contrary to the unity of the Church. And when after long discussion these men neither for prayers nor exhortations, neither for rebukes of Augustine and his company had been willing to give their assent to him, but rather preferred their own traditions before all other Churches which throughout the whole world agreed together in Christ, then the holy father Augustine made an end of so long and
<pb id="p.207"/>
troublesome strife by speaking in this wise: <q> Let us pray unto God, which doth make men to dwell all of one mind in their Father's house,1 that he will vouchsafe to signify unto us by heavenly signs, which tradition is to be followed and by what ways we must speedily walk to the entrance of His kingdom. Let there be brought here some sick body, and by whose prayers he shall be healed, let his faith and working be deemed hallowed of God and to be followed of us all.</q> To this, when his adversaries granted, though unwillingly, there was presented a certain man of English birth which had lost the sight of his eyes; who being offered to the British priests, when by their ministry he was not holpen nor could be cured, at length Augustine, compelled by just necessity, fell on his knees to the Father of our Lord Jesu Christ, beseeching him that he would restore to the blind man the sight which he had lost, and that by the bodily lighting of one man he would enkindle the grace of spiritual light in the hearts of many faithful. And forthwith the blind man's eyes were lightened, and Augustine is declared by all as a true herald of heavenly light. Then these Britons confessed indeed that they understood that to be the true way of righteousness, which Augustine preached unto them: but yet they said they could not give up their old customs without the consent and leave of their own people. They desired therefore that they might have a second synod of a greater multitude.
</p><p>Which when it was appointed to be so, there came by report 7 British bishops and a greater number of learned men, specially out of their most notable monastery which is called in the English tongue Bancornaburg, 2 where at that time it is said Dinoot
<pb id="p.209"/>
was abbot. These men being now ready to go to the said meeting, came first to a certain holy and wise man which used to live amongst them an anchorite's life, and asked his counsel whether they ought at Augustine's preaching to leave their traditions or no. Who answered them: <q> If he be a man of God, follow him!</q> <q>And how can we prove this?</q> said they. The anchorite answered: <q> Our Lord saith, ' Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly of heart.'1 If therefore this Augustine be meek and lowly of heart, it is believable that himself too beareth the yoke of Christ and offereth you the same to bear: but if he be curst 2 and proud, it is certain that he is not of God, neither must we attend to his words.</q> Then they said again: <q> And how have we power to discern this?</q> <q>Marry,</q> quoth he, <q>provide ye that he with his company come first to the place of the synod, and if, when ye approach near, he ariseth courteously to you, then, knowing that he is the servant of Christ, hear ye him obediently! but if he despise you nor will vouchsafe to rise at your presence, though ye are more in number, let him likewise be despised by you!</q>
</p><p>As the anchorite bade them, so did they. And it happened that when they came thither Augustine was already there and sat in his chair, which when they saw, straightways waxing wroth, they noted him of pride and endeavoured to gainsay all that he said. Now he said that <q>in many points ye do contrary to our custom, or rather to the custom of the universal Church: yet notwithstanding, if ye will in these three things obey unto me, that is, to celebrate Easter in due time; to accomplish the ministry of
<pb id="p.211"/>
baptism, by which we are born again to God, according to the manner of the holy Roman and apostolic Church;1 and to preach along with us the word of the Lord to the English nation; all the other things that ye do, though they be contrary to our customs, we shall be content to bear with.</q> But they answered that they would do none of the things requested, neither would count him for archbishop: saying with themselves: <q> Nay, if he would not so much as rise to us, how much the more, if we now begin to subject ourselves to him, will he hereafter despise us and set us at nought!</q>
</p><p>To whom the man of God, Augustine, is said to have threatfully prophesied, that, if they would not have peace with brethren, they should have war from enemies; and if they would not preach to the English nation the way of life, they should through their hands suffer the vengeance of death. Which thing in all points was brought so to pass, as he had foresaid, by the working of God's judgment.
</p><p>For it happened afterwards that the very same king of the English of whom we have spoken, the mighty Ethelfrith, gathering a large army, made at the City of Legions 2 (which the English nation call Legacaestir, but the Britons better Carlegion) a very great slaughter of this heretical 3 people. And being now ready to give battle, when he spied their priests (which had come together to pray to God for the soldiers fighting in the war) to stand apart from the rest in a safer place,he demanded what these men were and to what end they had collected there. Now the most part of these priests were of the monastery of Bangor, where there is said to have been so great a number of monks, that this monastery being
<pb id="p.213"/>
divided into 7 companies, with each company his several assigned ruler, none of these companies had less than 300 persons, who did all ever live by the labour of their own hands. A great number therefore of them, after three days' fasting, had come with others to the aforesaid army to pray for the soldiers, having by them a defender named Brocmail who should keep them from the swords of the barbarians while they thus earnestly bent to their prayers. And when king Ethelfrith had understood the cause of their coming thither, he said: <q>Then if these men cry and call upon their God against us, truly though they themselves have no armour, yet they fight against us, who pursue us with curses to bring evil upon us.</q> Accordingly he commanded his soldiers to assault these men first, and so he vanquished after the other parts of this detestable host, but yet not without a great loss of his own men. It is reported that there were slain in that battle, of them which had come to pray, about 1200 men, and that only 50 escaped by flight. Brocmail at the first coming of the enemy turned his back with his men, and whom he ought to have defended, these he left without defence and naked to the strokes of the sword. And so in this manner was fulfilled the prophecy of the holy bishop Augustine (though he himself long before had been raised to the heavenly realms), so that these heretical men learnt by the vengeance also of temporal death, that they had despised the counsels of eternal salvation offered to them.

</p><p>How the same Augustine made Mellitus and Justus bishops; and of his death.
</p><p>In the 604th year of the incarnation of our Lord, Augustine archbishop of the Britains ordained two bishops to wit Mellitus and Justus: the one, that is Mellitus, to preach to the province of the East Saxons, which are separated from Kent with the river Thames and are fast joined to the East Sea, whose chief city is London, of situation set upon the bank of the said flood, and itself a mart of many people arriving thither by land and sea: in the which country at that time reigned Sabert, Ethelbert's nephew by his sister Ricula, although set under the dominion of the same Ethelbert who was (as has been said before) lord over all the English races as far as the boundary of the flood Humber. Now when this province also by the preaching of Mellitus received the word of truth, king Ethelbert builded in the city of London the church of the apostle St. Paul, where both Mellitus himself and his successors should have their episcopal see: The other, which was Justus, Augustine ordained bishop in Kent itself in the city of Rochester which is called Hrofaescaestrae of the English nation, from the name of Hrof that was sometime principal man thereof. Now it is in distance from Canterbury town about 24 miles westward, in the which city king Ethelbert, builded the church of the blessed apostle Andrew, and also gave many gifts to the bishops of both these churches, like as he also gave to the bishops of Canterbury: moreover, he added territories and
<pb id="p.217"/>
possessions thereto for the better maintaining of them that lived with these bishops.
</p><p>After this the beloved man of God, father Augustine, died, and his body was laid by the church of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul (of which church we have made mention before), without the door thereof, because it was not yet finished nor dedicated. But as soon as the church was dedicated, his body was brought in and decently buried in the north chapel of the church: where also were interred the bodies of all the archbishops following, except two only, that is Theodore and Bertwald, whose bodies were laid in the church itself, because the said chapel could receive no more. This chapel hath almost in the middle of it an altar dedicated in the honour of the blessed pope Gregory, at the which altar every Saturday masses 1 in their memory are solemnly celebrated by the priest of that place. Moreover, in the tomb of the same Augustine was written such an epitaph as followeth:
</p><p><q> Here lieth in rest the lord Augustine,
first archbishop of Canterbury, who aforetime sent hither of the blessed Gregory, bishop 0f the city of Rome, and strengthened of God by working of miracles, won over Ethelbert the king and his people from the worship of idols to the faith of Christ, and so fulfilling in peace the days of his office he died the 26th of May 2 in the reign of the same king.</q>

<div2 type="chapter" n="4"><p>
</p><p>How Laurence with his fellow bishops warned the Scots to follow the unity of the holy Church, specially in keeping Easter, and how Mellitus came to Rome.
</p><p>The successor to Augustine in the bishopric was Laurence, whom Augustine himself, while he yet lived, had thereunto ordained, lest that after he was dead the state of the Church as yet so rude might begin to totter, if it should have lacked a pastor even for an hour. Wherein too he followed the example of the first pastor of the Church, that is of the most blessed prince of the apostles, Peter, who when he had laid at Rome the foundation of Christ's Church, is said to have consecrated Clement to be his helper in preaching the Gospel, as well as to be his successor. Laurence having now obtained the rank of archbishop gave heed most diligently to enlarge the foundations of the Church, which he saw had been well and strongly laid, and to lift up the building to reach the due highness, both by often words of holy exhortation and continual examples of godly working. In short he wrought needfully not only for the new Church which was now gathered of the English, but also for the Church of the old inhabitants of Britain and of the Scots too who harboured in Ireland, the next isle to Britain, on the which folk he laboured to bestow the care of a pastor. For as soon as he knew the life and profession of the Scots in their forenamed country to be scarce ecclesiastical in many points (like as was the Britons' at that time in Britain itself), specially because they celebrated not the solemnity of Easter in due time, but (as we have
<pb id="p.221"/>
before shewed) thought that they must observe the day of our Lord's resurrection from the 14th moon to the 20th; he, I say, with his fellow bishops wrote unto them an exhorting epistle, beseeching and warning them to hold fast the unity of peace and catholic observation with that Church of Christ which was spread over all the whole world; of which epistle namely the beginning is as follows:
</p><p><q> To our dearest brethren the bishops and abbots throughout all Scotland,1 Laurence, Mellitus and Justus bishops, servants of the servants of God. Whenas the see apostolic (according to the accustomed manner thereof as it doth in all parts of the world) sent us to preach to paynim people in these western parts, and so it happened us to enter into this isle which is called Britain; where thinking, before we had experience, that men walked according to the customed way of the universal Church, we honoured with great reverence of holiness as well the Britons as the Scots; but having experience of the Britons we thought the Scots better. Marry now, we have learnt by bishop Dagan 2 coming to this before-mentioned island, and by the coming of Columban,3 abbot in France, that the Scots do nothing differ from the Britons in their conversation. For bishop Dagan coming to us would not only not eat with us, but not so much as take his meat in the same house where we were eating.</q> 4 The same Laurence with his fellow bishops sent also letters meet for his degree to the priests of the Britons wherein he endeavoured to strengthen them in catholic
<pb id="p.223"/>
unity. But how much he hath availed by so doing, these present days do still declare.1
</p><p>About this time came Mellitus, bishop of London, to Rome, there to counsel with the apostolic pope Boniface 2 for necessary causes of the English Church. And whenas the same most reverend pope called a synod of the bishops of Italy to appoint some order as concerning the life of monks and their quiet state, Mellitus also himself sat amongst them the 8th year of the reign of the emperor Focas, the 13th indiction, and the 27th day of February:3 that what things so ever were decreed according to rule, he also by subscribing thereunto might confirm them with his authority, and returning to Britain might bring them with him to the English churches to be committed to them and observed, as also beside epistles which the same bishop of Rome wrote and sent to the archbishop Laurence beloved of God and all the clergy, and likewise also to king Ethelbert and the English nation. This is the Boniface which was the 4th bishop of Rome after blessed Gregory, who by earnest suit obtained of the emperor Focas a temple at Rome to be granted to the Church of Christ, which temple of ancient time was called Pantheon, as it were to stand for all the gods: out of which temple this Boniface easting forth all filthiness made a church therein in the honour of the holy mother of God and all the martyrs of Christ beside; that the army of devils being shut out thence, the army of martyrs might have there memorial.

<div2 type="chapter" n="5"><p>
</p><p>How when the kings Ethelbert and Sabert were dead, their successors brought up again idolatry, whereupon Mellitus and Justus departed out of Britain.
</p><p>In the 616th year of the incarnation of our Lord (which was the 21st after that Augustine and his company were sent to the English nation to preach 1), Ethelbert king of Kent, after his temporal reign which he had kept most gloriously the space of 56 years, entered into the eternal bliss of the kingdom of heaver: who was in deed the third king of the English nation, and had lordship over all their southern provinces which are separated from the northern by the flood Humber and the borders adjoining thereto; but he was the first of all the kings that ascended into the kingdom of heaven. For the first that had lordship after this sort 2 was Aella king of the South Saxons; the second Caelin king of the West Saxons, who was called in their own tongue Ceawlin; the third, as I have said, was Ethelbert king of the Kentishmen; the fourth was Redwald king of the East English, who also, while Ethelbert yet lived, was gaining the leadership for the same his own nation; the fifth was Edwin king of the Northumbrian nation, that is, king of those that dwell about the north part of the flood Humber, who, being a prince of greater power than all other that inhabited Britain, was head over both the English and the Britons too, except the people of Kent; and added moreover to the English lordship the Mevanian islands 3 of the Britons, which lie
<pb id="p.227"/>
betwixt Ireland and Britain; the sixth was Oswald, himself also king of the Northumbrians, a most Christian prince, whose kingdom was within the same boundaries; the seventh was Oswy his brother, who governed the realm within almost equal bounds for a certain time, and after, he subdued for the most part the Pictish and Scottish races also which dwelt in the north quarters of Britain, and made them tributary. But we will speak of these things hereafter. Now long Ethelbert died the 24th day of February, 21 years being full past after he had received the faith, and was laid in St. Martin's chapel within the church of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul, where also queen Bertha is buried.
</p><p>Which king, beside all other benefits that he of wise policy bestowed upon his subjects, appointed them, with his council of wise men,1 judicial dooms 2 according to the example of the Romans; which being written in the English tongue are until this day kept of them and practised: in which dooms he for the first time ordained what amends he ought to make, which had by theft taken away anything from the churches, bishops or the other orders: wishing doubtless to provide a safeguard for them whom and whose doctrine he had received.
</p><p>Now the said Ethelbert was son of Irminric, whose father was Octa, whose father was Eric called also Oisc, of whom the kings of the Kentishmen are wont to be called Oiscings. This Eric's father's name was Hengist, who with Oisc his son, being sent for of Vurtigern, first entered Britain, as we have shewed before.
</p><p>But after—the death ofEthelbert, when Eadbald his son had taken on him the rule-of-the-realm, he
<pb id="p.229"/>
greatly damaged the growth of the Church which was yet right young and tender there. For he would not only not accept the faith of Christ, but he was also defiled with such a fornication as the apostle witnesseth not to have been heard of even amongst the Gentiles, which was that he married his father's wife. 1 With which two heinous offences he gave occasion to his subjects to return to their former vomit, which under his father's dominion, either for favour or fear of the king, had yielded to the laws of faith and chastity. But the scourges of punishment from on high wanted not to the chastisement and correction of the unbelieving king: for he was plagued with often frenzy of mind and the assault of an unclean spirit.
</p><p>Moreover, the death also of Sabert king of the East Saxons increased the storm of this disturbance of the Church, who departing to the everlasting kingdoms left his three sons, which had remained yet paynims, heirs of his temporal kingdom on earth; and these began straightway and openly to follow idolatry which, while their father lived, they seemed somewhat to have relented, and gave free licence to the people subject to them to worship idols. These princes, when they saw the bishop,2 after he had celebrated the solemnities of the mass in the church, give the people the sacrament, being puffed up with barbarous and rude folly, would say (as the common report is), <q> Why dost thou not offer us also the white bread which thou didst both give to our father Saba (for so they were wont to call him) and which thou dost not yet cease to give the people in the church?</q> To whom he answered: <q> If ye will be washed in that wholesome font,3 wherein your father was
<pb id="p.231"/>
washed, ye are also able to be partakers of the holy bread whereof he was partaker: but if ye contemn the laver of life, ye can in no wise receive the bread of life.</q> <q>We will not,</q> say they in reply, <q> enter that font, for we know we have no need thereof, but yet nevertheless we wish to be refreshed with that bread.</q> And when they had been often and diligently warned of the bishop that it could by no means be, that without most holy cleansing anyone might communicate of this most holy oblation, they at last, in their fury and rage, said to the bishop: <q> If thou wilt not consent to us in so small a matter as we ask of thee, thou shalt not be able henceforth to abide in our province.</q> And straightway they expelled him, commanding him and all his company to depart their realm.
</p><p>Who Being expelled thence went into Kent to commune there with Laurence and Justus his fellow-bishops, what were best to be done in this case. And by common consent it was concluded that it were better for them all to return to their own country and there to serve the Lord with a free mind, than to abide without profit amongst barbarous men that were rebels of the faith. And so at first Mellitus and Justus departed and withdrew to the coasts of France, purposing to attend for the issue of these matters. But these kings, which had driven from them the preacher of truth, were not long time enslaved to the worshipping of devils without punishment. For going out to battle against the tribe of the Gewissas, 1 they were all slain along with their army; but although the authors of mischief were thus destroyed, yet could not the common people once stirred to naughtiness be amended and

recalled to the simplicity of faith and charity which is in Christ.

<div2 type="chapter" n="6"><p>
</p><p>How Laurence chastened by the apostle Peter converted king Eadbald to Christ, who shortly after called back Mellitus and Justus to preach.
</p><p>WHEN now Laurence also was ready to go after Mellitus and Justus and forsake Britain, he commanded, the very night before he went, his bed to be laid in the church of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul, of which church we have oftentimes before spoken; where, when after many his prayers and tears poured forth to the Lord for the state of the Church, reposing his body to rest and going to sleep, the most blessed chief of the apostles appeared to him, and scourging him with sharp stripes a great while in the close and secret night, sought to know with apostolic severity, why he should forsake the Hock which he himself had committed unto him, and to what shepherd, running now away himself, he would leave the sheep of Christ beset in the midst of wolves. <q> Hast thou,</q> quoth he, <q> forgot mine example, who for the little ones of Christ, which he commended to me in token of His love, did suffer fetters, stripes, imprisonings, afflictions, and at the last death itself, yea the death of the cross, by infidels and the enemies of Christ, that I might myself be crowned with Christ?</q> By these stripes of the blessed Peter and these his exhortations Laurence the servant of Jesus Christ, being stirred up, came straightway to the king early in the morning
<pb id="p.235"/>
and loosing his garment shewed him how sore he was beaten and pitifully his flesh torn. The king much amazed thereat enquired who durst be so bold as to whip and scourge such a man: and when he heard that for his own salvation's sake the bishop had suffered so grievous beatings of the apostle of Christ, he feared greatly; and so having cursed all worship of idols, and renouncing his unlawful marriage, he embraeed the faith of Christ, and being baptized he endeavoured to consider and befriend the cause of the Chureh in all points to his uttermost power. He sent also into France and called home Mellitus and Justus, commanding them to return to their churches and give instruction freely: and they returned again the year after their departure; and Justus went back to Rochester where he was bishop, but as for Mellitus the Londoners would not receive him for bishop, choosing rather to obey idolatrous high priests. For Eadbald was not a king of so great power as was his father, that he might restore the bishop to his church notwithstanding the paynim Londoners' ill-will and resistance. But yet for his own part and all his subjects, from the day that he was converted to the Lord he was earnest to submit himself to the commandments of God. At last also he built a church in honour of the holy mother of God in the monastery 1 of the most blessed chief of the apostles, which church Mellitus the archbishop consecrated.

<note type="margin">MELLITUS ARCHBISHOP</note>
</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="7"><p>
</p><p>How bishop Mellitus quenched with his prayer the flames burning his city.
</p><p>For in the reign of this king Eadbald the blessed archbishop Laurence ascended to the heavenly kingdom and was buried the second day of February in the church and monastery of the holy apostle Peter fast by his predecessor Augustine, and after him Mellitus who was bishop of London succeeded to the see of Canterbury church, third archbishop after Augustine: whenas Justus was still alive and governed the church of Rochester. Which two prelates, since they did rule the English Chureh with great labour and diligence, received exhorting epistles from Boniface,1 bishop of the Roman and apostolic see, who after Deusdedit governed the Church in the year of the incarnation of our Lord 619. Now Mellitus was troubled with infirmities of the body, that is to say, with the gout, yet, notwithstanding, the walking of his mind was sure and sound, and passing over speedily all earthly things he hied him fast to heavenly things, which are ever to be beloved, to be wished and to be sought for. After the flesh he was noble by the birth he came of, but more noble by the height he came to of his mind.
</p><p>In a word I will rehearse one token of his good power by which the rest may be understood; when upon a certain time the city of Canterbury was from fault of negligence taken with fire and began to consume away by much increasing of the flames, so that no man by any casting of water was able to stay it, the greatest part of the city
<pb id="p.239"/>
being at length near burnt and the furious flashes extending themselves to the bishop's palace, the bishop trusting in God's help, where the help of man now failed, commanded that he might be carried out of his house and set against these fierce flaws of fire flying all round about. Now in that part where the assault of the flames fell most sorely there was the tomb of the blessed Four Crowned Martyrs.1 When the bishop by the hands of his servants was brought thither, he began with prayer, sick as he was, to drive away the peril which the stout strength of strong men with much labour could not before bring to pass. And behold, the wind that blew from the south, whereby this fire was spread abroad over the city, now suddenly being bent against the south, first drew off the blast of his fury from hurting the places right over in the other side, and straightway sinking utterly to rest stayed his blowing, while the flames in like manner were quieted and died out. And for as much as the man of God did fervently burn with the fire of divine charity, seeing he was wont with his often prayers and exhortations to drive from the hurt of himself and all his the storms of the powers of the air,2 he might now justly prevail against the winds and (lames of the present world, and obtain that they injured not him nor his.
</p><p>And this man then, after he had ruled the Church 5 years, passed away to the heavens in the reign of Eadbald, and was buried with his fathers in the oft-mentioned monastery and church of the most blessed chief of the apostles, in the 624th year of the Lord's incarnation, on the 24th day of April.

<div2 type="chapter" n="8"><p>
</p><p>How pope Boniface sent Justus, Mellitus' successor, a pall and an epistle.
</p><p>To whom Justus succeeded immediately in the pontificate, who was bishop of the church at Rochester, over which church he consecrated Romanus as bishop in his place, for now he had received authority to ordain bishops from Boniface the pope, successor of Deusdedit as we have said before; the form of which authority is as follows:
<quote><p>To our dearly beloved brother Justus, Boniface. How godly and how earnestly also you have, dear brother, laboured for the Gospel of Christ, not only the tenor of your epistle directed to us, but rather the perfection granted unto your work from on high hath declared. For Almighty God hath not forsaken either the meaning of His name or the fruit of your travail, seeing Himself faithfully hath promised the preachers of the Gospel, saying: 1 ' Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.' Which thing especially His clemency hath shewed in this ministry appointed you, by opening the hearts of the Gentiles to receive the singular mystery of your preaching. For He hath made honourable with a great reward the acceptable course of your eminence by the approval of His goodness, seeing that Himself, by bestowing abundant fruit upon the exercise of your most faithful trading 2 with the talents entrusted to you, hath prepared for that course what you could set forth for manifold generations. And this too is given you in such recompense, for that you, persisting continually in
<pb id="p.243"/>
the ministry appointed to you, looked with laudable patience for the redemption of that people, and their salvation was granted unto you, that they might get some good by your deserving; as the Lord saith:1 ' He that endureth to the end shall be saved.' Ye are therefore saved by the hope of patience and by the virtue of longsuffering, so that the hearts of infidels being purged from their natural and superstitious disease may attain to the mercy of their Saviour. For after receiving the letters of our son king Adulwald, 2 we have understood with what great learning of the holy word you, my brother, have brought his mind to belief in true conversion and in the undoubted faith. Whereupon we, putting sure affiance in the forbearance of the heavenly mercy, do believe that not only the full salvation of king Adulwald's subjects but rather also of the next inhabitants about him must come to follow after the ministry of your preaching: to the end that, as it is written, the payment of your perfected work may be given you from the Lord, the rewarder of all good, and that truly the universal confession of all nations receiving the mystery of the Christian faith may manifestly declare, ' Then-sound hath gone forth over all the earth, and their words to the uttermost parts of the world.'3
</p><p>Furthermore, called thereunto heartily of our bounteousness we have sent you, my brother, by the bearer of our present letter, a pall, which namely we have given you licence to use only in the celebration of the most holy mysteries: granting you, moreover, by the aid of the Lord's mercy the ordaining of bishops when occasion requireth: so that the Gospel of Christ by the preaching of many may the
<pb id="p.245"/>
better be spread over all nations that be not yet converted. Be therefore, my brother, zealous to keep with pure sincerity of mind this authority which thou hast gotten by the bounty of the see apostolic, earnestly considering what it is that is figured by the vestment of such exceeding honour, which thou hast received to be worn upon thy shoulders. And calling for the mercy of the Lord, endeavour to prove thyself such a man as may shew and present the rewards of the gift we have bestowed, before the tribunal of the supreme Judge that is to come, not with the loss but with the gain of souls. God have thee in His safe keeping, most beloved brother!</p></quote>

<div2 type="chapter" n="9"><p>
</p><p>Of the reign of king Edwin, and how Paulinus, coming to preach the Gospel to him, first instructed his daughter in the mysteries of the Christian faith and others with her.
</p><p>ABOUT this time the people also of Northumberland (that is, that nation of the English which dwelt toward the north side of the flood Humber), received together with their king Edwin the word of faith by the preaching of Paulinus, of whom we have spoken before.1 To the which king to wit in a good abodement 2 of receiving the faith and the heavenly kingdom was granted also greater power by the increase of his earthly dominion: insomuch that he brought under subjection all the coasts of Britain, where either the provinces of the English themselves or the Britons had their habitation, which thing no one of the English kings had done before him.
<pb id="p.247"/>
<note type="margin">EDWIN'S MARRIAGE</note>
</p><p>Moreover, too, he joined on the Mevanian islands (as we have also shewn before *) to the dominion of the English: of which isles the first (that is nearest the south and is both in situation larger and more plentiful in produce of crops and more fertile) hath dwelling-room for the number of 960 families, according to the estimate of the English 2; the second hath space of ground for 300 tenements or somewhat more.
</p><p>Now the occasion to this people of receiving the faith was that the aforenamed king was joined in affinity to the kings of Kent by the marriage of Ethelberga, otherwise called Tata, daughter of king Ethelbert. Which lady when at the first king-Edwin sought for wife at the hands of her brother Eadbald, then king of Kent, by the sending of wooers, answer was given that it was not lawful for a Christian maiden to be given for wife to a paynim, lest the faith and sacraments of the King of Heaven might be profaned by the company of such a king as knew not at all the worshipping of the true God. Which answer when the ambassadors brought back to Edwin, he promised that in any case he would do nothing which should be contrary to the Christian faith which the maiden professed; but rather permit that she, with all the men and women, priests and attendants which came with her, should observe after the Christian manner the faith and practice of their religion. Neither did he deny but that himself also would submit to the same religion, so that after the examination of wise men 3 it were able to be found holier and meeter for God.
</p><p>And accordingly the maiden was promised and sent also unto Edwin, and according to appointment
<pb id="p.249"/>
made, Paulinus the man beloved of God was ordained bishop to go with her,1 and by daily exhortation and celebration of the heavenly sacraments to strengthen her and her company that they might not be defiled with the fellowship of paynims.
</p><p>Now Paulinus was made bishop by the archbishop Justus about the 21st day of July, the 625th year of our Lord's incarnation; and in this way he came in company of the above-mentioned maiden unto king Edwin, as if he had been the companion of their carnal union. But he himself was rather bent, with all his mind to call that country to which he went, to the acknowledging of the truth, that, according to the saying of the apostle, he might present her as a chaste virgin to Christ the one true husband.2 And when he was now come into the province, he laboured earnestly with the Lord's help to keep them which came with him from falling from their faith, and by preaching to convert, if by any means it were possible, some of those paynims to the grace of faith. But, as the apostle saith,3 albeit he laboured long in the word: <q> The God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ should shine unto them.</q>
</p><p>Now in the following year there came into this province a desperate ruffian named Eumer (sent by Cwiehelm, king of the West Saxons), with the hope to dispatch king Edwin of his kingdom and life at the same time; and this man had a double-edged short sword 4 to this intent dipped in poison, that if the stroke of the sword were not forceable enough to kill the king out of hand, yet it might be helped forward with the infection of the poison. Now he
<pb id="p.251"/>
came on the first day of Easter unto the king, who lay at the river Derwent where there was then a royal township,1 and entered there as if bringing a message from his master; and when with crafty speech he was rehearsing his feigned embassy, he steppeth forth suddenly and drawing his sword from under his garment made assault upon the king. Which when Lilia the king's most loyal thane saw (having no buckler ready at hand, wherewith he might defend the king from present death), he stcpt straightway with his own body between the king and the stroke of the piercing sword; but the murderer struck his sword so far and fiercely, that through the body of this soldier now quite slain he even wounded the king himself. Which thing when he had thus done, being straightway beset with weapons on all sides, right in the confusion he slew also with the same bloody sword another of the thanes, whose name was Forthere.
</p><p>Now it happened that on the same most holy night of the Lord's Easter the queen was delivered of a daughter to the king, whose name was Eanfled. And when the king in the presence of the bishop Paulinus gave thanks to his gods for the birth of his daughter, the bishop contrariwise began to give thanks to the Lord Christ, and to add furthermore that he hath obtained by his prayers of Christ, that the queen might bring forth her child safely and without grievous pain. With which his words the king, being much delighted, promised that he would renounce idols and serve Christ, if so be that Christ would grant him life and victory in his wars against the king by whom this man-queller who had wounded him had been sent; and in pledge of performing this
<pb id="p.253"/>
his promise he committed this his same daughter to bishop Paulinus to be consecrated to Christ; who was baptized first of the people of the Northumbrians upon the holy day of Pentecost 1 with eleven others of the king's family.
</p><p>At which time the king being recovered of the wound before inflicted on him, made an army and marched against the nation of the West Saxons, and when war was begun he slew or else took prisoners all them whom he understood to have conspired to his death. And so returning home to his country in triumph, yet would he not by and by or without further counsel receive the sacraments of the Christian faith: although he served not idols any more from that day he promised he would serve Christ. But at the first he was careful more diligently at leisure, and from the mouth of the venerable man Paulinus himself, to learn thoroughly the reason of the faith, and to confer with his nobles, whom he knew to be the wiser, what were best, as they thought, to be done in these matters. Moreover (as he was by nature a man of excellent understanding), sitting oftentimes by himself alone for a great space, in much silence of outward voice, but in his inward thought communing many things with himself, he debated diversely what he should do and what religion were best to be followed.

</p><p>How pope Boniface sent a letter and exhorted the same king to the faith.
</p><p>About which time he haply received from Boniface, bishop of the see apostolic, a letter exhorting him to the faith, of which the form is such:
</p><p>Copy of the letter of the most blessed and apostolic pope of the church of the city of Rome, Boniface, unto the puissant prince Edwin king of the English.1
<quote><p>To the puissant prince Edwin king of the English, Boniface, bishop, servant of the servants of God.
</p><p>Although the power of the supreme divinity cannot be expressed by the employment of words of man (for it consisteth by the greatness thereof of so unspeakable and unsearchable eternity, that no keenness of wit is able to comprise and expound how great it is): yet for as much as the lovingkindness of God, opening the gates of the heart to the entry of itself, doth mercifully pour into men's minds by secret inspiration such things as shall be revealed concerning itself; we have thought good to extend our episcopal care in uttering unto you the rich store of the Christian faith, that bringing likewise also unto your understanding the Gospel of Christ, which our Saviour commanded to be preached to all nations, we may offer you the means of your salvation. The mercy, therefore, of the high majesty of God, who with the only word of His commandment hath founded and created all things, the heaven to
<pb id="p.257"/>
wit and the earth, the sea and all that in them is, setting the degrees, in which they should abide, by the counsel of His eternal Word, and ordering them by the unity of the Holy Ghost, made man (fashioned of the mire of the earth) to His own image and likeness, and gave him such preeminence of reward that He set him above all things, and (so that he kept the bounds of His commandment) fenced him with the assurance of immortality. This God then, the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, which is the inseparable Trinity, mankind, from the rising of the sun even to the going down of the same, worshippeth and adoreth with wholesome confession of faith as the Creator of all things and their own Maker: to the which God the supreme honours of empire and the puissant powers of state are lowly subject, because by His ordinance authority over all kingdoms is granted. His merciful goodness therefore in extending His aid to all His creation hath marvellously vouchsafed to enkindle with the heat of the Holy Ghost the cold hearts of the nations set even in the uttermost parts of the earth in the acknowledgment also of Himself.
</p><p>For we reckon your highness hath come to a fuller understanding than we (the country lying so near), of what the mercy of the Redeemer hath wrought in the illumining of his highness our son king Audubald and the nations subject unto him. Therefore do we trust with certain hope that by His heavenly longsuffering the wonderful gift is being-bestowed also in you; seeing indeed we have learnt the sovereign lady your wife (who is discerned to be part of your body) to be illuminated with the reward of eternity by the regeneration of holy baptism.
<pb id="p.259"/>
</p><p>Wherefore we have thought it good to exhort your highness in this our present letter with all affection of inward charity; to the intent that loathing idols and their worship, and despising the fond foolishness of their temples and the deceitful enticements of soothsaying, ye may now believe in God the Father Almighty, and His Son Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost, and that believing so ye may be loosed by the working power of the holy and inseparable Trinity from the bonds and captivity of the devil, and be enabled to be made partaker of life everlasting.
</p><p>Now in how great fault and offence they are fast held, which worship idols and embrace the deadly superstition of idolatry, the examples of their destruction that worship them can sufficiently inform you; whence it is that it is said of them through the mouth of the Psalmist: 1' All the gods of the Gentiles are devils but the Lord hath made the heavens.' And again: 2 ' They have eyes and see not; they have ears and hear not; they have noses and shall not smell; they have hands and shall not feel; they have feet and shall not walk: therefore are all such made like unto them as do put the hope of their confidence in them.' For how can they have power to help any man, which are made of a corruptible matter and wrought too by the hands of thy inferiors and subjects; upon which, namely, by employment of the work of craftsmen thou hast bestowed the likeness of limbs without life; which, were they not moved by thee, shall not be able to walk, but like a stone set fast in one place, so are they builded up, and having no understanding and stark with right insensibleness have gotten no ability to hurt or help? Therefore we cannot by any discretion and judgment find out
<pb id="p.261"/>
upon what blindness of mind ye worship and follow after those gods to whom your own selves have given the representation of a body.
</p><p>Wherefore it behoveth you to receive now the sign of the holy cross by which mankind was redeemed, and shake from your heart the abominable guile of the subtlety of the devil, who ever continueth in malice and envy at the works of God's goodness, and setting hands on these gods which up till now ye have fashioned as your gods by the joining together of the work of men's hands, to see that they be broken in pieces and smitten asunder utterly. For the very dissolving and ruin of them that never had breath of life in them, nor could not by any means take of their makers sense and feeling, can plainly chew you how it was nothing at all which hitherto you were worshipping; whereas assuredly you who have received the breath of life from the Lord stand forth as better than they be, that are made with hands: seeing that Almighty God hath brought you to sprout from the stock of the first man whom He formed, after innumerable shoots through many ages have sprung therefrom. Come you therefore to the acknowledging of Him that hath created you, that hath breathed into you the breath of life, that for your redemption hath sent His only begotten Son, so that He might deliver you out of original sin, and reward you after with heavenly recompence, being now delivered from the power of the corrupt wickedness of the devil.
</p><p>Receive ye the words of the preachers and the Gospel of God, of which they are the messengers to you; to the end that, believing, as has been said more than once, in God the Father Almighty and in
<pb id="p.263"/>
</p><p>Jesus Christ His Son and in the Holy Ghost and the inseparable Trinity; and that abandoning the thoughts of devils and driving from you the enticement of the poisoned enemy that is full of deceit, ye may be born again by water and the Holy Ghost to Him in Whom ye have believed, and by the help of His bountifulness may dwell with Him in the brightness of everlasting glory.
</p><p>Furthermore we have sent you the blessing of your protector the blessed Peter, chief of the apostles, that is to say, by a shirt with ornament in gold, and a cloak made at Ancyra; and this gift we beseech your highness to accept with so good a heart and will as ye understand it is sent from us.</p></quote>

</p><p>The loving kindness of our Redeemer, of His great providence hath offered mankind (whom by the shedding of H's precious blood He hath delivered from the bonds of the captivity of the devil) the means by which they might be saved; that by insinuating through divers means into the minds of the
<pb id="p.265"/>
nations the acknowledgment of His name, they might receive the mystery of the Christian faith and acknowledge their Creator. Which thing in deed, that it hath been by heavenly gift bestowed upon the mind of your highness, the mystical cleansing of your regeneration doth plainly confirm. Therefore our heart hath leaped for joy at this great benefit of our Lord's bountifulness to you, for that He hath vouchsafed by your confession to enkindle a spark of right religion; that thereby He might after easily make a flame in the love of Himself to rise not only in the mind of his highness your husband, but rather in the minds of all the people subject unto you.
</p><p>For we have learned by the report of them which came to us with the tidings of the laudable conversion of our son his highness king Audubald, that your highness also (after ye had received tin wonderful mystery of the Christian faith) do shine and excel in good works and such as be ever pleasant in the sight of God, that ye do also diligently keep yourself from the worshipping of idols or frequenting of temples and from the allurement of fond soothsaying, and are so continually watchful in the love of your Redeemer with unchangeable devotion, that you never cease to bestow your pains unceasingly to the enlargement of the Christian faith; and whereas for our fatherly charity we had with searchings of heart inquired of the state of his highness your husband, we understood that he served so far forth to the abomination of idolatry, that he delayed to shew his obedience and give ear to the voice of the preachers. By which news no small bitterness was heaped upon us, by reason that a part of your own body hath remained in this sort alienated from the
<pb id="p.267"/>
acknowledgment of the highest and inseparable Trinity. Wherefore, as becometh a father to do, we have not delayed to send our warning to your Christian highness; encouraging you that, whereas ye are now filled with the help of God's inspiration, ye delay not to be instant in season and out of season in seeking that he himself too by the aiding power of our Saviour the Lord Jesus Christ may be coupled with you in the number of Christians; and so thou mayest hold the laws of wedlock in like manner in an unspotted bond of union. For it is written:1 ' They shall be two in one flesh.' How then can it be said that you have oneness of union if your husband, by the darkness of detestable error set between you, shall abide still alienated from the brightness of your faith?
</p><p>Wherefore cease not by continuing instant in prayer to try to obtain from the long-suffering of the heavenly mercy the benefit of his enlightening, that namely they, whom the knot of carnal affection is shewn to have rendered in a certain sort one body, may also by the unity of faith be preserved in unending fellowship after their departure from this life. Press on then, illustrious daughter, and with utmost endeavour hasten speedily to soften the hardness of his heart by the religious communication of the divine commands; pouring into his mind, how excellent a mystery it is that thou by believing hast received, and how marvellous is the reward thou hast deserved to attain to because thou hast been born again. Kindle to warmth the coldness of his heart by the message of the Holy Ghost Himself; that when he hath set aside the numbness of the deadly worship of idols, the heat of divine faith may enkindle
<pb id="p.269"/>
his understanding by thy often encouragements, that so it may truly appear to be fulfilled assuredly in thee, which is testified in holy Scripture:1 ' The unbelieving husband shall be saved by the woman that believeth.' For unto this end thou hast gained the pitifulness of the Lord's goodness, that thou shouldest render back to thy Redeemer the multiplied fruit of thy faith and the good gifts committed unto thee. And verily that thou mayest have strength to fulfil this work by the help of the protection of His lovingkindness, we cease not to ask with continual prayer.
</p><p>In these words therefore sent in advance, shewing you the duty of our fatherly love, we exhort you that having found the opportunity of a bearer ye will as quickly as possible by favourable tidings give us comfort concerning those things which the power from above shall vouchsafe to work marvellously by you in the conversion of your husband and your subjects, that we (which carefully and longingly look for the happy news of the salvation of the soul of you and all yours) by this your tidings may be comforted, and acknowledging the brightness of the divine graciousness more richly spread abroad in your midst, we may with joyful confession give deservedly abundant thanks to God the giver of all good things and the blessed Peter, the chief of the apostles.
</p><p>Furthermore, we have sent you the blessing of your protector the blessed Peter, chief of the apostles, that is to say by a looking-glass of silver and a comb of ivory gilt with gold; and we pray your highness to accept this gift in that spirit of loving-kindness in the which, as ye understand, it hath been sent by us.</p></quote>

<note type="margin">EDWIN'S VISION</note>
</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="12"><p>
</p><p>How Edwin was invited to believe by a vision appearing to him aforetime in banishment.
</p><p>THUS much did pope Boniface by letter, when informed concerning the salvation of king Edwin and his people. Moreover, the king's mind was very much holpen to receive and understand the precepts of wholesome doctrine by a message from heaven, which divine goodness vouchsafed to reveal to him while he lay sometime in banishment at the court of Redwald king of the Angles. When then Paulinus perceived that the king's loftiness of spirit could hardly be bowed to the lowliness of the way of salvation, and to receive the mystery of the quickening cross; and when he was labouring for the king's salvation as well as that of the people over whom Edwin was ruler, both by word of exhortation before men and the word of prayer before the divine goodness: at the length he learned in the spirit (for so it is most likest to be) what and of what nature was that message which had before been declared to the king from heaven. And thereafter he made no delay, but forthwith warned the king to fulfil the vow which at the time of the message shewn to him he had promised to do, in case he were delivered from his present miseries and attained to the dignity of a kingdom.
</p><p>Now the message was such as followeth. At what time the king's predecessor Ethelfrith with grievous pursuing made him lie privy in divers places and realms, and wander as a banished man for many years' space, at the length Edwin came to Redwald,
<pb id="p.273"/>
beseeching him that he would save him by protecting his life from the trains and search of so deadly an enemy: who gladly entertained him and promised to fulfil that his request. But after that Ethelfrith heard say that Edwin was seen in that province and lived there at the king's court familiarly with all his company, he sent ambassadors to offer Redwald a great sum of money to procure Edwin's death; but it prevailed nothing. He sent a second time, he sent a third time, both offering more plentiful gifts of money and threatening him beside with war if his offer were still scorned. Which Redwald, either overcome by the threats or corrupted with the bribes, granted the things which he was asked and promised either to put Edwin to death himself or else yield him up to the ambassadors. Which thing when a certain faithful friend of Edwin's had word of, he entered to the chamber where Edwin was preparing to sleep (for it was an hour within night), and calling him forth informed him what the king had promised to do against him, saying in the end thus much: <q> If therefore you so please, this very hour I shall lead you out of this province and bring you into such a place that neither Redwald nor Ethelfrith be ever able to find you.</q> To whom Edwin saith: <q>I thank you for this your gentleness; nevertheless I cannot follow your counsel herein, namely to be myself first to make void the covenant I have entered into with so mighty a king, seeing he hath done me no wrong, hath shewn me no enmity hitherto. Nay more, if I must of necessity die, I had rather he should yield me up for death than any man of less nobility. For whither should I fly now, who in the course of so many years and seasons 1 was a wanderer through all
<pb id="p.275"/>
the provinces of Britain, avoiding the snares of my enemies?</q> The friend therefore departing, Edwin remained without alone, and sitting down sadly before the palace began to be troubled with many hot vexations of thought, not witting what to do or whither to turn his feet.
</p><p>And after being long harassed with privy torments of mind and close fire of secret sorrow,1 he saw suddenly in the silence of the dead of night a man drawing toward him, which was both for visage and apparel unknown to him: whom he espying thus as one unknown and unexpected, was not a little afraid. But the stranger coming unto him greeteth him, and asketh him wherefore he sat so sorrowful on the stone, watching all alone at that hour, when other men were at rest and sunk in their deep sleep. Whereon Edwin in turn demanded of him what he had to do therewith, if he passed the night within doors or without. To whom this man answered and said: <q> Think ye not but that I know the cause of your heaviness and watch, and of your solitary sitting without doors: for I know quite surely who ye be and wherefore ye are sad, and what mischief you fear shortly shall befall you. But tell me, what reward would you give to him, if such there should be, who should rid you out of these sorrows and persuade Redwald that neither he himself should do you any hurt nor yield you up to your enemies that they might slay you?</q> And when Edwin answered that he would give all that he possibly could to such an one for reward of so good a turn, this man added moreover: <q> What if beside this he do truly warrant you that ye shall be a king and all your enemies destroyed, yea and that in such sort that you shall not
<pb id="p.277"/>
only excel all your ancestors, but also pass in power all the kings who had reigned before you in the English nation?</q> Here Edwin, being made more firm by questioning, doubted not to promise that he would be answerable with worthy thanksgiving to the man that should bestow on him such great benefits. Then the man spake the third time and said: <q> But tell me, if the man, which hath foretold that you shall hereafter undoubtedly have such and so great benefits, can give you also better counsel and more profitable for your life and salvation than ever any of your parents or kinsfolk heard of, can you then consent to obey him and receive his wholesome sayings?</q> But Edwin delayed not but that he promised out of hand that he would altogether follow his teaching, who should deliver him from so many grievous miseries and exalt him after to wear a royal crown. And when this answer was received, straightway the man which talked with him laid his right hand upon Edwin's head, and said: <q> When this sign then shall come unto you, remember well this time and this our talk, and delay not to fulfil that you do now promise me.</q> And this being said, according to the tale told, he suddenly vanished away, to the intent that Edwin might understand that it was no man which had appeared unto him, but a ghost.
</p><p>And when this young prince was still sitting solitary in the same place, rejoicing for the comfort bestowed upon him, but yet very careful and busied in pondering in his mind who it should be or whence he should come which spake these things to him, there came to him his aforesaid friend and greeting him cheerfully said: <q> Rise, come in, and stilling and letting pass this your cark and care set your mind at rest and
<pb id="p.279"/>
your limbs to sleep, for the king's heart is changed, nor doth he purpose to do you any wrong, but rather to keep his promised faith; for after he had discovered to the queen in secret his thought of which I told you before, she withdrew him from that purpose, warning him that it is in no wise meet for a king of such prowess to sell his best friend, when he is now brought to straitness, for gold, nay, more, to lose his honour which is more to be esteemed than all treasures, from love of money.</q> Why make a longer tale? The king did as hath been said; and not only not betrayed the banished man to the ambassadors of his enemy, but also helped him to come to the throne. For shortly after, when the ambassadors were returning home, he gathered a mighty army to conquer king Ethelfrith, and when Ethelfrith marched against him with an army that was much weaker (for space enough had not been given him to gather all his force together and order it into one army) Redwald slew him in the borders of the Marchland men, at the east side of the river called Idle:1 in which battle Regenhere, king Redwald's son, was slain: and thus Edwin, according to the oracle which he had received, not only avoided the snares of the king his deadly enemy, but also succeeded the same after his death in the honour of his kingdom.2
</p><p>When therefore Paulinus for all his preaching of the word of God found that the king slacked to believe, using yet for some space at divers fitting hours to sit solitary (as we have said before) and diligently to examine with himself what were best for him to do, what religion were best to be followed, the man of God entering the presence of the king on
<pb id="p.281"/>
a certain day, laid his right hand on his head and asked him whether he acknowledged that sign or no. And when the king trembling thereat would have fallen down at his feet, Paulinus lifted him up and spake after a familiar sort thus unto him: <q> Behold, by the granting of the Lord you have escaped the hand of the enemy whom you dreaded; behold, by His bountiful gift you have obtained the kingdom for which you longed. Remember that you delay not to perform the third thing which you promised, by receiving His faith and keeping His commandments, Who both delivered you from your temporal adversities, and exalted you to the honour of a temporal king; and if you shall be willing hereafter to obey His pleasure which He declareth to you through me. He will also deliver you from the perpetual torment of evils, and make you partaker with Him of the eternal kingdom in the heavens.</q>

<div2 type="chapter" n="13"><p>
</p><p>What counsel the same Edwin had with his chief men for the receiving of the faith of Christ; and how his chief priest profaned his own altars.
</p><p>Which words when the king heard, he answered that he both would and was bound to receive the faith which Paulinus taught. But he said that he would still confer thereof with the nobles that were his friends, and his chief counsellors, that so, if they too should be willing to think the same as he did, they might all be consecrated together to Christ in the font of life. Whereunto when Paulinus agreed, the king did as he had said. For having called a
<pb id="p.283"/>
meeting of his wise men, he asked severally each of them, what manner of doctrine this seemed to them to be, which until that day had never been heard of before, and what they thought of the new worshipping of divinity which was now preached.
</p><p>To whom Coifi, the first of the king's priests, incontinently answered: <q><p>May it like your highness to prove what manner of doctrine this is which is now preached unto us; but thus much I surely avouch unto you, which I have certainly learned, that the religion which unto this day we have observed hath no virtue nor advantage in it at all: for none of your subjects hath set himself more earnestly to the worship of our gods than I; and yet, notwithstanding, there are many of them which receive from you more ample benefits than I, and higher dignities than I, and better prosper in all they take in hand to do or seek to get than L If now the gods could aught have done, they would rather have holpen me, who have been careful to serve them more zealously. Wherefore it remaineth that, if you shall find after good examination that these things which be now newly preached to us be better and of more power, then without longer delay we hasten to receive them.</p></q>
</p><p>To whose wise persuasion and words another of the king's nobles consenting forthwith added: <q><p>Such seemeth to me, my Lord, the present life of men here in earth (for the comparison of our uncertain time to live), as if a sparrow should come to the house and very swiftly flit through; which entereth in at one window and straightway passeth out through another, while you sit at dinner with your captains and servants 1 in winter-time; the parlour being then made warm with the fire kindled in the midst
<pb id="p.285"/>
thereof, but all places abroad being troubled with raging tempests of winter rain and snow. Right for the time it be within the house, it feeleth no smart of the winter storm, but after a very short space of fair weather that lasteth but for a moment, it soon passeth again from winter to winter and escapeth your sight. So the life of man here appeareth for a little season, but what followeth or what hath gone before, that surely know we not. Wherefore if this new learning hath brought us any better surety, methink it is worthy to be followed. ' Thus or in like manner spake thereafter the rest of the ciders and counsellors of the king, being moved of God.</p></q>
</p><p>But Coifi said, moreover, that he wished more diligently to hearken to Paulinus himself speaking concerning the God whom he preached. And when he did so according to the king's pleasure, Coifi, on hearing his words, with a loud voice said: <q> I understood long ago that it was right nought that we worshipped; for certes the more curiously I sought for the truth in that our worship, the less I found it. But now do I plainly avouch that in this preaching is manifested that truth which is able to give us the gifts of life, salvation and of bliss everlasting. Wherefore I give counsel, my lord, that out of hand we curse and give over to the flames the temples and altars which we have consecrated without fruit and profit.</q> Why make a longer tale? The king openly gave consent to blessed Paulinus in his preaching of the Gospel, and renouncing idolatry declared that he received the faith of Christ. And demanding then of the aforesaid priest of his sacrifices, who should first profane the altars and temples with the grates
<pb id="p.287"/>
<note type="margin">COIFI AND THE IDOLS</note>
wherewith they were environed: <q> Marry,</q> replied he, <q> I will. For who now to the good example of all men can better than I myself, by the wisdom given me by the true God, destroy those things which I have myself worshipped by foolishness?</q> And incontinently casting away vain superstition he besought the king to grant him harness and a stallion war horse whereon he might mount and come to destroy the idols. For it was not before lawful for a priest of the sacrifices either to wear harness or to ride on other than a mare. Girded therefore with a sword about his loins he took a spear in his hand, and mounting the king's war horse set forth against the idols. Which sight when men saw they thought he had been mad. But for all that he stayed not to profane the temple, as soon as he approached near unto it, casting thereupon the spear which he held in his hand; and much rejoicing for the acknowledgment of the worship of the true God he commanded the company, which was there with him, to set fire to and destroy the temple together with all its courts. Now the place where these idols sometime were is now to be seen not far from York to the east beyond the river Derwent, and is at the present day called Godmunddingaham,1 in which place the chief priest himself by the inspiration of the true God defiled and destroyed the altars which he himself had consecrated.2

<div2 type="chapter" n="14"><p>
</p><p>How the same Edwin and all his folk were made believers, and in what place Paulinus baptized them.
</p><p>So king Edwin with all the nobility of his country and most part of the commons received the faith and came to the laver of holy regeneration, the eleventh year of his reign, which is the 627th year of the Lord's incarnation, and about the 180th year after the entrance of the English into Britain. Now he was baptized at York on the holy day of Easter 1 the 12th of April, in the church of the apostle Peter, which in all speed he himself set up of wood in that same place while he was catechized and instructed against his baptism. And in this city also he granted a bishop's see for Paulinus himself, his teacher and bishop. Moreover, as soon as he was christened, at the telling of the same Paulinus, he set to building right in that place a basilica of stone greater and more magnificent, in the midst whereof he would have enclosed his own proper oratory which he had before made. Laying, therefore, the foundations in a ring about the first oratory he began to build there a basilica foursquare. But before the wall thereof could be brought to his just highness, the king himself was slain by cruel death, and left that same work to be perfected by his successor Oswald. Now Paulinus from that time, six years after, that is to the end of king Edwin's reign, preached the word of God continually by his good leave and favour in that province; and they believed and were baptized, as many as were predestined to life everlasting: amongst whom were Osfrid and Eadfrid king Edwin's
<pb id="p.291"/>
sons both which he had in his banishment by dame Quenberga, daughter to Cearl king of the Marchmen.
</p><p>In time following his other children also which he had by queen Ethelberga were baptized, as his son Ethelhun and his daughter Ethelthryth and a second son Wuscfrea, of the which the two first were taken out of this life while still in their white garments of baptism, and buried in the church at York. Yffi son of Osfrid was christened too, with many other of the nobility and ethelings of the royal race.1 And, as is reported, then was the fervour of faith and earnest desire of the health-giving laver so great among the people of the Northumbrians, that on a certain time, when Paulinus came with the king and queen to the royal township which is called Adgefrin,2 he stayed in that place with them thirty-six days, only occupied in catechizing and instructing: in each of the which days he did nothing else from morning till evening but instruct the commons which flocked thither out of all places and villages thereabout in the word of Christ's salvation, whom after he had thus instructed he cleansed in the flood Glen,3 for that was the next near water, with the laver of remission. This town ship of Adgefrin in the time of succeeding kings waxed rude and desert, and another was built in its room in a place called Maelmin.4
</p><p>Thus much did Paulinus in the Bernicians' province; but also in the province of the Deirans, where he lay most commonly with the king, he baptized in the flood Swale which runneth fast by the village of Cataract.5 For as yet there could not be builded oratories or places of baptism in the very birth of the Church new begun there. But yet there was built a basilica in Campodunum, 6 where there
<pb id="p.293"/>
then was a royal township, which church the paynims that slew king Edwin burned afterwards with the whole of the said town: instead of which the kings that came after made their mansion place in the country of Loidis.1 But the altar of the said church escaped the fire, because it was made of stone: and it is kept to this day in the monastery of the right reverend abbot and priest Thrydwulf, standing in the wood Elmet. 2

<div2 type="chapter" n="15"><p>
</p><p>How the province of the East English received the faith of Christ.
</p><p>Now Edwin had such an earnest zeal towards the worship of the true faith that he also persuaded the king of the East English, Earpwald, the son of Redwald,3 to leave off the superstitions of idols, and with his whole realm receive the faith and sacraments of Christ. And indeed his father Redwald had long since been instructed in Kent in the mysteries of the Christian faith, but in vain: for returning home again he was led away by his wife 4 and certain false teachers, and being in such wise corrupted from the simplicity of the faith, his end was worse than his beginning; so much so that he seemed after the manner of the old Samaritans 5 to serve both Christ and the gods he served before. And so in one temple he had both an altar for the sacrifice of Christ and another little altar for offerings made to devils. The which temple, namely, Aldwulf, king of the same province, who lived in this our time, said that it
<pb id="p.295"/>
dured so unto his day and witnessed that he saw it in his childhood.
</p><p>Now the aforenamed king Redwald, being noble in birth although ignoble in deed, was son of Tytilus, whose father was Wuffa, from whom the kings of the East English are called Wuffings. But Earpwald not long after he had received the faith was slain by a man that was a paynim named Ricbert; and from that time three years after the province abode in error, until Sigbert, brother 1 of the same Earpwald, took the kingdom, a man in all points most Christian and learned, who, whiles his brother was yet alive, living banished in France was instructed in the mysteries of the faith; of which he went about to make all his realm partaker as soon as he began to reign. Whose good endeavour herein the bishop Felix farthered to his great glory, and when Felix came from the coasts of Burgundy (where he was born and took holy orders) to Honorius the archbishop, and had opened his longing unto him, the archbishop sent him to preach the word of life to the aforesaid nation of the East English. Where certes his desires fell not in vain; nay rather this good husbandman of the spiritual soil found in that nation manifold fruit of people that believed. For according to the good abodement of his name 2 he brought all that province, now delivered from their long iniquity and unhappiness, unto faith and works of justice, and the gifts of unending happiness; and he received the see of his bishopric in the city of Domnoc:3 where, when he had ruled the same province seventeen years in that dignity, he ended his life in peace in the same place.

</p><p>BUT Paulinus continued still and preached the word also in the province of Lindsey, which is the next toward the south bank of the flood Humber, reaching even unto the sea, where he first converted to the Lord the reeve of Lincoln, whose name was Blaeeca, 1 with his household. In the which city he built too a well-wrought church of stone; the roof whereof either for long lack of reparation or the spoil of enemies is now cast down, but the walls thereof stand yet to be seen at this present day, and every year some or other miracles of healing are wont to be shewn in the same place for the comfort of them which seek therefor in faith. And in this church, when Justus departed hence to Christ, Paulinus consecrated Honorius bishop in his room, as I shall shew more conveniently hereafter.
</p><p>As touching the faith of this province a certain priest and abbot, a man of very good credit, whose name was Deda, of the monastery of Peartaneu,2 told me that one of the elders of that convent (as he reported himself) had been baptized at midday by Paulinus, in the presence of king Edwin, with a mighty throng of people, in the flood Trent, near the city which is called in the English tongue Tiowulfingaeaestir 3; the which also was wont to describe Paulinus' person, saying that he was a tall man, somewhat crook-backed and black of hair, lean in face and having a hooked thin nose, of a countenance that did at once appal and strike with
<pb id="p.299"/>
reverence. He had, moreover, in the ministry with him one James a deacon, a man certes of industry and great fame in Christ and the Church, who lived even unto our time.
</p><p>Now in those days such is stated to have been the tranquillity throughout Britain, which way so ever the rule of king Edwin had reached, that (as it is yet to-day in a common proverb), even if a woman should have wished to walk along with her newborn babe over all the island from sea to sea, she might have done so without injury from any. The same king did so much tender the comfort of his people, that in most places where he saw clear well-springs breaking out by the side of the highways, he back-posts be set up and copper vessels hung thereon for the refreshing of wayfaring men, which vessels either for greatness of fear of the king's displeasure no men durst touch further than to his present use and need, or would wish to touch for greatness of the love they bare him. Moreover, he had such excellency of glory in the kingdom that not only in battle were banners borne before him, but in time of peace too a standard-bearer was accustomed to go before him whensoever he rode 1 about the cities, townships or shires with his thanes; yea, even when he passed through the streets to any place there was wont to be carried before him that kind of banner which the Romans call Tufa 2 but the English Tuuf.

</p><p>How the same king received a letter of exhortation from pope Honorius, who also sent a pall to Paulinus.
</p><p>AT that time 1 Honorius, the successor of Boniface, held the prelacy of the apostolic see, and when he learned that the people of Northumbria with their king were converted to the faith and confession of Christ by Paulinus' preaching of the Gospel, he sent the same Paulinus a pall and sent too a letter of exhortation to king Edwin, with fatherly love kindling him to sec that himself and his people should always continue or rather go forward in the faith of the truth which they had received. Of which letter namely the following is the tenor:
<quote><p>To the most eminent sovereign and his most excellent son Edwin, king of the English, Honorius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, sendeth greeting.
</p><p>So is the integrity of your Christianity, fired with the flame of faith towards the worship of its founder, that it shineth far and wide, and being declared through all the world bringeth back manifold fruit of your doing. For so do ye know that ye are kings, while, after ye are taught thoroughly by the right and true preaching, ye believe with worshipping of God your King and Creator, and render up to Him the sincere devotion of your mind, as far forth as man's nature can attain unto. For what other thing shall we have power to offer unto our God, than that continuing in good works and confessing Him to be the Author of mankind we hasten to worship Him and render to Him our prayers? And for that reason we exhort you, most excellent
<pb id="p.303"/>
son, as it is meet for a loving father to do, that ye hasten all manner of ways ye can with earnest will and constant supplications to keep this that the mercy of God hath vouchsafed to grant in calling you to His grace; that so He which hath vouchsafed to bring you in this present world, freed from all error, to the acknowledgment of His name, may also prepare a mansion place for you in the heavenly country. Be ye therefore often busied in the reading of Gregory your preacher and my lord of apostolic memory, having before your eyes the goodwill of the teaching of the selfsame, which he gladly practised for the sake of your souls: that so his prayer may both increase your kingdom and your people, and make you to appear in the end without fault before Almighty God. Now as concerning those things which you hoped should be ordained by us for your bishops, we do without any delay and with readiness of mind make it our care to grant them, for the sake of the unfeignedness of your faith, of which we have been commendably informed in divers reports by the bearers of these our presents; and we have sent two palls belonging to the two metropolitans, that is, for Honorius and Paulinus, in order that when one of them is called out of this world to the Author of his being, the other should appoint a bishop in his place by this our authority. And this thing truly we are moved to grant, as well for the good will of your love, as for the situation of such great provinces at the distance which is known to separate us from you, to the intent we might in all points shew our readiness to meet your devotion and act according to your wishes.

</p><p>How Honorius who succeeded Justus in the bishopric of the church of Canterbury received from the same pope Honorius a pall and letter.
</p><p>About this time the archbishop Justus was uplifted to the heavenly realms—the 10th day of November 1—and Honorius was chosen to the prelacy in his room: who coming to Paulinus to be ordained, met him at Lincoln and there was consecrated bishop of the church at Canterbury, being the fifth after Augustine. To whom also the aforesaid pope Honorius sent a pall and letter, in the which he appointed the very selfsame thing that he appointed before in the epistle sent to King Edwin; which is, that when the bishop of Canterbury or the bishop of York hath departed this life, then his fellow of the same degree, which remaineth alive, shall have power to ordain a bishop to succeed, in the room of him which is now deceased; that it may not be needful always to travel and toil over such long space of land and sea as far as to Rome for the ordaining of an archbishop. Of which letter too I have thought it not amiss to insert a copy in this our History.
<quote><p>To Honorius, our dearly beloved brother, Honorius.
</p><p>Among many other good gifts which the pitifulness of our Redeemer vouchsafeth of His grace to give unto His servants, this also doth He mercifully grant by bestowing of the bountifulness of His goodness, that through the brotherly greeting of letters (as it were by a sort of looking on one another). He may (by this our beholding each of the other's visage

in turn) make manifest our mutual unity of love. For which benefit we render thanks unceasingly unto His majesty, and beseech Him with prayers of supplication that He may strengthen your love to endure steadfastly in labouring and gathering fruit in the preaching of the Gospel, and in following the rule of your head and master, holy Gregory, and that He may raise greater increase by you unto the growth of the Church; that the gain which you and your predecessors have won (which springeth out of the first planting of our lord Gregory) may more abundantly be spread by becoming strong through faith and work in the fear of God and in charity; that the very promises uttered by our Lord may hereafter have regard unto you and that that voice of His may call you forth to eternal joyfulness 1: ' Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and I will refresh you.' And again 2: ' Well done, good and faithful servant; because thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord! ' And we for our part, belovedbrethren,sendforward these words of exhortation to you in behalf of the eternal charity, and defer not to grant you the things which again we see are able to be meet for the privileges of your churches. And as in accordance with your request, so in accordance with that of the kings 3 our sons, by our express commandment in the stead of the blessed Peter, chief of the apostles, we grant you authority, that when the Divine Grace hath bidden one of you to be called to Itself, he who shall be left alive must ordain a bishop to be successor in place of the departed one. For which thing's sake also we have sent a pall to each of you, beloved, to be used for celebrating
<pb id="p.309"/>
the same ordination, that by the authority of this our commandment you be able to render the ordination acceptable to God; for that the long spaces of land and sea, which are hindrances betwixt us and you, have compelled us to condescend herein to grant this much unto you, that no loss may happen to your churches by any pretenced occasion in any manner of way; but rather it be possible to set for the farther the devotion of the people committed to your charge. God have you in his safe keeping, most beloved brother.

</p><p>How first the same Honorius and after him John sent letters to the Scottish nation on account of the keeping of Easter as well as on account of the Pelagian heresy.
</p><p>THE same pope Honorius sent a letter also unto the Scottish nation, whom he had learned to be in error in the observation of the holy time of Easter, as we have before specified; earnestly exhorting them that they should not reckon their own small number, set as they were in the utmost ends of the earth, to be wiser than the churches of Christ, either ancient,
<pb id="p.311"/>
either new, which were throughout the world; nor should celebrate another Easter contrary to the commonly accounted Easters, and to the decrees of the bishops of the whole world sitting in synods.
</p><p>Moreover, John, who succeeded Severinus, the successor of the same Honorius, when he was yet but elected to the chief bishopric, sent a letter 1 unto them of great authority and full of good learning for the sake of amending the same error: plainly asserting therein that the Easter Sunday ought to be sought for from the 15th moon up to the 21st, as was approved in the council of Nicaea. Further too he was careful in the same letter to warn them to beware of and eschew the Pelagian heresy which he had learned did begin to rise again amongst them; the beginning of which epistle is this:
<quote><p>To the well beloved and most holy Tomene, Colman, Cronan, Dima and Baeithin, bishops; Cronan, Ernan, Laisren, Scellan and Seghine, priests; Saran and the other doctors or abbots of the Scots, Hilary, arch-presbyter and keeper of the vacant holy see apostolic, John, deacon and in the name of God chosen bishop; also John, superintendent and keeper of the vacant holy see apostolic, and John servant of God, Councillor of the same apostolic see.2 The letters which your bearers have brought to pope Severinus of holy memory, have had no answer made in return to the matters which had been required therein, seeing the pope departed from this life. Which we have now opened, lest the darkness of so great a question might have lasted on and been unexamined,
<pb id="p.313"/>
and we find therein that certain of your province, contrary to the right faith, do go about to renew a new from an old heresy, rejecting through the mist of darkness our Easter in which Christ was sacrificed, and striving to celebrate the same with the Hebrews on the 14th moon.</p></quote> 1 And by this beginning of the latter it appeareth plainly, both that at that time this heresy was but a very little before risen in Scotland, and that not all the country but certain among them only had been entangled therein.
</p><p>Now when the reckoning of the observance of Easter had been set out, they add thereto as follows concerning the Pelagians in the same letter: <q> And this also we understand, that the poison of the Pelagian heresy beginneth to spring again amongst you; and we exhort you to provide that the poisoned crime of this manner of superstition be utterly removed from your minds. For it ought not to be hid from you how also the selfsame abominable heresy hath been condemned: seeing that not only hath it been done away with these 200 years, but also is daily buried by us and condemned with continual cursing; and we exhort you that ye suffer not their ashes to be stirred to life amongst you, whose weapons have been burnt and consumed. For who would not abhor the proud intent and wicked words of them which affirm that a man may live without sin of his own voluntary will, and not through the grace of God? And first of all it is blasphemous folly of speech to say that man is without sin; for none can be so save the one Mediator of God and man, the man Jesus Christ who was conceived and born without sin. For as for other men they are all born with original sin, and are known to bear the witness 
<pb id="p.315"/>
of Adam's fall, yea, though they live without actual sin; according to the prophet, saying:1 'Behold I was shapen in wickedness, and in sin hath my mother conceived me.'</q>

</p><p>How when Edwin was slain Paulinus returned to Kent and there took the prelacy of the church of Rochester.
</p><p>BUT in truth when Edwin reigned most triumphantly seventeen years over the English and the Britons both, of which years for six he himself fought for the kingdom of Christ, Cadwallon 2 king of the Britons made a rebellion against him, having aid thereunto of Penda a stout man of the king's blood of the Marchmen, who also himself from that time was head over the realm of the said nation with divers' fortune two-and-twenty years; and when they had joined battle fiercely in the field which is called Heathfield, 3 Edwin was slain the 12th day of October in the 633rd year of the Lord's incarnation, when he was 48 years of age; and all his army was either destroyed or put to flight. In the which war also one son of his, the warlike young Osfrid, fell before his father; a second, Eadfrid, of urgent necessity fled over to king Penda, and was afterwards put to death against the faith of the king's oath in the reign of Oswald.
</p><p>At which time there was a very great slaughter made in the church and nation of the Northumb-
<pb id="p.317"/>
rians, especially because that one of the captains, which caused it, was a paynim, the other, because he was a savage,was fiercer than the paynim. Forking Penda with all the nation of the Marchmen was given over to idolatry and was ignorant of the Christian name: but indeed Cadwallon, although he had the name of a Christian and professed that life, yet was he in mind and manners so much a savage, that he spared not even the sex of women or the harmless infancy of young children, but delivered them all to death with torments according to his beastly cruelty, wasting a long time and raging over all the provinces, purposing, moreover, with himself to exterminate out of the borders of Britain the whole race of Englishmen. Nay he did not either pay any reverence to the Christian religion which had risen up amongst them. For unto this day the Briton's manner and custom is to set light by the faith and religion of the English, neither in any one point more to communicate with them than with paynims. Now king Edwin's head was brought unto York, and afterwards carried into the church of the blessed apostle Peter (which church he himself began to build, but his successor Oswald finished it, as we have before declared), and there laid in the chapel of the holy pope Gregory, from whose disciples he himself had received the word of life.
</p><p>And so the state of Northumberland being much troubled with the season of this disaster, seeing that there was none other remedy but only by flight,1 Paulinus taking with him queen Ethelberga whom long sithens he had brought to that country, took ship and returned to Kent, and was there very honourably received of Honorius the archbishop and king Eadbald. Moreover, he came with Bassus for guide, a
<pb id="p.319"/>
brave thane of King Edwin's, and Paulinus had with him Eanfled the daughter and Wuscfrea the son of Edwin, as well as Yffi son of Osfrid, Edwin's son, and afterwards their mother Ethelberga, for fear of the kings Eadbald and Oswald, sent her two children into France to be brought up in the court of king Dagobert, who was her friend,1 and there they both died in their infancy, and were buried in the church with such honour as is meet for king's children and innocent babes of Christ. Paulinus brought with him also much precious plate of King Edwin's, amongst which there was too a great golden cross and golden chalice consecrated for the ministry of the altar, which are yet preserved and to be seen in the church of Kent.
</p><p>At which time the church of Rochester was without a pastor, because that Romanus the prelate thereof, being sent from the archbishop Justus as legate to pope Honorius, had been drowned in the waves of the Italian sea; 2 and so for this cause the aforesaid Paulinus, at the offer of Honorius the bishop and Eadbald the king, took the charge thereof and held it until he himself too in his due time ascended to the heavenly realms with the fruit of his glorious travail. Who at his decease left also in his church of Rochester the pall which he had received from the pope of Rome.8
</p><p>Moreover, he had left in his church of York James his deacon, a godly man and true officer of the Church, who living long after in that church by teaching and baptizing took many preys from the old enemy; of whose name the village near Cataract, in which he for the most part abode and dwelt, hath a name to this day- Who because he was cunning in singing in church, when the country was afterwards become

quiet again, and the company of the faithful was increasing, also began to be a master to many of church music according to the fashion of the Romans and Kentish men;1 and he himself when old and full of days, according to the words of Scripture,2 followed the way which his fathers went.

</p><p>How the first successors of king Edwin both did forsake the faith of their nation, and further how the most Christian king Oswald restored both kingdoms [623-634].
</p><p>Now king Edwin being slain in battle, the son of Elfric his uncle by his father's side, called Osric (who after hearing Paulinus preach was instructed in the mysteries of the faith), succeeded to the kingdom of the Deirans in Edwin's stead, of the which province he had had the pedigree of his parentage and the first beginnings of his kingdom. Furthermore, the realm of the Bcrnicians (for the nation of the Northumbrians had been divided of old time into these two provinces) 1 was ruled by Ethelfrith's son, named Eanfrid, who had of that province the beginning of his kindred and kingdom. For in all the time of Edwin's reign the sons of the aforenamed king Ethelfrith, who had reigned before Edwin, were banished with a great number of young nobles and so lived amongst the Scots and Redshanks, 2 and there they were instructed and renewed by the grace of baptism according to the doctrine of the Scots. And these princes as being suffered after the death of the king their enemy to return to their country, the
<pb id="p.327"/>
<note type="margin">CADWALLON'S CRUELTY</note>
eldest of them, whom we have named, Eanfrid took the kingdom of the Bernicians. Each of which kings, when the lot of the diadem of an earthly kingdom fell to him, execrated and forsook the mysteries of the heavenly kingdom in which he had been initiated, and yielded himself again to be defiled and lost with the former old filth of idolatry.
</p><p>And without delay Cadwallon, the king of the Britons, slew both of them, with pitiless might but righteous vengeance. And first, the next summer ensuing, he destroyed Osric with his whole army, bursting out upon him with all his men and taking him unprepared, after Osric had pended him in the fenced town.1 Then afterward by the space of a whole year he held the provinces of the people of Northumberland, not as a king that were a conqueror but as an outrageous cruel tyrant, destroying them and with tragical slaughter rending them to pieces; and at length by a like fate he condemned Eanfrid to death when he came unto him unadvisedly with 12 chosen thanes, minding to entreat upon peace. That year continueth also unto this day unhappy and hateful to all good men, as well for the apostasy of the English kings, whereby they had put from them the mysteries of the faith, as for the British king's furious tyranny. Wherefore all they that reckon the chronicles of the kings, have thought it best to take away from the midst the memory of the apostate kings, and assign the same year to the reign of the king that followed next, that is to say, Oswald, a man beloved of God: who, after that his brother Eanfrid was slain, coming unlooked for with a small army, but fenced with the faith of Christ, the Britons' cursed captain and that innumerable host, whereof

</p><p>How of the wood of the cross which the same king had set up, when he was going to fight against the barbarians, innumerable miracles of healing were, wrought, and among them a certain man was cured of the feebleness of an afflicted arm.
</p><p>Now that place is shewed until this day and is had in great reverence, where Oswald, when he should come to this battle, did set up the sign of the holy cross, and beseeched the Lord on bended knees, that with His heavenly help He should succour His worshippers being in so sore a strait. In short, the report is that (the cross being made with quick speed and the hole prepared wherein it should be set), the king himself, being fervent in faith, did take it in haste and did put it in the hole, and further held it with both his hands when it was set up until it was fastened to the earth with dust which the soldiers heaped about it. And when this was done, he lifted up his voice and cried out aloud to the whole army: <q> Let us all bend our knees and together pray earnestly the almighty, living and true God of His mercy to defend us from the proud and cruel enemy: for He knoweth that we have enterprised warfare in a rightful quarrel for the safeguard of our nation.</q> All did as he had commanded; and thus in the dawning of the day they marched forward against the enemy, and according
<pb id="p.331"/>
<note type="margin">HEFENFELTH</note>
to the merit of their faith achieved the victory. In the place of which prayer manifold mighty works of healing are known to have been wrought, questionless in token and remembrance of the king's faith. For even until this present day many men do customably cut chips from the very wood of the holy cross, and when they have put them into water and given thereof to sick men or beasts to drink, or sprinkled them therewith, the sick are shortly restored to health.
</p><p>That place is in the English tongue called Hefenfelth, which in the Latin can have the meaning Heaven's Field, which got its name so long before not without a sure and certain foresight of things to come, as signifying undoubtedly that in the same place a heavenly memorial was to be set up, a heavenly victory should be begun, heavenly miracles should be ever wrought even unto our days. Now the place is near to that wall which standeth towards the north, wherewith the Romans did once compass all whole Britain from sea to sea to keep off the invasions of the barbarians, as we have declared before.1 In the which very place the brethren of Hexham church, which is not far from thence, do, of custom now long time established, come every year, the day before that upon which the same king Oswald was slain, to keep dirges there for his soul, and after many psalms of praise being said solemnly, to offer for him in the morning the sacrifice of holy oblation. And they too, as this good custom increased in fame, made the place more holy and more honoured of all men by reason of the church that was lately builded in the same place. And not without a cause, considering that (as we have learned), no sign of the

<note type="margin">HEALING OF BOTHELM</note>
</p><p>Christian faith, no church, no altar was set up in all the country of the Bernicians, before that this new captain of warfare, at the bidding of his devout faith, did set up this banner of the holy cross, as he was going to give battle to his terrible enemy.
</p><p>And it is not amiss to relate fully one marvellous mighty work out of many which have been wrought at this cross. One of the brethren of Hexham church, called Bothelm, who liveth yet at this day, a few years past, when in the nigh the was stepping heedlessly upon ice, suddenly falling down crushed his arm, and began to be so vexed with the grievous trouble of the hurt thereof, that for vehemency of pain he was not even able to bring his arm in any way to his mouth. And this man,hearing one morning that one of the brethren had appointed to go up to the place of the same holy cross, prayed him that at his return he would bring him a piece of that venerable wood, saying that he believed that he could thereby by the gift of the Lord gain his health. The brother did as he was desired; and when he was come home again about evening, the brethren being now set at the table to eat, he gave the afflicted party some of the old moss that was grown upon the over most part of the wood. Who sitting then at table and having at hand no better place to lay up the gift wherewith he was presented, put it into his bosom. And when he went to bed, forgetting to put this moss anywhere else he let it remain in his bosom. But at midnight he waked, and feeling a cold thing lying near to his side and moving his hand thereto to find what that should be, he found his arm and hand whole and sound, as if he had never had aught of such great feebleness.

</p><p>How the same king asking for a bishop from the Scottish nation received Aidan, and gave the same the see of a bishopric in the isle of Lindisfarne.
</p><p>THE same Oswald therefore, as soon as he was come to the throne, being desirous that all the people whom he began to rule, should be filled with the grace of the Christian faith, whereof he had now gotten very great proofs in vanquishing the barbarians, sent to the aldermen of the Scots, among whom he, living in banishment and the soldiers which were with him, had obtained the sacraments of baptism; making request unto them that they would send him a prelate, by whose teaching and ministry the English people which he ruled might both learn the gifts of our Lord's faith and receive the sacraments. And not long after he obtained what he sought: for he received Aidan as bishop, a man of marvellous meekness, godliness, and sobriety, and one that had the zeal of God, though not fully according to knowledge. For he was wont to keep Easter Sunday from the 14th day after the change of the moon until the 20th 1 according to the custom of his nation, whereof we have divers times made mention. For the north province of the Scots 2 and all the nation of the Redshanks did at that time still solemnize Easter Sunday by that rule, thinking that in this keeping of Easter they had followed the advertisement written by the holy and praiseworthy father Anatolius. 3 And whether this be true, everyone that is skilled very readily knoweth. Furthermore, the Scottish nations which dwelt in the southern parts of the isle of Ireland
<pb id="p.337"/>
<note type="margin">LINDISFARNE</note>
had long agone learned to keep Easter by the canonical approved custom, being advised thereto by the bishop of the apostolic sec.
</p><p>To bishop Aidan then, upon his coming, the king appointed his episcopal see in the island of Lindisfarne, 1 where the bishop himself desired it to be. Which same place with flowing and ebbing of the tide is twice every day environed like an island with the surges, twice joined on the mainland, the shore being voided again of the sea waves; and so following humbly and readily in all things the advice of the bishop, the king set himself very diligently to build up and enlarge the Church of Christ in his realm. Wherein it often fell out that there was a gracious and pleasant sight seen, when the bishop, who was unskilful of the English tongue, was preaching the Gospel, and the king himself was interpreter of the heavenly word to his aldermen and thanes: for that by reason of his long banishment in Scotland 2 he had by now come to understand the tongue quite well. Hereupon a greater number began as the days went on to come from the country of the Scots to Britain, and with great devotion to preach the word of faith to those provinces of the English over which king Oswald reigned, and as many of them as were endowed with the degree of priesthood to minister the grace of baptism to them that believed. Therefore churches were builded throughout the districts, the people flocked joyfully to hear the word, possessions were given by the king's bountifulness and pieces of land for the foundation of religious houses, and the little children of the English along with elder folks were instructed under Scottish
<pb id="p.339"/>
<note type="margin">IONA AND COLUMBA</note>
teachers in the studies and observation of monastic rule.
</p><p>For they were for the most part monks who had come to preach. Aidan the bishop was himself a monk, seeing that he had been sent from the island which is called Hy 1: the monastery of which island was no small time the head house of all the monasteries almost of the northern Scots 2 and of all the Redshanks, and had the sovereignty in ruling of all their people. The which isle in very deed belongeth to the right of Britain, being severed from it with a narrowed sea, but by the free gift of the Redshanks, who inhabit those coasts of Britain, had been long ago handed over to the Scottish monks, in consideration that by the preaching of those monks they received the faith of Christ.

</p><p>When the nation of the Redshanks received the faith of Christ.
</p><p>FOR in the 565th year of the Lord's incarnation (at which time Justin the younger, succeeding Justinian, received the governance of the Roman empire), there came to Britain from Ireland a priest and abbot notable by his dress and life of a monk, called Columba, to preach the word of God to the provinces of the northern Redshanks, that is to say. to those that by high and hideous ridges of hills 3
<pb id="p.341"/>
<note type="margin">NINIAN AND COLUMBA</note>
were dissevered from the southern regions inhabited by Redshanks. For these same southern Redshanks who have their dwelling-places inside of the same mountains, had as they say, long before abandoned the error of idolatry and received the true faith, at what time the word was preached unto them by the most reverend bishop and holy man Ninian, a Briton born, who had been fully taught at Rome according to rule the faith of the mysteries of the truth; whose episcopal see, made notable for the name and church of the holy bishop Martin (where Ninian himself doth rest in the body along together with many holy men), the English nation holdeth at this very time. Which place appertaining to the Bernicians' province, is commonly called At White Building,1 for so much as there be made a church of stone, after another fashion than the Britons were wont to build.
</p><p>Now Columba came to Britain when the most puissant king Bruide, Maelchon's son, reigned over the Redshanks in the 9th year of his reign, and did by word and example convert that nation to the faith of Christ: in consideration whereof too the aforesaid isle was given to him in possession to make a monastery. For the isle is not great either, but as though it were of 5 households by estimation of the English 2; and his successors keep it until this day, and there he himself lieth buried, dying at the age of 77 years, about 32 years after that he came to Britain to preach. But before that he travelled to Britain, he had made a famous monastery in Ireland, which for the great store of oaks is in the Scottish tongue called Dearmach, that is to say, the field of oaks.3 Of both the which monasteries very many more

<note type="margin">SCOTIC ORGANIZATION</note>
religious houses were afterwards built in addition by his scholars both in Britain and in Ireland: of all the which, the same monastery that is m the isle wherein his body lieth, is the head house.
</p><p>Moreover, the same isle is always wont to have an abbot that is a priest to be the ruler, to whose law both the whole district 1 and also the bishops themselves ought, after an unaccustomed order, to be subject, according to the example of that first teacher who was no bishop, but a priest and a monk: of whose life and sayings the report is that some things remain written by his scholars.2 But yet what manner of man so ever he was, we know this of him for a surety, that he left successors, men that excelled in continency and love of God and practice of religious lift: in observing in deed the time of the high feast of Easter they followed uncertain cycles, and no marvel, considering that, being men set so far removed from the rest of the world, no man sent unto them the decrees made in synods 3 for the keeping thereof: they diligently observed only such works of devotion and chaste conversation as they could learn in the Prophets, the Gospels and in the Apostles' writings. Now this keeping of Easter remained no small time with them, that is to wit, until the 715th year of the Lord's incarnation, by the space of 150 years.
</p><p>But when the most reverend and holy father and priest Egbert 4 came to them from the English nation, living in Christ's quarrel in exile long time in Ireland, and being a man very well learned in the Scriptures
<pb id="p.345"/>
<note type="margin">CELTIC EASTER</note>
and singular for the perfect life he led for many years, they were reformed by him and brought to keep Easter on the true and lawful day; nevertheless, they did not even before that time solemnize and keep it always upon the 14th day after the change of the moon, according to the Jews' custom (as some men supposed), but on the Sunday, though yet in another week than was convenient. For they knew, as Christian men do, that the resurrection of our Lord, which was on the first day of the week, ought always to be celebrated on the first day of the week: but as ignorant and high up landish men, they had no wise learned when the same first day of the week, which is now named Sunday, should come. Yet forasmuch as they have not ceased to be fervent in the grace of charity, they have also deserved to attain the perfect knowledge of this thing too, according as the apostle promiseth, saying:1 <q>And if in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this also unto you.</q> But hereof we must treat more at large hereafter in a place convenient.

</p><p>Of the life of Aidan the bishop.
</p><p>FROM this isle therefore, from the convent of these monks, Aidan was sent to instruct the province of the English in Christ, after he had received the order of bishop. At which time Seghine, abbot and priest, was head of the same monastery. Whereby among other lessons of living, Aidan left the clerks a most wholesome example of abstinence and continence; and this thing did chiefly commend his doctrine to all
<pb id="p.347"/>
<note type="margin">AIDAN'S EXAMPLE</note>
men, that the learning which he taught was correspondent to the life he led with his brethren.1 For he took no thought to gain anything of this world or to be enamoured of it. His joy was forthwith to give away to the poor that might meet him all that was granted him of kings or wealthy men of the world. He was wont to travel abroad through all places both in towns and country, not riding on horseback but walking on foot, except peradventure a greater need had forced him to ride: in order that, wherever he had espied any, whether rich or poor, as he walked, incontinent turning aside to these, either he allured them to the mystery of receiving the faith, if they were out of the faith, or strengthened them in their faith, if they were in it, and exhorted them no less in deeds than in words to almsgiving and the execution of good works.
</p><p>Moreover, his life was so far removed from the slackness of our time, that all they which walked with him, were they professed into religion or were they laymen, must needs study; that is, bestow then-time either in reading Scripture or in learning the Psalter. This was the daily exercise of him and of all who were with him, to what place so ever they came. And if by chance it had happened (which yet happened seldom) that he were bidden to the king's banquet, he went in accompanied with one or two clerks; and after a short repast, he made speedily haste to read with his brethren or else went forth to pray. All men and women under religious rule, being at that time taught by his examples, took a custom all the year through, saving only the 50 days after Easter, to prolong their fasting the 4th and 6th days of the week until the ninth hour.2 If rich men had
<pb id="p.349"/>
done anything amiss, he never for hope of honour or fear of displeasure spared to tell them of it; but with sharp rebuking amended them. Never was he wont to give any money to the great men of the world (making them only good cheer, if he had received any to hospitality), but rather such gifts as in money were liberally given him by rich men, he did either (as we have said) give them in a dole for the relief of the poor, or else he laid them out for the ransoming of those that had been wrongfully sold.1 Finally, many of such as he had ransomed by payment of money he made after his scholars, and by bringing them up in learning and virtue advanced them to the degree of priesthood.
</p><p>Now the report is that when king Oswald desired first to have a prelate out of the province of the Seots, who might preach the word of faith to him and his people, another man of a more austere stomach was first sent, who (when after a while preaching to the English people he did nothing prevail nor was willingly heard of the people) returned to his own country, and so in the assembly of the elders he made relation that in teaching he had been able to do the people no good, to whom he had been sent, forasmuch as they were folk that might not be tamed, and of a hard capacity and fierce nature. Then the elders (as they say) began in council to treat at long what were best to be done; being in deed desirous that the people should have the salvation which they were asked to give them, but sorry that the preacher whom they had sent was not welcomed. Then Aidan (for he also was himself present at the council) saith unto the priest whose ease was in question: <q> Methinketh, brother, that you have been more rigorous than reason
<pb id="p.351"/>
would have with unlearned hearers, and that you have not, according to the apostle's instruction,1 first given them the milk of milder doctrine, until by little and little, nourished with the word of God, they were able to receive the more perfect things and fulfil the higher commandments of God.</q> This being heard, all that were at the assembly turned their faces, and looking at the speaker debated diligently his saying, and concluded that he was himself worthy of the bishopric, and should himself be sent to instruct the unbelieving and unlearned, who before all things was tried to be filled with the grace of discretion, the mother of all virtues; and so ordaining 2 him they sent him to preach. Who, when he had taken the opportunity given, even as before he was seen to be guided by discretion, so did he afterwards shew himself to be beautified with all other virtues.

</p><p>Of king Oswald's wonderful religion and passing piety.
</p><p>KING Oswald therefore with that part of the English nation of whom he was sovereign governor, being instructed in this prelate's doctrine, did not only learn to hope for the heavenly kingdoms unknown to his forefathers; but also won earthly kingdoms more than any of his ancestors did, by the power of the same one God who make heaven and earth. Briefly, all the nations and provinces of Britain which had four divers languages,3 that is to say, those of the Britons, the Redshanks, the Scots and English, became subject unto him.
<pb id="p.353"/>
</p><p>And being advanced to so royal a majesty he was ever, notwithstanding (which is marvellous to be reported), lowly, gracious and bountiful to the poor and strangers. In short it is reported that at a certain time when on the holy day of Easter the king with the foresaid bishop were set down to dinner, and a silver dish replenished with princely dainties was set on the table before him, and they were now on the point of putting forth their hands to bless the bread, suddenly there entered in his officer to whom was committed the charge to relieve the needy, and told the king that a very great number of poor people arriving from all places did sit in the public ways, desiring some alms from the king: who by and by gave commandment that the delicacies which were set before his own person should be bestowed on the. poor, and moreover the dish of silver be broken and by piecemeal parted among the same. At the sight whereof the bishop set by the king, being delighted with such an act of goodness, took him by the right hand and said: <q> May this hand never wax old.</q> Which thing came even so to pass according to the prayer of his blessing. For whereas, after that the king was slain in battle (his hands, with his arms being cut off from the residue of his body),it happened that his hands to this day continue uncorrupted. In fact they are preserved within a silver shrine in the church of St. Peter, and are worshipped by all men with worthy honour in the king's city,1 which hath his name of a lady sometime queen, called Bebba.
</p><p>By this king's travail the provinces of the Deirans and Bernicians, which until that time were at variance with one another, were reconciled, and as it were joined together into one people. Now Oswald was
<pb id="p.355"/>
<note type="margin">BIRINUS IN WESSEX</note>
king Edwin's nephew by his sister Aeha's side, and it was meet that so noble a predecessor should have so worthy an heir, as well of his religion as of his realm, and that of his own kindred.

</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="7"><p>
</p><p>How the province of the West Saxons received the word of God by Birinus' preaching; and of Agilbert and Lothere his successors.
</p><p>AT that time the people of the West Saxons (who of old time were called Gewissas) received the faith of Christ in the reign of Cynegils, Birinus the bishop preaching to them the word, who had come to Britain with the consent of pope Honorius, promising in his presence that he would sow the seeds of the holy faith in the heart of the coasts of the English beyond, whither no teacher had gone before him. In consideration whereof too at the commandment of the same pope, he was consecrated to the order of bishop by the hands of Asterius bishop of Genoa.1 But at his arrival into Britain and first entering among the folk of the Gewissas, whereas he found all the inhabitants in the same country utterly paynim, he thought it more expedient to preach the word there,-rather than in travelling further to search for such as he should preach unto.
</p><p>And thus at his preaching of the Gospel in the foresaid province, when the king himself, after being taught, was cleansed in the font of baptism with his people, it happened at that time that Oswald, the most holy and very victorious king of Northumberland
<pb id="p.357"/>
<note type="margin">SEE OF DORCHESTER</note>
was present and lifted Cynegils up as he came forth from the laver, in an alliance most lovely altogether and worthy of God, in that Oswald took for his godson the very man whose daughter he was to take to wife, after this man had been first dedicated to God by a second birth. Moreover, both kings gave the same bishop the city which is called Dorcic 1 to make there his episcopal see; where, after that he had builded and dedicated churches and by his godly pains brought much people to the Lord, he passed to the Lord and was buried in the same city, and many years after, when Heddi was bishop, he was conveyed from thence over to the city of Wenta,2 and laid in the church of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul.
</p><p>But when the king too died, his son Cenwalh succeeded him in the kingdom, who refused to receive the faith and sacraments of the kingdom of heaven, and shortly after lost the power of his earthly kingdom also. For putting away the sister of Penda, king of the Marchmen, whom he had married, he took another wife: and for that cause he was by Penda assaulted with battle and deposed from his kingdom, and departed to the king of the East English, who was called Anna: with whom living in banishment by the space of three years he learned and received the true faith. For the king with whom he lived in banishment was both himself a virtuous man and was blessed with virtuous and holy issue, as we shall declare hereafter.3
</p><p>Now when Cenwalh had been restored to his kingdom, there came out of Ireland into his province a certain prelate,4 named Agilbert, a Frenchman born, yet having made long abode in Ireland for the sake of reading the Scriptures; and this bishop joined
<pb id="p.359"/>
</p><p>A GILBERT AND WINI
himself to the king, taking upon him of his own accord the ministry of preaching: and the king, seeing his learning and industry, entreated him to receive the see of a bishopric there and remain as bishop of his people; which he consenting to his prayers accepted, and ruled the same people many years with the authority of bishop. At the length the king, who could only speak the Saxon tongue, being weary with Agilbert's foreign way of speech, did privily bring into the province another bishop of his own language named Wini, the which also was ordained in France; and dividing the province into two dioceses gave to this bishop his see in the city of Wenta which is called by the Saxon folk Wintancaestir: wherefore Agilbert, being highly displeased because the king did this without his counsel, returned to France,1 and after he had received the bishopric of the city of Paris, died in the same place an old man and full of days. Moreover, when not many years had past after his departure from Britain, Wini was by the same king driven from his bishopric: who departing to the king of the Marchmen, called Wulfhere, bought of the same with money the see of the city of London,2 and continued bishop thereof up to the end of his life. And so the province of the West Saxons lacked no small time a bishop.
</p><p>At which time also the foresaid king of the selfsame nation, being very often distressed with grievous losses which in his kingdom he sustained by his enemies, called at last to his mind that the falling away from the faith long ago drove him from his kingdom, while the acknowledgment of Christ's faith brought him back again: and he understood, that also at that time the province, being forsaken of
<pb id="p.361"/>
<note type="margin">LOTHERE MADE BISHOP</note>
a prelate, was rightfully withal forsaken of divine help. Therefore he sent ambassadors into France to Agilbert, offering to make satisfaction, and beseeching him to return and resume the bishopric of his people. But Agilbert excusing himself testified that he could not repair thither because he was fast bound to abide at his bishopric which he had in his own city and diocese; nevertheless, to the end he might somewhat help him who did most earnestly desire him, he sent thither in his stead Lothere, a priest, his own nephew, who should be ordained bishop for him, if it were the king's pleasure; affirming that he deemed him to be well worthy of the bishopric. Which Lothere was honourably received of the people and the king, and they entreated Theodore,1 then archbishop of the church of Canterbury, that Lothere should be consecrated their bishop: who, being consecrated in that same city, by the space of many years exercised his office as sole bishop of the Gewissas with diligent direction in accordance with the decree of the synod.2

</p><p>How Earconbert, King of the Kentish men, gave commandment for idols to be destroyed; and of his daughter Earcongota and kinswoman Ethelberga, virgins dedicated to God.
</p><p>In the 640th year of the Lord's incarnation Eadbald, King of the men of Kent, passing out of this life left the direction of the kingdom to his son Earconbert: which, when he had undertaken, he did prosperously hold by the space of 24 years and
<pb id="p.363"/>
<note type="margin">MONASTERIES IN FRANCE</note>
certain months. This was the first King of England who of his princely authority commanded that the idols in all his whole realm should be forsaken and destroyed, and at the same time that the fast of 10 days 1 should be kept. And, that this his authority might not lightly be despised by any man, he appointed meet and convenient punishments for the transgressors thereof. Earcongota, this prince's daughter, as a worthy child of such a father, was a virgin that did mighty works, serving the Lord in the monastery that was builded in the country of the Franks by an honourable abbess called Fara in the place named In Brige.2 For in those days, when many monasteries were not yet builded in the country of the English, many were wont for the sake of religious life to go to the religious houses of the Franks or Gaul; moreover, they 3 sent their daughters to the same to be brought up and married to the heavenly bridegroom; chiefly in the monastery of Brige and of Cale 4 and of Andilegum,5 among whom Saethryd, daughter to the wife of Anna, King of the East English (of which king we have made mention before), and Ethelberga the said king's natural 6 daughter: who, though strangers, were both made abbesses of the same monastery of Brige by reason of their worthy virtues. And this king's elder daughter Sexberg, wife of Earconbert, King of Kent, had a daughter Earcongota, and of her we will now treat.
</p><p>Now the inhabitants of that place are wont even at this day to tell of many mighty works and miraculous signs wrought by this virgin dedicated to God. But let us be contented to speak somewhat shortly only of her departure and passage to the
<pb id="p.365"/>
<note type="margin">EARCONGOTA'S DEATH</note>
heavenly kingdoms. The day then of her calling being at hand, she began to visit in the monastery the cells of the sick handmaids of Christ, and especially of such her sisters as either for advanced age or for virtuous conversation were more notable than other: unto the prayers of all whom lowly commending herself, she hid not from them that, as she had learned by revelation, her death would very shortly come to pass: and this revelation, certes, she related to be of this manner: she said she had seen a company of men apparelled in white enter into the same monastery; and that these when asked by her what they sought for or what they would there, answered that they were sent thither to the end that they might take with them that golden coin 1 which had come from Kent to that place. And on the selfsame night (in the last part whereof, that is to say, when dawn was beginning, she passing over the darkness of the present world departed to the light that is above) many of the brethren of the same monastery 2 which were in other houses, reported that they heard el early the melody of angels harping together, and, moreover, the noise as it were of a very great multitude coming into the monastery: whereupon they, by and by going forth to know what manner of thing it were, saw that there was an exceeding great light sent forth from heaven, which led that holy soul, delivered out of the prison of the flesh, to the everlasting joys of the heavenly country. Besides this they report of other miracles which were shewn by the hand of God that very night in the same monastery: but we, passing to other things, do leave these to the religious persons of the monastery to relate. Further, the honourable body of Christ's virgin and spouse
<pb id="p.367"/>
was buried in the church of the blessed first martyr Stephen: and it was thought good three days after the burial that the stone wherewith the grave was covered should be laid aside and reared up higher in the very same place: at the doing whereof such a sweet-smelling savour did break forth from the bottom of the earth, that to all the brethren and sisters that stood by there seemed as though there were store chambers of balm natural opened.
</p><p>Yea, furthermore, Ethelberga, aunt by the mother's side to this Earcongota of whom we have treated, even she also in great chastity of body preserved the glory beloved of God, that resteth in perpetual virginity: and how virtuous a virgin she was, it was better known after her death. For when she was abbess, she began in her monastery to build a church in honour of all the apostles, wherein she willed her body to be buried. But, the work being well near half done, she was snatched away by death, that she might not complete it, and was buried in that very place of the church where she desired. After whose death, the brethren more intending upon other things, the building of this church ceased by the space of 7 years, which being expired, they determined utterly to leave off the building of it, for the excessive labour thereof; yet appointed to convey into another church, which had been completed and dedicated, the bones of the abbess that were taken up out of that place. And opening her grave they found her body so undeeayed as it was free from the corruption of carnal concupiscence: and so when they had washed it once again and clad it in other attire, they carried it over into the church of the blessed martyr Stephen; the
<pb id="p.369"/>
day of which martyr's birth is there customably kept solemn in great glory the seventh day of July.

</p><p>How that many miracles in doing of cures were wrought in the place where King Oswald was slain; and how that first the horse of a certain traveller was healed, and afterwards a young girl was healed of the palsy.
</p><p>Now Oswald, the most Christian king of Northumberland, reigned 9 years, that year being also reckoned in, which both the deadly cruelty of the king of the Britons and the mad apostasy of the English kings had made abominable. For (as we have declared before 1), it was agreed upon with one accord by all, that the name and memory of them that fell away should be utterly razed out of the roll of Christian kings, neither any year be registered in their reign. And when the course of his years was fulfilled, Oswald was slain in the field, in a cruel battle, by the same paynim people and paynim king of the Marchmen by whom also his predecessor Edwin had been killed,- in a place which in the tongue of the English is called Maserfelth,3 in the,'58th year of his age, on the fifth day of the month August.
</p><p>And how great the faith of this king was in God, what devotion of mind he had, appeared also after his death, by the miracles due to his virtues. For to this day cures of the sick, both men and beasts, cease not to be continually wrought in the place where he was slain of the heathen, fighting for his
<pb id="p.371"/>
country. Whereof it came to pass that many carried away the very dust where his body fell upon the earth, and easting it into water brought much comfort to their sick thereby. Which custom indeed was so often practised that by little and little, as the earth was taken away from there, a hole was made to the measure of a man's height. And no marvel that sick people are healed in the place where he died, who always during his lifetime ceased not to consider the sick and needy, to bestow alms and to give help. And, verily, many miracles due to his virtues are related to have been done in that place or from the dust of that place; but we have thought it sufficient to rehearse only two 1 which we have heard of our elders.
</p><p>Not long time having passed after this prince's death, it fortuned a man on horseback to journey near that place, whose horse began suddenly to become tired, to stand still, to hang down his head to the earth, to foam at the mouth, and with increase of excessive pain to fall to the earth. The rider lighted down, and taking off the saddle began to tarry for the hour when either he should get back the horse in better case or leave it dead. But the beast being of long time troubled with grievous pain, as it tumbled itself this way and that, wallowed in the end of a sudden to that place where the king of worthy memory fell. And incontinent the pain ceasing, the horse left the inordinate motions of his limbs, and after the customable manner of horses rolling itself, as if it had been weary, upon either side in turn and forthwith rising as if whole in all ways, it began more greedily than wont to crop the green grass of the field.
<pb id="p.373"/>
<note type="margin">GIRL WITH PALSY</note>
</p><p>At the sight whereof the rider, as a man of quick wit, understood that some singular holiness was in that place where the horse was healed; and putting a mark there, he shortly after mounted his horse and rode to the inn whither he had purposed to travel: upon reaching which he found a damsel there, granddaughter to the good man of the house, of a long time diseased with a grievous palsy: and whereas the household of the inn did complain in his presence of the damsel's sore sickness, he began to tell them of the place where his horse had been healed. What need many words? They set her on a cart, and brought her to the place and laid her down upon the spot. But she, when set in the place, slept for a small time; and when she waked, feeling herself cured of that her helplessness of body, she called for water and herself washed her face, dressed up her hair, covered her head with a linen cloth 1 and walking soundly on her feet returned with them who had brought her thither.

</p><p>How the dust of that place prevailed against fire.
</p><p>ABOUT the same time there came a certain other traveller of the British nation, journeying, as the bruit is, near the very place wherein the foresaid battle was brought to its end; and he espied one plot more green and pleasant than was the residue of the field: and began of quickness of wit to guess, that there should be no other cause of the unwonted greenness of that place, save that on that same spot some one man holier than the rest of the army had
<pb id="p.375"/>
<note type="margin">MIRACLE IN A FIRE</note>
been slain. Accordingly he stole away with him some of the dust of that earth, knitting it up in a linen cloth, deeming with himself, as indeed was to come to pass, that the same dust might be profitable for the remedy of sick persons; and continuing with his journey he came in the evening to a certain village, and entered into a house in which the villagers were at feast supping; and being received by the masters of the house, sat down himself also at their entertainment, hanging upon one of the posts of the wall the linen cloth with the dust which he had brought. And as they set themselves further to feasting and drinking, a great fire being lighted in the midst, it happened that, the sparks flying up aloft, the roof of the house, which was built of twigs and thatched, was suddenly caught on fire and filled with flames. And when the guests espied this with sudden distress of panic, they fled out of doors, having no power to save the house now on fire and on the point of being consumed. The house, therefore, being destroyed with the flames, only the post (whereon the dust hanged, enclosed in the cloth) continued safe from the fire and therewith not hurt at all. At the sight of which mighty work they marvelled much, and with diligent inquiry and examination found out that the dust had been taken from that place where king Oswald's blood had been shed. And after that these miracles had been manifestly known and bruited abroad, much people began, as the days passed, to resort to that place and obtain there the grace of cures for themselves and their kin.

</p><p>How that a light from heaven stood all night over king Oswald's relics; and how that they which were possessed with evil spirits were healed by those relics.
</p><p>AND amongst these things it must, I think, in no wise be passed over in silence how mighty a work and heavenly miracle was shewed when king Oswald's bones were found and conveyed to the church wherein they are now kept. Now this was done by the diligence of Osthryth, 1 the queen of the Marchmen, who was daughter of Oswald's brother, that is to say, of Oswy who after Oswald held the headship of the kingdom, as we shall declare in the process that followeth.
</p><p>There is a famous monastery in the province of Lindsey named Beardaneu,2 which the same queen and her husband Ethelred did greatly love, honour and reverence, wherein she desired to lay up her uncle's honoured bones: and when the chariot was come, wherein the same bones were brought at the fall of the evening unto the foresaid monastery, the men that were in the monastery would not gladly admit them: because, although they knew him to be a holy man, notwithstanding, forasmuch as he was sprung from another province and took upon him to be king over them, they pursued him also after his death with the hatred they had of old. Whereby it came to pass that that same night the relics that were brought thither did remain still without, only a pavilion larger than ordinary being stretched out over the chariot wherein the relics were. But the showing of a heavenly miracle did manifestly declare
<pb id="p.379"/>
</p><p>A PILLAR OF LIGHT
with how great reverence those relics ought to be received of all faithful people. For all that night long a pillar of light reaching from that chariot unto heaven stood so that it was plainly seen in all places almost of the same province of Lindsey. Wherefore, when the morning was come, the brethren of that monastery, who on the day before had denied, began of themselves earnestly to desire that the same relics, holy and beloved of God, might be laid up in their house. Therefore the bones were washed and after enclosed in a shrine which they had provided for this purpose, and placed in the church with honour convenient: and to the end that the holy man's princely personage might always be remembered, they placed besides over his tomb his standard fashioned of purple and gold, and the very water wherein they washed his bones they poured out in .1 corner of the cemetery. From -which time forward it came to pass, that the earth itself that received the venerable washing had effect of health giving grace for driving away of devils from the bodies that were possessed.
</p><p>Finally, in process of time, when the foresaid queen abode in the same monastery, there came to greet her a certain honourable abbess which liveth until this day, by name Ethelhild, sister of the holy men Ethelwin and Aldwin, the first of which was bishop in the province of Lindsey, the second was abbot in the monastery which is called Peartaneu,1 not far from which she also had her monastery. When then the abbess coming communed with the queen, and among other matters, after they began to fall in talk of Oswald, said that she herself too had seen on that night the light above his relics, which in height
<pb id="p.381"/>
</p><p>A DEMONIAC GUEST
reached up to heaven, the queen thereto added that many sick folk had already been healed with the dust of the pavement on the which the water of the washing of his bones was poured out. Then the abbess desired to have some deal of the health-giving dust bestowed on her; and as soon as she received it she knit it up in a cloth and laid it up in a little casket, and returned home. And after some time had passed, when she was in her own monastery, a certain stranger came thither, who in the night season was wont divers times to be troubled suddenly with a foul spirit and that most grievously. And this guest, when he had been liberally entertained and had laid his limbs to rest upon a bed after supper, on a sudden being seized by the devil began to cry out, to gnash with his teeth, to foam at the mouth, and twist his limbs, flinging them now one way, now another. And when no man had been able to hold or bind him, a servant ran and knocking at the gate told the abbess. Then she opening the door of the monastery came forth herself with one of the nuns to the place where the brethren lay, and calling forth a priest required him to go with her to the patient. Where, when at their coming they saw many men present who, for all their endeavour to keep down the party afflicted and to stay his inordinate movements, availed nothing, the priest pronounced exorcisms 1 and did all that he could for the appeasing of the rage that this piteous creature was in. But neither was the priest himself, for all his much travail, able to avail aught. And when it seemed that no way of amendment was left for the mad body, the abbess suddenly remembered that aforesaid dust, and forthwith commanded a handmaid to go and bring her the

<note type="margin">CURE OF DEMONIAC</note>
little casket wherein the dust was. And she bringing it as she was commanded, as she entered the court of the house (in the inward part whereof the man that was possessed with the evil spirit was tormented), the man suddenly held his peace and laid down his head as though he were fallen asleep, and settled all his limbs to rest.
</p><p>Whist were they all and set their faces attentive,1
carefully looking to see what end the matter would have. And after some hour's space the man that was before disquieted sat up and fetching a deep sigh said: <q> Now I feel myself whole, for I have come to my wits again.</q> Whereupon they inquired of him earnestly how this had happened. And he said: <q> Incontinent as soon as this maid, with the little casket which she was bringing, was come nigh to the court of this house, all the wicked spirits that troubled me departed and leaving me appeared no more.</q> Then did the abbess give him a little piece of that dust; and so, when the priest there had offered prayer, he passed the night in most quiet rest: neither from that time forth did he suffer any night alarm or trouble from his old enemy.

</p><p>How a little boy sitting hard by Oswald's tomb was healed of an ague.
</p><p>IN the time following after this there was a certain little boy in the same monastery, who had been a great while sorely distressed with trouble of fevers: who on a certain day looking heavily for the hour of

<note type="margin">CURE OF BOY</note>
the attack, one of the brethren coming in to him saith: <q> Wilt thou, my son, that I teach thee how thou mayest be delivered of the grief of this sickness? Rise, go into the church, and when thou comest to Oswald's sepulchre, sit down there and abiding quietly cleave unto the tomb! Beware thou go not from thence nor stir from the place until the hour of the abatement of the fever shall be past! Then will I come myself and bring thee forth from thence.</q> The child did as the religious man had counselled him, and when he was sitting hard by the holy man's tomb, the sickness 1 did in no wise presume to touch him; nay, it fled away so far in fear that neither the next day nor the third day nor ever afterward did it dare to come nigh him. And that this was so done, the brother who came from thence reported to me and said furthermore, that at the time of his talk with me that young man, on whom as a child this miracle of healing was then done, was now still alive in the same monastery. And it is not to be wondered at that the prayers of that king now reigning with the Lord avail to do much with Him, being a man who having sometime the governance of a temporal realm accustomed himself rather to travail always and pray earnestly for the everlasting kingdom.
</p><p>Finally, men report that he oftentimes continued in prayer from the time of early morning praise 2 until it were day, and by reason of his common custom of prayer and giving thanks to the Lord he was wont always, wheresoever he did sit, to have his hands with the palms turned upward above his knees. Yea, it is commonly said, and turned into usage of a proverb, that he also ended his life as he

<note type="margin">OSWALD'S FAME</note>
was saying his devotions. For whiles he was compassed about with the weapons of his enemies and saw that he should be slain immediately, he prayed for the souls of his army. Of the which occasion came up this proverb: <q> God have mercy on their souls, quoth Oswald, as he fell to the ground.</q>
</p><p>Therefore his bones were conveyed away and buried in the monastery that we have said: furthermore, the king who had killed him commanded that his head and his hands with his arms cut off from the body should be hanged on poles. And thither a year after, Oswy his successor in the kingdom came with an army and took them away, burying his head in the churchyard of the church of Lindisfarne, but his hands with his arms in his royal city.1

</p><p>How in Ireland a certain man was by his relics recalled from the point of death.
</p><p>NOR did the renown of this famous man pass only over all the borders of Britain, but also, spreading afar the beams of wholesome light beyond the ocean sea, came to the coasts of Germany and Ireland likewise. In short, the most reverend bishop Acca 2 is wont to tell that in his journey to Rome, as he abode along with his prelate Wilfrid in the house of the most holy Wilbrord, archbishop of the Frisian nation, he heard him oftentimes report of the wondrous works which were done in that province at the relics of the same most reverend king. Moreover, too, in Ireland, at what time he, being but yet

<note type="margin">CURE OF IRISH SCHOLAR</note>
a priest, led the life of a pilgrim for the love he had to the everlasting country, he reported that the bruit of the king's holiness was by that time far abroad spread in that isle also: and one miracle of those wrought, which he rehearsed among other, we have thought good to put in our present History.
</p><p><q> In a time of mortal sickness,</q> 1 said he, <q><p>which wasted Britain and Ireland with a wide havock, a certain scholar of the Scottish nation was stricken amongst other with the calamity of the same plague, a man skilful certes in the study of learning, but one that used no diligence and labour at all for the care of his own everlasting salvation: who, when he saw himself to be at death's door, began to fear and quake, lest being shortly dead he should, as his lewd life deserved, be hurried away to the dungeons of hell: and therewith he cried to me (as I was lodged not far off), and trembling in the midst of sorrowful sighs, with a lamentable voice made thus his moan in my company: ' You see,' quoth he, ' that at this very time by the increase of my bodily grief I am being driven to the point of meeting death: and I doubt not that after the death of the body I must be hurried away to the everlasting death of the soul, and endure the torments of hell: I who no small time occupied in study of reading Holy Writ was accustomed to be a slave to the entanglements of sin rather than be obedient to the commandments of God. But, if the heavenly goodness will grant me some leisure to live, I propose to amend my sinful manners and turn my whole mind and life anew to the direction of the divine will. Yet I know that it is not in my deserving either to obtain or hope to obtain a truce and respite to live, except peradventure

by the help of them which have faithfully served God, He will vouchsafe to be reconciled to me that am a wretch unworthy of pardon. Now we have heard and it is very commonly reported that there hath been in your nation a king of wonderful holiness, called Oswald, the excellency of whose faith and virtue, yea, after death, hath become well known by the performance of many mighty works: and I beseech you, if you have any of his relics in your keeping, to bring it to me, in case it may be so that the Lord will be pleased to have mercy upon me through his merits.' Whereupon I made answer: ' Forsooth, I have some of the tree whereupon his head was stuck after that he was slain of the paynims; and if thou wilt believe steadfastly in thine heart, the merciful goodness of God by the merits of so worthy a person can both grant thee longer time to lead this life and also make thee a meet man to enter into the life everlasting.' And he answered me incontinent that he did perfectly believe so.
</p><p>Then I blessed water, and casting in a chip of the foresaid oak-wood did give to the sick man to drink.

</p><p>How that, when Paulinus was dead, Ithamar received the prelacy of the church of Rochester in his stead; and of the marvellous humility of king Oswin, who by cruel murder was slain of Oswy [644-651].
</p><p>OSWALD then being transported to the kingdoms of heaven, his brother Oswy, a young man about 30 years old, took in his stead the place of the earthly kingdom, and held it with great disquietude and trouble the space of eight-and-twenty years, being assailed certes both by the paynim people of the Marchmen which had slain his brother, and also by his own son Alchfrid, as well as by his nephew Ethelwald, 1 that is to say, the son of his brother Oswald that reigned before him.
</p><p>In the second year of which Oswy's reign, that is, to wit, in the 644th year from the incarnation of our Lord, the most reverend father Paulinus, sometime bishop of York but then bishop of the city of Rochester, passed to the Lord the tenth day of October: who held the bishopric 19 years two months and 21 days; and was buried in the sacristy of the blessed apostle Andrew, which king Ethelbert builded up from the foundations in the same city of Hrof. In whose place Honorius the archbishop ordained Ithamar,2 a man sprung from the nation of the men of Kent, yet comparable in life and learning to his predecessors.
</p><p>Now Oswy at the beginning of his reign had a partaker of his estate royal, named Oswin, who descended of king Edwin's blood 3 (that is to say, he was son of Osric of whom we have made mention before), a
<pb id="p.395"/>
<note type="margin">OSWY AND OSWIN</note>
marvellous devout and godly man: who by the space of seven years ruled the province of the Deirans in most plenty of all things and with the love of all his subjects. But Oswy who governed the other part of the Northumbrian nation on the north, to wit the province of the Bernicians, could not live peaceably with him; nay, rather forging and increasing causes of debate he murdered him most cruelly. For, an army being on both parts assembled opposite, Oswin, seeing that he was not able to join battle with him that had a greater host of men, thought it more expedient to give over his purpose of fighting at that time and keep himself until better occasion served. Therefore he discharged his army which he had gathered together, and commanded them severally to return home again from the place which is called Wilfaraesdun,1 that is Wilfar's Hill, and standeth almost ten mile from the village of Cataract, being-withdrawn over against the setting of the sun in summer: and Oswin conveyed himself out of the way with one only that was his most faithful thane, named Tondher, to hide himself in the house of Hunwald, a retainer 2 whom also he took to be of himself a very friend to him. But alas, sad to say! he was far otherwise: for, being by the same retainer betrayed, Oswin, along with his aforesaid thane, was slain of Oswy through the means of his reeve 3 Ethelwin, by a death that was abominable in the eyes of all. And this was done the 20th day of August in the ninth year of his reign in the place which is called Ingetlingum; 4 where afterward for the satisfaction of this heinous act there was a monastery builded: 5 in the which daily prayers should be offered to the Lord for the redemption of both the kings' souls, to wit,
<pb id="p.397"/>
<note type="margin">OSWIN AND AIDAN</note>
both the soul of him that was slain and of him that gave command to slay him.
</p><p>Now king Oswin was of countenance beautiful and of stature high, and in talk pleasant and courteous in manner, and bountiful to all, that is to say to men of high as well as men of low degree: whereby it happened that for the princely worthiness of his mind and visage and deserving acts he had the love of all men, and from all the provinces on all sides near, men even of the highest degree flocked to his service. Among all whose other honourable qualities of excellence and sobriety and, that I may so speak, of peculiar blessing, his humility is said to have been the chiefest, as one example will be sufficient to prove.
</p><p>He had given to bishop Aidan a very fair horse on which the bishop (though he used most to travel on foot) might pass over flowing streams, or bring his journey to the end if any other necessity constrained: but when after a short space of time a certain poor man met the bishop and craved an alms of him, he lighted off and commanded the horse, gorgeously trapped as he was, to be given to the poor man: for he was passing pitiful, a lover of the poor and as it were a father of the wretched. When this had been reported to the king, he said to the bishop, as it chanced they were about to enter in to dinner: <q> What meant you, my lord bishop, to give to the poor man that royal horse which it was fitting for you to keep for your own use? Had we not store of horses of less price and other kind to be sufficient for gifts to the poor, though you should not give them that horse which I chose to be your peculiar possession?</q> To whom the bishop at once said: <q> Why talketh your Grace thus? Is that son
<pb id="p.399"/>
<note type="margin">OSWIN AND AIDAN</note>
of a mare dearer in your sight than that son of God?</q> Which being said they entered for to dine. And the bishop for his part took his place appointed. Then the king, for he had come from hunting, standing with his thanes at the hearth began to warm himself: and suddenly, as he warmed himself, recalling the word which the bishop had spoken unto him, he ungirded his sword, giving it to a thane, and came in haste to the bishop, falling down at his feet and beseeching him to be reconciled to him: <q> Because,</q> said he, <q> I will never hereafter speak of this, or measure what or how much of our money thou bestowest upon the sons of God.</q> At which sight the bishop was much afraid, and rising at once lifted up the king, professing that he was right well reconciled with him, provided only he should sit down to the feast and cast away heaviness. And whilst the king at the bishop's bidding and entreaty did recover cheerfulness, the bishop contrariwise began to be made heavy even to the shedding of tears. Of whom, when his chaplain, in his mother tongue which the king and his court knew not, had demanded why he wept: <q> I know,</q> said he, <q> that the king is not to live long: for never before this time have I seen an humble king. Whereby I perceive that he must speedily be taken out of this life: for this people is not worthy to have such a governor.</q> And shortly after, the bishop's dreadful abodement was fulfilled with the king's cruel death, of which we have spoken before.
</p><p>Moreover, bishop Aidan himself also was taken out of the world and received of the Lord the everlasting reward of his labours, even not longer than the 12th day after the king whom he loved was slain, that is to wit the 31st day of August.

</p><p>How that bishop Aidan both told the shipmen beforehand of a storm that was to come, and gave them holy oil wherewith to calm it [642-6441.
</p><p>And how worthy a man Aidan was, the secret Judge of men's hearts hath fully declared by the signs of miracles, three of the which let it be sufficient to recite for remembrance' sake. A certain priest called Utta, a man of great gravity and truth, and for that reason much esteemed of all, even of the princes of this world themselves, at what time he was sent to Kent to fetch thence a wife to King Oswy (to wit Eanfled, daughter of King Edwin, who after the slaying of her father had been taken thither), appointing for his journey to travel thither by land but to return with the maiden by ship, went to bishop Aidan, beseeching him to make his humble prayer to the Lord to prosper him and his who were about to venture on so hazardous a journey. And the bishop, blessing them and committing them to the Lord, gave them also hallowed oil, saying: <q> I know that when you shall have shipping, a tempest and a contrary wind shall rise upon you suddenly: but do thou remember that thou cast into the sea this oil that I give thee; and anon the wind being laid, comfortable fair weather will attend you and send you home again by the way you have desired.</q> All which things were fulfilled in order as the bishop had prophesied: and truly at the beginning, when the surges of the sea did rage, the shipmen assayed to hold back the ship by casting anchors into the sea, but by doing so availed nothing: and when the
<pb id="p.403"/>
<note type="margin">AIDAN AND PENDA</note>
waves swept the ship on all sides and it began to fill, and all saw that death threatened them and was at that instant upon them, at length the priest, remembering the bishop's words, took the oil pot and did cast of the oil into the sea, and forthwith, as had been prophesied, the sea abated of his violence. And so it was that the man of God both by the spirit of prophecy foreshewed the tempest to come, and by the virtue of the same spirit, though absent in the body, calmed it when it was arisen. And no common reporter of uncertain rumour but a very credible man, a priest of our church,1 Cynimund by name, told me the process of that miracle, who said that he had heard it of Utta the priest himself in whom and through whom the miracle was wrought.

</p><p>ANOTHER miracle worthy remembrance wrought by the same father is reported of many who were able to have knowledge thereof. For in the time of his bishopric the army of the Marchmen that were enemies, with Penda for captain, wasting the country of the Northumbrians with cruel destruction far and wide, came even to the royal city 2 which is called after the name of Bebba, one time queen, and forasmuch as he was not able neither by battle nor by siege to win it, Penda endeavoured to destroy it by fire: and pulling in pieces the hamlets which he found in the neighbourhood of the city, carried thither a very great quantity of beams, rafters, partitions, wattles

and thatch, and therewith he compassed the city on the side that adjoineth to the land, in a great height: and when he saw the wind to serve, he kindled the fire and sought to consume the city. At the which time the most reverend bishop Aidan was dwelling in Farne island which is almost two miles distant from the city. For thither he oftentimes was used to depart for the sake of secret prayer and silent meditation. Indeed to this day they are wont to shew in the same island the place where he would sit to be alone. Who beholding the masses of fire and the smoke raised aloft over the city (as the wind bare them along), lifting up his eyes and hands to heaven, with tears (as is reported), said: <q>Behold, Lord, how great mischief Penda worketh!</q> Which being said, the winds, being forthwith shifted from the city, turned back again the burning of the flames upon them who had kindled it, insomuch that some being hurt, all made afraid, they were fain to leave the further assault of the city which they saw to be holpen by the hand of God.

</p><p>How a buttress of the church whereunto the same bishop leaning departed this life could not be consumed of the fames, when the rest of the house was burning; and of his inward life.
</p><p>THIS bishop at what time the day of death compelled him to depart from this life, having brought to an end 16 years of his bishopric, was in a township of the king, not far from the city of which we have before spoken. For having there a church and a
<pb id="p.407"/>
<note type="margin">AIDAN'S BURIAL</note>
chamber he was oftentimes accustomed to betake himself there and abide, and so from thence to go forth all about to preach: which selfsame thing he was wont to do in other townships of the king also, as having no possession of his own but his church only and small pieces of land lying thereabout. Therefore, as he was sick, they pitched him a pavilion on the western side of the church, in such fashion that the pavilion was fastened hard to the church wall. Whereupon it came to pass that, leaning to a prop which was set against the outside of the church to fortify it, he breathed out the last breath of life. Now he died in the 17th year of his bishoprie the last day of August. And his body was by and by from thence carried over to the island of Lindisfarne, and in the churchyard of the brethren buried. But after some space of time, a greater building being there erected and dedicated in the honour of the most blessed chief of the apostles, his bones were transposed thither, and laid at the right side of the altar with the honour that so virtuous a bishop deserved.
</p><p>There succeeded him of a truth in his bishopric Finan, himself too directed thither from the island and monastery of Iona in Scotland, and he remained in the bishoprie no small time. Moreover, it fortuned some years after, that Penda king of the March-men invading these parts with an armed host, while destroying with fire and sword all that he could, consumed with flames also that village in which the bishop Aidan died, along with the church before spoken of. But in a marvellous manner that only prop, whereunto he leaned at the moment of his departure, could not be consumed of the flames that
<pb id="p.409"/>
<note type="margin">MIRACLE OF PROP</note>
swallowed all things round. Which miracle becoming known abroad, the church was shortly builded up again in the selfsame place, and this same prop set against the church on the outside to fortify the wall as before. And again, after some time had passed, it came to pass, by the oversight of the inhabitants, that the same village and along with it the church itself were consumed with fire. But not even then had the flame the power to touch the same prop: and whereas by a marvel assuredly great the flame entered and eat through the very openings of that prop, whereby it was fastened to the building, yet the fire was not suffered to injure the prop itself at all. Whereupon the church being builded a third time, that prop was no more set without to bolster up the fabric as before, but for remembrance of the miracle it was had into the church itself and laid where people entering in should have to kneel and make supplication to the heavenly mercy. And it is well known that sithen that time many have in the same place obtained the grace of health: nay, also with chips cut from the selfsame prop and cast into water, more beside have gotten cures of sickness for themselves and their belongings.
</p><p>Now this much have I written of the person and works of the aforesaid man; by no manner of means choosing out this for commendation in him that he had imperfect understanding of the observation of Easter: nay, rather much abhorring him in this, as I have evidently declared in the book I have written concerning times; but as a true historian setting down in singleness of heart those things which were done of him or through him, and praising those things in his acts which are deserving of praise, and com-

mending them also to be remembered of readers for their profit: to wit, his love of peace and charity, continence and lowliness; a mind that was conqueror of wrath and covetousness, as well as despiser of pride and vainglory; diligence in keeping as well as in teaching the heavenly commandments, devotion to reading and watching, his gravity worthy of the priesthood in rebuking the proud and powerful, and likewise his mild demeanour in comforting the weak and refreshing or defending the poor. Who, to bring-together many things in brief, so far as we have learned from them who knew him, laboured to neglect nothing of all the things which in the Gospels or apostolical and prophetical writings he had learned should be done, but to fulfil them all by his works according to the measure of his might. These things in the aforesaid bishop I do much embrace and love, because I question not that they were undoubtedly pleasing to God. But that he observed not Easter in his due time, either as ignorant of the canonical time thereof, or overcome with the authority of his nation from following that he wot, this I approve not nor commend. In whom nevertheless this I approve, that in the solemnization of his Easter he kept in his heart, reverenced and preached no other thing than we do, that is, the redemption of mankind by the passion, resurrection and ascension to the heavens of the mediator between God and men, the man Jesus Christ. And therefore he kept this day not (as some falsely do suppose) on the 14th of the moon on any day in the week, like the Jews, but always upon the Sunday from the 14th day of the moon to the 20th; for the faith undoubtedly which he had in our lord's resurrection, believing it to

<div2 type="chapter" n="18"><p> Of the life and death of the devout king Sigbert [631-634].
</p><p>ABOUT this time after Earpwald, Redwald's successor, Sigbert his brother, a virtuous and devout man, reigned over the East English nation: which prince, while he lived in banishment in France, flying the enmity of Redwald, had long since taken the laver of baptism, and after his return to his country, when he obtained possession of the throne, desiring by and by to follow that goodly order which he saw practised in France, set up a school in the which boys should be instructed in letters, by the help of bishop Felix whom he had gotten from Kent, and who appointed them masters and teachers after the manner of the men of Kent.
</p><p>And so deeply was that king a lover of the heavenly kingdom, that leaving at the last the affairs of his realm and entrusting them to his kinsman Egric, who also before held part of the same kingdom, he entered to a monastery which he had made for himself, where being shoren in he laboured rather to make war for the everlasting kingdom. And whilst he was so busied a long time, it happened that the nation of the Marchmen, with their captain, king Penda, came forth to war against the East English, who seeing themselves to be too weak for their enemies in fight, beseech Sigbert for the encourage-

<note type="margin">DEATH OF ANNA</note>
ment of their soldiers to come unto the battle with them. When of his own accord he would not agree thereto, they plucked him by force out of the monastery and brought him against his will unto the field, hoping that the soldiers in the presence of their old most valiant and excellent captain might be less afraid in their hearts and think less upon flight. But he, remembering his profession, being set in the midst of the goodly host would carry only a little rod in his hand: and was slain along with king Egric, and all their army by the setting on of the heathen was killed or scattered.
</p><p>Now Anna, son to Eni, of the king's blood, was their successor in the kingdom, a man of great virtue and the father of a virtuous issue, of whom we must speak in their proper time hereafter: and this king himself also was afterwards slain of the same heathen captain of the Marchmen, by whom too his predecessors were slain.

</p><p>But in the time that Sigbert yet held the crown of his kingdom; there came over from Ireland a holy man called Fursa, renowned for his sayings and doings and, moreover, notable for his excellent virtues, desiring to lead a pilgrim's life in the Lord's quarrel, wheresoever he might find himself occasion.
<pb id="p.417"/>
<note type="margin">FURSA AND SIGBERT</note>
</p><p>Who coming to the country of the East English was honourably received of the said king, and pursuing his accustomed work of preaching the Gospel he wrought with many, both by the example of his goodness and the urgency of his preaching, either converting unbelievers to Christ or strengthening further in the faith and love of Christ them that already believed.
</p><p>And being seized there with a certain sickness of body he was counted worthy to have the joy of an angelic vision wherein he was warned to press on earnestly in the ministry of the word, which he had begun, and persevere unweariedly in his accustomed watching and praying; for that his end was certain, but the coming hour of the same end was uncertain, according to the saying of the Lord:1 <q>Watch therefore, for ye know not the day nor the hour.</q> Being strengthened with which vision he hastened with all speed to build up a monastery in the place king Sigbert had given him and to give instruction therein to regular discipline. Now the monastery was pleasantly situated for the woods and sea adjoining, being erected in a castle which in the tongue of the English is called Cnobheresburg, that is the city of Cnobhere; 2 which afterwards Anna the king of that country and all the noble men enriched with buildings of more majesty and with offerings. Moreover, this Fursa came of the noblest race of the Scots, but he was far nobler of mind than of birth of the flesh. From the very time of his childhood he gave no small pains to the reading of the Scriptures and monastical discipline, and as especially becometh holy men, all things that he had learned ought to be done, he was diligent in endeavouring to execute.
<pb id="p.419"/>
<note type="margin">FURSA'S VISIONS</note>
</p><p>Why make a long story? In process of time he both builded himself a monastery wherein he might with more liberty attend to the study of heavenly things: and therein being stricken with sickness he was taken out of the body,1 as the book written of his life doth sufficiently testify: and from evening until cockcrow being out of the body he was thought worthy to behold the sight of the angelical company, and to hear their blessed thanksgivings. Further, he was wont to tell that among other things he openly heard them sing: <q> Holy men shall go from virtue to virtue.</q> 2 And again: <q>The God of gods shall be seen in Sion.</q> And this man, being restored again to the body and within three days after taken out again, saw not only greater joys of the blessed, but also mighty conflicts of wicked spirits which without rest went about to stop him of his journey toward heaven with their often accusations, but yet by the warding of the angels availed naught against him: of all the which things if any listeth more at large to be instructed, as with what spiteful subtleties the evil spirits unfolded his doings and superfluous words as well as his very thoughts, as if they had been written in a book; what glad and heavy tidings he learned of the holy angels, and what things of righteous men appearing unto him amongst the angels, let him read the little book itself of his life, of which I have spoken, and heshall receive therefrom, as I think, much spiritual advantage.
</p><p>Among the which yet one thing there is that we have thought profitable to many to set down in this History. At what time then he was carried away heavenward, he was commanded of the angels who conducted him, to look back upon the world.
<pb id="p.421"/>
</p><p>Whereon he, bending down his eyes to the things below him, saw as if it were a dark valley lying underneath him at the bottom. He saw too in the air four fires not far distant one from the other. And asking the angels what fires these were, he was told that these were the fires which should kindle and consume the world. One was the fire of lying, when we no way fulfil the promise which we have made in baptism to renounce Satan and all his works. The second is the fire of covetousness, when we prefer the riches of the world before the love of heavenly matters: the third is the fire of debate, when we stick not to offend the mind of our neighbour even in trifling matters: the fourth is the fire of pitilessness, when we think it a light matter to despoil them that are weaker and to do them injury. These fires truly increasing by little and little reached so far to one another that they were joined together into one howgy 1 flame. And when they had approached nigh unto him, he said to the angel in great fear: <q> Lord, behold! the fire draweth to me.</q> Then the angel said: <q> That which thou hast not kindled shall not burn in thee: for though that furnace there seemeth dreadful and howgy, yet it trieth everyone according to the deserts of his works; because the desire that each one hath shall burn in this fire. For as a man burneth in the body by unlawful inclination, so, when freed from the body, he shall burn by deserved pain.</q> 2 Then he saw one of the three angels (which in both his visions throughout were with him as his guides) to go before and divide the flames, and the other two to fly round on either side and ward him from the danger of the fires. Moreover, he saw the devils flying through the fire heap up
<pb id="p.423"/>
the burnings of wars against the just. After, follow the accusations of the wicked spirits against himself, the defence of the good spirits, a more abundant sight of the heavenly company; moreover, too, the sight of holy men of his own nation who had formerly held the degree of priesthood not unworthily, as he had learned by report already being spread abroad; of whom he heard not a few things, such as to be very profitable either for himself or for all that should be ready to hear. Who, after they had ended their communication and returned to heaven themselves also with the angelic spirits, there remained with blessed Fursa the three angels, of whom we have spoken, to bring him back to the body. And when they approached the great foresaid fire, the angel in deed parted the fire of the flame as before. But when the man of God was come to the entrance opened onward between the flames, the unclean spirits snatching up one of them which they tormented in the fires, threw him at Fursa and touching him burned his shoulder and cheek: and he knew the person and recalled to memory that at his death he had taken of him a garment. And the holy angel, immediately taking hold of the tormented soul, threw him again to the fire. And the wicked enemy saith: <q>Repel him not now whom ye received before! for as ye took the goods of that sinner, so ought ye also to take part of his pains.</q> Unto whom the angel answering saith: <q> He took it not of covetousness but for the sake of saving the other's soul!</q> and the fire ceased. And the angel turning to Fursa said: <q>This that thou hast kindled hath burned in thee. For if thou hadst not taken the money of this man dead in his sins, neither would
<pb id="p.425"/>
his pains burn in thee.</q> And with more words he taught him in wholesome discourse what was to be done concerning their salvation which did repent in the hour of death. And he afterwards being restored to the body bore all the time of his life the sign of the burning which he suffered in soul, evident to all men in his shoulder and cheek: and the flesh marvellously openly shewed that which the soul privately suffered. But he endeavoured ever after, as he was also wont before, both by example to shew to all men the work of a virtuous life and to preach it in his words. Moreover, the due course of his visions he was willing to set forth only to them who of longing brought of prick of conscience used to question him. There remaineth yet a certain elder brother of our monastery, who is wont to relate that a certain very truthful and devout man told him, that he saw Fursa in person in the country of the East English and heard of his own mouth these visions: adding thereto that it was bitter time of winter and frostbound, when this man, sitting but in a slight garment as he recounted the tale, through the great fear and delight conceived by the remembrance thereof, did so sweat as if it had been in the middle of the heat of summer.
</p><p>When then, to return to former matters, Fursa, preaching the word of God to all many years in Scotland,1 did not easily endure the commotion of the crowds that pressed in upon him, he left all that he seemed to have and departed also from the very island that was his native country: and with a few brethren came from thence through the Britons to the country of the English, and there preaching the word (as we touched before), he builded a noble monastery. All winch things duly performed, desiring to abandon
<pb id="p.427"/>
<note type="margin">FURSA'S DEATH</note>
all the business of this world and also that of the monastery itself, he left the charge of the monastery and care of souls to his brother Foillan 1 and to Gobban and Dieul, priests, and purposed himself, being free from all the things of the world, to end his days in the life of an anchorite. He had a second brother, called Ultan, 2 who after long proof and trial of the monastery had gone to lead the life of an eremit. To him then Fursa went alone, living a whole year with him in continence and prayer and working-daily with his hands.
</p><p>After, seeing the country disquieted by the invasion of the heathen 3 and forecasting danger to threaten also the monasteries, leaving all things in good order, he sailed to France, and there being honourably received of Clovis,4 the king of the Franks, and of Ercinwald, the patrician,5 he builded a monastery in a place called Latineacum, 6 and not long after being seized with sickness he brought his last day to a close. Whose body the same Ercinwald, the patrician, taking kept it in a side chapel of the church which he was making in his township which has the name of Péronne, until the church itself should be dedicated. Which being done 27 days after and the body itself taken from the side chapel to be laid anew by the altar, it was found to be so uninjured as if the man had the same hour departed from the light of day. Moreover, four years after a shrine being erected at the east side of the altar, where the body of the same man should more honourably be tombed, it was found still without blemish of corruption and transferred to the same spot with fitting respect; in the which place it is

well known that his merits have been often renowned with many mighty works by the power of God. Thus much of the incorruption of his body we have briefly touched, that the reader might more clearly understand the greatness of the man's excellency. All which things, and moreover of other his fellow-soldiers, whoso readeth shall find more ample mention made in the little book of his life.

</p><p>How the province of the Uplandish English was made Christian under king Peada [653].
</p><p>AT this time the Middle Englishmen,1 that is the Uplandish English, received the faith and the mysteries of truth under their prince Peada, the son of king Penda: who being an excellent young man, and worthy of the name and dignity of king, was of his father advanced to the government of that nation; and he came to Oswy king of the Northumbrians, requiring Alchfled his daughter to be given him to wife: but could in no otherwise obtain his suit unless he would receive the faith of Christ and baptism, together with the nation over which he was set. Thereon, having heard the preaching of the truth, the promise of the heavenly kingdom and the hope of resurrection and immortality to come, he willingly avouched that he was ready to become a Christian, even though he should not win the maiden: being chiefly persuaded to receive the faith by king Oswy's son, called Alchfrid, who was his brother-in-law 2 and friend, having to wife Peada's sister, by name Cyneburg, king Penda's daughter.
</p><p>He was therefore baptized by Finan the bishop, with all the retainers and thanes who had come with him, and the whole of their servants, in a famous town of the king's which is called At Wall.3 And he returned home with much joy, having taken four priests who seemed fit both by learning and conduct
<pb id="p.433"/>
<note type="margin">CONVERSION OF MERCIA</note>
to teach and baptize his nation. Now the priests were Cedd, Adda, Betti and Diuma, of whom the last was a Scotsman born, the rest were English. Now Adda was brother of Utta, the notable priest and abbot of the monastery which is called At Goat's Head,1 of whom we have before made mention. The foresaid priests therefore entering the province with the prince preached the word and were gladly heard, and many daily, as well noble as of the base sort, renouncing the filth of idolatry were cleansed in the font of faith.
</p><p>Neither did king Penda withstand the preaching of the word even in his own nation, that is to say. the Marchmen, if any would hear it. Nay, he rather hated and despised those instructed in the faith of Christ, whom he discovered to have not the works of faith, saying that such men were worthily to be spited and wretched, which regarded not to obey their God in whom they believed. These things began two years before the death of king Penda. But after Penda was slain, when Oswy, a Christian king, succeeded to his kingdom as Ave shall hereafter tell. Diuma, one of the four foresaid priests, was ordained by bishop Finan to be bishop of the Uplandish English as well as of the Marchmen. For the scarcity of priests made that one bishop was set over the two nations. Who, after winning to the Lord in short time no small number of folk, died among the Uplandish Englishmen in the country that is called Infeppingum: 2 and Ceollach succeeded to the bishopric in his room, himself also a Scottish man born, who, not long after, leaving the bishopric, returned to the island of Iona, where the Scots had the chief and principal of very many convents: his
<pb id="p.435"/>
<note type="margin">SIGBERT THE GOOD</note>
successor in the bishopric being Trumhere, a devout man and brought up in monastic life, an Englishman born but ordained bishop of the Scots; which thing took place in the days of king Wulfhere, of whom we shall speak hereafter.

<div2 type="chapter" n="22"><p>
</p><p>How the East Saxons at the preaching of Cedd received again under king Sigbert the faith which they had before abandoned [653].
</p><p>AT that time also the East Saxons 1 by the importunity of king Oswy received again the faith which formerly, expelling the bishop Mellitus out of the country, they had abandoned.2 For the king of the said nation was Sigbert 3 (who reigned after the Sigbert surnamed the Little), a friend of the same king Oswy who, when Sigbert oftentimes came to the country of the Northumbrians to visit him, used eftsoons to persuade with him to understand that such could not be gods which had been made with men's hands; that wood or stone could not be matter to make a god, the pieces whereof were either wasted with fire, or served to make any kind of vessels for the use of man, or anyway being regarded as naught worth were cast forth abroad and trodden underfoot and turned into earth. God rather,4 said he, must be understanded to be of majesty incomprehensible, to men's eyes invisible, almighty, everlasting, who had made heaven and earth and mankind, governed them and should judge the world in equity; whose everlasting mansion must be believed to be, not in base
<pb id="p.437"/>
<note type="margin">SIGBERT AND CEDD</note>
and perishable metal but in the heavens: and rightly must be so understanded, because all such as learned and performed the will of Him by Whom they were created should receive of Him everlasting rewards. Such things and many of such sort being with friendly and as it were brotherly counsel from time to time pressed upon king Sigbert by king Oswy. at length (with the help of his friends agreeing thereto) he came to believe, and advice being taken with his company and having encouragement (they all approving and consenting to the faith), he was baptized along with them of Finan the bishop in the royal township, of which we have made mention above, which is named At Wall.1 For it is nigh unto the wall wherewith the Romans formerly fenced the island of Britain to protect it, at a distance of 12 miles from the East sea.
</p><p>King Sigbert then, being now made a citizen of the everlasting kingdom, returned to the seat of his earthly kingdom, requiring of king Oswy that he would give him some teachers to convert his people to the faith of Christ and cleanse them in the health-giving font. Thereat he, sending to the country of the Uplandish Englishmen, called unto him Cedd the man of God, and giving him a certain second priest to be his companion, sent them to preach the word to the nation of the East Saxons. Where, when going about all that country they had collected together a mighty Church for the Lord, it befell upon a time that the same Cedd departed home again and came to the church of Lindisfarne to talk with Finan the bishop; who, when he found that the work of preaching the Gospel had prospered with Cedd, called unto him two other bishops 2 for the
<pb id="p.439"/>
<note type="margin">DEATH OF SIGBERT</note>
ministry of ordination, and made Cedd bishop unto the nation of the East Saxons. And he, having now taken the degree of bishop, returned to his province, and perfecting with more authority the work he had begun, he made churches in divers places, ordained priests and deacons to aid him in the word of faith and the ministry of baptizing, especially in the city which in the Saxon tongue is called Ythancaestir,1 and, moreover, in that which is named Tilaburg: 2 of which the first is a place on the bank of the river Penta,3 the second on the bank of the Thames: in which places, assembling together a multitude of servants of Christ, he instructed them for the keeping of the rules of monastic life, as far as their tender capacity could then conceive.
</p><p>And when in no small time the instruction of heavenly living gat daily increase in the aforesaid province, to the joy of the king and the joy of the whole people with him, it fell out that, by the instinct of the enemy of all good, the king was himself murdered by the hands of his own alliance. Now the executors of this heinous act were two brothers german; who, being examined upon what motion they committed this act, were able to answer nothing-else save that they were angered with the king and made his enemies for this cause, that he was wont to shew overmuch clemency to his enemies and meekly to let be offences done by them, when presently they entreated him. Such was the fault of the king, for which he was murdered, because with a devout heart he observed the commandments of the Gospel: in the which his guiltless death nevertheless, a true fault of his was punished, according as the man of God had foretold him. For one of these retainers
<pb id="p.441"/>
who murdered him had lived in unlawful wedlock, and when the bishop was not able to let or amend it, he excommunicated him and commanded all that should be ready to hear him, not to enter that offender's house or partake of his meat. But the king set at nought the sentence of the bishop, and when invited by the retainer, entered his house to feast there: and after departing therefrom he met with the bishop. Thereon the king looking upon him, by and by being much afeared, lighted off from his horse and fell down before the bishop's feet, asking pardon for his offence. For the bishop too lighted off his horse at the same time as the king: for he was himself too on horseback. But in anger he touched the king, as he lay on the ground, with the rod he held in his hand and protested unto him with bishoply authority, saying: <q> I tell thee, because thou wouldest not refrain from the house of that wicked and damnable person, thou hast to die in that very house.</q> Yet it is to be thought that such a death of a devout man not only did wipe away such a fault but also increased his merit: because he came to his death for his goodness' sake, for observing the commandments of Christ.
</p><p>Now there succeeded Sigbert in the kingdom. Swidhelm, son to Sexbald, who was baptized by the selfsame Cedd in the province of the East Englishmen in a town of the king's called Rendlesham, 1 that is to say, Rendil's Steading; and Ethelwald king of the selfsame nation of the East English, brother to Anna, former king of the same, lifted him up as he was rising from the sacred font.2

</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="23"><p>
</p><p>How the same bishop Cedd, obtaining a place to build a monastery of king Ethelwald, by prayer and fasting did consecrate it to the Lord; and of his death [664].
</p><p>Now the same man of the Lord, in performing the duty of his bishopric among the East Saxons, used also oftentimes to visit again his own country, that is to say, the province of the Northumbrians for the sake of exhortation: whom, when Ethelwald, son to king Oswald, who reigned in the coasts of the Derans, saw to be a holy, wise and virtuous man, he required him to take of his gift a piece of ground towards the building of a monastery wherein the king himself should have to resort to pray to the Lord and hear the word, and be buried when he died. For he truly believed that he should be much holpen by their daily prayers, who in that place served the Lord. Now the same king had had in his house the brother german of the same bishop, by name Caelin, a man of no less devotion to God, who used to minister the word and sacraments of faith (for he was a priest), to the king and his court, by the knowledge of whom the king came to be acquainted with the bishop and learned to love him. Agreeing, therefore, to the requests of the king, the bishop chose out a place to erect a monastery in the high desert mountains, where there seemed to be rather starting-holes for thieves and dens for wild beasts than mansion places for men: that according to the prophecy of Isaiah,1 <q>in the couches, wherein aforetime dragons had their habitation, might come the green of reeds and rushes.</q> meaning that the fruits
<pb id="p.445"/>
<note type="margin">CEDD AND LASTINGHAM</note>
of good works should there spring, where before either beasts or men beastly Uving had been used to make their abode.
</p><p>Now the man of the Lord, desiring first by prayer and fasting to cleanse the place he had obtained for the monastery from the former filth of iniquities there committed, and so to set thereon the foundations of the monastery, required of the king that he would grant him opportunity and leave to abide in that same place to pray all the time of the 40 days of Lent that then approached. In all which days, except the Lord's day, prolonging his fast until the evening, as the manner is, not even then did he take aught but a little bread and one hen's egg with a little milk mingled with water. For, as he said, the custom of them of whom he learned the trade of monastical life 1 was that, when places had been newly obtained for making a monastery or a church, they should first consecrate them to the Lord with prayer and fasting. In this his fast, 10 days only remaining of the 40, there came one to call him to the king. But, to th z intent the godly work might not be interrupted by occasion of the prince's business, he entreated his priest Cynibill, who was also his brother german, to make an end of the good work begun. And when his brother readily agreed thereto, applying himself to fasting and prayers until they were fulfilled, Cedd made there the monastery which is now called Lastingham, 2 giving it rules and orders of religion according to the practice of Lindisfarne where he was brought up in.
</p><p>Thus governing many a year both his bishopric in the foresaid province,3 and keeping the charge of this
<pb id="p.447"/>
<note type="margin">CEDD AND CHAD</note>
monastery too by setting provosts 1 therein, it came to pass that as he visited the selfsame monastery in the time of a mortal sickness,2 being taken with illness of body in the same place he died: 3 and at first indeed he was buried abroad, but as time went on, a church being there builded of stone in the honour of the blessed mother of God, his body was taken up and laid therein at the right side of the altar.
</p><p>Moreover, the bishop left the monastery to be governed after him of his brother Chad who after was made a bishop, as we shall anon declare. For these four brothers german whom we have spoken of, Cedd, Cynibill, Caelin and Chad, were all (which is a rare thing) notable priests of the Lord, and two of them also in the highest degree of the priesthood held the office of bishop. When it was known in the province of Northumberland that their bishop was dead and buried, about 30 brethren of the monastery, which he erected in the province of the East Saxons, came to Lastingham from their own monastery, desiring by the body of their father either to live, if it should so please God, or to die and be buried there: who, being gladly received of their brethren and fellow-soldiers, all died in that spot with the coming upon them of the destruction of the foresaid plague, except one little boy, who (as is well known), was saved from death by the prayers of his father.4 For living long time after this and giving his time to reading Scripture, he learned at length that he had not been born again of the water of baptism, and, being shortly cleansed by the fount of the health-giving laver, was also afterwards advanced to the order of priest and was profitable to many in the Church: of whom I should not believe it to be
<pb id="p.449"/>
<note type="margin">OSWY AND PENDA</note>
doubted but that, as I said, by the intercessions of his father, whose body out of the love he bare him he came to visit, he was held back from the point of death, that he might both himself escape everlasting-death and also extend to other brethren the ministry of life and salvation by his doctrine.

<div2 type="chapter" n="24"><p>
</p><p>How the province of the Marchmen received the faith of Christ, Penda their king being slain: and how Oswy for the victory gained gave possessions and lands to the building of monasteries [655-658].
</p><p>IN those days king Oswy, after suffering cruel invasions and grievous to be borne of the often before named king of the Marchmen, who had slain his brother, forced at the last by necessity promised that he would bestow upon him an infinite number of the royal treasures and presents exceeding belief, to purchase peace, provided only he would return home and cease to waste the provinces of Oswy's kingdom even to destruction. And when the unbelieving king yielded nothing in any way to his petition,having determined utterly to root out and destroy the whole nation from the highest to the lowest, Oswy turned him to look for the help of divine mercy, whereby he might be delivered from the pitilessness of his barbarous enemy and binding himself by a vow he saith: <q> Sith the heathen knoweth not how to take our presents, let us offer them to him that knoweth, the Lord our God.</q> Therefore he vowed, that 1 if he had the upper hand of his enemy, he would present his daughter to be consecrated in holy
<pb id="p.451"/>
<note type="margin">DEFEAT OF PENDA</note>
virginity to the Lord; and would grant twelve estates of bocland 1 withal to the erecting of monasteries: and this being said he prepared himself to battle with a very small army. In short, the army of the heathen is reported to have been thirty times more in number; seeing that it contained thirty legions well appointed in war and governed with most noble princes,2 against the which king Oswy with Alehfrid his son marched, though with a very small army, as I said, yet with a sure confidence in Christ their captain. For another son of his, Egfrid, was at that time kept in hostage in the province of the Marchmen at the court of queen Cynwise. Moreover, Ethelwald, son of king Oswald, who ought to have stood with his countrymen, was on the side of their enemies and was become a captain for the same when they were to fight against his country and his uncle, although, when the field was begun, at that very time he had withdrawn himself from the fighting and getting him to a hold hard by awaited the issue of the battle. The armies thus meeting therefore and coupling together, the heathen were put to flight and slain, the thirty royal captains which had come to aid them were almost all killed: among the which was Ethelhere, brother to Anna king of the East English, then reigning after his brother, and himself the principal mover 3 of the war, who was slain with loss of his soldiers and alliance: and whereas the field was fought nigh to the river Winwaed, 4 which at that time from abundance of rain had overflowed his bed, nay all his banks to a wide space, it came about that in the flight far more were lost in the water than were slain by the sword in the fighting. Then king Oswy rendering thanks to God for the
<pb id="p.453"/>
<note type="margin">HARTLEPOOL AND WHITBY</note>
victory bestowed upon him, according to the vow he had made to the Lord gave his daughter Eltled, which was yet scant one year old, to be consecrated to Him in perpetual virginity: granting thereto beside the 12 little boclands where, instead of the practice of earthly warfare, place and opportunity might be furnished to the devout zeal of monks for the waging of heavenly warfare and making supplication for the everlasting peace of his nation. Of the which twelve territories to wit, six he appointed in the province of the Derans, six in the province of the Bernicians. Each territory contained ten households, making, that is to say, in all together six score. Now the aforesaid daughter of king Oswy entered the monastery called Heruteu, 1 that is, the Isle of the Hart, over which at that time Hild ruled as abbess, there to be consecrated to God: which abbess two years after, purchasing a territory of ten households in the place called Streanaeshalch, 2 builded there a monastery; in the which the said king's daughter was at the first a learner, afterward also a teacher 3 of monastical life, until at the age of fully 59 years the blessed virgin passed to be united in marriage to her heavenly Spouse. And in this monastery both she herself and her father Oswy and her mother Eanfled and her mother's father Edwin and many other noble personages were buried in the church of the holy apostle Peter. Now this walking Oswy brought to an end in the country of Leeds, the 13th year of his reign, the 15th day of November, to the great commodity of both countries. For he both delivered his own people from the ravages of his heathen enemy, and the people of the Marchmen themselves and of the neighbouring
<pb id="p.455"/>
<note type="margin">BISHOPS OF MERCIA</note>
provinces he brought over to the grace of the Christian faith, when their unbelieving head was once cut off. Now the first bishop made in the province of the Marchmen, as well as of the Lindisfaras and of the Middle Englishmen, was (as we said before) Diuma who died and was buried in the country of the Middle Englishmen: the second was Ceollach, who, leaving the charge of his bishopric yet living, returned to Scotland. Both these were Scottish born. The third bishop was Trumhere, of English birth but fully instructed and ordained of the Scots, who was abbot of the monastery which is named Ingetlingum. This is the very place where king Oswin was slain, as we have before recorded. For queen Eanfled, being alliant to him,1 required of king Oswy in part of satisfaction of Oswin's unjust murder, that he would grant there a place for the erecting of a monastery for the use of the aforesaid servant of God, Trumhere, because he was himself also of kin to the slain king: to the intent that in that monastery continual prayers might be had for the eternal salvation of both kings, that is to say, as well of the slain as of him who commanded to slay. Now the same king Oswy had authority 2 by the space of three years after the death of king Penda over the people of the Marchmen as well as over the other countries of the southern provinces: subduing also the nation of the Redshanks for the most part to the allegiance of the English.
</p><p>At which time he granted to the aforenamed Peada, son of king Penda, because he was his brother-in-law, the kingdom of the South March-men, containing, as men say, 5000 households and divided by the river Trent from the North Marchmen.
<pb id="p.457"/>
<note type="margin">MERCIA REBELS</note>
whose land containeth 7000 households. But the same Peada the next spring was very foully slain by the treason (as they say) of his wife, in the very time of the Easter festival. Moreover, three years after the death of king Penda the nobility of the nation of the Marchmen, Immin, Eafa, and Eadbert rebelled against king Oswy, advancing to the throne Wulfhere, son of the same Penda, a young man whom they had kept privy; and expelling the governors of Oswy, who was not their natural king, they stoutly recovered again their boundaries as well as their freedom: and so, living free under a king of their own, they served joyfully the true king Christ, to be at length partakers of the everlasting kingdom in heaven. Now the same king reigned over the nation of the Marchmen 17 years, and had for his first bishop Trumhere (of whom we have spoken above), the second Jaruman, the third Chad, the fourth Wynfrid. All these in continual succession executed the office of bishop of the nation of the Marchmen under king Wulfhere.

</p><p>How the controversy about the time of Easter was moved against those who had come from Scotland [664].
</p><p>IN the meanwhile, after the bishop Aidan was taken from this life, Finan in his room had received the degree of bishop, being ordained and sent of tin Scots: who in the isle of Lindisfarne made a church meet for a bishop's see; the which nevertheless after the manner of the Scots he builded not of stone but all of sawed oaken timber and thatched it with
<pb id="p.459"/>
<note type="margin">EASTER QUESTION</note>
reed, and afterwards the most reverend archbishop Theodore dedicated it in the honour of the blessed apostle Peter. But the bishop of the selfsame place, Eadbert, took off the reeds and set to cover it all with plates of lead, that is to say, both the roof and also the walls thereof themselves.
</p><p>About this time there was raised a hot and constant disputation touching the observance of Easter, they who had come from Kent or from France affirming that the Scots kept the Easter Lord's day contrary to the accustomed manner of the universal Church. Among these there was a very earnest defender of the true Easter, one named Ronan,a Scot born but yet instructed fully in the rule of ecclesiastical truth in the parts of France and Italy; who coupling and disputing with Finan set many aright or inflamed them to a more careful inquiry of the truth: yet was he able in no way to correct Finan; nay, rather he exasperated him by his reproof, being a man of hasty nature,1 and made him an open adversary of the truth. On the other hand James, once deacon (as we have shewn before) of the venerable archbishop Paulinus, with all whom he was able to instruct in the better way, observed the true and catholic Easter. Eanfled also, the queen, with her train observed after the same manner as she had seen it practised in Kent, having with her a priest of catholic observation out of Kent, by name Romanus: whereby, as is said, it happened sometimes in those days that in one year Easter was kept twice, and when the king was breaking his fast and solemnizing the Lord's Easter, then the queen and her company continued yet the fast and kept the day of palms. Yet this diversity of keeping Easter, as long as Aidan lived,

was borne in patience of all men, who had come to know very well, that though he was not able to celebrate Easter contrary to the custom of those who had sent him, yet he set himself diligently to perform works of faith, mercy, and love according to the manner customable with all holy men: upon which consideration he was deservedly beloved of all men, even of those which varied from him about Easter: and was held in reverence not only of the common sort but also of the bishops themselves, Honorius of the men of Kent and Felix of the East English.
</p><p>But after the death of Finan which came after Aidan, when Colman succeeded to the bishopric, who also himself was sent from Scotland, there arose a sharper disputation about the observance of Easter as well as upon other rules of ecclesiastical life: by occasion whereof this inquiry rightly stirred the minds and hearts of many from fear, lest, having gained the name of Christians, they did run or had run in vain.1 The dispute reached too to the ears of the princes themselves, to wit of king Oswy and his son Alchfrid; of whom Oswy, being brought up and baptized of the Scots and right skilful also in their tongue, thought nothing better than the manner which they had taught. In his turn Alchfrid, having for his teacher in Christian instruction Wilfrid, a man of great learning (for he had both travelled to Rome on his first visit for the sake of ecclesiastical teaching and spent a long time at Lyons with Dalfinus, archbishop of France, of whom also he had taken the crown 2 of ecclesiastical tonsure), knew that Wilfrid's teaching was rightly to be chosen rather than all the traditions of the Scots: wherefore also he had granted him a monastery of 40 households
<pb id="p.463"/>
<note type="margin">SYNOD OF WHITBY</note>
in the place which is called Inhrypum;1 which place indeed a little before he had given to those which followed the Scots, to have in possession for a monastery. But because afterwards, when choice was offered to them, they preferred to depart and yield up the place rather than to change their accustomed manner, it was given by the prince to him whose life and teaching he held to be worthy thereof. About that time Agilbert, bishop of the West Saxons, of whom we have made mention before,2 a friend of king Alehfrid and of Wilfrid the abbot, had come to the province of Northumberland and was staying with them for a space; who also at the request of Alehfrid made Wilfrid a priest in his monastery aforesaid. Now Agilbert had with him a priest named Agatho. The question therefore concerning Easter and the tonsure and other ecclesiastical matters being there raised, it was agreed on both sides that in the monastery called Strenaeshalc (which is by interpretation Lighthouse Bay,3 over which Hild, a woman vowed to God, was abbess), a synod 4 should be kept for the deciding of this question. And thither came both the kings, namely, the father and the son; the bishops, Colman with his clergy of Scotland, and Agilbert with Agatho and Wilfrid, priests. On the part of these last were James and Romanus: Hild the abbess with her company were of the Scottish part, whereon also was the venerable bishop Cedd long since ordained of the Scots, as we have shewn before, who in that assembly came forward also as a most watchful interpreter on both sides.
<pb id="p.465"/>
</p><p>And first king Oswy said beforehand by way of preparation that it behoved those who were united in serving God to keep one rule of living and not to vary in celebrating the heavenly sacraments, who looked all for one kingdom in the heavens; but rather they should search out what was the truer tradition and this should be followed uniformly of everyone: and first he commanded his bishop Colman to declare what his observation was, and from whence he drew the source thereof and whom he followed therein. Then Colman saith: <q> The Easter which I am accustomed to observe I have received of my elders of whom I was sent hither bishop, and this all our fathers, men beloved of God, are known to have solemnized after the same manner. And this observation, that none may think it a light matter or to be rejected, is the selfsame which the blessed evangelist John, the disciple whom the Lord specially loved, kept, as we read, with all the churches over the which he was head.</q> And when he spake these and such like words the king commanded also Agilbert to declare before them all the manner of his observation, whence it was that it had beginning and by what authority he followed it. Agilbert answered: <q>Let, I beseech you, my scholar, the priest Wilfrid, speak herein for me, for we both, along with all the other followers after the ecclesiastical tradition, who sit here, are of one mind; beside, he can better and more clearly express our opinion in the very tongue of the English, than I am able to do, using an interpreter.</q> Then Wilfrid, the king commanding him to speak, thus began: <q> The Easter which we follow we have seen to be kept by all at Rome where the blessed apostles Peter and Paul
<pb id="p.467"/>
lived, taught, suffered and were buried: this manner we have noted to be practised of all in Italy, and in France, countries which we have passed through in pursuit of knowledge or desire to pray: this manner we have found to be performed in Africa, Asia, Egypt, Greece and all the world (wherever the Church of Christ hath been spread, throughout different nations and tongues), after one order of time and that without variableness: apart only from these men and them that are partakers of their obstinacy, the Redshanks I mean and the Britons, with whom, being natives of the two farthermost islands of the Ocean sea, and yet not the whole of them neither, these men with fond endeavour do contend against the whole world.</q> To whom so speaking Colman replied: <q> I marvel wherefore you be ready to term our endeavour fond, wherein we follow the example of so excellent an apostle who was worthy to lean upon the Lord's breast; seeing that all the world accounteth him to have lived most wisely.</q> Whereat Wilfrid saith: <q> God forbid we should charge John with fondness for keeping the decrees of the Mosaic law literally, according as the Church followed yet in many things the Jewish manner, and the apostles had not power upon the sudden to renounce all observance of the law ordained of God (in the way that all that come to the faith must of necessity abandon idols invented of devils), lest forsooth they might cause offence to those Jews which lived among the Gentiles. For in the like consideration Paul did circumcise Timothy,1 offered sacrifices in the temple,2 shaved his head at Corinth with Aquila and Priscilla:3 truly to no other intent but that the Jews might not be offended. Upon this 
<pb id="p.469"/>
consideration James said unto the same Paul:1 ' Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law.' Notwithstanding, the light of the Gospel now shining throughout the world, it is neither necessary, no, nor lawful for believers to be circumcised or to offer up to God sacrifices of the flesh of beasts. And so John, according to the custom of the law, in the 14th day of the first month at evening began to celebrate the Paschal Festival, not regarding whether it fell out the Sabbath day or any other day of the week. But in truth Peter preaching at Rome,2 remembering that the Lord rose again from the dead the first day after the Sabbath and gave therewith the hope of resurrection to the world, understood that Easter must be kept in such sort that, according to the custom and commandments of the Law, he ever looked (even as John did) for the rising of the moon at evening in the 14th day of his age, in the first month: and at the rising thereof, if Sunday (which then was called the first day after the Sabbath) was to come on the morrow, he began on that very evening to observe the Lord's Pasch, as we too are wont to do to-day. But if the Sunday were not to come the next morrow after the 14th day of the change of the moon, but the 16th or 17th or any other day of the moon until the one-and-twentieth, he tarried for that Sunday, and the sabbath before, upon the evening, he began the most holy solemnity of Easter; and so it came to pass that the Easter Sunday was kept only between the 15th day of the change of the moon until the one-and-twentieth and no day else. Neither doth this tradition of the Gospel and of the apostles break 
<pb id="p.471"/>
the Law but rather fulfil it, for in the Law it is commanded that the Passover should be solemnized from the evening of the 14th day of the change of the moon of the first month until the one-and-twentieth day of the same moon at evening: to the following of which observation all the successors of blessed John in Asia after his death and all the Church throughout the world were converted. And it was by the Nieene Council not newly decreed but confirmed (as the ecclesiastical history witnesseth), that this is the true Easter, this only is to be celebrated by believing men. Whereby it is clear, my lord Colman, that you neither follow the example of John (as you suppose), neither of Peter, whose tradition you wittingly withstand, nor do you agree with the Law nor the Gospel in the observation of your Easter. For John observing the Paschal time according to the decrees of the Mosaie law had no regard to the first day after the Sabbath; and this you do not follow, who keep Easter only on the first day after the Sabbath. Peter celebrated the Lord's Easter day from the 15th day of the change of the moon until the one-and-twentieth day; which you follow not, which keep the Lord's Easter day from the 14th day of the moon until the 20th: so that oftentimes you begin Easter in the 13th day of the change of moon at evening, of which neither hath the Law made any mention, neither did the Lord, the maker and giver of the Gospel, on that day, but on the 14th, eat either the old Passover in the evening, or hand down the sacraments of the New Testament to be celebrated of the Church in commemoration of His passion. Likewise the one-and-twentieth day of the moon, which the Law expressly commanded
<pb id="p.473"/>
for celebration, you do utterly exclude from the celebrating of your Easter: and thus, as I said, in the observation of the highest festival you agree neither with John, nor Peter, nor the Law, nor the Gospel.</q>
</p><p>To this Colman replied and said: <q> How think ye? Did Anatolius,1 a holy man and much commended in the ecclesiastical history before of you alleged, think contrary to the Law and the Gospel, writing that Easter ought to be celebrated from the 11th unto the 20th day of the moon? Is it to be believed that our most reverend father Columba and his successors, men beloved of God, who after the same manner kept their Easter, thought or acted contrary to the divine pages? Seeing there were very many among them, to whose holiness witness was borne by heavenly signs and miracles of mighty works wrought by them: and as I doubt not but they were holy men, so I cease not myself ever to follow their life, manners and trade of discipline.</q>
</p><p><q> In good sooth,</q> saith Wilfrid thereupon, <q> it is well known that Anatolius was a right holy man, very well learned and worthy of much praise; but what have ye to do with him, seeing ye keep not his rulings neither? For Anatolius in his Easter, following assuredly the rule of truth, accounted the compass of nineteen years,2 which you are either ignorant of or if ye know it, yet though it be close kept by the whole Church of Christ, ye set light In it. He reckoned the 14th day of the moon to fall on the Lord's Easter in such a way that he allowed that same day at evening to be the 15th of the change, after the manner of the Egyptians. He also assigned the 20th day to the Lord's Easter in such a way
<pb id="p.475"/>
that he held it for the one-and-twentieth when the sun had set. Which his rule and distinction, that ye be ignorant of is manifest by this, that some time ye keep your Easter clean before the full of the moon, that is upon the 13th day of the change. Moreover, as touching your father Columba and those which followed him, whose holiness ye claim to copy and whose rule and commandments ye say that ye follow, as the which have been confirmed by heavenly signs, to this I could have answered, that in the day of Judgment when many say unto the Lord 1 that they have prophesied and cast out devils and done many wonderful works in His name, the Lord will answer that He never knew them. But God forbid that I should say this of your fathers: for it is much more righteous to think well of such as we know not than to think evil. Wherefore also I deny not that they were servants of God and beloved of God, as the which loved God, though in rude simplicity, yet with a godly intention. Neither do I think that the manner of their observation of Easter is much prejudicial against them, as long as none had come to shew them the decrees of more perfect practice, the which they should follow: of whom I verily believe that had any catholic reckoner then come unto them, they would have followed his admonitions in the same manner in which they are shewn to have followed those commands of God which they knew and had learned. But as for thee and thy companions, if hearing the decrees of the apostolic see, nay, rather of the universal Church and these eon-firmed by Holy Writ, you scorn to follow them, you sin herein undoubtedly. For though thy fathers were holy men, is yet their fewness proceeding from
<pb id="p.477"/>
<note type="margin">OSWY'S JUDGMENT</note>
one corner of the uttermost island of the earth to be put above the universal Church of Christ dispersed throughout the world? 1 And if he your father Columba (yea, and our father if he was Christ's) was holy and mighty in works, can he by any means be chosen above the most blessed chief of the apostles, to whom our Lord said:2 <q>Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it, and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven</q>?</q>
</p><p>When Wilfrid thus concluded the king said: <q> Were these things, Colman, indeed spoken to that Peter of our Lord?</q> And the bishop said: <q>They were indeed, my lord king.</q> Whereat the king saith: <q>Can you bring forward any so special authority given your Columba?</q> Whereon the bishop said: <q> No.</q> Again the king said: <q> Whether do ye both agree in this without any question, that these words were principally spoken unto Peter, and that unto him the keys of the kingdom of heaven were given of the Lord?</q> They answered: <q> Yea, certainly.</q> Whereon the king thus concluded and said: <q> And I say unto you that I will not gainsay such a porter as this is; but as I know and have power, I covet in all points to obey his ordinances; lest it may be, when I come to the doors of the kingdom of heaven, I find none to open unto me, having his displeasure who is proved to hold the keys thereof.</q>
</p><p>When the king so spake, all that sat or stood by, the greater along with them of mean degree, gave their consent thereto; and abandoning their former imperfect usage hastened to change over to those things which they had learned to be better.

<div2 type="chapter" n="26"><p>
</p><p>How Colman being overcome returned home; and Tuda took the charge of the bishopric in his place; and what trade of life the Church led under those teachers [664].
</p><p>AND the strife being thus ended and the assembly dissolved, Agilbert returned home.1 Colman, seeing his doctrine contemned and sect reproved, taking those which would follow him, that is, which refused to accept the catholic Easter and the bearing of a shaven crown (for of this matter also there was no small disputation), returned unto Scotland, minding to deliberate there with his countrymen,2 what he ought to do concerning these matters. Cedd, forsaking the following of the Scots, returned to his see, inasmuch as he had embraced the observance of the catholic Easter. Now this controversy was moved in the 664th year of the Lord's incarnation, which was the 22nd year of king Oswy; but in the 30th year after the Scots had been made bishops in the province of the English. For Aidan occupied his bishopric 17 years, Finan 10 and Colman 3.
</p><p>Now after the return of Colman to his country, there succeeded to the bishopric of the Northumbrians in his place Tuda, the servant of Christ, who had been instructed and ordained bishop among the South Scots,3 bearing after the manner of that country the round crown of ecclesiastical tonsure and observing the catholic rule of the time of Easter: he was a man of virtue and holiness, but he governed the Church a very small time. Now he had come from Scotland, while Colman yet occupied the bishopric, and dili-
<pb id="p.481"/>
gently taught all men both in word and with example the things which belong to the true faith. Furthermore, at the departure of the Scots, Eata, a most reverend and meek person, was set over the brethren which chose to remain in the church at Lindisfarne, with authority of abbot, and he before was abbot in the monastery which is named Mailros 1: and this it is said was obtained of king Oswy by the suit of Colman at the point of his departure, because that the same Eata was one of the twelve scholars of Aidan, which at his first coming as bishop he took out of the English nation to be brought up in Christ. For the same bishop Colman was dearly loved of king Oswy tor the wisdom that was natural to him. This Eata is he which not long after was made bishop of the same church at Lindisfarne. Now Colman at his departing homeward took with him a portion of the bones of the most reverend father Aidan; but part he left in the church which he ruled,2 and commanded that they be laid in the saeristy thereof.
</p><p>But how spareful persons he and his predecessors were and how greatly they abstained from all pleasures, even the place where they bare rule did witness, in the which at their departure very few houses were found beside the church; that is to say, those houses only without which the conversation of common life could nowise be maintained. They had no money, but cattle. For, if they took any money of rich men, by and by they gave it to poor people. For neither was it needful that either money should be gathered or houses provided for the entertainment of the powerful of this world, who never used to come to the church but only to pray and hear the word of God. The king himself, when
<pb id="p.483"/>
<note type="margin">SCOTTISH CLERGY</note>
occasion had required it, came accompanied with only five or six persons, and after prayer ended in the church departed. But if by chance, it fortuned that they refreshed themselves there, they contented themselves only with the brethren's simple daily fare, looking for nothing farther. For then 1 all the desire with those teachers was to serve God, not the world; their whole care was to comfort the heart, not the paunch. Whereof it came to pass that in that time even the habit of religious men was had in great reverence; so that wherever any of the clergy or monks came, he was joyfully received of all men, like the servant of God: again, if any were found going on a journey, they ran unto him and making low obeisance rejoiced either to receive the sign 2 from his hand or a blessing from his mouth; also they would diligently give ear to their words of exhortation. Moreover, too, upon the Sundays ordinarily the people flocked eagerly either to the church or to the monasteries, not for belly cheer but to hear the word of God: and if any of the priests came by chance abroad into the village, the inhabitants thereof would by and by gather together about him and set themselves to desire of him the word of life. For neither had either the priests themselves or the clergy other reason to come into the villages but only to preach, to baptize, to visit the sick, and (to speak all in one word) for the cure of souls: who were so far chastened from all the infection of covetousness, that none of them would take pieces of land and possessions toward the building of monasteries but through the constraint of the powerful of this world. Which custom in all points was
<pb id="p.485"/>
<note type="margin">ECLIPSE AND PLAGUE</note>
maintained a long time hereafter in the churches of Northumbria. But thus much of these matters.

<div2 type="chapter" n="27"><p>
</p><p>How Egbert, a holy man, English born, led a religious life in Ireland [664-729],
</p><p>Now in the same 664th year of the Lord's incarnation an eclipse of the sun happened on the third 1 day of the month of May about the tenth hour of the day: in the which year a sudden destructive plague,2 consuming first the southern regions of Britain, took hold also of the province of the Northumbrians; and raging far and wide with much continuance brought low in grievous ruin an infinite number of men. In the which affliction the foresaid priest of the Lord, Tuda, was carried off from the world and honourably buried in the monastery called Paegnalaech.3 Moreover, this affliction pressed sore on the island of Ireland with a like destruction. There were in that same place at that time many nobles as well as common sort of English race, who in the time of the bishops Finan and Colman had left their native island and departed aside thither either to read sacred writings or to live more strictly. And certain of them forthwith bound themselves faithfully to the monastical life, while others wandering rather about the cells of such as taught 4 gladly gave good heed to reading: all of whom the Scots entertained cheerfully and were forward to give them daily sustenance

<note type="margin">ETHELHUN AND EGBERT</note>
free, also books for reading and teaching without payment.
</p><p>Among these, two young men of the English nobility were of great towardness, Ethelhun and Egbert, of the which two the former was brother unto Ethelwin, a man no less beloved of God, who himself too in the age following went to Ireland for study's sake, and being well taught returned to his country and was made bishop in the province of Lindsey and ruled the church honourably for a long time. These youths then living in the monastery which in the Scottish tongue is called Rathmalsigi, 1 all their companions either being carried off from the world by the mortality or scattered abroad in divers places, were both of them seized of the same mortal sickness and grievously tormented: and of the two, Egbert (as I learned by the report of a most trusty and venerable gray-headed priest which told me he heard the story at Egbert's own mouth), thinking he was at the point to die, departed very early out of his chamber where the sick were wont to lie,2 and sitting down alone in a commodious place began diligently to think upon his former life, and being pricked with the remembrance of his sins washed his face with tears and beseeched God from the bottom of his heart that he might not have yet to die, before he should either more completely, as occasion served, amend his former failings which he had committed in his boyhood and infancy, or exercise himself more fully in good works. He vowed also a vow that he would be ready to live so much a pilgrim that he would never return to the island where he was born, that is to say, to Britain; that beside the
<pb id="p.489"/>
ordinary service of the canonical hours, if weakness of body letted him not, he would recite every day the whole Psalter 1 for a remembrance of the praise of God; and that in every week he would pass a day and a night fasting. And his tears, his prayers and his vows thus being ended he returned home and found his fellow asleep: and himself too getting to bed began to lay his limbs to rest. And a little after as he rested, his fellow, waking and looking upon him, said: <q> O brother Egbert, what have ye done? My hope was that together we should enter into life everlasting. But now understand ye, ye shall have your request.</q> For by a vision it was revealed unto him both what the other's petition had been, and that he had obtained it. What need many words? Ethelhun himself the night following departed: but in truth Egbert casting off the trouble of his sickness recovered, and living long time after and being made bishop adorned his station with a life worthy of his vocation, and after many virtuous good deeds, as he himself desired, passed to the heavenly kingdoms of late, to wit, in the 729th year of the Lord's incarnation, when he himself was 90 years of age. Now he led his life in great perfection of lowliness, meekness, continency, innocency and righteousness. Whereby he profited much both his own people and the nations wherein he lived in banishment, the Scots and Redshanks, in example of living, in diligence of teaching, in authority of correcting and in bountifulness of bestowing of the gifts which he had received from the rich. Moreover, beside his vows mentioned before, he made other, as that in Lent he never ate more than once in the day, tasting then nothing else but bread and very thin milk, and that with a certain
<pb id="p.491"/>
<note type="margin">WILFRID AND CHAD</note>
measure: to wit, milk which the day before he was wont to set fresh in a vial and when night was past, skimming away the cream, he would drink what was left along with a small portion of bread, as we have said. And this kind of abstinence he was careful to observe 40 days before Christmas, as also for as many days after the festival of Pentecost was over, that is, 50 days after Easter.

</p><p>How after the death of Tuda, Wilfrid in France, Chad, among the West Saxons were ordained bishops of the province of Northumbria [665].
</p><p>IN the meantime king Alehfrid sent the priest Wilfrid unto the king of France 1 to have him consecrated for himself and his household. Whereupon the king of France sent him unto Agilbert to be ordained, of whom we have made mention before, and who having left Britain was made bishop of the city of Paris; and of him Wilfrid was consecrated with great honour, a number of bishops meeting together in a manor of the king's which is called Compiègne. And Wilfrid making yet some abode in parts beyond the seas by reason of his ordination, king Oswy following the example of his son's forwardness sent into Kent a holy man, of virtuous behaviour, sufficiently learned in reading of Seriptures, and a diligent performer in deed of that he had learned in the Scriptures should be done, to be ordained bishop of the church of York. Now this man was a priest named Chad, brother to the most reverend bishop Cedd of whom we have often made mention, and abbot of the monastery which is called Lastingham.
<pb id="p.493"/>
<note type="margin">CHAD'S ORDINATION</note>
</p><p>And the king sent with him his priest, Eadhed by name, who after in the reign of king Egfrid was made prelate of the church of Ripon. But they at their arrival in Kent found that the archbishop Deusdedit had now passed from the world and no other was yet appointed bishop in his room. Whereby they stroke over to the province of the West Saxons where Wini was bishop; and of him the foresaid Chad was consecrated bishop, having with him to assist and accompany him at the ordination two bishops of the British race, who celebrate the Lord's Easter day, as hath often been said before, contrary to 1 the canonical order from the 14th to the 20th moon. For there was not at this time, beside this bishop Wini, any bishop canonically ordained in all Britain.2 Chad then being consecrated bishop began shortly to be zealous in care for ecclesiastical truth and purity of doctrine; to apply his heart to lowliness, abstinency and study; to visit continually the towns, country places, cottages, villages, houses for the sake of preaching the Gospel, not making his journey on horseback but going on foot as the apostles used. For he was one of Aidan's scholars and laboured to instruct his hearers in the same way of life and behaviour after the example of Aidan and his own brother Cedd. Wilfrid also coming to Britain, now made a bishop, did himself too by his teaching bring into the churches of the English very many rules of catholic observance. Whereby it came to pass that the catholic practice daily continuing to increase, the whole company of the Scots which lived among the Englishmen either yielded to the same or returned back to their country.

<note type="margin">WIGHARD SENT TO ROME</note>
</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="29"><p>
</p><p>How Wighard, priest, was sent to Rome from Britain to be ordained archbishop: and how he died in that same place, according as by letter shortly sent back-by the apostolic pope it was specified [6671.
</p><p>AT this time the most renowned kings of the English, Oswy of the province of Northumberland and Egbert of Kent, deliberating between themselves what was to be done concerning the condition of the Church of the English (for Oswy had now truthfully learned, though brought up of the Scots, that the Church of Rome was the catholic and apostolic Church), with the choice and consent of the holy Church of the English nation called unto them a priest named Wighard, a good man and worthy to be a bishop, one of the clergy 1 under Deusdedit the bishop, and sent him to Rome to be ordained bishop, to the intent that he, having received the office of archbishop, might himself be able re ordain catholic bishops for the churches of the English throughout all Britain.
</p><p>But Wighard, reaching Rome, before he could be consecrated to the bishopric, was snatched away of untimely death, and a letter as followeth was sent back to Britain to king Oswy.
</p><p><q> To the excellent lord, our son Oswy king of the Saxons, Vitalian, 2 bishop, servant of the servants of God. We have received your excel-
lency's wishful letter, by the perusal whereof we perceived your most godly devotion and the fervent zeal you have to attain everlasting life; hoping that, as you now reign over your own people, so in the time to come you shall reign with Christ, forasmuch as
<pb id="p.497"/>
<note type="margin">POPE'S LETTER</note>
under the protection of the Lord's right hand you are now converted to the true apostolic faith. Blessed therefore is the people which hath been found worthy to have a prince of such wisdom and desire of God's honour: as the which not only is found, to honour God himself, but also studieth day and night for the conversion of all his subjects to the catholic and apostolic faith, purchasing thereby the salvation of his own soul. For who hearing this pleasant report would not rejoice thereat? Who would not leap for joy at these godly works? Forasmuch as your nation also hath believed in Christ the almighty God, according to the oracles of the divine prophets, as it is written in Isaiah:1 'In that day the root of Jesse which standeth for an ensign of the people, it shall the Gentiles call upon.' And again: Listen, O isles, and hearken ye people, from afar.' And a little after he saith: ' It is not enough that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to convert the dregs of Israel. I have given thee for a light to the Gentilesthatthou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.' And again: ' Kings shall see and princes shall arise and worship.' And a very little after: ' I have given thee for a covenant of the people that thou shouldest raise up the earth and possess the scattered inheritages, and say to the prisoners, Go forth; and to them that are in darkness, Shew yourselves.' And again: ' I the Lord have called thee in righteousness and have taken thine hand and kept thee; and I have set thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles, to open the eyes of the blind and to bring out the prisoner from the prison and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.' Behold, most
<pb id="p.499"/>
excellent son, how by the verdict of the prophets it is clearer than day, not only of you but also of all nations that they shall believe in Christ, the Maker of all. Wherefore it behoveth your highness, being now a member of Christ, to follow in all things and all times the godly rule of the chief of apostles, whether for observing Easter or in all things delivered by the holy apostles Peter and Paul, whose doctrine doth so daily lighten the hearts of men that believe, as the two lights of the element give light to the world.</q>
</p><p>And after some words in which he speaketh touching the celebration of the one true Easter throughout the whole world he saith:
</p><p><q> Finally, as touching one apt for learning and adorned with all qualities to be bishop, according to the tenor of your letters,1 we could by no means find any now, the journey being so long to you. For assuredly, as soon as we shall espy out a meet person of this character, we shall direct him after instruction to your country, that both by his own preaching and by the divine oracles he may thoroughly root out all the tares of the enemy from all your island with the will of God. The presents which your highness directed to the blessed chief of the apostles, for his perpetual memory we have received, and thank your highness therefor, and beseech God with the clergy of Christ incessantly for your highness' preservation. Accordingly, the bearer 2 of these presents, who hath been taken from this life, is laid at the church of the apostles, we much lamenting at his departure here. But to your messengers, the bearers of this our letter, we have caused to be given the benefits of the saints, that is to say, the relies of the blessed

apostles Peter and Paul, and of the holy martyrs, Laurence, John and Paul and of Gregory and Pancras,1 all to be delivered truly to your excellency. For beside to your lady wife,2 our spiritual daughter, we have sent by the said bearers a cross having a golden key taken from the most holy chains of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul: of whose godly zeal we understanding and along with us the whole apostolic see as far rejoice as her godly works do smell sweet and blossom in the sight of God. We beseech therefore your highness, according to our wish, to hasten to dedicate all your island to God Christ. For assuredly you lack not herein a protector, our Lord Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of mankind, who will prosper you in all things, to the heaping up the number of the new people of Christ, and establishing there the catholic apostolic faith. For it is written 3: ' Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.' For undoubtedly your highness seeketh and hath obtained, and all your islands (as we wish) shall be set under you. And so we salute your excellency with fatherly affection, beseeching continually the mercy of God that it vouchsafe to assist you and yours in all good works, that in the world to come ye may reign with Christ. May the grace from above have your excellency in its safe keeping!</q>

And this province to wit being visited with the disaster of the foresaid mortal sickness, Sighere with the people over whom he ruled, forsaking the sacraments of the Christian faith, fell to apostasy. For both the king himself and number of the people as well as of the nobles, loving this present life and not seeking after the life to come, or even not believing any such life at all, began to renew their temples which stood desolate and to worship idols, as though they could thereby be protected from the mortal sickness. Farthermore, Sebbi his companion and fellow-heir of the same kingdom with all under him kept the faith he had received with great devotion and ended his faithful life, as we shall hereafter declare, in great felicity. And king Wulfhere, when he understood that the faith of the province, in part that is, had been profaned, for to amend their error and call the province back to the true faith sent unto them bishop Jaruman, the successor of Trumhere: who dealing very discreetly (as was reported to me by a priest, who waited upon him in his travel and had helped him in preaching of the word, for he was a devout and virtuous man), and journeying far and wide through
