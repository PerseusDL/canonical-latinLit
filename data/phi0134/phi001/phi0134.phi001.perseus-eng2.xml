   <milestone unit="paragraph"/>THE SUBJECT.
   <milestone unit="paragraph"/>CHREMES and Phania were brothers, citizens of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. Chremes going to <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, leaves his daughter, Pasibula, in the care of his brother Phania, who, afterward setting sail with Pasibula for <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, is wrecked off the Isle of <placeName key="perseus,Andros City">Andros</placeName>. Escaping with their lives, they are kindly received by a native of the island; and Phania soon afterward dies there. The Andrian changes the name of the girl to Glycerium, and brings her up, as his own child, with his daughter Chrysis. On his death, Chrysis and Glycerium sail for <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> to seek their fortune there. Chrysis being admired by several Athenian youths, Pamphilus, the son of Simo, an opulent citizen, chances to see Glycerium, and falls violently in love with her. She afterward becomes pregnant by him, on which he makes her a promise of marriage. In the mean time, Chremes, who is now living at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and is ignorant of the fate of Pasibula, agrees with Simo, the father of Pamphilus, to give Philumena, another daughter, in marriage to Pamphilus. While these arrangements are being made, Chrysis dies; on which Simo accidentally discovers his son’s connection with Glycerium. Chremes, also coming to hear of it, declines the match, having no idea that Glycerium is really his own daughter. Simo, however, in order to test his son’s feelings, resolves to pretend that the marriage-day is fixed. Meeting Pamphilus in the town, he desires him to go home and prepare for the wedding, which is to take place immediately. In his perplexity, the youth has recourse to his servant Davus, who, having heard of the refusal of Chremes, suspects the design of Simo. At this conjuncture, Charinus, a friend of Pamphilus, who is enamored of Philumena, but has been rejected by her father, entreats Pamphilus to put off the marriage, for at least a few days. Disclosing his own aversion to the match, Pamphilus readily engages to do this. In order the more effectually to break it off, Davus advises Pamphilus to pretend a readiness to comply with his father’s wishes, supposing that of course Chremes will steadily persist in his refusal. Pamphilus does as he is advised, on which Simo again applies to Chremes, who, after some entreaty, gives his consent. Just at this conjuncture, Glycerium is delivered of a son; and by the advice of Davus, it is laid before the door of Simo’s house. Chremes happening to see it there, and ascertaining that Pamphilus is its father, again refuses to give him his daughter. At this moment, Crito, a native of <placeName key="perseus,Andros">Andros</placeName>, arrives, who, being a relative of Chrysis, has come to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> to look after her property. Through him, Chremes discovers that Glycerium is no other than his long-lost daughter, Pasibula; on which he consents to her immediate marriage with Pamphilus, who promises Charinus that he will use his best endeavors to obtain for him the hand of Philumena.</l>

It is not agreed what are the meanings of the respective terms, but in the present Translation the following theory has been adopted: The words <q rend="double" type="foreign" xml:lang="lat">dextrae</q> and <q rend="double" type="foreign" xml:lang="lat">sinistrae</q> denote the kind of flute, the former being treble, the latter bass flutes, or, as they were sometimes called, <q rend="double" type="foreign" xml:lang="lat">incentiveae</q> or <q rend="double" type="foreign" xml:lang="lat">succentivae;</q> though it has been thought by some that they were so called because the former were held with the right hand, the latter with the left.

<milestone unit="paragraph"/>THE SUMMARY OF C. SULPITIUS APOLLINARIS.
<milestone unit="paragraph"/>PAMPHILUS seduces Glycerium, wrongfully supposed to be a sister of a Courtesan, an Andrian by birth; and she having become pregnant, he gives his word that she shall be his wife; but his father has engaged for him another, the daughter of Chremes; and when he discovers the intrigue he pretends that the nuptials are about to take place, desiring to learn what intentions his son may have. By the advice of Davus, Pamphilus does not resist; but Chremes, as soon as he has seen the little child born of Glycerium, breaks off the match, and declines him for a son-in-law. Afterward, this Glycerium, un-expectedly discovered to be his own daughter, he bestows as a wife on Pamphilus, the other on Charinus. </l></div>

<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi001.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="1">THE POET, when first he applied his mind to writing, thought that the only duty which devolved on him was, that the Plays he should compose might please the public. But he perceives that it has fallen out entirely otherwise; </l>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi001.perseus-eng2" n="5">for he is wasting his labor in writing Prologues, not for the purpose of relating the plot, but to answer the slanders of a malevolent old Poet.<note resp="editor"><q rend="double" type="mentioned">A malevolent old Poet</q>: He alludes to Luscus Lanuvinus, or Lavinius, a Comic Poet of his time, but considerably his senior. He is mentioned by Terence in all his Prologues except that to the Hecyra, and seems to have made it the business of his life to run down his productions and discover faults in them.</note> Now I beseech you, give your attention to the thing which they impute as a fault. Menander composed the Andrian<note resp="editor"><q rend="double" type="mentioned">Composed the Andrian</q>: This Play, like that of our author, took its name from the Isle of <placeName key="perseus,Andros City">Andros</placeName>, one of the <placeName key="tgn,7011270">Cyclades</placeName> in the <placeName key="tgn,7002675">Aegean Sea</placeName>, where Glycerium is supposed to have been born. Donatus, the Commentator on Terence, informs us that the first Scene of this Play is almost a literal translation from the Perinthian of Menander, in which the old man was represented as discoursing with his wife just as Simo does here with Sosia. In the Andrian of Menander, the old man opened with a soliloquy.</note> and the Perinthian.<note resp="editor"><q rend="double" type="mentioned">And the Perinthian</q>: This Play was so called from Perinthus, a town of <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, its heroine being a native of that place.</note></l>
 <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi001.perseus-eng2" n="10">He who knows either of them well, will know them both; they are in plot not very different, and yet they have been composed in different language and style. What suited, he confesses he has transferred into the Andrian from the Perinthian, and has employed them as his own.</l>
 <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi001.perseus-eng2" n="15">These parties censure this proceeding; and on this point they differ from him, that Plays ought not to be mixed up together. By being thus knowing, do they not show that they know nothing at all? For while they are censuring him, they are censuring Naevius, Plautus, and Ennius,<note resp="editor"><q rend="double" type="mentioned">Noevius, Plautus, and Ennius</q>: Ennius was the oldest of these three Poets. Naevius a contemporary of Plautus. See a probable allusion to his misfortunes in the Miles Gloriosus of Plautus, l. 211.</note> whom our Poet has for his precedents; </l>
 <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi001.perseus-eng2" n="20">whose carelessness he prefers to emulate, rather than the mystifying carefulness<note resp="editor"><q rend="double" type="mentioned">The mystifying carefulness</q>: By <q rend="double" type="foreign" xml:lang="lat">obscuram diligentiam</q> he means that formal degree of precision which is productive of obscurity.</note> of those parties. Therefore, I advise them to be quiet in future, and to cease to slander; that they may not be made acquainted with their own misdeeds. Be well disposed, then; attend with unbiased mind, and consider the matter, </l>

This surely is precious refinement, worthy the genius of a true Commentator. Madame Dacier, who entertains a just veneration for Donatus, doubts the authenticity of the observation ascribed to him. The sense I have followed is, I think, the most obvious and natural interpretation of the words of Pamphilus and Simo, which refers to the preceding, not the subsequent, speech of Chremes.</quote></note> </l></sp>
