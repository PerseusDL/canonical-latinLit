                    <p>CHREMES commands his wife, when pregnant, if she is delivered of a girl
                        immediately to kill the child. Having given birth to a girl, Sostrata
                        delivers her to an old woman named Philtera to be exposed. Instead of doing
                        this, Philtera calls her Antiphila, and brings her up as her own. Clinia,
                        the son of Menedemus, falls in love with her, and treats her as though his
                        wife. Menedemus, on learning this, is very angry, and by his harsh language
                        drives away his son from home. Taking this to heart, and in order to punish
                        himself for his ill-timed severity, Menedemus, though now an aged man,
                        fatigues himself by laboring at agricultural pursuits from morning till
                        night. At the period when the Play commences, Clinia has just returned to
                            <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, but not daring to go to
                        his father's house, is entertained by Clitipho, the son of Chremes, who is
                        the neighbor of Menedemus. Clitipho then sends for Antiphila, whose supposed
                        mother has recently died, to come and meet her lover. On the same day,
                        Chremes learns from Menedemus how anxious he is for his son's return; and on
                        hearing from his son of the arrival of Clinia, he defers informing Menedemus
                        of it until the next day. Syrus, the servant who has been sent to fetch
                        Antiphila, also brings with him Bacchis, an extravagant Courtesan, the
                        mistress of Clitipho. To conceal the truth from Chremes, they represent to
                        him that Bacchis is the mistress of Clinia, and that Antiphila is one of her
                        maids. Next morning Chremes informs Menedemus of his son's arrival, and of
                        the extravagant conduct of his mistress, but begs that he will conceal from
                        Clinia his knowledge of this fact. Bacchis requiring ten minae, Syrus
                        devises a plan for obtaining the money from Chremes, while the latter is
                        encouraging him to think of a project against Menedemus. Syrus tells him a
                        story, that the mother of Antiphila had borrowed a thousand drachmae of
                        Bacchis, and being dead, the girl is left in her hands as a pledge for the
                        money. While these things are going on, Sostrata discovers in Antiphila her
                        own daughter. In order to obtain the money which Bacchis persists in
                        demanding, Syrus suggests to Chremes that it should be represented to
                        Menedemus that Bacchis is the mistress of Clitipho, and that he should be
                        requested to conceal her in his house for a few days; it is also arranged
                        that Clinia shall pretend to his father to be in love with Antiphila, and to
                        beg her as his wife. He is then to ask for money, as though for the wedding,
                        which is to be handed over to Bacchis. Chremes does not at first approve of
                        the plan suggested by Syrus; but he pays down the money for which he has
                        been informed' his daughter is a pledge in the hands of Bacchis. This, with
                        his knowledge, is given to Clitipho, who, as Syrus says, is to convey it to
                        Bacchis, who is now in the house of Menedemus, to make the latter more
                        readily believe that she is his mistress. Shortly after this, the plot is
                        discovered by Chremes, who threatens to punish Clitipho and Syrus. The Play
                        concludes with Chremes giving his consent to the marriage of Clinia with
                        Antiphila, and pardoning Clitipho, who promises to abandon the Courtesan,
                        and marry. Unlike the other Plays of Terence and Plautus, the Plot of this
                        Play extends over two days. </p>

                    <head>THE SUMMARY OF C. SULPITIUS APOLLINARIS.</head>
                    <p>A SEVERE father compels his son Clinia, in love with Antiphila, to go abroad
                        to the wars; and repenting of what has been done, torments himself in mind.
                        Afterward, when he has returned, unknown to his father, he is entertained at
                        the house of Clitipho. The latter is in love with Bacchis, a Courtesan. When
                        Clinia sends for his much-loved Antiphila, Bacchis comes, as though his
                        mistress, and Antiphila, wearing the garb of her servant; this is done in
                        order that Clitipho may conceal it from his father. He, through the
                        stratagems of Syrus, gets ten minae from the old man for the Courtesan.
                        Antiphila is discovered to be the sister of Clitipho. Clinia receives her,
                        and Clitipho, another woman, for his wife. </p>

                        <p>LEST it should be a matter of surprise to any one of you, why the Poet
                            has assigned to an old man<l n="1"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>Assigned to an old man</lem></app>:
                                He refers to the fact that the Prologue was in general spoken by
                                young men, whereas it is here spoken by L. Ambivius Turpio, the
                                leader of the Company, a man stricken in years. The Prologue was
                                generally not recited by a person who performed a character in the
                                opening Scene.</note> a part that belongs to the young, that I will
                            first explain to you;<l n="3"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>That I will first explain to
                                    you</lem></app>: His meaning seems to be, that he will first tell
                                them the reason why he, who is to take a part in the opening Scene,
                                speaks the Prologue, which is usually spoken by a young man who does
                                not take part in that Scene; and that he will then proceed to speak
                                in character (eloquor), as Chremes, in the first Scene. His reason
                                for being chosen to speak the Prologue, is that he may be a pleader
                                (orator) for the Poet, a task which would be likely to be better
                                performed by him than by a younger man.</note> and then, the reason
                            for my coming I will disclose. An entire Play from an entire Greek

                            am to-day about to represent, which from a two-fold plot<l n="6"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>Which
                                    from a two-fold plot</lem></app>: Vollbehr suggests that the meaning
                                of this line is, that though it is but one Play, it has a two-fold
                                plot--the intrigues of two young men with two mistresses, and the
                                follies of two old men. As this Play is supposed to represent the
                                events of two successive days, the night intervening, it has been
                                suggested that the reading is "duplex--ex argumento--simplici;" the
                                Play is "two-fold, with but one plot," as extending to two
                                successive days. The Play derives its name from the Greek words,
                                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">e(auto\n,</foreign> "himself," and

                                "tormenting."</note> has been made but one. I have shown that it is
                            new, and what it is: next I would mention who it was that wrote it, and
                            whose in Greek it is, if I did not think that the greater part of you
                            are aware. Now, for what reason I have learned this part, in a few words
                            I will explain. The Poet intended me to be a Pleader,<l n="11"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>To be a
                                    Pleader</lem></app>: He is to be the pleader and advocate of the
                                Poet, to influence the Audience in his favor, and against his
                                adversaries; and not to explain the plot of the Play. Colman has the
                                following observation: "It is impossible not to regret that there
                                are not above ten lines of the Self-Tormentor preserved among the
                                Fragments of Menander. We are so deeply interested by what we see of
                                that character in Terence, that one can not but be curious to
                                inquire in what manner the Greek Poet sustained it through five
                                Acts. The Roman author, though he has adopted the title of the Greek

                                the background, and Chremes is brought forward as the principal
                                object; or, to vary: the allusion a little, the Menedemus of Terence
                                seems to be a drawing in miniature copied from a full length, as

                            this is the case, and that he does not repent of so doing; and he
                            affirms that he will do so again. He has the example of good Poets;
                            after which example he thinks it is allowable for him to do what they

                                recent Play of Luscus Lavinius this had been the sole stirring
                                incident introduced. Plautus introduces Mercury running in the guise
                                of Sosia, in the fourth Scene of the Amphitryon, 1. 987, and
                                exclaiming, "For surely, why, faith, should I, a God, be any less
                                allowed to threaten the public, if it doesn't get out of my way,
                                than a slave in the Comedies?" This practice can not, however, be
                                intended to be here censured by Plautus, as he is guilty of it in
                                three other instances. In the Mercator, Acanthio runs to his master
                                Charinus, to tell him that his mistress Pasicompsa has been seen in
                                the ship by his father Demipho; in the Stichus, Pinacium, a slave,
                                runs to inform his mistress Philumena that her husband has arrived
                                in port, on his return from <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>; and in the Mostellaria, Tranio, in haste,
                                brings information of the unexpected arrival of Theuropides. The
                                "currens servus" is also mentioned in the Prologue to the Andria, 1. 36. See the soliloquy
                                of Stasimus, in the Trinummus of Plautus, 1. 1007.</note> why should

                                "Statariam." See thie spurious Prologue to the Bacchides of Plautus,
                                l. 10, and the Note to the passage in Bohn's Translation. The Comedy
                                of the Romans was either "stataria," "motoria," or "mixta."
                                "Stataria" was a Comedy which was calm and peaceable, such as the
                                Cistellaria of Plautus; "motoria" was one full of action and
                                disturbance, like his Amphitryon; while the "Comoedia mixta" was a
                                mixture of both, such as the Eunuchus of Terence.</note> in silence;

                            the time in fact of your purchasing an estate here in the neighborhood,
                            yet either your good qualities, or our being neighbors (which I take to
                            be a sort of friendship), induces me to inform you, frankly and
                            familiarly, that you appear to me to labor beyond your years, and beyond
                            what your affairs require. For, in the name of Gods and men, what would
                            you have? What can be your aim? You are, as I conjecture, sixty years of
                            age, or more. No man in these parts has a better or a more valuable
                            estate, no one more servants; and yet you discharge their duties just as
                            diligently as if there were none at all. However early in the morning I
                            go out, and however late in the evening I return home, I see you either
                            digging, or plowing, or doing something, in fact, in the fields. You
                            take respite not an instant, and are quite regardless of yourself. I am
                            very sure that this is not done for your amusement. But really I am

                                the next line, he is of opinion that if he were to cease working
                                himself, and were to overlook his servants, he would get far more
                                done. It is more generally thought to be an objection which Chremes

                                    Augustine says, that at the delivery of this
                                sentiment, the Theatre resounded with applause; and deservedly,
                                indeed, for it is replete with the very essence of benevolence
                                and:disregard of self. Cicero quotes the passage in his work De
                                Officiis, B. i., c. 9. The remarks of Sir Richard Steele upon this
                                passage, in the Spectator, No. 502, are worthy to be transcribed at
                                length. "The Play was the Self-Tormentor. It is from the beginning
                                to the end a perfect picture of human life, but I did not observe in
                                the whole one passage that could raise a laugh. How well-disposed
                                must that people be, who could be entertained with satisfaction by
                                so sober and polite mirth! In the first Scene of the Comedy, when
                                one of the old men accuses the other of impertinence for interposing
                                in his affairs, he answers, 'I am a man, and can not help feeling
                                any sorrow that can arrive at man.' It is said this sentence was
                                received with an universal applause. There can not be a greater
                                argument of the general good understanding of a people, than their
                                sudden consent to give their approbation of a sentiment which has no
                                emotion in it. If it were spoken with ever so great skill in the
                                actor, the manner of uttering that sentence could have nothing in it
                                which could strike any but people of the greatest humanity--nay,

                        <p> You shall know:--There is a poor old woman here, a stranger from
                                <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>:--her daughter, a
                            young woman, he fell in love with, insomuch that he almost regarded her
                            as his wife; all this took place unknown to me. When I discovered the
                            matter, I began to reprove him, not with gentleness, nor in the way
                            suited to the love-sick mind of a youth, but with violence, and after
                            the usual method of fathers. I was daily reproaching him,--"Look you, do
                            you expect to be allowed any longer to act thus, myself, your father,
                            being alive; to be keeping a mistress pretty much as though your wife?
                            You are mistaken, Clinia, and you don't know me, if you fancy that. I am
                            willing that you should be called my son, just as long as you do what
                            becomes you; but if you do not do so, I shall find out how it becomes me
                            to act toward you. This arises from nothing, in fact, but too much
                            idleness. At your time of life, I did not devote my time to dalliance,
                            but, in consequence of my poverty, departed. hence for <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, and there acquired in arms both
                            riches and military glory." At length the matter came to this,--the
                            youth, from hearing the same things so often, and with such severity,
                            was overcome. He supposed that I, through age and affection, had more
                            judgment and foresight for him than him-self. He went off to <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, Chremes, to serve under the
                            king.</p>

                                Bohn's Translation. It was the especial duty of certain slaves to
                                take off the shoes of their masters.</note> then some make all haste

                                The "lecti" or "couches" upon which the ancients reclined at meals,
                                have been enlarged upon in the Notes to Plautus, where full
                                reference is also made to the "coena," or "dinner," and other meals
                                of the Romans.</note> and to prepare a repast; each according to his
                            ability did zealously what he could, in order to alleviate my sorrow.
                            When I observed this, I began to reflect thus:--"What! are so many
                            persons anxious for my sake alone, to pleasure myself only? Are so many
                            female servants to provide me with dress?<l n="130"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>Provide
                                    me with dress</lem></app>: It was the custom for the mistress and

                                Thus in the Fasti of <persName>Ovid</persName>,
                                B. ii., 1. 746, <persName>Lucretia</persName> is
                                found amidst her female servants, making a cloak, or "lacerna," for
                                her husband. Suetonius says that Augustus refused to wear any
                                garments not woven by his female relations. Cooke seems to think
                                that "vestiant" alludes to the very act of putting the clothes upon
                                a person. He says, "The better sort of people had eating-dresses,
                                which are here alluded to. These dresses were light garments, to put
                                on as soon as they had bathed. They commonly bathed before eating,
                                and the chief meal was in the evening." This, however, does not seem
                                to be the meaning of the passage, although Colman has adopted it. We may here
                                remark that the censure here described is not unlike that mentioned
                                in the Prologue to the Mercator of Plautus, as administered by
                                Demaenetus to his son Charinus.</note> Shall I alone keep up such an
                            expensive establishment, while my only son, who ought equally, or even
                            more so, to enjoy these things-inasmuch as his age is better suited for
                            the enjoyment of them--him, poor youth, have I driven away from home by
                            my severity! Were I to do this, really I should deem myself deserving of
                            any calamity. But so long as he leads this life of penury, banished from
                            his country through my severity, I will revenge his wrongs upon myself,
                            toiling, making money, saving, and laying up for him." At once I set

                            unhappy; and that it is not right for me to enjoy any pleasure here,

                                celebrated with great magnificence, processions and dramatic

                                at length they were put down in the year n.c. 187, with a strong
                                hand, by the Consuls Spurius Posthumius Albinus and Q. Marcius
                                Philippus; from which period the words "bacchor" and "bacchator"

                            possesses them. To him who knows how to use them, they are blessings; to

                        <p> I'll tell you. However the case stood, Clinia ought still to have
                            remained at home. Perhaps his father was a little stricter than he
                            liked: he should have put up with it. For whom ought he to bear with, if
                            he would not bear with his own father Was it reasonable that he should
                            live after his son's humor, or his son after his? And as to charging him
                            with harshness, it is not the fact. For the severities of fathers are
                            generally of one character, those I mean who are in some degree
                            reasonable men.<l n="205"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>Reasonable men</lem></app>: "Homo," "a man,"
                                is here put for men in general who are fathers.</note> They do not
                            wish their sons to be always wenching; they do not wish them to be
                            always carousing; they give a limited allowance; and yet all this tends
                            to virtuous conduct. But when the mind, Clitipho, has once enslaved
                            itself by vicious appetites, it must of necessity follow similar
                            pursuits. This is a wise maxim, "to take warning from others of what may
                            be to your own advantage."</p>

                            of his own he does relate to me! Now he says, "Take warning from others
                            of what may be to your advantage." How shrewd! He certainly does not
                            know how deaf I am at the moment when he's telling his stories. Just
                            now, the words of my mistress make more impression upon me. "Give me
                            this, and bring me that," she cries; I have nothing to say to her in
                            answer, and no one is there more wretched than myself. But this Clinia,
                            although he, as well, has cares enough of his own, still has a mistress
                            of virtuous and modest breeding, and a stranger to the arts of a
                            courtesan. Mine is a craving, saucy, haughty, extravagant creature, full
                            of lofty airs. Then all that I have to give her is--fair words<l n="228"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>Is--fair words</lem></app>: "Recte est." It is supposed that he

                                tells the reason, in saying that he has scruples or prejudices

                            matter. <stage>(Exit.)</stage></p>

                        <p> First of all then, when we came to the house, Dromo knocked at the door;
                            a certain old woman came out; when she opened the door, he directly
                            rushed in; I followed; the old woman bolted the door, and returned to
                            her wool. On this occasion might be known, Clinia, or else on none, in
                            what pursuits she passed her life during your absence; when we thus came
                            upon a female unexpectedly. For this circumstance then gave us an
                            opportunity of judging of the course of her daily life; a thing which
                            especially discovers what is the disposition of each individual. We
                            found her industriously plying at the web; plainly clad in a mourning
                                dress,<l n="286"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>In a mourning dress</lem></app>: Among the
                                Greeks, in general, mourning for the dead seems to have lasted till
                                the thirtieth day after the funeral, and during that period black
                                dresses were worn. The Romans also wore mourning for the dead, which
                                seems, in the time of the Republic, to have been black or dark blue
                                for either sex. Under the Empire the men continued to wear black,
                                but the women wore white. No jewels or ornaments were worn upon
                                these occasions.</note> on account of this old woman, I suppose, who
                            was lately dead; without golden ornaments, dressed, besides, just like
                            those who only dress for themselves, and patched up with no worthless
                            woman's trumpery.<l n="289"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>With no worthless woman's

                                muliebri" he clearly means that they did not find her painted up
                                with the cosmetics which some women were in the habit of using. Such
                                preparations for the face as white-lead, wax, antimony, or
                                vermilion, well deserve the name of" mala res." A host of these
                                cosmetics will be found described in <persName>Ovid</persName>'s Fragment "On the Care of the Complexion,"
                                and much information upon this subject is given in various passages
                                in the Art of Love. In the Remedy of Love, l. 351, <persName>Ovid</persName> speaks of these practices in
                                the following terms: "At the moment, too, when she shall be smearing
                                her face with the cosmetics laid up on it, you may come into the
                                presence of your mistress, and don't let shame prevent you. You will
                                find there boxes, and a thousand colors of objects; and you will see
                                'oesypum,' the ointment of the fleece, trickling down and flowing
                                upon her heated bosom. These drugs, Phineus, smell like thy tables;
                                not once alone has sickness been caused by this to my stomach."
                                Lucretius also, in his Fourth Book, l. 1168, speaks of a female who
                                "covers herself with noxious odors, and whom her female attendants
                                fly from to a distance, and chuckle by stealth." See also the
                                Mostellaria of Plautus, Act I., Scene 3, l. 135, where Philematium
                                is introduced making her toilet on the stage.</note> Her hair was

                            not happen. Either the one must be had with the other, or the one must
                            be let alone with the other. Now, of these two alternatives, consider

                        <p> Upon my word, my dear Antiphila, I commend you, and think you fortunate
                            in having made it your study that your manners should be conformable to
                            those good looks of yours: and so may the Gods bless me, I do not at all
                            wonder if every man is in love with you. For your discourse has been a
                            proof to me what kind of disposition you possess. And when now I reflect
                            in my mind upon your way of life, and that of all of you, in fact, who
                            keep the public at a distance from yourselves, it is not surprising both
                            that you are of that disposition, and that we are not; for it is your
                            interest to be virtuous; those, with whom we are acquainted, will not
                            allow us to be so. For our lovers, allured merely by our beauty, court
                            us for that; when that has faded, they transfer their affections
                            elsewhere; and unless we have made provision in the mean time for the
                            future, we live in destitution. Now with you, when you have once
                            resolved to pass your life with one man whose manners are especially
                            kindred to your own, those persons<l n="393"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>A man whose

                                    scarce endure it</lem></app>: Colman has the following remark on
                                this passage: "Madame Dacier, contrary to the authority of all
                                editions and MSS., adopts a conceit of her father's in this place,
                                and places this speech to Clitipho, whom she supposes to have
                                retired to a hiding-place, where he might overhear the conversation,
                                and from whence he peeps out to make this speech to Syrus. This she
                                calls an agreeable jeu de th£eâtre, and doubts
                                not but all lovers of Terence will be obliged to her father for so
                                ingenious a remark; but it is to be feared that critical sagacity
                                will not be so lavish of acknowledgments as filial piety. There does
                                not appear the least foundation for this remark in the Scene, nor
                                has the Poet given us the least room to doubt of Clitipho being
                                actually departed. To me, instead of an agreeable jeu de
                                th£eâtre, it appears a most absurd and
                                ridiculous device; particularly vicious in this place, as it most
                                injudiciously tends to interrupt the course of Clinia's more
                                interesting passion, so admirably delineated in this little

                                more than one day in the action, it is not the only one in which the
                                day is represented as breaking. The Amphitryon and the Curculio of
                                Plautts commence before daybreak, and the action is carried on into
                                the middle of the day. Madame Dacier absolutely considers it as a
                                fact beyond all doubt, that the Roman Audience went home after the
                                first two Acts of the Play, and returned for the representation of
                                the third the next morning at daybreak. Scaliger was of the same
                                opinion; but it is not generally entertained by Commentators.</note>
                            Why do I delay to knock at my neighbor's door, that he may learn from me
                            the first that his son has returned? Although I am aware that the youth
                            would not prefer this. But when I see him tormenting himself so
                            miserably about his absence, can I conceal a joy so unhoped for,
                            especially when there can be no danger to him from the discovery? I will
                            not do so; but as far as I can I will assist the old man. As I see my
                            son aiding his friend and year's-mate, and acting as his confidant in
                            his concerns, it is but right that we old men as well should assist each
                            other. <stage>Enter MENEDEMUS from his house.</stage></p>

                            profuseness or with parsimony too great. Into the same error will you
                            fall from the one side as from the other. In the first place, formerly,
                            rather than allow your son to visit a young woman, who was then content
                            with a very little, and to whom any thing was acceptable, you frightened
                            him away from here. After that, she began, quite against her
                            inclination, to seek a subsistence upon the town. Now, when she can not
                            be supported without a great expense, you are ready to give any thing.
                            For, that you may know how perfectly she is trained to extravagance, in
                            the first place, she has already brought with her more than ten female
                            attendants, all laden with clothes and jewels of gold; if a

                                Pytiso" was the name given to the nasty practice of tasting wine,
                                and then spitting it out; offensive in a man, but infinitely more so
                                in a woman. It seems in those times to have been done by persons who
                                wished to give themselves airs in the houses of private persons; at
                                the present day it is probably confined to wine-vaults and
                                sale-rooms where wine is put up to auction, and even there it is
                                practiced much more than is either necessary or agreeable. Doubtless
                                Bacchis did it to show her exquisite taste in the matter of

                                from the " dolia," or large vessels, into the "amphorae," which,
                                like the "dolia," were made of earth, and sometimes of glass. The
                                mouths of the vessels were stopped tight by a plug of wood or cork,
                                which was made impervious to the atmosphere by being rubbed over
                                with a composition of pitch, clay, wax, or gypsum. On the outside,
                                the title of the wine was painted, and among the Romans the date of
                                the vintage was denoted by the names of the Consuls then in office.
                                When the vessels were of glass, small tickets or labels, called
                                "pittacia," were suspended from them, stating to a similar effect.
                                The "seriae" were much the same as the "dolia," perhaps somewhat
                                smaller; they were both long, bell-mouthed vessels of earthen-ware,
                                formed of the best clay, and lined with pitch while hot from the
                                furnace. "Seriae" were also used to contain oil and other liquids;
                                and in the Captivi of Plautus the word is applied to pans used for
                                the purpose of salting meat. "Relino" signifies the act of taking
                                the seal of pitch or Wax off the stopper of the
                            wine-vessel.</note>; she kept all on the stir: and this but a single

                                never die of old age, and that when, by reason of their beaks

                                no means an unamiable one, to think former times better than the
                                present. Aged people feel grateful to those happy hours when their
                                hopes were bright, and every thing was viewed from the sunny side of
                                life.</note> but as times are now, very passable: nor do I in the
                            least wonder that Clinia doats upon her. But he has a father--a certain
                            covetous, miserable, and niggardly person--this neighbor of ours

                            prosper me, I dreaded what in the end might be the consequence. I
                            understand lovers. They resent highly things that you would not
                            imagine.</p>

                        <p> Be it so; still, at least, you ought to go somewhere for a little time
                            away from their presence. Passion prompts to many a thing; your presence
                            acts as a restraint upon doing them. I form a judgment from myself.
                            There's not one of my friends this day to whom I would venture,
                            Clitipho, to disclose all my secrets. With one, his station forbids it;
                            with another, I am ashamed of the action itself, lest I may appear a

                                Madame Dacier suggests that Chremes is prevented by his wife's
                                coming from making a proposal to advance the money himself, on the
                                supposition that it will be a lucrative speculation. This notion is
                                contradicted by Colman, who adds the following note from Eugraphius:
                                "Syrus pretends to have concerted this plot against Menedemus, in
                                order to trick him out of some money to be given to Clinia's
                                supposed mistress. Chremes, however, does not approve of this: yet
                                it serves to carry on the plot; for when Antiphila proves afterward
                                to be the daughter of Chremes, he necessarily becomes the debtor of
                                Bacchis, and is obliged to lay down the sum for which he imagines
                                his daughter is pledged."</note>

                            blunders you disclose in this single affair! For, in the first place,
                            then, if you had been disposed to obey my orders, the child ought to
                            have been dispatched; you ought not in words to have feigned her death,
                            and in reality to have left hopes of her surviving. But that I pass
                            over; compassion, maternal affection, I allow it. But how finely you did
                            provide for the future! What was your meaning ? Do reflect. It's clear,
                            beyond a doubt, that your daughter was betrayed by you to this old

                            temper prompts you to do amiss. But, whatever this circumstance is, by

                        <p> As we women are all foolishly and wretchedly superstitious, when I
                            delivered the child to her to be exposed, I drew a ring from off my
                            finger, and ordered her to expose it, together with the child; that if
                            she should die, she might not be without<note anchored="true">That she
                                might not be without)--Ver 652. Madame Dacier observes upon this
                                passage, that the ancients thought themselves guilty of a heinous
                                offense if they suffered their children to die without having
                                bestowed on them some of their property; it was consequently the
                                custom of the women, before exposing children, to attach to them
                                some jewel or trinket among their clothes, hoping thereby to avoid
                                incurring the guilt above mentioned, and to ease their

                                says that the meaning of this passage is this: Chremes tells his
                                wife that by having given this ring, she has done two good acts
                                instead of one--she has both cleared her conscience and saved the
                                child; for had there been no ring or token exposed with the infant,
                                the finder would not have been at the trouble of taking care of it,
                                but might have left it to perish, never suspecting it would be
                                inquired after, or himself liberally rewarded for having preserved

                                "Infortunium!" was the name by which the slaves commonly denoted a
                                beating. Colman has the following remark here: " Madame Dacier, and
                                most of the later critics who have implicitly followed her, tell us
                                that in the interval between the third and fourth Acts, Syrus has
                                been present at the interview between Chremes and Antiphila within.
                                The only difficulty in this doctrine is how to reconcile it to the
                                apparent ignorance of Syrus, which he discovers at the entrance of
                                Clinia. But this objection, says she, is easily answered. Syrus
                                having partly heard Antiphila's story, and finding things likely to
                                take an unfavorable turn, retires, to consider what is best to be
                                done. But surely this is a most unnatural impatience at so critical
                                a conjuncture; and, after all, would it not be better to take up the
                                matter just where Terence has left it, and to suppose that Syrus
                                knew nothing more of the affair than what might be collected from
                                the late conversation between Chremes and Sostrata, at which we know
                                he was present ? This at once accounts for his apprehensions, which
                                he betrayed even during that Scene, as well as for his imperfect
                                knowledge of the real state of the case, till apprised of the whole

                            Bacchis here, our old man will immediately come to know that she is
                            Clitipho's mistress; if you take her away with you, it will be concealed
                            just as much as it has been hitherto concealed.</p>

                            for with what face am I to address my father about it? You understand
                            what I mean ?</p>

                        <p> Nay, I don't want you to dissemble; tell him the whole case just as it
                            really is.</p>

                        <speaker>SYRUS</speaker>
                        <p> I bid you do this; tell him that you are in love with her, and want her
                            for a wife: that this Bacchis is Clitipho's mistress.</p>
                    </sp>

                        <speaker>CLINIA</speaker>
                        <p> You require a thing that is fair and reasonable, and easy to be done.
                            And I suppose, then, you would have me request my father to keep it a
                            secret from your old man.</p>
                    </sp>

                        <speaker>SYRUS</speaker>
                        <p> On the contrary; to tell him directly the matter just as it is.</p>
                    </sp>
                    <sp>
                        <speaker>CLINIA</speaker>
                        <p> What? Are you quite in your senses or sober? Why, you were for ruining
                            him outright. For how could he be in a state of security ? Tell me
                            that.</p>
                    </sp>
                    <sp>
                        <speaker>SYRUS</speaker>
                        <p> For my part, I yield the palm to this device. Here I do pride myself
                            exultingly, in having in myself such exquisite resources, and power of
                            address so great, as to deceive them both by telling the truth: so that
                            when your old man tells ours that she is his son's mistress, he'll still
                            not believe him.</p>

                        <speaker>CLINIA</speaker>
                        <p> But yet, by these means you again cut off all hopes of my marriage; for
                            as long as Chremes believes that she is my mistress, he'll not give me
                            his daughter. Perhaps you care little what becomes of me, so long as you
                            provide for him.</p>

                            an age ? 'Tis but for a single day, only till I have secured the money:
                            you be quiet; I ask no more.</p>

                                Colman quotes the following remark from Patrick: "There is a
                                remarkable passage in Arrian's Account of Alexander, lib. iv., where
                                he tells us that some embassadors from the Celtae, being asked by
                                Alexander what in the world they dreaded most, answered, ' That they
                                feared lest the sky should fall [upon them].' Alexander, who
                                expected to hear himself named, was surprised at an answer which
                                signified that they thought themselves beyond the reach of all human
                                power, plainly implying that nothing could hurt them, unless he
                                would suppose impossibilities, or a total destruction of nature."
                                Aristotle, in his Physics, B. iv., informs us that it was the early
                                notion of ignorant nations that the sky was supported on the
                                shoulders of Atlas, and that when he let go of it, it would
                                fall.</note>

                                of composition, and quoted certain lines which occur in the

                                Cooke suggests that the Poet makes Bacchis call the house of
                                Charinus "villa," and that of Chremes "fundus" (which signifies " a
                                farm-house," or "farm"), for the purpose of exalting the one and
                                depreciating the other in the hearing of Syrus.</note></p>

                                speech in the original, and the Commentators have been puzzled to
                                make sense of them. It seems to me that the Poet's intention is no
                                more than this: Bacchis expresses some reluctance to act under the
                                direction of Syrus, but is at length prevailed on, finding that he
                                can by those means contrive to pay her the money which he has

                        <p> Clinia has told Menedemus, that this Bacchis is your Clitipho's
                            mistress, and that he has taken her thither with him in order that you
                            might not come to know of it.</p>

                        <speaker>SYRUS</speaker>
                        <p> Tell me, please, what you think of it.</p>

                    <sp>
                        <speaker>CHREMES</speaker>
                        <p> Extremely good, I declare.</p>
                    </sp>
                    <sp>
                        <speaker>SYRUS</speaker>
                        <p> Why yes, pretty fair. But listen, what a piece of policy still remains.
                            He is then to say that he has seen your daughter--that her beauty
                            charmed him as soon as he beheld her; and that he desires her for a

                        <speaker>SYRUS</speaker>
                        <p> The same; and, in fact, he'll request that she may be asked for.</p>

                        <speaker>CHREMES</speaker>
                        <p> For what purpose, Syrus? For I don't altogether comprehend it.</p>

                        <speaker>CHREMES</speaker>
                        <p> Perhaps so. </p>

                        <p> Money will be given him for the wedding--with which golden trinkets and
                            clothes----do you understand me?</p>
                    </sp>
                    <sp>
                        <speaker>CHREMES</speaker>
                        <p> To buy them----?</p>
                    </sp>
                    <sp>
                        <speaker>SYRUS</speaker>
                        <p> Just so.</p>
                    </sp>
                    <sp>
                        <speaker>CHREMES</speaker>
                        <p> But I neither give nor betroth my daughter to him.</p>
                    </sp>
                    <sp>
                        <speaker>SYRUS</speaker>
                        <p> But why?</p>
                    </sp>
                    <sp>
                        <speaker>CHREMES</speaker>
                        <p> Why, do you ask me? To a fellow----</p>
                    </sp>
                    <sp>
                        <speaker>SYRUS</speaker>
                        <p> Just as you please. I don't mean that in reality you should give her to
                            him, but that you should pretend it.</p>
                    </sp>
                    <sp>
                        <speaker>CHREMES</speaker>
                        <p> Pretending is not in my way; do you mix up these plots of yours, so as
                            not to mix me up in them. Do you think that I'll betroth my daughter to
                            a person to whom I will not marry her?</p>
                    </sp>
                    <sp>
                        <speaker>SYRUS</speaker>
                        <p> I imagined so.</p>
                    </sp>
                    <sp>
                        <speaker>CHREMES</speaker>
                        <p> By no means.</p>
                    </sp>
                    <sp>
                        <speaker>SYRUS</speaker>
                        <p> It might have been cleverly managed; and I under-took this affair for
                            the very reason, that a short time since you so urgently requested
                            it.</p>
                    </sp>
                    <sp>
                        <speaker>CHREMES</speaker>
                        <p> I believe you.</p>
                    </sp>
                    <sp>
                        <speaker>SYRUS</speaker>
                        <p> But for my part, Chremes, I take it well and good, either way.</p>
                    </sp>
                    <sp>
                        <speaker>CHREMES</speaker>
                        <p> But still, I especially wish you to do your best for it to be brought
                            about; but in some other way.</p>
                    </sp>

                        <speaker>SYRUS</speaker>
                        <p> It shall be done: some other method must be thought of; but as to what I
                            was telling you of,--about the money which she owes to Bacchis,--that
                            must now be repaid her. And you will not, of course, now be having
                            recourse to this method; "What have I to do with it? Was it lent to me?
                            Did I give any orders? Had she the power to pawn my daughter without my
                            consent?" They quote that saying, Chremes, with good reason, " Riorous

                                malitia." "' Extreme law, extreme injustice,' is now become a stale
                                proverb in discourse." The same sentiment is found in the Fragments

                        <speaker>SYRUS</speaker>
                        <p> Why, because the suspicion of being in love with her has been
                            transferred to him with Menedemus.</p>

                        <speaker>SYRUS</speaker>
                        <p> Because it will seem to be more like probability when he gives it her;
                            and at the same time I shall effect more easily what I wish. Here he
                            comes too; go, and bring out the money.</p>

                            difficult when you do it with reluctance. As this walk of mine, for
                            instance, though not fatiguing, it has reduced me to weariness. And now
                            I dread nothing more than that I should be packed off somewhere hence
                            once again, that I may not have access to Bacchis. May then all the Gods

                            might have been fully sensible of this? What was it I saw? Alas! wretch

                            ask of you; so that he may look for no other resources and forsake

                                following Note: "The departure of Menedemus here is very abrupt,
                                seeming to be in the midst of a conversation; and his re-entrance
                                with Clitipho, already supposed to be apprised of what has passed
                                between the two old gentlemen, is equally precipitate. Menage
                                imagines that some verses are lost here. Madame Dacier strains hard
                                to defend the Poet, and fills up the void of time by her old
                                expedient of making the Audience wait to see Chremes walk
                                impatiently to and fro, till a sufficient time is elapsed for
                                Menedemus to have given Clitipho a summary account of the cause of
                                his father's anger. The truth is, that a too strict observance of
                                the unity of place will necessarily produce such absurdities; and
                                there are several other instances of the like nature in

                            importance, and did not look forward to the future, I took measures that
                            you might neither want nor be able to waste this which I have. When,

                        <p> I'll tell you what's come into my mind; be you the judge. While they had
                            you alone, while they had no other source of joy more nearly to affect
                            them, they indulged you, they lavished upon you. Now a daughter has been
                            found, a pretense has been found in fact on which to turn you
                            adrift.</p>

                    <sp>
                        <speaker>CLITIPHO</speaker>
                        <p> It's very probable.</p>
                    </sp>
                    <sp>
                        <speaker>SYRUS</speaker>
                        <p> Do you suppose that he is so angry on account of this fault?</p>
                    </sp>
                    <sp>
                        <speaker>CLITIPHO</speaker>
                        <p> I do not think so.</p>

                        <speaker>SYRUS</speaker>
                        <p> Now consider another thing. All mothers are wont to be advocates for
                            their sons when in fault, and to aid them against a father's severity;
                            'tis not so here.</p>
                    </sp>
                    <sp>
                        <speaker>CLITIPHO</speaker>
                        <p> You say true; what then shall I now do, Syrus?</p>
                    </sp>
                    <sp>
                        <speaker>SYRUS</speaker>
                        <p> Question them on this suspicion; mention the matter without reserve;
                            either, if it is not true, you'll soon bring them both to compassion, or
                            else you'll soon find out whose son you are. </p>
                    </sp>
                    <sp>
                        <speaker>CLITIPHO</speaker>
                        <p> You give good advice; I'll do so. <stage>He goes into the house of
                                CHREMES.</stage></p>

                            For the less hope the young man entertains, the greater the difficulty
                            with which he'll bring his father to his own terms. I'm not sure even,
                            that he may not take a wife, and then no thanks for Syrus. But what is
                            this? The old man's coming out of doors; I'll be off. What has so far
                            happened, I am surprised at, that he didn't order me to becarried off
                            from here: now I'll away to Menedemus here, I'll secure him as my
                            intercessor; I can put no trust in our old man. <stage>Goes into the

                                intimates such a proof to be easy, because Clitipho and Antiphila
                                were extremely alike; which sense she thinks immediately confirmed
                                by the answer of Chremes. I can not agree with any of them, and
                                think that the whole difficulty of the passage here, as in many
                                other places, is entirely of their own making. Sostrata could not
                                refer to the reply of Chremes, because she could not possibly tell
                                what it would be; but her own speech is intended as an answer to his
                                preceding one, which she takes as a sneer on her late wonderful
                                discovery of a daughter; imagining that he means to insinuate that
                                she could at any time with equal ease make out the proofs of the
                                birth of her son. The elliptical mode of expression so usual with
                                Terence, together with the refinements of Commentators, seem to have
                                created all the obscurity."</note></p>

                        <p> No; but for a reason why it should be much sooner believed--because he
                            is just like you in disposition, you will easily prove that he is your
                            child; for he is exactly like you; why, he has not a single vice left
                            him but you have just the same. Then, besides, no woman could have been
                            the mother of such a son but yourself. But he's coming out of doors, and
                            how demure! When you understand the matter, you may form your own
                            conclusions.</p>

                            soon become attached to, the daughter of our neighbor Phanocrata.</p>

                        <p> What! that red-haired girl, with cat's eyes, freckled face,<l n="1060"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>Freckled face</lem></app>: Many take "sparso ore" here to mean
                                "wide-mouthed." Lemonnier thinks that must be the meaning, as he has
                                analyzed the other features of her countenance. There is, however,
                                no reason why he should not speak of her complexion; and it seems,
                                not improbably, to have the same meaning as the phrase "os
                                lentiginosum," "a freckled face."</note> and hooked nose? I can not,
                            father.</p>
