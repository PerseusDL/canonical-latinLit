               <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
               <p>THE plot of the Heautontimorumenos turns, as is often the case, partly
                  upon the recognition of a child which had been exposed as an infant. Sostrata the
                  wife of Chremes had an infant daughter, which her husband refused to bring up, and
                  ordered to be exposed. She gave it to an old woman for that purpose, attaching to
                  its dress a ring, from a superstitious feeling that the child ought not to be
                  entirely disinherited. The old woman, instead of exposing the child, brought her
                  up as her own daughter, and named her Antiphila. When she grew up she attracted
                  the attention of Clinia. son of Menedemus. Their attachment continued for some
                  time before it came to the knowledge of Clinia's father. As soon as he discovered
                  it he began to persecute his son about the affair, till at last the young man, to
                  put an end to the dispute, went to <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, and there entered the service of the king. No sooner had he
                  gone than his father repented his severity; and finding that his son was past
                  recall, he determined, as the only amends he could make, to inflict upon himself a
                  continual penance. He sold his house, and all his servants except a few to work
                  upon a farm which he purchased. There he kept himself at work from morning to
                  night. Three months passed in this way, and at the end of that time, Clinia, who
                  could not support any longer his absence from his mistress, returns and is
                  received into the house of Chremes, whose son Clitipho had been his friend from
                  his childhood. No sooner has he arrived than his servant Dromo is sent with Syrus,
                  Clitipho's slave, to bring Antiphila to her lover. Syrus discharges his errand
                  more cleverly than was intended; he found Antiphila alone, for her reputed mother,
                  Philtere, had died in the interval, and in circumstances which shewed that she was
                  still faithful to Clinia. Thinking besides to do a stroke of business for his own
                  master, he brings at the same time Bacchis, Clitipho's mistress, a very different
                  character from Antiphila: and that Chremes may have no suspicion of this
                  connection of his son's, it is arranged that Bacchis shall pass for Clinia's
                  mistress, and Antiphila for one of her servants. While this is going on, Chremes
                  and Menedemus have been talking together; Chremes remonstrating with Menedemus
                  upon his unintelligible conduct in working himself to death instead of
                  superintending his slaves, and Menedemus explaining his reasons by an account of
                  what led to his son's departure, and his consequent determination to punish
                  himself till his return. Chremes being unable to shake his friend's determination,
                  returns to keep the festival of <persName>Bacchus</persName>
                  at his own house. There he finds the party assembled, and what with Bacchis and
                  the young men they make a pretty night of it, nearly emptying his cellar, and
                  turning the house upside down. Early next morning Chremes, who has a strong head
                  for an old man, goes to meet his friend Menedemus as he comes out to his work, and
                  informs him of his son's return. He advises him to be cautious in receiving him,
                  tells him what sort of a life he has to expect, and recommends him to do any thing
                  rather than openly encourage his son in such debauchery. Menedemus begs him to do
                  any thing he can to bring about a reunion with his son, even if it be to encourage
                  the young man and Syrus to cheat him in any imaginable way. Chremes enters into
                  the plan: and encourages Syrus to devise some scheme for making Menedemus supply
                  Clinia with the means of indulgence. Syrus has already some such scheme on foot;
                  but it is to be directed against Chremes, for he has promised Bacchis ten minae
                  for her share in the night's amusements, and intends to get it out of his master.
                  So he at once explains to his master a plausible scheme that he has, namely, to
                  induce Menedemus to buy Antiphila from Bacchis, to whom she has been left in pawn
                  by Philtere, on the representation that she is a captive from Caria whom her
                  friends are sure to ransom very handsomely. Meanwhile Sostrata has discovered,
                  through the medium of the aforesaid ring, that Antiphila is her own daughter. This
                  disconcerts Syrus, who now springs a new mine; he sends Bacchis off to Menedemus'
                  house, and explains to Chremes that the only way to deceive Menedemus now, is to
                  pretend that she is Clitipho's mistress, and at the same time to get Clinia to
                  profess an attachment to Antiphila, and desire his father to demand her in
                  marriage, for then the old man would have to supply him with money for the
                  marriage, which of course would go to his mistress Bacchis. At the same time
                  Chremes is persuaded to release his daughter from her pledge to Bacchis; and the
                  money is given to Clitipho to carry to Bacchis for the purpose forsooth of more
                  fully persuading Menedemus that she is his mistress. At this point the
                  dénouement takes place. Clitipho acts his part of Bacchis' lover a
                  little too well, and all the circumstances are discovered by Menedemus, who
                  proceeds to inform Chremes of the real state of the case. Now the two old men
                  change places, Chremes is enraged beyond measure at having been made the dupe of
                  his dissolute son, and Menedemus has to urge upon him the same maxims of
                  forbearance which Chremes had used to him. Clitipho has to undergo a complete
                  humiliation; but is ultimately received into favour by his father upon his
                  promising to settle and lead a respectable life.</p>
               <p xml:lang="eng">This play is remarkable for a supposed irregularity in its construction,
                  which has made it the subiect of an animated controversy among advocates of the
                  'Unities.' It is clear that the opening scene of the play is laid at evening, when
                  Menedemus is just finishing his day's work. The Third Act commences with the
                  following morning, and in the interval the supper at Chremes' house takes place.
                  This in itself, though an exception to the general arrangement of Terence's plays,
                  is not a very important matter. The theory of the 'Unities' is not to be received
                  as an absolute law for the Drama: and there is nothing in this case which is not
                  abundantly justified by many other instances. Upon this point turns a theory which
                  was first mooted by Scaliger, and afterwards maintained by Madame Dacier,--that
                  this play was acted in two portions: the first two Acts at night, after sunset;
                  and the three remaining Acts the next morning at break of day; the interval
                  between the two parts being taken up with the supper at Chremes' house. This idea
                  proceeds entirely upon the supposed necessity of filling up the interval between
                  the Second and Third Acts; and is, as far as we are informed, entirely gratuitous.
                  Colman has shown the absurdity of the idea very well in his remarks on this
                  subiect. Any one who considers that the Roman Drama was performed in the open air,
                  will at once see the improbability of such a mode of representation. The Roman
                  Amphitheatre was at any time a disadvantageous arena for the Drama. What must have
                  been the success of a play, acted partly at night-fall, partly before breakfast
                  next morning? Nothing but a devotion to the 'Unities' could have led to such an
                  idea; and it will be dismissed without any further discussion, now that a more
                  artistic idea of Dramatic Unity is generally recognized. </p></div>
