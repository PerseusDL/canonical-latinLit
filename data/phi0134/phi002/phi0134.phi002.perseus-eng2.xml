<milestone unit="paragraph"/>THE SUBJECT.
<milestone unit="paragraph"/>CHREMES commands his wife, when pregnant, if she is delivered of a girl immediately to kill the child. Having given birth to a girl, Sostrata delivers her to an old woman named Philtera to be exposed. Instead of doing this, Philtera calls her Antiphila, and brings her up as her own. Clinia, the son of Menedemus, falls in love with her, and treats her as though his wife. Menedemus, on learning this, is very angry, and by his harsh language drives away his son from home. Taking this to heart, and in order to punish himself for his ill-timed severity, Menedemus, though now an aged man, fatigues himself by laboring at agricultural pursuits from morning till night. At the period when the Play commences, Clinia has just returned to <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, but not daring to go to his father’s house, is entertained by Clitipho, the son of Chremes, who is the neighbor of Menedemus. Clitipho then sends for Antiphila, whose supposed mother has recently died, to come and meet her lover. On the same day, Chremes learns from Menedemus how anxious he is for his son’s return; and on hearing from his son of the arrival of Clinia, he defers informing Menedemus of it until the next day. Syrus, the servant who has been sent to fetch Antiphila, also brings with him Bacchis, an extravagant Courtesan, the mistress of Clitipho. To conceal the truth from Chremes, they represent to him that Bacchis is the mistress of Clinia, and that Antiphila is one of her maids. Next morning Chremes informs Menedemus of his son’s arrival, and of the extravagant conduct of his mistress, but begs that he will conceal from Clinia his knowledge of this fact. Bacchis requiring ten minae, Syrus devises a plan for obtaining the money from Chremes, while the latter is encouraging him to think of a project against Menedemus. Syrus tells him a story, that the mother of Antiphila had borrowed a thousand drachmae of Bacchis, and being dead, the girl is left in her hands as a pledge for the money. While these things are going on, Sostrata discovers in Antiphila her own daughter. In order to obtain the money which Bacchis persists in demanding, Syrus suggests to Chremes that it should be represented to Menedemus that Bacchis is the mistress of Clitipho, and that he should be requested to conceal her in his house for a few days; it is also arranged that Clinia shall pretend to his father to be in love with Antiphila, and to beg her as his wife. He is then to ask for money, as though for the wedding, which is to be handed over to Bacchis. Chremes does not at first approve of the plan suggested by Syrus; but he pays down the money for which he has been informed his daughter is a pledge in the hands of Bacchis. This, with his knowledge, is given to Clitipho, who, as Syrus says, is to convey it to Bacchis, who is now in the house of Menedemus, to make the latter more readily believe that she is his mistress. Shortly after this, the plot is discovered by Chremes, who threatens to punish Clitipho and Syrus. The Play concludes with Chremes giving his consent to the marriage of Clinia with Antiphila, and pardoning Clitipho, who promises to abandon the Courtesan, and marry. Unlike the other Plays of Terence and Plautus, the Plot of this Play extends over two days. </l>

<milestone unit="paragraph"/>THE TITLE OF THE PLAY.
<milestone unit="paragraph"/>IT is from the Greek of Menander. Performed at the Megalensian Games; Lucius Cornelius Lentulus and Lucius Valerius Flaccus being Curule Aediles. Ambivius Turpio performed it. Flaccus, the freedman of Claudius, composed the music. The first time it was performed to the music of treble and bass flutes; the second time, of two treble flutes. It was acted three times; Marcus Juventius and Titus Sempronius being Consuls.<note resp="translator"><q rend="double" type="mentioned">Being Consuls.</q>—M. Juventius Thalna and Ti.

<milestone unit="paragraph"/>THE SUMMARY OF C. SULPITIUS APOLLINARIS.
<milestone unit="paragraph"/>A SEVERE father compels his son Clinia, in love with Antiphila, to go abroad to the wars; and repenting of what has been done, torments himself in mind. Afterward, when he has returned, unknown to his father, he is entertained at the house of Clitipho. The latter is in love with Bacchis, a Courtesan. When Clinia sends for his much-loved Antiphila, Bacchis comes, as though his mistress, and Antiphila, wearing the garb of her servant; this is done in order that Clitipho may conceal it from his father. He, through the stratagems of Syrus, gets ten minae from the old man for the Courtesan. Antiphila is discovered to be the sister of Clitipho. Clinia receives her, and Clitipho, another woman, for his wife. </l></div>

<sp> <speaker>THE PROLOGUE</speaker>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi002.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="1">LEST it should be a matter of surprise to any one of you, why the Poet has assigned to an old man<note resp="translator"><q type="mentioned" rend="double">Assigned to an old man</q>: He refers to the fact that the Prologue was in general spoken by young men, whereas it is here spoken by L. Ambivius Turpio, the leader of the Company, a man stricken in years. The Prologue was generally not recited by a person who performed a character in the opening Scene.</note> a part that belongs to the young, that I will first explain to you;<note resp="translator"><q type="mentioned" rend="double">That I will first explain to you</q>: His meaning seems to be, that he will first tell them the reason why he, who is to take a part in the opening Scene, speaks the Prologue, which is usually spoken by a young man who does not take part in that Scene; and that he will then proceed to speak in character (<foreign xml:lang="lat">eloquor</foreign>), as Chremes, in the first Scene. His reason for being chosen to speak the Prologue, is that he may be a pleader (<foreign xml:lang="lat">orator</foreign>) for the Poet, a task which would be likely to be better performed by him than by a younger man.</note> and then, the reason for my coming I will disclose. An entire Play from an entire Greek one,<note resp="translator"><q type="mentioned" rend="double">From an entire Greek one</q>: In contradistinction to such Plays as the Andria, as to which it was a subject of complaint that it had been formed out of a mixture (<foreign xml:lang="lat">contaminantus</foreign>) of the Andrian and Perinthian of Menander.</note></l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi002.perseus-eng2" n="5">the Heautontimorumenos, I am to-day about to represent, which from a two-fold plot<note resp="translator"><q type="mentioned" rend="double">Which from a two-fold plot</q>: Vollbehr suggests that the meaning of this line is, that though it is but one Play, it has a two-fold plot—the intrigues of two young men with two mistresses, and the follies of two old men. As this Play is supposed to represent the events of two successive days, the night intervening, it has been suggested that the reading is <q rend="double" type="foreign" xml:lang="lat">duplex—ex argumento—simplici;</q> the Play is <q rend="double" type="gloss">two-fold, with but one plot,</q> as extending to two successive days. The Play derives its name from the Greek words, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑαυτὸν,</foreign> <q rend="double" type="gloss">himself,</q> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τιμωρουμενὸς,</foreign> <q rend="double" type="gloss">tormenting.</q></note> has been made but one. I have shown that it is new, and what it is: next I would mention who it was that wrote it, and whose in Greek it is, if I did not think that the greater part of you are aware. </l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi002.perseus-eng2" n="10">Now, for what reason I have learned this part, in a few words I will explain. The Poet intended me to be a Pleader,<note resp="translator"><q type="mentioned" rend="double">To be a Pleader</q>: He is to be the pleader and advocate of the Poet, to influence the Audience in his favor, and against his adversaries; and not to explain the plot of the Play. Colman has the following observation: <quote rend="double">It is impossible not to regret that there are not above ten lines of the Self-Tormentor preserved among the Fragments of Menander. We are so deeply interested by what we see of that character in Terence, that one can not but be curious to inquire in what manner the Greek Poet sustained it through five Acts. The Roman author, though he has adopted the title of the Greek Play, has so altered the fable, that Menedemus is soon thrown into the background, and Chremes is brought forward as the principal object; or, to vary: the allusion a little, the Menedemus of Terence seems to be a drawing in miniature copied from a full length, as large as the life, by Menander.</quote></note> not the Speaker of a Prologue; your decision he asks, and has appointed me the advocate; if this advocate can avail as much by his oral powers as he has excelled in inventing happily,</l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi002.perseus-eng2" n="15">who composed this speech which I am about to recite. For as to malevolent rumors spreading abroad that he has mixed together many Greek Plays while writing a few Latin ones, he does not deny that this is the case, and that he does not repent of so doing; and he affirms that he will do so again.</l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi002.perseus-eng2" n="20">He has the example of good Poets; after which example he thinks it is allowable for him to do what they have done. Then, as to a malevolent old Poet<note resp="translator"><q type="mentioned" rend="double">A malevolent old Poet</q>: He alludes to his old enemy, Luscus Lavinius, referred to in the preceding Prologue.</note> saying that he has suddenly applied himself to dramatic pursuits, relying on the genius of his friends,<note resp="translator"><q type="mentioned" rend="double">The genius of his friends</q>: He alludes to a report which had been spread, that his friends Laelius and Scipio had published their own compositions under his name. Servilius is also mentioned by Eugraphius as another of his patrons respecting whom similar stories were circulated.</note> and not his own natural abilities;</l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi002.perseus-eng2" n="25">on that your judgment your your opinion, will prevail. Wherefore I do entreat you all, that the suggestions of our antagonists may not avail more than those of our favorers. Do you be favorable; grant the means of prospering to those who afford you the means of being spectators of new Plays;</l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi002.perseus-eng2" n="30">those, I mean, without faults: that he may not suppose this said in his behalf who lately made the public give way to a slave as he ran along in the street;<note resp="translator"><q type="mentioned" rend="double">As he ran along in the street</q>: He probably does not intend to censure this practice entirely in Comedy, but to remind the Audience that in some recent Play of Luscus Lavinius this had been the sole stirring incident introduced. Plautus introduces Mercury running in the guise of Sosia, in the fourth Scene of the Amphitryon, 1. 987, and exclaiming, <quote rend="double">For surely, why, faith, should I, a God, be any less allowed to threaten the public, if it doesn’t get out of my way, than a slave in the Comedies?</quote> This practice can not, however, be intended to be here censured by Plautus, as he is guilty of it in three other instances. In the Mercator, Acanthio runs to his master Charinus, to tell him that his mistress Pasicompsa has been seen in the ship by his father Demipho; in the Stichus, Pinacium, a slave, runs to inform his mistress Philumena that her husband has arrived in port, on his return from <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>; and in the Mostellaria, Tranio, in haste, brings information of the unexpected arrival of Theuropides. The <q rend="double" type="foreign" xml:lang="lat">currens servus</q> is also mentioned in the Prologue to the Andria, 1. 36. See the soliloquy of Stasimus, in the Trinummus of Plautus, 1. 1007.</note> why should he take a madman’s part? About his faults he will say more when he brings out some other new ones, unless he puts an end to his caviling.</l>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi002.perseus-eng2" n="35">Attend with favorable feelings; grant me the opportunity that I may be allowed to act a quiet Play<note resp="translator"><q type="mentioned" rend="double">A quiet Play</q>: <q rend="double" type="foreign" xml:lang="lat">Statariam.</q> See the spurious Prologue to the Bacchides of Plautus, l. 10, and the Note to the passage in Bohn’s Translation.

<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi002.perseus-eng2" n="40">with the utmost expense of voice, and the greatest exertion. For my sake come to the conclusion that this request is fair, that so some portion of my labor may be abridged. For nowadays, those who write new Plays do not spare an aged man.

Cicero quotes the passage in his work De Officiis, B. i., c. 9. The remarks of Sir Richard Steele upon this passage, in the Spectator, No. 502, are worthy to be transcribed at length. <quote rend="double">The Play was the Self-Tormentor. It is from the beginning to the end a perfect picture of human life, but I did not observe in the whole one passage that could raise a laugh. How well-disposed must that people be, who could be entertained with satisfaction by so sober and polite mirth! In the first Scene of the Comedy, when one of the old men accuses the other of impertinence for interposing in his affairs, he answers, <q rend="single" type="spoken">I am a man, and can not help feeling any sorrow that can arrive at man</q>. It is said this sentence was received with an universal applause. There can not be a greater argument of the general good understanding of a people, than their sudden consent to give their approbation of a sentiment which has no emotion in it. If it were spoken with ever so great skill in the actor, the manner of uttering that sentence could have nothing in it which could strike any but people of the greatest humanity—nay, people elegant and skillful in observation upon it. It is possible that he may have laid his hand on his heart, and with a winning insinuation in his countenance, expressed to his neighbor that he was a man who made his case his own; yet I will engage, a player in <placeName key="tgn,4012717">Covent Garden</placeName> might hit such an attitude a thousand times before he would have been regarded.</quote></note> and nothing that concerns a man do I deem a matter of indifference to me.

The only difficulty in this doctrine is how to reconcile it to the apparent ignorance of Syrus, which he discovers at the entrance of Clinia. But this objection, says she, is easily answered. Syrus having partly heard Antiphila’s story, and finding things likely to take an unfavorable turn, retires, to consider what is best to be done. But surely this is a most unnatural impatience at so critical a conjuncture; and, after all, would it not be better to take up the matter just where Terence has left it, and to suppose that Syrus knew nothing more of the affair than what might be collected from the late conversation between Chremes and Sostrata, at which we know he was present?

Colman has the following just remarks upon it: <quote rend="double">Madame Dacier, as well as all the rest of the Commentators, has stuck at these words. Most of them imagine she means to say, that the discovery of Antiphila is a plain proof that she is not barren. Madame Dacier supposes that she intimates such a proof to be easy, because Clitipho and Antiphila were extremely alike; which sense she thinks immediately confirmed by the answer of Chremes. I can not agree with any of them, and think that the whole difficulty of the passage here, as in many other places, is entirely of their own making. Sostrata could not refer to the reply of Chremes, because she could not possibly tell what it would be; but her own speech is intended as an answer to his preceding one, which she takes as a sneer on her late wonderful discovery of a daughter; imagining that he means to insinuate that she could at any time with equal ease make out the proofs of the birth of her son. The elliptical mode of expression so usual with Terence, together with the refinements of Commentators, seem to have created all the obscurity.</quote></note> </l></sp>
