   <milestone unit="paragraph"/>THE SUBJECT.
   <milestone unit="paragraph"/>A CERTAIN citizen of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> had a daughter named Pamphila, and a son called Chremes. The former was stolen while an infant, and sold to a Rhodian merchant, who having made a present of her to a Courtesan of <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>, she brought her up with her own daughter Thais, who was somewhat older. In the course of years, Thais following her mother’s way of life, removes to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. Her mother dying, her property is put up for sale, and Pamphila is purchased as a slave by Thraso, an officer and an admirer of Thais, who happens just then to be visiting <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>. During the absence of Thraso, Thais becomes acquainted with Phaedria, an Athenian youth, the son of Laches; she also discovers from Chremes, who lives near <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that Pamphila, her former companion, is his sister. Thraso returns, intending to present to her the girl he has bought, but determines not to do so until she has discarded Phaedria. Finding that the girl is no other than Pamphila, Thais is at a loss what to do, as she both loves Phaedria, and is extremely anxious to recover Pamphila. At length, to please the Captain, she excludes Phaedria, but next day sends for him, and explains to him her reasons, at the same time begging of him to allow Thraso the sole right of admission to her house for the next two days, and assuring him that as soon as she shall have gained possession of the girl, she will entirely throw him off. Phaedria consents, and resolves to spend these two days in the country; at the same time he orders Parmeno to take to Thais a Eunuch and an Aethiopian girl, whom he has purchased for her. The Captain also sends Pamphila, who is accidentally seen by Chaerea, the younger brother of Phaedria; he, being smitten with her beauty, prevails upon Parmeno to introduce him into the house of Thais, in the Eunuch’s dress. Being admitted there, in the absence of Thais, he ravishes the damsel. Shortly afterward Thraso quarrels with Thais, and comes with all his attendants to her house to demand the return of Pamphila, but is disappointed. In conclusion, Pamphila is recognized by her brother Chremes, and is promised in marriage to Chaerea; while Thraso becomes reconciled to Phaedria, through the mediation of Gnatho, his Parasite. </l>

   <milestone unit="paragraph"/>THE SUMMARY OF C. SULPITIUS APOLLINARIS.
   <milestone unit="paragraph"/>THE Captain, Thraso, being ignorant of the same, has brought from abroad a girl who used wrongly to be called the sister of Thais, and presents her to Thais herself: she in reality is a citizen of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>. To the same woman, Phaedria, an admirer of Thais, orders a Eunuch whom he has purchased, to be taken, and he himself goes away into the country, having been entreated to give up two days to Thraso. A youth, the brother of Phaedria, having fallen in love with the damsel sent to the house of Thais, is dressed up in the clothes of the Eunuch. Parmeno prompts him; he goes in; he ravishes the maiden; but at length her brother being discovered, a citizen of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, betroths her who has been ravished, to the youth, and Thraso prevails upon Phaedria by his entreaties. </l></div>

<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi003.perseus-eng2" n="6">that it is an answer, not an attack; inasmuch as he has himself been the first aggressor; who, by translating plays verbally,<note resp="translator"><q rend="double" type="mentioned">By translating literally</q>: <q rend="double" xml:lang="lat">Bene vertendo, at eosdem scribendo male</q>. This passage has greatly puzzled some of the Commentators. Bentley has, however, it appears, come to the most reasonable conclusion; who supposes that Terence means by <q rend="double" xml:lang="lat">bene vertere</q>, a literal translation, word for word, from the Greek, by which a servile adherence to the idiom of that language was preserved to the neglect of the Latin idiom; in consequence of which the Plays of Luscus Lavinius were, as he remarks, <q rend="double" xml:lang="lat">male scriptae</q>, written in bad Latin.</note> and writing them in bad Latin, has made out of good Greek Plays Latin ones by no means good. Just as of late he has published the Phasma<note resp="translator"><q rend="double" type="mentioned">Has published the Phasma</q>: The <title xml:lang="grc">Φασμά</title>, or <q rend="double" type="gloss">Apparition</q>, was a play of Menander, so called, in which a young man looking through a hole in the wall between his father’s house and that next door, sees a young woman of marvelous beauty, and is struck with awe at the sight, as though by an apparition; in the Play, the girl’s mother is represented as having made this hole in the wall, and having decked it with garlands and branches that it may resemble a consecrated place; where she daily performs her devotions in company with her daughter, who has been privately brought up, and whose existence is unknown to the neighbors. On the youth coming by degrees to the knowledge that the object of his admiration is but a mortal, his passion becomes so violent that it will admit of no cure but marriage, with the celebration of which the Play concludes. Bentley gives us the above information from an ancient Scholiast, whose name is unknown, unless it is Donatus himself, which is doubtful. It would appear that Luscus Lavinius had lately made a translation of this Play, which, from its servile adherence to the language of the original, had been couched in ungrammatical language, and probably not approved of by the Audience. Donatus thinks that this is the meaning of the passage, and that, content with this slight reference to a well-known fact, the author passes it by in contemptuous silence.</note> [the Apparition] of Menander;</l>
 <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi003.perseus-eng2" n="10">and in the Thesaurus [the Treasure] has described<note resp="translator"><q rend="double" type="mentioned">And in the Thesaurus has described</q> Cook has the following appropriate remark upon this passage: <quote type="written" rend="double">In the <q rend="single" type="title">Thesaurus,</q> or <q rend="single" type="title">Treasure</q> of Luscus Lavinius, a young fellow, having wasted his estate by his extravagance, sends a servant to search his father’s monument: but he had before sold the ground on which the monument was, to a covetous old man; to whom the servant applies to help him open the monument; in which they discover a hoard and a letter. The old fellow sees the treasure and keeps it; the young one goes to law with him, and the old man is represented as opening his cause first before the judge, which he begins with these words:— <quote xml:lang="lat" rend="single">Athenienses, bellum cum Rhodiensibus, Quod fuerit, quid ego praedicem?</quote> <q rend="single" type="translation">Athenians, why should I relate the war with the Rhodians?</q> And lie goes on in a manner contrary to the rules of court; which Terence objects to, because the young man, who was the plaintiff, should open his cause first. Thus far Bentley, from the same Scholiast [as referred to in the last Note]. This Note is a clear explanation of the four verses to which it belongs. Hare concurs with Madame Dacier in her opinion <foreign xml:lang="lat" rend="single">de Thesauro,</foreign> that it is only a part of the Phasma of Menander, and not a distinct Play; but were I not determined by the more learned Bentley, the text itself would not permit me to be of their opinion; for the words <foreign xml:lang="lat" rend="single">atque in Thesauro scripsit</foreign> seem plainly to me to be a transition to another Play. The subject of the Thesaurus is related by Eugraphius, though not with all the circumstances mentioned in my Note from Bentlev.</quote> Colman also remarks here: <quote type="written" rend="double">Menander and his contemporary Philemon, each of them wrote a Comedy under this title. We have in the above Note the story of Menander’s; and we know that of Philemon’s from the <q rend="single" type="title" xml:lang="lat">Trinummus</q> of Plautus, which was a Translation of it.</quote></note> him from whom the gold is demanded, as pleading his cause why it should be deemed his own, before the person who demands it has stated how this treasure belongs to him, or how it came into the tomb of his father. Henceforward, let him not deceive himself, or fancy thus,</l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi003.perseus-eng2" n="15"><q rend="double">I have now done with it; there’s nothing that he can say to me.</q> I recommend him not to be mistaken, and to refrain from provoking me. I have many other points, as to which for the present he shall be pardoned, which, however, shall be brought forward hereafter, if he persists in attacking me, </l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi003.perseus-eng2" n="19">as he has begun to do. After the Aediles had purchased the Eunuch of Menander, the Play which we are about to perform, he managed to get an opportunity of viewing it.<note resp="translator"><q rend="double" type="mentioned">Opportunity of viewing it</q> Colman thinks that this means something <quote type="written" rend="double">stronger than merely being present at the representation,</quote> and he takes the meaning to be, that having obtained leave to peruse the MS., he furnished himself with objections against the piece, which he threw out when it came to be represented before the magistrates. Cooke thinks that the passage only means, <quote type="written" rend="double">that he bustled and took pains to be near enough at the representation to see and hear plainly.</quote> The truth seems to be that Lavinius managed to obtain admission at the rehearsal or trial of the merits of the piece before the magistrates, and that he then behaved himself in the unseemly manner mentioned in the text.</note> When the magistrates were present it began to be performed. He exclaimed that a thief, no Poet, had produced the piece, but still had not deceived<note resp="translator"><q rend="double" type="mentioned">Produced the piece, but still had not deceived him</q> There is a pun here upon the resemblance in meaning of the words <q rend="double" xml:lang="lat">verba dare</q> and <q rend="double" xml:lang="lat">fabulam dare</q>. The first expression means to <q type="gloss" rend="double">deceive</q> or <q type="gloss" rend="double">impose upon;</q> the latter phrase has also the same meaning, but it may signify as well <q type="gloss" rend="double">to represent</q> or <q type="gloss" rend="double">produce a Play.</q> Thus the exclamation in its ambiguity may mean, <q type="translation" rend="double">he has produced a Play, and has not succeeded in deceiving us,</q> or <q type="translation" rend="double">he has deceived us, and yet has not deceived us.</q> This is the interpretation which Donatus puts upon the passage.</note> him;</l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi003.perseus-eng2" n="25">that, in fact, it was the Colax, an old Play of Plautus;<note resp="translator"><q rend="double" type="mentioned">Colax, an old Play of Plautus</q> Although Nonius Marcellus professes to quote from the Colax of Plautus (so called from the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κολὺξ,</foreign> <q type="gloss" rend="double">a flatterer</q> or <q type="gloss" rend="double">parasite</q>), some scholars have disbelieved in the existence of any Play of Plautus known by that name. Cooke says: <quote type="written" rend="double">If Plautus had wrote a Play under the title of <q rend="single" type="title" xml:lang="lat">Colax,</q> I should think it very unlikely that it should have escaped Terence’s eye, considering how soon he flourished after Plautus, his being engaged in the same studies, and his having such opportunities to consult the libraries of the great; for though all learning was then confined to Manuscripts, Terence could have no difficulty in coming at the best copies. The character of the <q rend="single" type="title" xml:lang="lat">Miles Gloriosus</q> [Braggart Captain] here mentioned, I am inclined to think the same with that which is the hero of Plautus’s Comedy, now extant, and called <q rend="single" type="title" xml:lang="lat">Miles Gloriosus,</q> from which Terence could not take his Thraso. Pyrgopolinices and Thraso are both full of themselves, both boast of their valor and their intimacy with princes, and both fancy themselves beloved by all the women who see them; and they are both played off by their Parasites, but they differ in their manner and their speech: Plautus’s Pyrgopolinices is always in the clouds, and talking big, and of blood and wounds—Terence’s Thraso never says too little nor much, but is an easy ridiculous character, continually supplying the Audience with mirth without the wild extravagant bluster of Pyrgopolinices; Plautus and Terence both took their soldiers and Parasites from Menander, but gave them different dresses.</quote> Upon this Note Colman remarks: <quote type="written" rend="double">Though there is much good criticism in the above Note, it is certain that Plautus did not take his <q rend="single" type="title" xml:lang="lat">Miles Gloriosus</q> from the Colax of Menander, as he himself informs us it was translated from a Greek play called <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αλάζων,</foreign> <q rend="single" type="title">the Boaster,</q> and the Parasite is but a trifling character in that play, never appearing after the first Scene.</quote></note> and that from it were taken the characters of the Parasite and the Captain. If this is a fault, the fault is the ignorance of the Poet; not that he intended to be guilty of theft. That so it is, you will now be enabled to judge.</l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi003.perseus-eng2" n="30">The Colax is a Play of Meander’s; in it there is Colax, a Parasite, and a braggart Captain: he does not deny that he has transferred these characters into his Eunuch from the Greek; but assuredly he does deny this, that he was aware that those pieces had been already translated into Latin.</l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi003.perseus-eng2" n="35">But if it is not permitted us to use the same characters as others, how can it any more be allowed to represent hurrying servants,<note resp="translator"><q rend="double" type="mentioned">Hurrying servants</q> On the <q rend="double" xml:lang="lat">currentes servi</q>, see the Prologue to the Heautontimorumenos, <bibl n="Ter.

<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi003.perseus-eng2" n="615">this mad fellow will be guilty of some disturbance to-day or of some violence to Thais. For when this young man, the brother of the damsel, arrived, she begged the Captain to order him to be admitted; he immediately began to get into a passion, and yet didn’t dare refuse; Thais still insisted that he would invite the man in. This she did for the sake of detaining him; because there was no opportunity just then of telling him what she wanted to disclose about her sister. </l>
 <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi003.perseus-eng2" n="621">He was invited in, and took his seat. Then she entered into discourse with him. But the Captain, fancying it was a rival brought before his very eyes, wanted in his turn to mortify her: <q rend="double">Hark you, boy,</q> said he, <q rend="double">go fetch Pamphila, that she may amuse us here.</q> She exclaimed, <q rend="double">At a banquet! Certainly not.</q> The Captain still persisted to a downright quarrel.</l>
 <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi003.perseus-eng2" n="626">Meanwhile my mistress secretly took off her golden jewels,<note resp="translator"><q rend="double" type="mentioned">Took off her golden jewels</q>: This was probably because it was contrary to the laws of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> for a Courtesan to appear with gold or jewels in the street. Madame Dacier suggests another reason, in which there is some force, although it is ridiculed by Cooke. Thais may have supposed that the Captain, when irritated, might not have scrupled to take them away from her. Indeed, nothing would be more probable, than that he would be ready to take them by way of security for the return of the slave, whom he had thus, to no purpose, presented to her. In reference to the preceding line, we may remark that it was not customary among the Greeks for females of good character to appear at table with strangers.</note> and gave them to me to take away: this is a sign, I’m sure, that she’ll betake herself from there as soon as she possibly can.</l> <stage>(Goes into the house.)</stage></sp>
