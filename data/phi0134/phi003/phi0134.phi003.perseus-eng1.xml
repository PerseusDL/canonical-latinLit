					<head>THE SUBJECT.</head>

					<p>A CERTAIN citizen of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> had a
                        daughter named Pamphila, and a son called Chremes. The former was stolen
                        while an infant, and sold to a Rhodian merchant, who having made a present
                        of her to a Courtesan of <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>,
                        she brought her up with her own daughter Thais, who was somewhat older. In
                        the course of years, Thais following her mother's way of life, removes to
                            <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. Her mother dying,
                        her property is put up for sale, and Pamphila is purchased as a slave by
                        Thraso, an officer and an admirer of Thais, who happens just then to be
                        visiting <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>. During the absence
                        of Thraso, Thais becomes acquainted with Phasdria, an Athenian youth, the
                        son of Laches; she also discovers from Chremes, who lives near <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that Pamphila, her former
                        companion, is his sister. Thraso returns, intending to present to her the
                        girl he has bought, but determines not to do so until she has discarded
                        Phaedria. Finding that the girl is no other than Pamphila, Thais is at a
                        loss what to do, as she both loves Phaedria, and is extremely anxious to
                        recover Pamphila. At length, to please the Captain, she excludes Phaedria,
                        but next day sends for him, and explains to him her reasons, at the same
                        time begging of him to allow Thraso the sole right of admission to her house
                        for the next two days, and assuring him that as soon as she shall have
                        gained possession of the girl, she will entirely throw him off. Phaedria
                        consents, and resolves to spend these two days in the country; at the same
                        time he orders Parmeno to take to Thais a Eunuch and an Aethiopian girl,
                        whom he has purchased for her. The Captain also sends Pamphila, who is
                        accidentally seen by Chaerea, the younger brother of Phaedria; he, being
                        smitten with her beauty, prevails upon Parmeno to introduce him into the
                        house of Thais, in the Eunuch's dress. Being admitted there, in the absence
                        of Thais, lie ravishes the damsel. Shortly afterward Thraso quarrels with
                        Thais, and comes with all his attendants to her house to demand the return
                        of Pamphila, but is disappointed. In conclusion, Pamphila is recognized by
                        her brother Chremes, and is promised in marriage to Chaerea; while Thraso
                        becomes reconciled to Phaedria, through the mediation of Gnatho, his
                        Parasite. </p>

					<head>THE
						TITLE<note anchored="true">Colman has the following remark on this
                            Play: "This seems to lave been the most popular of all the Comedies of
                            Terence. Suetonius and Donatus both inform us that it was acted with the
                            greatest applause, and that the Poet received a larger price for it from
                            the Aediles than had ever been paid for any before, namely, 8000
                            sesterces, which is about equal to 200 crowns, which in those times was
                            a considerable sum."</note>

                            informs us that it really was performed twice in one day. Donatus says
                            it was performed three times, by which he may probably mean, twice on

					<head>THE SUMMARY OF C. SULPITIUS APOLLINARIS.</head>
					<p>THE Captain, Thraso, being ignorant of the same, has brought from abroad a
                        girl who used wrongly to be called the sister of Thais, and presents her to
                        Thais herself: she in reality is a citizen of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>. To the same woman, Phaedria, an admirer of Thais,
                        orders a Eunuch whom he has purchased, to be taken, and he himself goes away
                        into the country, having been entreated to give up two days to Thraso. A
                        youth, the brother of Phaedria, having fallen in love with the damsel sent
                        to the house of Thais, is dressed up in the clothes of the Eunuch. Parmeno
                        prompts him; he goes in; he ravishes the maiden; but at length her brother
                        being discovered, a citizen of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, betroths her who has been ravished, to the youth,
                        and Thraso prevails upon Phaedria by his entreaties. </p>

                                of the Commentators. Bentley has, however, it appears, come to the most
                                reasonable conclusion; who supposes that Terence means by "<foreign xml:lang="lat">bene vertere</foreign>," a literal translation, word
                                for word, from the Greek, by which a servile adherence to the idiom
                                of that language was preserved to the neglect of the Latin idiom; in
                                consequence of which the Plays of Luscus Lavinius were, as he
                                remarks, "<foreign xml:lang="lat">male scriptae</foreign>," written in
                                bad Latin.</note> and writing them in bad Latin, has made out of
                            good Greek Plays Latin ones by no means good. Just as of late he has
                            published the Phasma<l n="9"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>Has published the

                                "Apparition," was a play of Menander, so called, in which a young
                                man looking through a hole in the wall between his father's house
                                and that next door, sees a young woman of marvelous beauty, and is
                                struck with awe at the sight, as though by an apparition; in the
                                Play, the girl's mother is represented as having made this hole in
                                the wall, and having decked it with garlands and branches that it
                                may resemble a consecrated place; where she daily performs her
                                devotions in company with her daughter, who has been privately
                                brought up, and whose existence is unknown to the neighbors. On the
                                youth coming by degrees to the knowledge that the object of his
                                admiration is but a mortal, his passion becomes sdoviolent that it
                                will admit of no cure but marriage, with the celebration of which
                                the Play concludes. Bentley
                                gives us the above information from an ancient Scholiast, whose name
                                is unknown, unless it is Donatus himself, which is doubtful. It
                                would appear that Luscus Lavinius had lately made a translation of
                                this Play, which, from its servile adherence to the language of the
                                original, had been couched in ungrammatical language, and probably
                                not approved of by the Audience. Donatus thinks that this is the
                                meaning of the passage, and that, content with this slight reference
                                to a well-known fact, the author passes it by in contemptuous
                                silence.</note> [the Apparition] of Menander; and in the Thesaurus

                                this passage: "In the 'Thesaurus,' or 'Treasure' of Luscus Lavinius,
                                a young fellow, having wasted his estate by his extravagance, sends
                                a servant to search his father's monument: but he had before sold
                                the ground on which the monument was, to a covetous old man; to whom
                                the servant applies to help him open the monument; in which they
                                discover a hoard and a letter. The old fellow sees the treasure and
                                keeps it; the young one goes to law with him, and the old man is
                                represented as opening his cause first before the judge, which he
                                begins with these words:-- <quote xml:lang="lat">'Athenienses, bellum cum
                                    Rhodiensibus, Quod fuerit, quid ego praedicem?'</quote>
                                'Athenians, why should I relate the war with the Rhodians?' And lie
                                goes on in a manner contrary to the rules of court; which Terence
                                objects to, because the young man, who was the plaintiff, should
                                open his cause first. Thus far Bentley, from the same Scholiast [as referred to in
                                the last Note]. This Note is a clear explanation of the four verses

                                part of the Phasma of Menander, and not a distinct Play; but were I
                                not determined by the more learned Bentley, the text itself would not permit me to be
                                of their opinion; for the words <foreign xml:lang="lat">'atque in

                                We have in the above Note the story of Menander's; and we know that

                            pleading his cause why it should be deemed his own, before the person
                            who demands it has stated how this treasure belongs to him, or how it
                            came into the tomb of his father. Henceforward, let him not deceive
                            himself, or fancy thus, "I have now done with it; there's nothing that
                            he can say to me." I recommend him not to be mistaken, and to refrain
                            from provoking me. I have many other points, as to which for the present
                            he shall be pardoned, which, however, shall be brought forward
                            hereafter, if he persists in attacking me, as he has begun to do. After
                            the Aediles had purchased the Eunuch of Menander, the Play which we are
                            about to perform, he managed to get an opportunity of viewing
                                it.<l n="21"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>Opportunity of viewing it</lem></app> Colman thinks
                                that this means something "stronger than merely being present at the
                                representation," and he takes the meaning to be, that having
                                obtained leave to peruse the MS., he furnished himself with
                                objections against the piece, which he threw out when it came to be
                                represented before the magistrates. Cooke thinks that the passage
                                only means, "that he bustled and took pains to be near enough at the
                                representation to see and hear plainly." The truth seems to be that
                                Lavinius managed to obtain admission at the rehearsal or trial of
                                the merits of the piece before the magistrates, and that he then
                                behaved himself in the unseemly manner mentioned in the text.</note>
                            When the magistrates were present it began to be performed. He exclaimed
                            that a thief, no Poet, had produced the piece, but still had not
                                deceived<l n="24"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>Produced the piece, but still had not

                                meaning of the words "<foreign xml:lang="lat">verba dare</foreign>" and
                                    "<foreign xml:lang="lat">fabulam dare</foreign>." The first
                                expression means to "deceive" or "impose upon;" the latter phrase
                                has also the same meaning, but it may signify as well "to represent"
                                or "produce a Play." Thus the exclamation in its ambiguity may mean,
                                "he has produced a Play, and has not succeeded in deceiving us," or
                                "he has deceived us, and yet has not deceived us." This is the

                            that, in fact, it was the Colax, an old Play of Plautus;<note anchored="true"><app><lem>Colax, an old Play of
                                    Plautus</lem></app> Although Nonius Marcellus professes to quote
                                from the Colax of Plautus (so called from the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">*kolu\c,</foreign> "a flatterer" or "parasite"),
                                some scholars have disbelieved in the existence of any Play of
                                Plautus known by that name. Cooke says: "If Plautus had wrote a Play
                                under the title of 'Colax,' I should think it very unlikely that it
                                should have escaped Terence's eye, considering how soon he
                                flourished after Plautus, his being engaged in the same studies, and
                                his having such opportunities to consult the libraries of the great;
                                for though all learning was then confined to Manuscripts, Terence
                                could have no difficulty in coming at the best copies. The character
                                of the 'Miles Gloriosus' [Braggart Captain] here mentioned, I am
                                inclined to think the same with that which is the hero of Plautus's
                                Comedy, now extant, and called 'Miles Gloriosus,' from which Terence
                                could not take his Thraso. Pyrgopolinices and Thraso are both full
                                of themselves, both boast of their valor and their intimacy with
                                princes, and both fancy themselves beloved by all the women who see
                                them; and they are both played off by their Parasites, but they
                                differ in their manner and their speech: Plautus's Pyrgopolinices is
                                always in the clouds, and talking big, and of blood and
                                wounds--Terence's Thraso never says too little nor much, but is an
                                easy ridiculous character, continually supplying the Audience with
                                mirth without the wild extravagant bluster of Pyrgopolinices;
                                Plautus and Terence both took their soldiers and Parasites from
                                Menander, but gave them different dresses." Upon this Note Colman
                                remarks: "Though there is much good criticism in the above Note, it
                                is certain that Plautus did not take his 'Miles Gloriosus' from the
                                Colax of Menander, as he himself informs us it was translated from a
                                Greek play called <foreign xml:lang="grc">*ala/zwn,</foreign> 'the
                                Boaster,' and the Parasite is but a trifling character in that play,
                                never appearing after the first Scene."</note> and that from it were
                            taken the characters of the Parasite and the Captain. If this is a
                            fault, the fault is the ignorance of the Poet; not that he intended to
                            be guilty of theft. That so it is, you will now be enabled to judge. The
                            Colax is a Play of Meander's; in it there is Colax, a Parasite, and a
                            braggart Captain: he does not deny that he has transferred these
                            characters into his Eunuch from the Greek; but assuredly he does deny
                            this, that he was aware that those pieces had been already translated
                            into Latin. But if it is not permitted us to use the same characters as
                            others, how can it any more be allowed to represent hurrying
                                servants,<l n="45"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>Hurrying servants</lem></app> On the "<foreign xml:lang="lat">currentes servi</foreign>," see the Prologue to the

                                combination of the characters of Menander's Comedy: "So long as the
                                deceitful slave, the harsh father, the roguish procuress, and the

                            describe virtuous matrons, artful courtesans, the gluttonous parasite,
                            the braggart captain, the infant palmed off, the old man cajoled by the
                            servant, about love, hatred, suspicion? In fine, nothing is said now
                            that has not been said before. Wherefore it is but just that you should
                            know this, and make allowance, if the moderns do what the ancients used
                            to do. Grant me your attention, and give heed in silence, that you may
                            understand what the Eunuch means. </p>

						<p> Pass those matters by.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker>
						<p> How pass them by? O Thais, Thais, I wish that I had equal affection with
                            yourself, and that it were in like degree, that either this might
                            distress you in the same way that it distresses me, or that I might be
                            indifferent at this being done by you.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>THAIS</speaker>
						<p> Prithee, don't torment yourself, my life, my Phaedria. Upon my faith, I
                            did it, not because I love or esteem any person more than you; but the
                            case was such that it was necessary to be done.</p>

						<p> Is it thus you act, Parmeno? Well, well. <stage>To PHAEDRIA.</stage> But

					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PARMENO</speaker>
						<p> What, I? Perfectly well. But, hark you, upon these conditions I pledge
                            my word to you; the truth that I hear, I'm silent upon, and retain it
                            most faithfully; but if I hear what's false and without foundation, it's
                            out at once; I'm full of chinks, and leak in every direction. Therefore,
                            if you wish it to be kept secret, speak the truth.</p>

						<p> My mother was a Samian; she lived at <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>----</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PARMENO</speaker>
						<p> That may be kept a secret.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>THAIS</speaker>
						<p> There, at that period, a certain merchant made present to my mother of a
                            little girl, who had been stolen away from <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> here.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PARMENO</speaker>
						<p> What, a citizen?</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>THAIS</speaker>
						<p> I think so; we do not know for certain: she herself used to mention her
                            mother's and her father's name; her country and other tokens she didn't
                            know, nor, by reason of her age, was she able. The merchant added this:
                            that he had heard front the kidnappers that she had been carried off
                            from Sunium.<l n="115"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>From Sunium</lem></app>: This was a town
                                situate near a lofty Promontory of that name in <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>. It was famous for a fair
                                which was held there. "Sunium's rocky brow" is mentioned by Byron in
                                the song of the Greek Captive in the third Canto of Don Juan.</note>
                            When my mother received her, she began carefully to teach her every
                            thing, and to bring her up, just as though she had been her own
                            daughter. Most persons supposed that she was my sister. Thence I came
                            hither with that stranger, with whom alone at that period I was
                            connected; he left me all which I now possess----</p>

						<p> Both these things are false; out it goes.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>THAIS</speaker>
						<p> How so?</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PARMENO</speaker>
						<p> Because you were neither content with one, nor was he the only one to
                            make you presents; for he likewise <stage>pointing to PHAEDRIA</stage>
                            brought a pretty considerable share to you.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>

						<p> Such is the fact; but do allow me to arrive at the point I wish. In the
                            mean time, the Captain, who had begun to take a fancy to me, set out to
                                <placeName key="tgn,7002358">Caria</placeName>;<l n="126"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>Set out

                                was a country of <placeName key="tgn,7002294">Asia Minor</placeName>

                            interval, I became acquainted with you. You yourself are aware how very
                            dear I have held you; and how I confess to you all my nearest
                            counsels.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker>
						<p> Nor will Parmeno be silent about that. </p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PARMENO</speaker>
						<p> O, is that a matter of doubt?</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>THAIS</speaker>
						<p> Attend; I entreat you. My mother died there recently; her brother is
                            somewhat greedy after wealth. When he saw that this damsel was of
                            beauteous form and understood music, hoping for a good price, he
                            forthwith put her up for sale, and sold her. By good fortune this friend
                            of mine was present; he bought her as a gift to me, not knowing or
                            suspecting any thing of all this. He returned; but when he perceived
                            that I had formed a connection with you as well, lie feigned excuses on
                            purpose that he might not give her; he said that if he could feel
                            confidence that he should be preferred to yourself by me, so as not to
                            apprehend that, when I had received her, I should forsake him, then he
                            was ready to give her to me; but that he did fear this. But, so far as I
                            can conjecture, he has set his affections upon the girl.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker>
						<p> Any thing beyond that?</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>THAIS</speaker>
						<p> Nothing; for I have made inquiry. Now, my Phaedria, there are many
                            reasons why I could wish to get her away from him. In the first place,
                            because she was called my sister; moreover, that I may restore and
                            deliver her to her friends. I am a lone woman; I have no one here,
                            neither acquaintance nor relative; wherefore, Phaedria, I am desirous by
                            my good offices to secure friends. Prithee, do aid me in this, in order
                            that it may be the more easily effected. Do allow him for the few next
                            days to have the preference with me. Do you make no answer?</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker>
						<p> Most vile woman! Can I make you any answer after such behavior as
                            this?</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PARMENO</speaker>
						<p> Well done, my master, I commend you; <stage>aside</stage> he's galled at
                            last. <stage>To PHAEDRIA.</stage> You show yourself a man.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker>
						<p> I was not aware what you were aiming at; "she was carried away from
                            here, when a little child; my mother brought her up as though her own;
                            she was called my sister; I wish to get her away, that I may restore her
                            to her friends." The meaning is, that all these expressions, in fine,
                            now amount to this, that I am shut out, he is admitted. For what reason?
                            Except that you love him more than me: and now you are afraid of her who
                            has been brought hither, lest she should win him, such as he is, from
                            yourself.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>THAIS</speaker>
						<p> I, afraid of that? </p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker>
						<p> What else, then, gives you concern? Let me know. Is he the only person
                            who makes presents? Have you found my bounty shut against you? Did I
                            not, when you told me that you wished for a servant-maid from

                            setting all other matters aside, go and seek for one? Then you said that

                            rather than make an enemy of you, I'll do as you request me.</p>

						<p> I only wish that you used that expression from your heart and
                            truthfully, "rather than make an enemy of you." If I could believe that
                            this was said sincerely, I could put up with any thing.</p>

                                peculiar points of excellence shown by Terence, introducing common
                                characters in a new manner, without departing from custom or nature;
                                since he draws a good Courtesan, and yet engages the attention of
                                the Spectators and amuses them. Colman has the following Note here:
                                "Under the name of Thais, Menander is supposed to have drawn the
                                character of his own mistress, Glycerium, and it seems he introduced
                                a Courtesan of the same name into several of his Comedies. One
                                Comedy was entitled 'Thais,' from which <persName>St. Paul</persName> took the sentence in his Epistle to the
                                Corinthians, 'Evil communications corrupt good manners.'" Plutarch
                                has preserved four lines of the Prologue to that Comedy, in which
                                the Poet, in a kind of mock-heroic manner, invokes the Muse to teach
                                him to depict the character of his heroine.</note> By my troth, I,

                            same Phaedria; and whatever in the present case I have done, for this

						<p> Dear me! to ask the question, as though it were a matter of difficulty.
                            I wish that you were able, Phaedria, to find any thing as easily as this

                            Heyday! surely this is Gnatho, the Captain's Parasite; he's bringing

                            another! What a difference there is between a wise person and a fool!
                            This strongly came into my mind from the following circumstance. As I
                            was, coming along to-day, I met a certain person of this place, of my
                            own rank and station, no mean fellow, one who, like myself, had guttled
                            away his paternal estate; I saw him, shabby, dirty, sickly, beset with
                            rags and years;--"What's the meaning of this garb?" said I; he answered,
                            "Because, wretch that I am, I've lost what I possessed: see to what I am
                            reduced,--all my acquaintances and friends forsake me." On this I felt
                            contempt for him in: comparison with myself. "What!" said I, "you
                            pitiful sluggard, have you so managed matters as to have no hope left?
                            Have you lost your wits together with your estate? Don't you see me, who
                            have risen from the same condition? What a complexion I have, how spruce
                            and well dressed, what portliness of person? I have every thing, yet
                            have nothing; and although I possess nothing, still, of nothing am I in
                            want." "But I," said he, "unhappily, can neither be a butt nor submit to
                                blows."<l n="244"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>Nor submit to blows</lem></app>: It has been
                                remarked in the Notes to the Translation of Plautus that the
                                Parasites had, in consequence of their state of dependence, to
                                endure blows and indignities from their fellow-guests. Their
                                attempts to be <foreign xml:lang="lat">"ridiculi"</foreign> or "drolls"
                                were made in order to give some small return to their entertainers.
                                See especially the character of Gelasimus in the Stichus of Plautus,
                                and the words of Ergasilus in the Captivi, 1. 88, 90. Diderot, as:
                                quoted by Colman, observes: "This is the only Scene in Terence which
                                I remember that can be charged with being superfluous. Thraso has
                                made a present to Thais of a young girl. Gnatho is to convey her.
                                Going along with her, he amuses himself with giving the Spectators a
                                most agreeable eulogium on his profession. But was that the time for
                                it? Let Gnatho pay due attention on the stage to the young woman
                                whom he is charged with, and let him say what he will to himself, I
                                consent to it."</note> "What!" said I, "do you suppose it is managed
                            by those means? You are quite mistaken. Once upon a time, in the early
                            ages, there was a calling for that class; this is a new mode of
                            coney-catching; I, in fact, have been the first to strike into this
                            path. There is a class of men who strive to be the first in every thing,
                            but are not; to these I make my court; I do not present myself to them
                            to be laughed at; but I am the first to laugh with them, and at the same
                            time to admire their parts: whatever they say, I commend; if they
                            contradict that self-same thing, I commend again. Does any one deny? I
                            deny: does he affirm? I affirm: in fine, I have so trained myself as to
                            humor them in every thing. This calling is now by far the most
                            productive."</p>

                            welcome. When this poor hungry wretch saw that I was in such great
                            esteem, and that I obtained a living so easily, then the fellow began to
                            entreat me that I would allow him to learn this method of me; I bade him

                                the-word "advocate" does with us. The "advocati" were the friends of
                                a man who accompanied him when his cause was pleaded, and often
                                performed the part of witnesses; those who assisted a person in a
                                dispute or difficulty were also his "advocati," and in this respect
                                distantly resembled the "second" or "friend" of a party in the
                                modern duel. In the Phormio, Hegio, Cratinus, and Crito are

                                expression, and this doubt existed as early as the time of Donatus.
                                He says that it was a proverb either taken from the threshing of
                                beans with a flail by the countrymen; or else from the circumstance
                                of the cooks who have dressed the beans, but have not moistened them
                                sufficiently, being sure to have them thrown at their heads, as
                                though for the purpose of softening them. Neither of these solutions
                                seems so probable as that suggested by Madame Dacier, that dried
                                beans were inserted in the thongs of the "scuticae," or "whips,"
                                with which the slaves were beaten. According to others the knots in
                                the whips were only called "fabae," from their resemblance to beans.

                                Colman here remarks, quoting the following passage from Shakspeare's
                                "Love's Labor Lost," "That that Poet was familiarly acquainted with
                                this Comedy is evident from the passage, 'Holofernes says, Novi
                                hominem tanquam te. His humor is lofty, his discourse peremptory,
                                his tongue filed, his eye ambitious, his gait majestical, and his
                                general behavior vain, ridiculous, and Thrasonical.'" We may remark
                                that the previous words of Gnatho, though spoken with reference to
                                the King, contain a reproach against the Captain's boastfulness,
                                though his vanity will not let him perceive it. </note></p>

                                with some ground consider the passage as meaning that the king
                                ranked him in the number of his nobles. See the Paenulus of Plautus,

                                him, "In what a fashion it was you broke the fore-leg of even an

						<p> There was in my company at a banquet, this young man of Rhodes, whom I'm
                            speaking of. By chance I had a mistress there; he began to toy with her,
                            and to annoy me. "What are you doing, sir impudence?" said I to the
                            fellow; "a hare yourself, and looking out for game?"<l n="426"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>Lookinq
                                    out for game?</lem></app>: "Pulmentum," more strictly speaking, "A
                                nice bit." Patrick has the following Note on this passage: "'Lepus
                                tute es, et pulmentum quaeris?' A proverbial expression in use at
                                that time: the proper meaning of it, stripped of its figure, is,
                                'You are little more than a woman yourself, and do you want a
                                mistress?'" We learn from Donatus and Vopiscus, that Livius
                                Andronicus had used this proverb in his Plays before Terence.
                                Commentators who enter into a minute explanation of it offer many
                                conjectures rather curious than solid, and of a nature not fit to be
                                mentioned here. Donatus seems to think that allusion is made to a
                                story prevalent among the ancient naturalists that the hare was in
                                the habit of changing its sex.</note></p>

						<p> That such may not be the case, this method is the only remedy. When she

                            she says, "Let's invite Phaedria to make one," do you say, "Let's ask
                            Pamphila to sing." If she praises his good looks, do you, on the other
                            hand, praise hers. In short, do you return like for like, which will
                            mortify her.</p>

                            mischief; so cunningly do I perceive myself beset by her. Even on the
                            occasion when she first requested me to be fetched to her (any one might
                            ask me, "What business had you with her?" Really I don't know.) When I
                            came, she found an excuse for me to remain there; she said that she had
                            been offering a sacrifice,<l n="513"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>Had been offering a
                                    sacrifice</lem></app>: It was the custom to sacrifice before
                                entering on affairs of importance. Thus, too, Jupiter, in the
                                Amphitryon of Plautus, l. 938, speaks of offering sacrifice on his
                                safe return.</note> and that she was desirous to speak upon some
                            important business with me. Even then I had a suspicion that all these
                            things were being done for her artful purposes. She takes her place
                            beside me; pays every attention to me; seeks and opportunity of
                            conversation. When the conversation flagged, she turned off to this
                            point--how long since my father and mother died? I said that it was now
                            a long time ago. Whether I had any country-house at Sunium, and how far
                            from the sea? I suppose that this has taken her fancy, and she expects
                            to get it away from me. Then at last, whether any little sister of mine
                            had been lost from there; whether any person was with her; what she had
                            about her when she was lost; whether any one could recognize her. Why
                            should she make these inquiries? Unless, perhaps, she pretends--so great
                            is her assurance--that she herself is the same person that was formerly
                            lost when a little girl. But if she is alive, she is sixteen years old,
                            not older; whereas Thais is somewhat older than I am. She has sent to
                            press me earnestly to come. Either let her speak out what she wants, or
                            not be troublesome; I assuredly shall not come a third time

						<p> To-day a certain damsel was presented to her. Why now should I extol or
                            commend her beauty to you, Antipho, since you yourself know how nice a
                            judge of beauty I am? I have been smitten by her.</p>

						<p> Do you say so?</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>CHAEREA</speaker>
						<p> If you saw her, I am sure you would say she's exquisite. What need of
                            many words? I fell in love with her. By good luck there was at our house
                            a certain Eunuch, whom my brother had purchased for Thais, and he had
                            not as yet been sent to her. On this occasion, Parmeno, our servant,
                            made a suggestion to me, which I adopted. </p>

                            loved, Antipho. Is that a slight motive, or a poor reason? I was
                            presented to the woman. She, as soon as she received me, joyfully took
                            me home to her house and intrusted the damsel----</p>

                            had in former times played the like game, I felt extremely delighted
                            that a God should change himself into money, and slily come through the
                            tiles of another person's house, to deceive the fair one by means of a
                            shower. But what God was this? He who shakes the most lofty temples of

                            it, and without hesitation. While I was thinking over these matters with
                            myself, the damsel meantime was fetched away to bathe; she went, bathed,
                            and came back; after which they laid her on a couch. I stood waiting to
                            see if they gave me any orders. One came up, "Here, Dorus," said she,

                            have seen, I'm terribly afraid that this mad fellow will be guilty of
                            some disturbance to-day or of some violence to Thais. For when this
                            young man, the brother of the damsel, arrived, she begged the Captain to
                            order him to be admitted; he immediately began to get into a passion,
                            and yet didn't dare refuse; Thais still insisted that he would invite
                            the man in. This she did for the sake of detaining him; because there
                            was no opportunity just then of telling him what she wanted to disclose
                            about her sister. He was invited in, and took his seat. Then she entered
                            into discourse with him. But the Captain, fancying it was a rival
                            brought before his very eyes, wanted in his turn to mortify her: "Hark
                            you, boy," said he, "go fetch Pamphila, that she may amuse us here." She
                            exclaimed, "At a banquet! Certainly not." The Captain still persisted to
                            a downright quarrel. Meanwhile my mistress secretly took off her golden
                                jewels,<l n="627"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>Took off her golden jewels</lem></app>: This
                                was probably because it was contrary to the laws of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> for a Courtesan to appear
                                with gold or jewels in the street. Madame Dacier suggests another
                                reason, in which there is some force, although it is ridiculed by
                                Cooke. Thais may have supposed that the Captain, when irritated,
                                might not have scrupled to take them away from her. Indeed, nothing
                                would be more probable, than that he would be ready to take them by
                                way of security for the return of the slave, whom he had thus, to no
                                purpose, presented to her. In reference to the preceding line, we
                                may remark that it was not customary among the Greeks for females of

                                    was going</lem></app>: Donatus remarks that here the Poet artfully
                                finds a reason to bring Phaedria back again; as he at first with
                                equal art sent him out of the way, to give probability to those
                                incidents necessary to happen in his absence.</note> into the
                            country, I began on the road, as it mostly happens when there is any
                            anxiety on the mind, to reflect with myself upon one thing after
                            another, and upon every thing in the worst light. What need of words?
                            While I was musing thus, inadvertently I passed my country-house. I had
                            already got some distance from it, when I perceived this; I returned
                            again, really feeling quite uneasy; when I came to the very turning that
                            leads to the house, I came to a stop, and began to reason with myself;
                            "What! must I stay here alone for two days without her? Well, and what
                            then? It's nothing at all. What? Nothing at all? Well now, if I haven;t
                            the privilege of touching her, am I not even to have that of seeing her?
                            If I may not do the one, at least I may the other. Surely to love at a
                                distance<l n="640"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>At a distance</lem></app>: "Extremâ
                                lineâ." There have been many suggestions offered for the
                                origin of this figurative expression. Some suggest that it alludes
                                to the last or lowest stage of the supposed ladder of love; others
                                that it refers to the first or elementary line traced by the
                                student, when beginning to learn the art of painting. It is however
                                more generally thought to be a metaphor taken from the chariotraces
                                in the Circus, where, in going round the turning-place, he who was
                                nearest was said "currere in primâ lineâ;" the
                                next, "in secundâ;" and so on to the last, who took the
                                widest range, and was said to run "in extremâ
                                lineâ."</note> even, is better than nothing at all." I
                            purposely passed the house. But how's this, that Pythias is suddenly
                            hurrying out in such a fright? <stage>Stands apart.</stage></p>

						<p> I know nothing about him: as to what he has done, the thing speaks for
                            itself. The girl is in tears; and when you ask her what's the matter,
                            she does not dare tell. But he, a precious fellow, is nowhere to be
                            seen. To my sorrow I suspect too, that when he took himself off he
                            carried something away from the house.</p>

                            otherwise I should have shut him up somewhere, and not have intrusted

                            either about the Eunuch or the girl's misfortune. By this method you'll
                            both rid yourself of all perplexity, and have done a service to

                                iii., l. 117-8, that in early times the Roman armies carried bundles
                                or wisps of hay upon poles by way of standards. "A long pole used to
                                bear the elevated wisps, from which circumstance the manipular
                                soldier derives his name." It appears from this passage, and from
                                other authors, that to every troop of one hundred men a "manipulus"
                                or wisp of hay (so called from "manum implere," to "fill the hand,"
                                as being "a handful"), was assigned as a standard, and hence in time
                                the company itself obtained the name of "manipulus," and the
                                soldier, a member of it, was called "manipularis." The "centurio,"
                                or "leader of a hundred," was the commanding officer of the

                            what method now to adopt about this girl: you have so confounded all my
                            plans, that I can not possibly return her to her friends in such a
                            manner as is befitting and as I had intended; in order that, by this
                            means, I might, Chaerea, do a real service to myself.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>CHAEREA</speaker>
						<p> But now, from henceforth, I hope, Thais, that there will be lasting
                            good-will between us. Many a time, from some affair of this kind and
                            from a bad beginning, great friendships have sprung up. What if some
                            Divinity has willed this? </p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>THAIS</speaker>
						<p> I'faith, for my own part I both take it in that view and wish to do
                            so.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>CHAEREA</speaker>
						<p> Yes, prithee, do so. Be sure of this one thing, that I did not do it for
                            the sake of affronting you, but in consequence of passion.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>THAIS</speaker>
						<p> I understand, and, i'faith, for that reason do I now the more readily
                            forgive you. I am not, Chaerea, of a disposition so ungentle, or so
                            inexperienced, as not to know what is the power of love.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>CHAEREA</speaker>
						<p> So may the Deities kindly bless me, Thais; I am now smitten with you as
                            well.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>

					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>CHAEREA</speaker>
						<p> Now I entreat you that you will be my assistant in this affair. I
                            intrust and commit myself to your care; I take you, Thais, as my
                            protectress; I implore you; I shall die if I don't have her for my
                            wife.</p>

						<speaker>THAIS</speaker>
						<p> If you will wait a little, the brother himself of the young woman will
                            be here presently; he has gone to fetch the nurse, who brought her up
                            when a little child; you yourself, shall be present Chaerea, at his
                            recognition of her.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>CHAEREA</speaker>
						<p> I certainly will stay.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>

						<p> In the mean time, until he comes, would you prefer that we should wait
                            for him in the house, rather than here before the door?</p>

						<p> Nay but, Pythias, do you be my keeper.</p>

                            is a person of very high rank?</p>

					<sp>
						<speaker>PARMENO</speaker>
						<p> I didn't know that.</p>

						<speaker>PYTHIAS</speaker>
						<p> But so she has been discovered to be; he, unfortunate youth, has
                            ravished her. When the brother came to know of this being done, in a
                            most towering rage, he----</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PARMENO</speaker>
						<p> Did what, pray?</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PYTHIAS</speaker>
						<p> First, bound him in a shocking manner.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PARMENO</speaker>
						<p> Bound him?</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PYTHIAS</speaker>
						<p> And even though Thais entreated him that he wouldn't do so----</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PARMENO</speaker>
						<p> What is it you tell me?</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PYTHIAS</speaker>
						<p> Now he is threatening that he will also do that which is usually done to
                            ravishers; a thing that I never saw done, nor wish to.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PARMENO</speaker>
						<p> With what assurance does he dare perpetrate a crime so heinous?</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PYTHIAS</speaker>
						<p> How "so heinous?"</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PARMENO</speaker>
						<p> Is it not most heinous? Who ever saw any one taken up as a ravisher in a

					<sp>

						<p> I don't know.</p>

						<p> But that you mayn't be ignorant of this, Pythias, I tell you, and give
                            you notice that he is my master's son.</p>

					<sp>
						<speaker>PYTHIAS</speaker>
						<p> How! Prithee, is it he? </p>
					</sp>
					<sp>

						<p> Don't let Thais suffer any violence to be done to him. But why don't I
                            go in myself?</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PYTHIAS</speaker>
						<p> Take care, Parmeno, what you are about, lest you both do him no good and
                            come to harm yourself; for it is their notion, that whatever has
                            happened, has originated in you.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PARMENO</speaker>
						<p> What then, wretch that I am, shall I do, or how resolve? But look, I see
                            the old gentleman returning from the country; shall I tell him or shall
                            I not? By my troth, I will tell him; although I am certain that a heavy
                            punishment is in readiness for me; but it's a matter of necessity, in
                            order that he may rescue him.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PYTHIAS</speaker>

                            into our house. I had the joke all to myself, as I knew<l n="1003"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>As I knew</lem></app>: She enjoyed it the more, knowing that the
                                old man had nothing to fear, as he had just heard the fiction which
                                she had imparted to Parmeno. Donatus observes that the terror of
                                Laches accounts for his sudden consent to the union of Chaerea with
                                Pamphila; for though he could not settle the matter any other way
                                with credit, he was glad to find that his son had made an unequal
                                match rather than endangered his life. Colman, however, observes
                                with considerable justice: "I think Chaerea apologizes still better
                                for this arrangement in the Scene with Thais at the opening of this
                                Act, where he says that he is confident of obtaining his father's
                                consent, provided Pamphila proves to be a citizen; and, indeed, the
                                match between them is rather a reparation of an injury done to her
                                than a degradation of himself."</note> what it was he feared.</p>

					<sp>
						<speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker>
						<p> I'm overjoyed.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>CHAEREA</speaker>
						<p> I quite believe you. There is no one, brother, more worthy to be loved
                            than this Thais of yours: so much is she a benefactress to all our
                            family.</p>

                            that I may at least share Thais's favors in some degree.</p>

					<sp>

                            well. If you manage this, ask me for any present you like as your

                            you are present or absent, may be open to me; that, without invitation,
                            there may always be a place for me.</p>

					<sp>
						<speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker>
						<p> Perhaps you are not aware what has taken place here.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>THRASO</speaker>
						<p> I am quite aware.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker>
						<p> Why, then, do I see you in this neighborhood?</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>THRASO</speaker>
						<p> Depending on your kindness.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker>
						<p> Do you know what sort of dependence you have? Captain, I give you
                            notice, if ever I catch you in this street again, even if you should say
                            to me, "I was looking for another person, I was on my road this way,"
                            you are undone.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>GNATHO</speaker>
						<p> Come, come, that's not handsome.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker>
						<p> I've said it.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>GNATHO</speaker>
						<p> I didn't know you gave yourself such airs.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker>
						<p> So it shall be.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>GNATHO</speaker>
						<p> First hear a few words from me; and when I have said the thing, if you
                            approve of it, do it.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker>
						<p> Let's hear.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>GNATHO</speaker>
						<p> Do you step a little that way, Thraso. <stage>THRASO stands
                                aside.</stage> In the firs place, I wish you both implicitly to
                            believe me in this, that whatever I do in this matter, I do it entirely
                            for my own sake; but if the same thing is of advantage to yourselves, it
                            would be folly for you not to do it. </p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker>
						<p> What is it?</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>GNATHO</speaker>
						<p> I'm of opinion that the Captain, your rival, should be received among
                            you.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker>
						<p>
                            <stage>starting.</stage> Hah!</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>CHAEREA</speaker>
						<p> Be received?</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>GNATHO</speaker>
						<p>
                            <stage>to PHAEDRIA.</stage> Only consider. I'faith, Phaedria, at the
                            free rate you are living with her, and indeed very freely you are
                            living, you have but little to give; and it's necessary for Thais to
                            receive a good deal. That all this may be supplied for your amour and
                            not at your own expense, there is not an individual better suited or
                            more fitted for your purpose than the Captain. In the first place, he
                            both.has got enough to give, and no one does give more profusely. He is
                            a fool, a dolt, a blockhead; night and day he snores away; and you need
                            not fear that the lady will fall in love with him; you may easily have
                            him discarded whenever you please.</p>

					<sp>
						<speaker>CHAEREA</speaker>
						<p>
                            <stage>to PHAEDRIA.</stage> What shall we do?</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>GNATHO</speaker>
						<p> And this besides, which I deem to be of even greater importance,--not a
                            single person entertains in better style or more bountifully.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>CHAEREA</speaker>
						<p> It's a wonder if this sort of man can not be made use of in some way or
                            other.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker>
						<p> I think so too.</p>
					</sp>
					<sp>
						<speaker>GNATHO</speaker>
						<p> You act properly. One thing I have still to beg of you,--that you'll
                            receive me into your fraternity; I've been rolling that stone<l n="1084"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>Been rolling that stone</lem></app>: Donatus thinks that he alludes
                                to the story of Sisyphus, who, in the Infernal Regions, was
                                condemned eternally to roll a stone up a hill, which, on arriving at
                                the summit, immediately fell to the bottom.</note> for a

					<sp>
						<speaker>CHAEREA</speaker>
						<p> And with all my heart.</p>

					<sp>
						<speaker>GNATHO</speaker>
						<p> Then I, in return for this, Phaedria, and you, Chaerea, make him over to

                                propino." The word "propino" was properly applied to the act of
                                tasting a cup of wine, and then handing it to another; he means that
                                he has had his taste of the Captain, and is now ready to hand him
                                over to them.</note> to be eaten and drunk to the dregs.</p>

                                1087. Cooke has the following appropriate remark: "I can not think
                                that this Play, excellent as it is in almost all other respects,
                                concludes consistently with the manners of gentlemen; there is a
                                meanness in Phaedria and Chaerea consenting to take Thraso into
                                their society, with a view of fleecing him, which the Poet should
                                have avoided."</note>

                            your qualities, and had praised you as your actions and your virtues
                            deserved, I prevailed upon them.</p>
