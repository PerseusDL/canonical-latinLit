<milestone unit="paragraph"/>THE SUBJECT
<milestone unit="paragraph"/>PAMPHILUS, the son of Laches by his wife Sostrata, being at the time enamored of Bacchis, a Courtesan, chances, one night, in a drunken fit, to debauch Philumena, the daughter of Phidippus and Myrrhina. In the struggle he takes a ring from her, which he gives to Bacchis. Some time afterward, at his father’s express desire, he consents to marry. By chance the young woman whom he has ravished is given to him as a wife, to the great joy of her mother, who alone is aware of her misfortune, and hopes that her disgrace may be thereby concealed. It, however, happens otherwise; for Pamphilus, still retaining his passion for Bacchis, refuses for some time to cohabit with her. Bacchis, however, now rejects the advances of Pamphilus, who by degrees becomes weaned from his affection for her, and grows attached to his wife, whom he has hitherto disliked. Meantime, however, he is suddenly called away from home. During his absence, Philumena, finding herself pregnant, in consequence of her misfortune before her marriage, fearing detection, especially avoids the company of her mother-in-law. At length she makes an excuse for returning to the home of her own parents, where she remains. Sostrata thereupon sends for her, but is answered that she is ill, on which she goes to see her, but is refused admittance to the house. On hearing of this, Laches blames his wife as being the cause of this estrangement. Pamphilus now returns, and it so happens that, on the day of his arrival, Philumena is brought to bed of a child. Impatient to see her, Pamphilus rushes into her room, and to his great distress finds that this is the case. Myrrhina thereupon entreats him to keep the matter secret, and begs him, if he refuses to receive her daughter back again, at least not to ruin her reputation by divulging it. As he now declines either to take back his wife or give his reason for so doing, Laches suspects that he is still enamored of Bacchis, and accordingly sends for her, and expostulates with her. She, however, exonerates herself; on which the old man, supposing that Philumena and her mother are equally ignorant with himself as to his son’s motives, begs her to call on them and remove their suspicions. While she is conversing with them, they recognize the ring upon her finger which Pamphilus had formerly taken from Philumena. By means of this it is discovered that Pamphilus himself is the person who has ravished Philumena; on which, overjoyed, he immediately takes home his wife and son. </l>

<milestone unit="paragraph"/>THE SUMMARY OF C. SULPITIUS APOLLINARIS.
<milestone unit="paragraph"/>PAMPHILUS has married Philumena, to whom, when a virgin, he formerly, not knowing who she was, offered violence; and whose ring, which he took off by force, he gave to his mistress, Bacchis, a Courtesan. Afterward he sets out for Imbros, not having touched his bride. Having become pregnant, her mother brings her over to her own house, as though sick, that her mother-in-law may not know it. Pamphilus returns; detects her being delivered; conceals it; but determines not to take back his wife. His father imputes this to his passion for Bacchis. While Bacchis is exculpating herself, Myrrhina, the mother of the injured girl, by chance recognizes the ring. Pamphilus takes back his wife, together with his son. </l></div>

<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi005.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="9">I COME to you as an envoy from the Poet, in the character of prologue-speaker;</l>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi005.perseus-eng2" n="10">allow me to be a successful pleader, that in my old age I may enjoy the same privilege that I enjoyed when a younger man, when I caused new Plays, that had been once rejected, to come into favor; so that his writings might not die with the Poet. Among them, as to those of Caecilius,<note resp="translator"><q rend="double" type="mentioned">Caecilius</q>: Colman has the following Note: <quote rend="double">A famous Comic Poet among the Romans. His chief excellences are said to have been, the gravity of his style and the choice of his subjects. The first quality was attributed to him by Horace, Tully, etc., and the last by Varro. <quote rend="single" xml:lang="lat">In argumentis Caecilius poscit palmam, in ethesi Terentius</quote>. <q rend="single" type="translation">In the choice of subjects, Caecilius demands the preference; in the manners, Terence.</q></quote> Madame Dacier, indeed, renders <q rend="double" xml:lang="lat" type="mentioned">in argumentis,</q> <q rend="double" type="gloss">in the disposition of his subjects.</q> But the words will not bear that construction. <q rend="double" xml:lang="lat" type="foreign">Argumentum,</q> I believe, is uniformly used for the argument itself, and never implies the conduct of it; as in the Prologue to the Andrian, <quote rend="double" xml:lang="lat">non tam dissimili argumento.</quote> Besides, the disposition of the subject was the very art attributed by the critics of those days to Terence, and which <persName>Horace</persName> mentions in the very same line with the gravity of Caecilius, distinguishing them as the several characteristics of each writer, <quote rend="double" xml:lang="lat">Vincere Caecilius gravitate, Terentius arte.</quote></note> which I first studied when new;</l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi005.perseus-eng2" n="15">in some of which I was rejected; in some I kept my ground with difficulty. As I knew that the fortune of the stage was varying, where the hopes were uncertain, I submitted to certain toil. Those I zealously attempted to perform, that from the same writer I might learn new ones, and not discourage him from his pursuits.</l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi005.perseus-eng2" n="20">I caused them to be represented. When seen, they pleased. Thus did I restore the Poet to his place, who was now almost weaned, through the malevolence of his adversaries, from his pursuits and labors, and from the dramatic art. But if I had at that period slighted the writer,</l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi005.perseus-eng2" n="25">and had wished to use my endeavors in discouraging him, so that he might live a life of idleness rather than of study, I might have easily discouraged him from writing others. Now, for my sake, hear with unbiased minds what it is I ask.</l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi005.perseus-eng2" n="29">I again bring before you the Hecyra, which I have never been allowed to act before you in silence; such misfortunes have so overwhelmed it. These misfortunes your intelligence will allay, if it is a seconder of our exertions. The first time, when I began to act this Play, the vauntings of boxers,<note resp="translator"><q rend="double" type="mentioned">Vauntings of boxers</q>: Horace probably had this passage in his mind when he penned the First Epistle in his Second Book, 1. 185 ; where he mentions the populace leaving a Play in the midst for the sight of a bear, or an exhibition of boxers.</note> the expectation of a rope-dancer,<note resp="translator"><q rend="double" type="mentioned">Of a rope-dancer</q>: The art of dancing on the tight rope was carried to great perfection among the ancients. Many paintings have been discovered, which show the numerous attitudes which the performers assumed. The figures have their heads enveloped in skins or caps, probably intended as a protection in case of falling. At the conclusion of the performance the dancer ran down the rope. Germanicus and Galba are said to have exhibited elephants dancing on the tight rope.</note> added to which, </l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi005.perseus-eng2" n="35">the throng of followers, the noise, the clamor of the women, caused me to retire from your presence before the time. In this new Play, I attempted to follow the old custom of mine,<note resp="translator"><q rend="double" type="mentioned">The old custom of mine</q>: He says that on the second representation he followed the plan which he had formerly adopted in the Plays of Caecilius, of bringing those forward again which had not given satisfaction at first.</note> of making a fresh trial; I brought it on again. In the first Act I pleased; when in the mean time a rumor spread </l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi005.perseus-eng2" n="40">that gladiators were about to be exhibited; the populace flock together, make a tumult, clamor aloud, and fight for their places:<note resp="translator"><q rend="double" type="mentioned">Fight for their places</q>: This was in consequence of their sitting indiscriminately at the Amphitheatre, where the gladiators were exhibited; whereas at the Theatres there were distinct places appropriated to each <q rend="double" xml:lang="lat" type="foreign">ordo</q> or class.</note> meantime, I was unable to maintain my place. Now there is no confusion: there is attention and silence—an opportunity of acting my Play has been granted me; to yourselves is given </l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi005.perseus-eng2" n="45">the power of gracing the scenic festival.<note resp="translator"><q rend="double" type="mentioned">Gracing the scenic festival</q>: Madame Dacier remarks that there is great force and eloquence in the Actor’s affecting a concern for the sacred festivals, which were in danger of being deprived of their chief ornaments, if by too great a severity they discouraged the Poets who undertook to furnish the Plays during the solemnity.</note> Do not permit, through your agency, the dramatic art to sink into the hands of a few; let your authority prove a seconder and assistant to my own. If I have never covetously set a price upon my skill, </l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi005.perseus-eng2" n="50">and have come to this conclusion, that it is the greatest gain in the highest possible degree to contribute to your entertainment; allow me to obtain this of you, that him who has intrusted his labors to my protection, and himself to your integrity,—that him, I say, the malicious may not maliciously deride, beset by them on every side. </l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi005.perseus-eng2" n="55">For my sake, admit of this plea, and attend in silence, that he may be encouraged to write other Plays, and that it may be for my advantage to study new ones hereafter, purchased at my own expense.<note resp="translator"><q rend="double" type="mentioned">At my own expense</q>: It is generally supposed that <q rend="double" xml:lang="lat" type="foreign">meo pretio</q> means <q rend="double" type="gloss">a price named as my estimate;</q> and that it was the custom for the Aediles to purchase a Play of a Poet at a price fixed by the head of the company of actors. It is also thought that the money was paid to the actor, who handed over the whole, or a certain part, to the Poet, and if the Play was not received with favor, the Aediles had the right to ask back the money from the actor, who consequently became a loser by the transaction. Pareus and Meric Casaubon think, however, that in case of this Play, the Aediles had purchased it from the Poet, and the performers had bought it of the Aediles as a speculation. What he means at the end of the First Prologue by selling the Play over again, is not exactly known. Perhaps if the Play had been then performed throughout and received with no favor, he would have had to forfeit the money, and lose all right to any future pecuniary interest in it; but he preferred to cancel the whole transaction, and to reserve the Play for purchase and representation at a more favorable period.</note> </l></sp> </div></div>

<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi005.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="361"> I can not discover any fitting commencement of my troubles, at which to begin to narrate the things that have so unexpectedly befallen me, some of which with these eyes I have beheld; some I have heard with my ears; and on account of which I so hastily betook myself, in extreme agitation, out of doors. </l>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi005.perseus-eng2" n="365">For just now, when, full of alarm, I rushed into the house, expecting to find my wife afflicted with some other malady than what I have found it to be—ah me! immediately the servant-maids beheld that I had arrived, they all at the same moment joyfully exclaimed, <q rend="double" type="spoken">He is come,</q> from having so suddenly caught sight of me. But I soon perceived the countenances of all of them change,<note resp="translator"><q rend="double" type="mentioned">All of them change</q>: This must have been imaginary, as they were not likely to be acquainted with the reason of Philumena’s apprehensions.</note></l>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi005.perseus-eng2" n="370">because at so unseasonable a juncture chance had brought me there. One of them in the mean time hastily ran before me to give notice that I had come. Impatient to see my wife, I followed close. When I entered the room, that instant, to my sorrow, I found out her malady; for neither did the time afford any interval to enable her to conceal it, </l>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi005.perseus-eng2" n="375">nor could she complain in any other accents than those which the case itself prompted. When I perceived this: <q rend="double" type="spoken">O disgraceful conduct!</q> I exclaimed, and instantly hurried away from the spot in tears, overwhelmed by such an incredible and shocking circumstance. Her mother followed me; just as I got to the threshold, she threw herself on her knees: I felt compassion for her. Assuredly it is the fact, in my opinion, just as matters befall us all, so are we elated or depressed.</l>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi005.perseus-eng2" n="381">At once she began to address me in these words: <q rend="double" type="spoken">O my dear Pamphilus, you see the reason why she left your house; for violence was offered to her when formerly a maid, by some villain to us unknown. Now, she took refuge here then, that from you and others she might conceal her labor.</q></l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi005.perseus-eng2" n="385">But when I call to mind her entreaties, I can not, wretched as I am, refrain from tears. <q rend="double" type="spoken">hatever chance or fortune it is,</q> said she, <q rend="double" type="spoken">which has brought you here to-day, by it we do both conjure you, if with equity and justice we may, that her misfortune may be concealed by you, and kept a secret from all. If ever you were sensible, my dear Pamphilus, that she was tenderly disposed toward you, she now asks you to grant her this favor in return, without making any difficulty of it. </q></l>
 <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi005.perseus-eng2" n="391"><q rend="double; merge" type="spoken">But as to taking her back, act quite according to your own convenience. You alone are aware of her lying-in, and that the child is none of yours. For it is said that it was two months after the marriage before she had commerce with you. And then, this is but the seventh month since she came to you.<note resp="translator"><q rend="double" type="mentioned">Since she came to you</q>: There is great doubt what is the exact meaning of <q type="foreign" rend="double" xml:lang="lat">postquam ad te venit</q>, here, whether it means, <q rend="double" type="translation">it is now the seventh month since she became your wife,</q> or, <q rend="double" type="translation">it is now the seventh month since she came to your embraces,</q> which did not happen for two months after the marriage. The former is, under the circumstances, the most probable construction.</note></q></l>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi005.perseus-eng2" n="395"><q rend="double; merge" type="spoken">That you are sensible of this, the circumstances themselves prove. Now, if it is possible, Pamphilus, I especially wish, and will use my endeavors, that her labor may remain unknown to her father, and to all, in fact. But if that can not be managed, and they do find it out, I will say that she miscarried; I am sure no one will suspect otherwise than, what is so likely, the child was by you.</q></l>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi005.perseus-eng2" n="400"><q rend="double; merge" type="spoken">It shall be instantly exposed; in that case there is no inconvenience whatever to yourself, and you will be concealing an outrage so undeservingly committed upon her,<note resp="translator"><q rend="double" type="mentioned">Committed upon her</q>: Colman very justly observes here: <quote rend="double">It is rather extraordinary that Myrrhina’s account of the injury done to her daughter should not put Pamphilus in mind of his own adventure, which comes out in the Fifth Act. It is certain that had the Poet let the Audience into that secret in this place, they would have immediately concluded that the wife of Pamphilus and the lady whom he had ravished were one and the same person.</quote> Playwrights have never, in any age or country, troubled themselves much about probability in their plots. Besides, his adventure with Philumena was by no means an uncommon one. We find similar instances mentioned by Plautus; and violence and debauchery seem almost to have reigned paramount in the streets at night.</note> poor thing!</q> I promised this, and I am resolved to keep faith in what I said. But as to taking her back, really I do not think that would be at all creditable, nor will I do so, although love for her, and habit, have a strong influence upon me. </l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi005.perseus-eng2" n="405">I weep when it occurs to my mind, what must be her life, and how great her loneliness in future. O Fortune, thou hast never been found constant! But by this time my former passion has taught me experience in the present case. The means by which I got rid of that, I must employ on the present occasion. Parmeno is coming with the servants; it is far from convenient </l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi005.perseus-eng2" n="410">that he should be here under present circumstances, for he was the only person to whom I trusted the secret that I kept aloof from her when I first married her. I am afraid lest, if he should frequently hear her cries, he might find out that she is in labor. He must be dispatched by me somewhere till Philumena is delivered. </l></sp> </div>

In other Comedies, every body, Actors as well as Spectators, are at last equally acquainted with the whole intrigue and catastrophe, and it would even be a defect in the plot were there any obscurity remaining. But Terence, like a true genius, makes himself superior to rules, and adds new beauties to his piece by forsaking them. His reasons for concealing from part of the personages of the Drama the principal incident of the plot, are so plausible and natural, that he could not have followed the beaten track without offending against manners and decency. This bold and uncommon turn is one of the chief graces of the Play.</quote></note> where every thing is known to every body.
