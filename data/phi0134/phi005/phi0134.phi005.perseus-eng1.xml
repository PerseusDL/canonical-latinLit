                    <p>PAMPHILUS, the son of Laches by his wife Sostrata, being at the time enamored
                        of Bacchis, a Courtesan, chances, one night, in a drunken fit, to debauch
                        Philumena, the daughter of Phidippus and Myrrhina. In the struggle he takes
                        a ring from her, which he gives to Bacchis. Some time afterward, at his
                        father's express desire, he consents to marry. By chance the young woman
                        whom he has ravished is given to him as a wife, to the great joy of her
                        mother, who alone is aware of her misfortune, and hopes that her disgrace
                        may be thereby concealed. It, however, happens otherwise ; for Pamphilus,
                        still retaining his passion for Bacchis, refuses for some time to cohabit
                        with her. Bacchis, however, now rejects the advances of Pamphilus, who by
                        degrees becomes weaned from his affection for her, and grows attached to his
                        wife, whom he has hitherto disliked. Meantime, however, he is suddenly
                        called away from home. During his absence, Philumena, finding herself
                        pregnant, in consequence of her misfortune before her marriage, fearing
                        detection, especially avoids the company of her mother-in-law. At length she
                        makes an excuse for returning to the home of her own parents, where she
                        remains. Sostrata thereupon sends for her, but is answered that she is ill,
                        on which she goes to see her, but is refused admittance to the house. On
                        hearing of this, Laches blames his wife as being the cause of this
                        estrangement. Pamphilus now returns, and it so happens that, on the day of
                        his arrival, Philumena is brought to bed of a child. Impatient to see her,
                        Pamphilus rushes into her room, and to his great distress finds that this is
                        the case. Myrrhina thereupon entreats him to keep the matter secret, and
                        begs him, if he refuses to receive her daughter back again, at least not to
                        ruin her reputation by divulging it. As he now declines either to take back
                        his wife or give his reason for so doing, Laches suspects that he is still
                        enamored of Bacchis, and accordingly sends for her, and expostulates with
                        her. She, however, exonerates herself; on which the old man, supposing that
                        Philumena and her mother are equally ignorant with himself as to his son's
                        motives, begs her to call on them and remove their suspicions. While she is
                        conversing with them, they recognize the ring upon her finger which
                        Pamphilus had formerly taken from Philumena. By means of this it is
                        discovered that Pamphilus himself is the person who has ravished Philumena;
                        on which, overjoyed, he immediately takes home his wife and son. </p>

                    <p>PAMPHILUS has married Philumena, to whom, when a virgin, he formerly, not
                        knowing who she was, offered violence; and whose ring, which he took off by
                        force, he gave to his mistress, Bacchis, a Courtesan. Afterward he sets out
                        for Imbros, not having touched his bride. Having become pregnant, her mother
                        brings her over to her own house, as though sick, that her mother-in-law may
                        not know it. Pamphilus returns; detects her being delivered; conceals it;
                        but determines not to take back his wife. His father imputes this to his
                        passion for Bacchis. While Bacchis is exculpating herself, Myrrhina, the
                        mother of the injured girl, by chance recognizes the ring. Pamphilus takes
                        back his wife, together with his son. </p>

                        <p>I COME to you as an envoy from the Poet, in the character of
                            prologue-speaker; allow me to be a successful pleader, that in my old
                            age I may enjoy the same privilege that I enjoyed when a younger man,
                            when I caused new Plays, that had been once rejected, to come into
                            favor; so that his writings might not die with the Poet. Among them, as
                            to those of Caecilius,<l n="14"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>Coecilius</lem></app>: Colman has
                                the following Note: "A famous Comic Poet among the Romans. His chief
                                excellences are said to have been, the gravity of his style and the
                                choice of his subjects. The first quality was attributed to him by
                                Horace, Tully, etc., and
                                the last by Varro. '<foreign xml:lang="lat">In argumentis Caecilius
                                    poscit palmam, in ethesi Terentius</foreign>.' 'In the choice of
                                subjects, Caecilius demands the preference; in the manners,
                                Terence.'" Madame Dacier, indeed, renders "<foreign xml:lang="lat">in
                                    argumentis</foreign>," "in the disposition of his subjects." But
                                the words will not bear that construction. "<foreign xml:lang="lat">Argumentum</foreign>," I believe, is uniformly used for the
                                argument itself, and never implies the conduct of it; as in the
                                Prologue to the Andrian, "<foreign xml:lang="lat">non tam dissimili
                                    argumento</foreign>." Besides, the disposition of the subject
                                was the very art attributed by the critics of those days to Terence,
                                and which <persName>Horace</persName> mentions
                                in the very same line with the gravity of Caecilius, distinguishing
                                them as the several characteristics of each writer, "<foreign xml:lang="lat">Vincere Caecilius gravitate, Terentius
                                arte</foreign>."</note> which I first studied when new; in some of
                            which I was rejected; in some I kept my ground with difficulty. As I
                            knew that the fortune of the stage was varying, where the hopes were
                            uncertain, I submitted to certain toil. Those I zealously attempted to
                            perform, that from the same writer I might learn new ones, and not
                            discourage him from his pursuits. I caused them to be represented. When
                            seen, they pleased. Thus did I restore the Poet to his place, who was
                            now almost weaned, through the malevolence of his adversaries, from his
                            pursuits and labors, and from the dramatic art. But if I had at that
                            period slighted the writer, and had wished to use my endeavors in
                            discouraging him, so that he might live a life of idleness rather than
                            of study, I might have easily discouraged him from writing others. Now,
                            for my sake, hear with unbiased minds what it is I ask. I again bring
                            before you the Hecyra, which I have never been allowed to act before you
                            in silence; such misfortunes have so overwhelmed it. These misfortunes
                            your intelligence will allay, if it is a seconder of our exertions. The
                            first time, when I began to act this Play, the vauntings of
                                boxers,<l n="33"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>Vauntings of boxers</lem></app>: Horace
                                probably had this passage in his mind when he penned the First
                                Epistle in his Second Book, 1. 185 ; where he mentions the populace
                                leaving a Play in the midst for the sight of a bear, or an
                                exhibition of boxers.</note> the expectation of a
                                rope-dancer,<l n="34"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>Of a rope-dancer</lem></app>: The art of
                                dancing on the tight rope was carried to great perfection among the
                                ancients. Many paintings have been discovered, which show the
                                numerous attitudes which the performers assumed. The figures have
                                their heads enveloped in skins or caps, probably intended as a
                                protection in case of falling. At the conclusion of the performance
                                the dancer ran down the rope. Germanicus and Galba are said to have
                                exhibited elephants dancing on the tight rope.</note> added to
                            which, the throng of followers, the noise, the clamor of the women,
                            caused me to retire from your presence before the time. In this new
                            Play, I attempted to follow the old custom of mine,<l n="38"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>The old
                                    custom of mine</lem></app>: He says that on the second

                                the Plays of Caecilius, of bringing those forward again which had
                                not given satisfaction at first.</note> of making a fresh trial; I
                            brought it on again. In the first Act I pleased; when in the mean time a
                            rumor spread that gladiators were about to be exhibited; the populace
                            flock together, make a tumult, clamor aloud, and fight for their
                                places:<l n="41"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>Fight for their places</lem></app>: This was
                                in consequence of their sitting indiscriminately at the
                                Amphitheatre, where the gladiators were exhibited; whereas at the
                                Theatres there were distinct places appropriated to each "<foreign xml:lang="lat">ordo</foreign>" or class.</note> meantime, I was
                            unable to maintain my place. Now there is no confusion: there is
                            attention and silence--an opportunity of acting my Play has been granted
                            me; to yourselves is given the power of gracing the scenic
                                festival.<l n="45"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>Gracing the scenic festival</lem></app>:
                                Madame Dacier remarks that there is great force and eloquence in the
                                Actor's affecting a concern for the sacred festivals, which were in
                                danger of being deprived of their chief ornaments, if by too great a
                                severity they discouraged the Poets who undertook to furnish the
                                Plays during the solemnity.</note> Do not permit, through your
                            agency, the dramatic art to sink into the hands of a few; let your
                            authority prove a seconder and assistant to my own. If I have never
                            covetously set a price upon my skill, and have come to this conclusion,
                            that it is the greatest gain in the highest possible degree to
                            contribute to your entertainment; allow me to obtain this of you, that
                            him who has intrusted his labors to my protection, and himself to your
                            integrity,--that him, I say, the malicious may not maliciously deride,
                            beset by them on every side. For my sake, admit of this plea, and attend
                            in silence, that he may be encouraged to write other Plays, and that it
                            may be for my advantage to study new ones hereafter, purchased at my own
                                expense.<l n="57"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>At my own expense</lem></app>: It is generally
                                supposed that "<foreign xml:lang="lat">meo pretio</foreign>" means "a
                                price named as my estimate;" and that it was the custom for the
                                Aediles to purchase a Play of a Poet at a price fixed by the head of
                                the company of actors. It is also thought that the money was paid to
                                the actor, who handed over the whole, or a certain part, to the
                                Poet, and if the Play was not received with favor, the Aediles had
                                the right to ask back the money from the actor, who consequently
                                became a loser by the transaction. Pareus and Meric Casaubon think,
                                however, that in case of this Play, the Aediles had purchased it
                                from the Poet, and the performers had bought it of the Aediles as a
                                speculation. What he means at the end of the First Prologue by
                                selling the Play over again, is not exactly known. Perhaps if the
                                Play had been then performed throughout and received with no favor,
                                he would have had to forfeit the money, and lose all right to any
                                future pecuniary interest in it; but he preferred to cancel the
                                whole transaction, and to reserve the Play for purchase and
                                representation at a more favorable period.</note>

                        <p> Pamphilus was in the height of his passion for Bacchis here, when his
                            father began to importune him to take a wife, and to urge those points
                            which are usual with all fathers, that he himself was now in years, and
                            that he was his only son, that he wished for a support for his declining
                            years. He refused at first. But on his father pressing more urgently, he
                            caused him to become wavering in his mind, whether to yield rather to
                            duty or to love. By hammering on and teazing him, at last the old man
                            gained his point; and betrothed him to the daughter of our next-door
                            neighbor here <stage>pointing to the house of PHIDIPPUS</stage>. This
                            did not seem so very disagreeable to Pamphilus, until on the very point
                            of marriage, when he saw that all was ready, and that no respite was
                            granted, but marry he must; then, at last, he took it so much to heart,
                            that I do believe if Bacchis had been present, even she would have
                            pitied him. Whenever opportunity was afforded for us being alone, so
                            that he could converse with me, he used to say: "Parmeno, I am ruined!
                            What have I done! Into what misery have I plunged myself! Parmeno, I
                            shall never be able to endure this. To my misery, I am undone !"</p>

                        <p> In a very few days after, Pamphilus took me aside, away from the house,
                            and told me how that the young woman was still untouched by him; and how
                            that before he had taken her home as his wife, he had hoped to be able
                            to endure this marriage: "But, Parmeno, as I can not resolve to live
                            with her any longer, it is neither honorable in me, nor of advantage to
                            the young woman herself, for her to be turned to ridicule, but rather I
                            ought to return her to her relations just as I received her."</p>

                        <p> And this circumstance in especial contributed to estrange him from her;
                            after he had fairly examined himself, and her, and the one that was at
                            home, he formed a judgment, by comparison, upon the principles of them
                            both. She, just as might be expected from a person of respectable and
                            free birth, chaste and virtuous, patient under the slights and all the
                            insults of her husband, and concealing his affronts. Upon this, his
                            mind, partly overcome by compassion for his wife, partly constrained by
                            the insolence of the other, was gradually estranged from Bacchis, and
                            transferred its affections to the other, after having found a congenial
                            disposition. In the mean time, there dies at Imbros<l n="171"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>Imbros</lem></app>: An island in the <placeName key="tgn,7002675">Aegean Sea</placeName>, off the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>.</note> an old man, a

                            good understanding between them. In the mean time, however, in a strange
                            way, she began to take a dislike to Sostrata; nor yet was there ever any
                            quarrel or words between them.</p>

                        <p> If at any time she came to converse with her, she would instantly
                            withdraw from her presence,<l n="182"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>From her presence</lem></app>: For
                                the purpose, as will afterward appear, of not letting Sostrata see
                                that she was pregnant.</note> and refuse to see her; in fine, when
                            she could no longer endure her, she pretended that she was sent for by
                            her mother to assist at a sacrifice. When she had been there a few days,
                            Sostrata ordered her to be fetched. She made some, I know not what,
                            excuse. Again she gave similar orders; no one sent back any excuse.
                            After she had sent for her repeatedly, they pretended that the damsel
                            was sick. My mistress immediately went to see her; no one admitted her.
                            On the old man coming to know of this, he yesterday came up from the
                            country on purpose, and waited immediately upon the father of Philumena.
                            What passed between them, I do not know as yet; but really I do feel
                            some anxiety in what way this is to end. You now have the whole matter;
                            and I shall proceed whither I was on my way.</p>

                                as Donatus observes, why she does not again appear in the Play. The
                                following is an extract from Colman's remarks on this passage: "It
                                were to be wished, for the sake of the credit of our author's
                                acknowledged art in the Drama, that Philotis had assigned as good a
                                reason for her appearing at all. Eugraphius justly says: 'The
                                Courtesan in this Scene is a character quite foreign to the fable.'
                                Donatus also says much the same thing in his Preface, and in his
                                first Note to this Comedy; but adds that 'Terence chose this method
                                rather. than to relate the argument by means of a Prologue, or to
                                introduce a God speaking from a machine. I will venture to say that
                                the Poet might have taken a much shorter and easier method than
                                either; I mean, to have begun the Play with the very Scene which now
                                opens the Second Act.'"</note> to meet him.</p>

                        <p> O faith of Gods and men! what a race is this! what a conspiracy this!
                            that all women should desire and reject every individual thing alike!
                            And not a single one can you find to swerve in any respect from the
                            disposition of the rest. For instance, quite as though with one accord,
                            do all mothers-in-law hate their daughters-in-law. Just in the same way
                            is it their system to oppose their husbands; their obstinacy here is the
                            same. In the very same school they all seem to me to have been trained
                            up to perverseness. Of that school, if there is any mistress, I am very
                            sure that she <stage>pointing at SOSTRATA</stage> it is.</p>

                        <speaker>LACHES</speaker>
                        <p> You, woman, I say, who take me to be a stone, not a man. Do you think
                            because it's my habit to be so much in the country, that I don't know in
                            what way each person is passing his life here ? I know much better what
                            is going on here than there, where I am daily; for this reason, because,
                            just as you act at home, I am spoken of abroad. Some time since, indeed,
                            I heard that Philumena had taken a dislike to you; nor did I the least
                            wonder at it; indeed, if she hadn't done so, it would have been more
                            surprising. But I did not suppose that she would have gone so far as to
                            hate even the whole of the family; if I had known that, she should have
                            remained here in preference, and you should have gone away. But consider
                            how undeservedly these vexations arise on your account, Sostrata; I went
                            to live in the country, in compliance with your request, and to look
                            after my affairs, in order that my circumstances might be able to
                            support your lavishness and comforts, not sparing my own exertions,
                            beyond what's reasonable and my time of life allows. That you should
                            take no care, in return for all this, that there should be nothing to
                            vex me!</p>

                        <speaker>SOSTRATA</speaker>
                        <p> Upon my word, through no means or fault of mine has this taken
                            place.</p>

                        <speaker>LACHES</speaker>
                        <p> Nay, through you in especial; you were the only person here; on you
                            alone, Sostrata, falls all the blame. You ought to have taken care of
                            matters here, as I had released you from other anxieties. Is it not a
                            disgrace for an old woman to pick a quarrel with a girl? You will say it
                            was her fault.</p>

                        <speaker>LACHES</speaker>
                        <p> I am glad of that, so may the Gods prosper me, for my son's sake. I am
                            quite sure of this, that no fault of yours can possibly put you in a
                            worse light.</p>

                        <p> How do you know, my husband, whether she may not have pretended to
                            dislike me, on purpose that she might be more with her mother?</p>

                        <p> What say you to this? Is it not proof sufficient, when yesterday no one
                            was willing to admit you into the house, when you went to see her?</p>
                    </sp>
                    <sp>
                        <speaker>SOSTRATA</speaker>
                        <p> Why, they told me that she was very ill just then; for that reason I was
                            not admitted to her.</p>
                    </sp>
                    <sp>
                        <speaker>LACHES</speaker>
                        <p> I fancy that your humors are more her malady than any thing else; and
                            with good reason in fact, for there is not one of you but wants her son
                            to take a wife; and the match which has taken your fancy must be the
                            one; when, at your solicitation, they have married, then, at your
                            solicitation, they are to put them away again. </p>

                            that I am particularly indulgent to all my family, still it is not to
                            that degree to let my good nature corrupt their minds. And if you would
                            do the same, it would be more for your own interest and ours. At present

                        <p> I waited on you yesterday about your daughter; you sent me away just as
                            wise as I came. It does not become you, if you wish this alliance to
                            continue, to conceal your resentment. If there is any fault on our side,
                            disclose it; either by clearing ourselves, or excusing it, we shall
                            remedy these matters for you, yourself the judge. But if this is the
                            cause of detaining her at your house, because she is ill, then I think
                            that you do me an injustice, Phidippus, if you are afraid lest she
                            should not be attended with sufficient care at my house. But, so may the

                            father, that you can wish her well more than I do, and that on my son's
                            account, who I know values her not less than his own self. Nor, in fact,
                            is it unknown to you, how much, as I believe, it will vex him, if he

                            am persuaded that all you say is just as you say: and I would have you
                            believe me in this; I am anxious for her to return to you, if I possibly

                            constrain her by force to return, she solemnly protested that she
                            couldn't possibly remain with you, while Pamphilus was absent. Probably
                            each has his own failing; I am naturally of an indulgent disposition; I

                        <p> Upon my faith, we assuredly are all of us hated by our husbands with
                            equal injustice, on account of a few, who cause us all to appear
                            deserving of harsh treatment. For, so may. the Gods prosper me, as to
                            what my husband accuses me of, I am quite guiltless. But it is not so
                            easy to clear myself, so strongly have people come to the conclusion
                            that all step-mothers are harsh: i' faith, not I, indeed, for I never
                            regarded her otherwise than if she had been my own daughter; nor can I
                            conceive how this has befallen me. But really, for many reasons, I long
                            for. my son's return home with impatience. <stage>Goes into her

                        <p> No individual, I do believe, ever met with more crosses in love than I.
                            Alas! unhappy me! that I have thus been sparing of life! Was it for this
                            I was so very impatient to return home ? O, how much more preferable had
                            it been for me to pass my life any where in the world than to return
                            here and be sensible that I am thus wretched! For all of us know who
                            have met with trouble from any cause, that all the time that passes
                            before we come to the knowledge of it, is so much gain.</p>

                        <p> Still, as it is, you'll the sooner know how to extricate yourself from
                            these misfortunes. If you had not returned, this breach might have
                            become much wider; but now, Pamphilus, I am sure that both will be awed
                            by your presence. You will learn the facts, remove their enmity, restore
                            them to good feeling once again. These are but trifles which you have
                            persuaded yourself are so grievous.</p>

                        <p> Why comfort me? Is there a person in all the world so wretched as I?
                            Before I took her to wife, I had my heart engaged by other affections.
                            Now, though on this subject I should be silent, it is easy for any one
                            to know how much I have suffered; yet I never dared refuse her whom my
                            father forced upon me. With difficulty did I withdraw myself from
                            another, and disengage my affections so firmly rooted there! and hardly
                            had I fixed them in another quarter, when, lo! a new misfortune has
                            arisen, which may tear me from her too. Then besides, I suppose that in
                            this matter I shall find either my mother or my wife in fault; and when
                            I find such to be the fact, what remains but to become still more
                            wretched? For duty, Parmeno, bids me bear with the feelings of a mother;
                            then, to my wife I am bound by obligations; with so much temper did she
                            formerly bear my usage, and on no occasion disclose the many wrongs
                            inflicted on her by me. But, Parmeno, something of consequence, I know
                            not what it is, must have happened for this misunderstanding to have
                            arisen between them, that has lasted so long.</p>

                        <p> Or else something frivolous, i' faith, if you would only give words
                            their proper value; those which are sometimes the greatest enmities, do
                            not argue the greatest injuries; for it often happens that in certain
                            circumstances, in which another would not even be out of temper, for the
                            very same reason a passionate man becomes your greatest enemy. What
                            enmities do children entertain among themselves for trifling injuries!
                            For what reason? Why, because they have a weak understanding to direct
                            them. Just so are these women, almost like children with their fickle
                            feelings; perhaps a single word has occasioned this enmity between them,
                            master.</p>

                            Am I not to go see the wife of Pamphilus, when she is ill here next

                            her; for I'm of opinion that he who loves, a person to whom he is an
                            object of dislike, commits a double mistake: he himself takes a useless
                            trouble, and causes annoyance to the other. Besides, your son went in to
                            see how she is, as soon as he arrived.</p>

                        <speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker>
                        <p> I can not discover any fitting commencement of my troubles, at which to
                            begin to narrate the things that have so unexpectedly befallen me, some
                            of which with these eyes I have beheld; some I have heard with my ears;
                            and on account of which I so hastily betook myself, in extreme
                            agitation, out of doors. For just now, when, full of alarm, I rushed
                            into the house, expecting to find my wife afflicted with some other
                            malady than what I have found it to be--ah me! immediately the
                            servant-maids beheld that I had arrived, they all at the same moment
                            joyfully exclaimed, "He is come," from having so suddenly caught sight
                            of me. But I soon perceived the countenances of all of them
                                change,<l n="369"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>All of them change</lem></app>: This must have
                                been imaginary, as they were not likely to be acquainted with the
                                reason of Philumena's apprehensions.</note> because at so
                            unseasonable a juncture chance had brought me there. One of them in the
                            mean time hastily ran before me to give notice that I had come.
                            Impatient to see my wife, I followed close. When I entered the room,
                            that instant, to my sorrow, I found out her malady; for neither did the
                            time afford any. interval to enable her to conceal it, nor could she
                            complain in any other accents than those which the case itself prompted.
                            When I perceived this: "O disgraceful conduct!" I exclaimed, and
                            instantly hurried away from the spot in tears, overwhelmed by such an
                            incredible and shocking circumstance. Her mother followed me; just as I
                            got to the threshold, she threw herself on her knees: I felt compassion
                            for her. Assuredly it is the fact, in my opinion, just as matters befall
                            us all, so are we elated or depressed. At once she began to address me
                            in these words: "O my dear Pamphilus, you see the reason why she left
                            your house; for violence was offered to her when formerly a maid, by
                            some villain to us unknown. Now, she took refuge here then, that from
                            you and others she might conceal her labor." But when I call to mind her
                            entreaties, I can not, wretched as I am, refrain from tears. "Whatever
                            chance or fortune it is," said she, "which has brought you here to-day,
                            by it we do both conjure you, if with equity and justice we may, that
                            her misfortune may be concealed by you, and kept a secret from all. If
                            ever you were sensible, my dear Pamphilus, that she was tenderly
                            disposed toward you, she now asks you to grant her this favor in return,
                            without making any difficulty of it. But as to taking her back, act
                            quite according to your own convenience. You alone are aware of her.
                            lying-in, and that the child is none of yours. For it is said that it
                            was two months after the marriage before she had commerce with you. And
                            then, this is but the seventh month since she came to you.<l n="394"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>Since she came to you</lem></app>: There is great doubt what is the
                                exact meaning of "<foreign xml:lang="lat">postquam ad te
                                venit</foreign>," here, whether it means, "it is now the seventh
                                month since she became your wife," or, "it is now the seventh month
                                since she came to your embraces," which did not happen for two
                                months after the marriage. The former is, under the circumstances,
                                the most probable construction.</note> That you are sensible of
                            this, the circumstances themselves prove. Now, if it is possible,
                            Pamphilus, I especially wish, and will use my endeavors, that her labor
                            may remain unknown to her father, and to all, in fact. But if that can
                            not be managed, and they do find it out, I will say that she miscarried;
                            I am sure no one will suspect otherwise than, what is so likely, the
                            child was by you. It shall be instantly exposed; in that case there is
                            no inconvenience whatever to yourself, and you will be concealing an
                            outrage so undeservingly committed upon her,<l n="401"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>Committed
                                    upon her</lem></app>: Colman very justly observes here: "It is rather
                                extraordinary that Myrrhina's account of the injury done to her
                                daughter should not put Pamphilus in mind of his own adventure,
                                which comes out in the Fifth Act. It is certain that had the Poet
                                let the Audience into that secret in this place, they would have
                                immediately concluded that the wife of Pamphilus and the lady whom
                                he had ravished were one and the same person." Playwrights have
                                never, in any age or country, troubled themselves much about
                                probability in their plots. Besides, his adventure with Philumena
                                was by no means an uncommon one. We find similar instances mentioned
                                by Plautus; and violence and debauchery seem almost to have reigned
                                paramount in the streets at night.</note> poor thing!" I promised
                            this, and I am resolved to keep faith in what I said. But as to taking
                            her back, really I do not think that would be at all creditable, nor
                            will I do so, although love for her, and habit, have a strong influence
                            upon me. I weep when it occurs to my mind, what must be her life, and
                            how great her loneliness in future. O Fortune, thou hast never been
                            found constant! But by this time my former passion has taught me
                            experience in the present case. The means by which I got rid of that, I
                            must employ on the present occasion. Parmeno is coming with the
                            servants; it is far from convenient that he should be here under present
                            circumstances, for he was the only person to whom I trusted the secret
                            that I kept aloof from her when I first married her. I am afraid lest,
                            if he should frequently hear her cries, he might find out that she is in
                            labor. He must be dispatched by me somewhere till Philumena is
                            delivered. </p>

                        <p> I know the whole affair, and how it happened; I heard it just now, on my

                            <stage>to PHIDIPPUS.</stage> I am sure that it has been my study, that
                            with reason no slight might possibly be committed by your family; and if
                            I were now truthful to mention of how faithful, loving, and tender a
                            disposition I have proved toward her, I could do so truly, did I not
                            rather wish that you should learn it of herself; for by that method you
                            will be the more ready to place confidence in my disposition when she,
                            who is now acting unjustly toward me, speaks favorably of me. And that
                            through no fault of mine this separation has taken place, I call the
                            Gods to witness. But since she considers that it is not befitting her to
                            give way to my mother, and with readiness to conform to her temper, and
                            as on no other terms it is possible for good feeling to exist between
                            them, either my mother must be separated, Phidippus, from me, or else
                            Philumena. Now affection urges me rather to consult my mother's
                            pleasure.</p>

                        <p> Pamphilus, your words have reached my ears not otherwise than to my
                            satisfaction, since I find that you post-pone all considerations for
                            your parent. But take care, Pamphilus, lest impelled by resentment, you
                            carry matters too far.</p>

                        <p> How, impelled by resentment, could, I now be biased against her who
                            never has been guilty of any thing toward me, father, that I could not
                            wish, and who has often deserved as well as I could desire? I both love
                            and praise and exceedingly regret her, for I have found by experience
                            that she was of a wondrously engaging disposition with regard to myself;
                            and I sincerely wish that she may spend the remainder of her life with a
                            husband who may prove more fortunate than me, since necessity thus tears
                            her from me.</p>

                            daughter without saying a word. What if he comes to know that she has
                            been delivered? for what reason I am to say I kept it concealed, upon my

                            of us to be in ignorance of the truth, especially when she has been
                            delivered properly, and at the right time.<l n="531"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>At the

                                would appear that the Greeks considered seven months sufficient for
                                gestation. So it would appear, if we are to take the time of the
                                Play to be seven, and not nine, months after the marriage; and, as
                                before observed, the former seems to be the more reasonable
                                conclusion.</note> That you should be of a mind so perverse as to
                            prefer that the child should perish, through which you might be sure
                            that hereafter there would be a friendship more lasting between us,
                            rather than that, at the expense of your feelings, his wife should
                            continue with him! I supposed this to be their fault, while in reality

                            all. For, i' faith, the time will soon come when even he will be
                            disgusted with himself for doing so. But just as you formerly showed
                            yourself, you have never. ceased to be the same up to the present time;
                            in order that you might withdraw your daughter from him, and that what I
                            did might not hold good, one thing itself now plainly proves how far you

                            feelings toward one whose mother I am, if this match had been to our
                            advantage?</p>

                        <p> Can you possibly foresee or judge what is to our advantage? You have
                            heard it of some one, perhaps, who has told you that he has seen him
                            coming from or going to his mistress. What then? If he has done so with
                            discretion, and but occasionally, is it not more kind in us to conceal
                            our knowledge of it, than to do our. best to be aware of it, in
                            consequence of which he will detest us? For if he could all at once have
                            withdrawn himself from her with whom he had been intimate for so many
                            years, I should not have deemed him a man, or likely to prove a constant
                            husband for our daughter.</p>

                            guilty of. Go away, meet him by yourself; ask him whether he wishes to
                            have her as a wife or not; if so it is that he should say he does wish
                            it, why, send her back; but if on the other hand he does not wish it, I
                            have taken the best course for my child.</p>

                            fault; still I was at hand, by whose advice it was proper for these
                            matters to be settled; therefore I am greatly offended that you have
                            presumed to act thus without my leave. I forbid you to attempt to carry
                            the child any where out of this house. But I am very foolish to be
                            expecting her to obey my orders. I'll go in-doors, and charge the
                            servants to allow it to be carried out nowhere. <stage>Goes into the

                        <p> Upon my faith, I do believe that there is no woman living more wretched
                            than I; for how he would take it, if he came to know the real state of
                            the case, i' faith, is not unknown to me, when he bears this, which is
                            of less consequence, with such angry feelings; and I know not in what
                            way his sentiments can possibly be changed. Out of very many
                            misfortunes, this one evil alone had been wanting to me, for him to
                            compel me to rear a child of whom we know not who is the father; for
                            when my daughter was ravished, it was so dark that his person could not
                            be distinguished, nor was any thing taken from him on the occasion by
                            which it could be afterward discovered who he was. He, on leaving her,
                            took away from the girl, by force, a ring which<l n="574"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>A ring

                            although you carefully conceal your knowledge of it. But so may the Gods
                            prosper me, and so may you answer all my hopes, I have never knowingly
                            deserved that hatred of me should with reason possess her; and while I
                            thought before that you loved me, on that point you have confirmed my
                            belief: for in-doors your father has just now related to me in what way
                            you have preferred me to your passion. Now it is my determination to
                            return you the favor, that you may understand that with me lies the
                            reward of your affection. My Pamphilus, I think that this is expedient
                            both for yourselves and my own reputation. I have finally resolved to
                            retire hence into the country with your father, that my presence may not
                            be an obstacle, and that no pretense may remain why your Philumena

                                which began: "There were once upon a time an old man and an-old
                                woman." Indeed, almost the same words occur in the Stichus of
                                Plautus, 1. 540, at the commencement of a story: "<foreign xml:lang="lat">Fuit olim, quasi ego sum, senex</foreign>," "There was upon a

                            perplexed to this degree? In the first place, when you alleged as a
                            reason, that, on account of your mother, you could not have your wife at
                            home, she promised that she would leave the house. Now, since you see

                            without your knowledge, you have got another You are mistaken if you
                            suppose that I am ignorant of your feelings. That at last you might
                            prevail upon your feelings to take this step, how long a period for

                            expense you were at in keeping her! I remonstrated with you and
                            entreated you to take a wife. I said that it was time: by my persuasion
                            you married. What you then did in obedience to me, you did as became
                            you. Now again you have set your fancy upon a mistress, and, to gratify
                            her, you do an injury to the other as well. For I see plainly that you

                        <p> By all means. No wonder if my wife has taken this amiss: women are
                            resentful; they do not easily put up with such things. Hence that anger
                            of hers, for she herself told me of it; I would not mention this to you
                            in his presence, and at first I did not believe her; but now it is true
                            beyond a doubt; for I see that his feelings are altogether averse to
                            marriage.</p>

                                    Pamphilus at a distance</lem></app>: Colman observes, how are we to reconcile this with
                                the words of Parmeno at the beginning of the Play, where he says
                                that Pamphilus visited Bacchis daily; and he inquires whether we are
                                to suppose that Bacchis, who behaves so candidly in every other
                                instance, wantonly perjures herself in this, or that the Poet, by a
                                strange infatuation attending him in this Play, contradicts
                                himself? To this it may be answered, that as Bacchis appears to be
                                so scrupulous in other instances, it is credible that,
                                notwithstanding his visits, she may not have allowed him to share

                            home to Pamphilus; should I effect that, I shall not regret its being
                            reported that I have been the only one to do what other courtesans avoid
                                doing.<l n="777"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>Other courtesans avoid doing</lem></app>:
                                Colman has the following quotation from Donatus: "Terence, by his
                                uncommon art, has attempted many innovations with great success. In
                                this Comedy, he introduces, contrary to received prejudices, a good
                                step-mother and an honest courtesan; but at the same time he so
                                carefully assigns their motives of action, that by him alone every
                                thing seems reconcilable to truth and nature; for this is just the
                                opposite of what he mentions in another place, as the common
                                privilege of all Poets, 'to paint good matrons and wicked
                                courtesans.'" Perhaps the same good feeling prompted Terence, in
                                showing that a mother-in-law and a courtesan could be capable of
                                acting with good and disinterested feelings, which caused Cumberland to write his Play of
                                "The Jew," to combat the popular prejudice against that persecuted
                                class, by showing, in the character of Sheva, that a Jew might
                                possibly be a virtuous man.</note></p>

                        <p> What great joy have I caused for Pamphilus by my coming to-day! How many

                            him! A son I save for him, when it was nearly perishing through the
                            agency of these women and of himself: a wife, whom he thought that he
                            must cast off forever, I restore to him: from the suspicion that he lay
                            under with his father and Phidippus, I have cleared him. This ring, in
                            fact, was the cause of these discoveries being made. For I remember,
                            that about ten months ago, at an early hour of night, he came running
                            home to my house, out of breath, without a companion, and surcharged
                            with wine,<l n="824"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>Surcharged with wine</lem></app>: Cooke has
                                this remark here: "I suppose that this is the best excuse the Poet
                                could make for the young gentleman's being guilty of felony and rape
                                at the same time. In this speech, the incident is related on which
                                the catastrophe of the Play turns, which incident is a very
                                barbarous one, and attended with more than one absurdity, though it
                                is the occasion of an agreeable discovery."</note> with this ring in
                            his hand. I felt alarmed immediately: "My Pamphilus," I said, "prithee,
                            my dear, why thus breathless, or where did you get that ring?-tell me!"
                            He began to pretend that he was thinking of something else. When I saw
                            that, I began to suspect I know not what, and to press him still more to
                            tell me. The fellow confessed that he had ravished some female, he knew
                            not whom, in the street; and said, that while she was struggling, he had
                            taken that ring away from her. Myrrhina here recognized it just now,
                            while I had it on my finger. She asked whence it came: I told her all
                            the story. Hence the discovery has been made that it was Philumena
                            ravished by him, and that this new-born child is his. I am overjoyed
                            that this happiness hsa befallen him through my agency; although other
                            courtesans would not have similar feelings; nor, indeed, is it to our
                            interest that any lover should find pleasure in matrimony. But, i'
                            faith, I never, for the sake of gain, will give my mind to base actions.
                            So long as I had the opportunity, I found him to be kind, easy, and
                            good-natured. This marriage has fallen out unluckily for me,--that I
                            confess to be the fact. But, upon my word, I do think that I have done
                            nothing for it to befall me deservedly. It is but reasonable to endure
                            inconveniences from one from whom I have received so many benefits. </p>

                        <p> Once more, take care, will you, my dear Parmeno, that you have brought
                            me a faithful and distinct account, so as not to allure me for a short
                            time to indulge in these transient joys.</p>

                        <p> The one I formerly gave to her; and she has desired you to tell me this:
                            is such the fact?</p>
                    </sp>

                        <p> Who is there happier than I, and, in fact, more full of joyousness? What
                            am I to present you for these tidings? What?--what? I know not.</p>

                        <speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker>

                        <speaker>PARMENO</speaker>
                        <p> Why, nothing; for neither in the tidings nor in myself do I know of
                            there being any advantage to you.</p>

                        <speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker>
                        <p> What! am I to suffer you, who have caused me, when dead, to be restored
                            from the shades to life--to leave me unrewarded? Oh, you deem me too
                            thankless! But look--I see Bacchis standing before the door; she's
                            waiting for me, I suppose; I'll accost her.</p>

                        <speaker>BACCHIS</speaker>

                        <speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker>
                        <p> By your actions, you give me reason to believe you, and so much do you
                            retain your former charming qualities, that wherever you go, the meeting
                            with you, your company, your conversation, always give pleasure.</p>

                        <p> You had reason, Pamphilus, for being so fond of your wife. For never
                            before to-day did I set eyes upon her, so as to know her: she seems a
                            very gentle person.</p>

                        <p> Nor is there need, in fact; therefore keep it a secret: I don't wish it
                            to be the case here as it is in the Comedies,<l n="867"/><note anchored="true"><app><lem>In the
                                    Comedies</lem></app>: Madame Dacier observes on this passage:
                                "Terence here, with reason, endeavors to make the most of a
                                circumstance peculiar to his Play. In other Comedies, every body,
                                Actors as well as Spectators, are at last equally acquainted with
                                the whole intrigue and catastrophe, and it would even be a defect in
                                the plot were there any obscurity remaining. But Terence, like a
                                true genius, makes himself superior to rules, and adds new beauties
                                to his piece by forsaking them. His reasons for concealing from part
                                of the personages of the Drama the principal incident of the plot,
                                are so plausible and natural, that he could not have followed the
                                beaten track without offending against manners and decency. This
                                bold and uncommon turn is one of the chief graces of the
                                Play."</note> where every thing is known to every body. Here, those'
                            who ought to know, know already; but those who ought not to know, shall
                            neither hear of it nor know it.</p>

                        <p> Nay more, I will give you a proof why you may suppose that this may be
                            the more easily concealed. Myrrhina has told Phidippus to this
                            effect--that she has given credit to my oath, and that, in consequence,
                            in her eyes you are exculpated.</p>

                        <p> Still I suspect. "I restore him, when dead, from the shades

                                says this, while pondering upon the meaning of all that is going on,
                                and thereby expresses his impatience to become acquainted with it.
                                He therefore repeats what Pamphilus has before said in the twelfth
                                line of the present Act, about his having been restored from death
