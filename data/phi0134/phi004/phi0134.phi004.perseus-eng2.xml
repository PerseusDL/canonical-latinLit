            <milestone unit="paragraph"/>THE SUBJECT
            <milestone unit="paragraph"/>CHREMES and DEMIPHO are two aged Athenians, brothers. Nausistrata, the wife of Chremes, is a wealthy woman, possessed of large estates in the island of <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName>. Chremes, who goes thither yearly to receive the rents, meets with a poor woman there, whom he secretly marries, and has by her a daughter called Phanium: while engaged in this intrigue, Chremes passes at <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName> by the name of Stilpho. By his wife, Nausistrata, at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, Chremes has a son, named Phaedria, and his brother has a son, named Antipho. Phanium having now arrived at her fifteenth year, the two brothers privately agree that she shall be brought to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and married to Antipho. For this purpose, Chremes goes to <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName>, while Demipho is obliged to take a journey to <placeName key="tgn,7002470">Cilicia</placeName>. On departing, they leave their sons in the care of Geta, one of Demipho’s servants. Shortly afterward, Phaedria falls in love with a Music-girl, but, from want of means, is unable to purchase her from her owner. In the mean time, the Lemnian wife of Chremes, urged by poverty, embarks for <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, whither she arrives with her daughter and her nurse. Here they inquire for Stilpho, but in vain, as they can not find any one of that name. Shortly after, the mother dies, and Antipho, seeing Phanium by accident, falls in love with her. Being wishful to marry her, he applies to Phormio, a Parasite, for his advice. The latter hits upon the following scheme: there being a law at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, which obliges the next-of-kin to female orphans, either to marry them or give them a portion, the Parasite pretends that he is a friend of Phanium, and insists that Antipho is her nearest relation, and is consequently bound to marry her. Antipho is summoned before a court of justice, and it being previously arranged, allows judgment to be given against himself, and immediately marries Phanium. Shortly after, the old men return upon the same day, and are much vexed, the one on finding that his son has married a woman without a fortune, the other that he has lost the opportunity of getting his daughter advantageously married. In the mean time, Phaedria being necessitated to raise some money to purchase the Music-girl, Geta and Phormio arrange that the former shall pretend to the old man that Phormio has consented to take back the woman whom Antipho has married, if Demipho will give her a portion of thirty mine. Demipho borrows the money of Chremes, and pays it to Phormio, who hands it over to Phaedria, and Phaedria to Dorio, for his mistress. At this conjuncture, it becomes known who Phanium really is, and the old men are delighted to find that Antipho has married the very person they wished. They attempt, however, to get back the thirty minae from Phormio, and proceed to threats and violence. On this, Phormio, who has accidentally learned the intrigue of Chremes with the woman of <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName>, exposes him, and relates the whole story to his wife, Nausistrata; on which she censures her husband for his bad conduct, and the Play concludes with her thanks to Phormio for his information.</l>

The girl, her orphan daughter, (Chremes being away,) arranges the funeral. After Antipho has fallen in love with her when seen there, through the aid of the Parasite he receives her as his wife. His father and Chremes, having now returned. begin to be enraged. Afterward they give thirty minae to the Parasite, that he may take her as his own wife. With this money the Music-girl is bought for Phoedria. Antipho then keeps his wife, who has been recognized by his uncle.

<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi004.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="1">SINCE the old Poet<note resp="translator"><q rend="double" type="mentioned">Since the old Poet</q>: He alludes to his old enemy, Luscus Lavinius, who is mentioned in all his Prologues, except those to the Hecyra.</note> can not withdraw our bard from his pursuits and reduce him to indolence, he endeavors, by invectives, to deter him from writing: for he is wont to say to this effect,—that the Plays which he has hitherto composed</l>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi004.perseus-eng2" n="5">are poor in their language, and of meagre style; because he has nowhere described a frantic youth as seeing a hind in flight, and the hounds pursuing; while he implores<note resp="translator"><q rend="double" type="mentioned">While one implored.</q> <q rend="double" type="foreign" xml:lang="lat">Et eam plorare, orare ut subveniat sibi.</q> This is probably in allusion to some absurd passage in one of the Plays of Lavinius. It is generally supposed to mean, that the stag implores the young man; but as the youth is mad, the absurdity of the passage is heightened if we suppose that he implores the stag, and, in the moment of its own danger, entreats it to come to his own assistance; as certainly the Latin will admit of that interpretation.—Ovid has a somewhat similar passage in the Pontic Epistles, B. ii. Ep. ii. 1. 39: <quote rend="double" type="translaton">The hind that, in its terror, is flying from the savage dogs, hesitates not to trust itself to the neighboring house.</quote></note> and entreated that he would give her aid. But if he had been aware that his Play, when formerly first represented, </l>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi004.perseus-eng2" n="10">stood its ground more through the merits of the performers than its own, he would attack with much less boldness than he does. Now, if there is any one who says or thinks to this effect, that if the old Poet had not assailed him first, the young one could have devised no Prologue </l>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi004.perseus-eng2" n="15">for him to repeat, without having some one to abuse, let him receive this for an answer: <q rend="double" type="emph">that the prize is proposed in common to all who apply to the Dramatic art.</q> He has aimed at driving our Poet from his studies to absolute want; he then has in-tended this for an answer, not an attack. </l>

The idea is truly comic, and it is worked up with all that simplicity and chastity so peculiar to the manner of Terence. An ordinary writer would have indulged himself in twenty little conceits on this occasion; but the dry gravity of Terence infinitely surpasses, as true humor, all the drolleries which, perhaps, even those great masters of Comedy, Plautus or Molière, might have been tempted to throw out. It is the highest art of a Dramatic Author, on some occasions, to leave a good deal to the Actor; and it has been remarked by Heinsius and others, that Terence was particularly attentive to this circumstance.</quote></note> than before.</l> <stage>(Re-enter GETA, from the house.)</stage></sp>

Why hesitate to go up and address him? <stage>(Accosting him.)</stage> How now, Phaedria, whence have you acquired this new wisdom, and derived such great delight, as you show by your countenance?</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi004.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="1056_sp3">O welcome, my friend; O most delightful Phormio, welcome ! There’s not a person in all the world I could more wish just now to meet than yourself.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi004.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="1056_sp4">Pray, tell me what is the matter.</l></sp>

<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi004.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="1056_sp5">Aye, faith, I have to beg of you, that you will listen to it. My Pamphila is a citizen of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, and of noble birth, and rich.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi004.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="1056_sp6">What is it you tell me? Are you dreaming, pray?</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi004.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="1056_sp7">Upon my faith, I’m saying what’s true.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi004.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="1056_sp8">Yes, and this, too, is a true saying: <q rend="double" type="saying">You’ll have no great difficulty in believing that to be true, which you greatly wish to be so.</q></l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi004.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="1056_sp9">Nay, but do listen, I beg of you, to all the wonderful things I have to tell you of. It was while thinking of this to myself, that I just now burst forth into those expressions which you heard—that we, and what relates to us, are ruled by the sanction of the Gods, and not by blind chance.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi004.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="1056_sp10">I’ve been for some time in a state of suspense.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi004.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="1056_sp12">As well as I do yourself.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi004.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="1056_sp13">The rich man? </l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi004.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="1056_sp14">I understand.</l></sp>

<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi004.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="1056_sp15">He is the father of Pamphila. Not to detain you, these were the circumstances: Calchas was his servant, a worthless, wicked fellow. Intending to run away from the house, he carried off this girl, whom her father was bringing up in the country, then five years old, and, secretly taking her with him to Eubaea, sold her to Lycus, a merchant. This person, a long time after, sold her, when now grown up, to Dorio. She, however, knew that she was the daughter of parents of rank, inasmuch as she recollected herself being attended and trained up by female servants: the name of her parents she didn’t recollect.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi004.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="1056_sp16">How, then, were they discovered?</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi004.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="1056_sp17">Stay; I was coming to that. This runaway was caught yesterday, and sent back to Phanocrates: he related the wonderful circumstances I have mentioned about the girl, and how she was sold to Lycus, and afterward to Dorio. Phanocrates sent immediately, and claimed his daughter; but when he learned that she had been sold, he came running to me.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi004.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="1056_sp18">O, how extremely fortunate!</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi004.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="1056_sp19">Phanocrates has no objection to my marrying her; nor has my father, I imagine.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi004.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="1056_sp20">Trust me for that; I’ll have all this matter managed for you; Phormio has so arranged it, that you shall not be a suppliant to your father, but his judge.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi004.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="1056_sp21">You are joking.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi004.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="1056_sp22">So it is, I tell you. Do you only give me the thirty minae which Dorio—</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi004.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="1056_sp23">You put me well in mind; I understand you; you may have them; for he must give them back, as the law forbids a free woman to be sold; and, on my faith, I do rejoice that an opportunity is afforded me of rewarding you, and taking a hearty vengeance upon him; a monster of a fellow he has feelings more hardened than iron.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi004.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="1056_sp24">Now, Phaedria, I return you thanks; I’ll make you a return upon occasion, if ever I have the opportunity. You impose a heavy task upon me, to be contending with you in good offices, as I can not in wealth; and in affection and zeal, I must repay you what I owe. To be surpassed in deserving well, is a disgrace to a man of principle. </l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi004.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="1056_sp25">Services badly bestowed, I take to be disservices. But I do not know any person more grateful and more mindful of a service than yourself. What is it you were just now mentioning about my father?</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi004.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="1056_sp26">There are many particulars, which at present I have not the opportunity to relate. Let’s go in-doors, for Nausistrata has invited me to dinner, and I’m afraid we may keep them waiting.</l></sp> 

<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0134.phi004.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="1056_sp27">Very well; follow me. <stage>(To the AUDIENCE.)</stage> Fare you well, and grant us your applause.</l></sp> </div>
