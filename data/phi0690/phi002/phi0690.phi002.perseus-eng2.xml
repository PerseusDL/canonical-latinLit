               <l n="636">The unpitying fates recall me, and dark sleep</l>
               <l n="637">Closes my swimming eyes. And now farewell:</l>
               <l n="638">Girt with enormous night I am borne away,</l>
               <l n="639">Outstretching toward thee, thine, alas! no more,</l>
               <l n="640">These helpless hands.’ She spake, and suddenly,</l>
               <l n="641">Like smoke dissolving into empty air,</l>
               <l n="642">Passed and was sundered from his sight; nor him</l>
               <l n="643">Clutching vain shadows, yearning sore to speak,</l>
               <l n="644">Thenceforth beheld she, nor no second time</l>
               <l n="645">Hell's boatman brooks he pass the watery bar.</l>
               <l n="646">What should he do? fly whither, twice bereaved?</l>

               <l n="648">The Powers of darkness? She indeed even now</l>
               <l n="649">Death-cold was floating on the Stygian barge!</l>
               <l n="650">For seven whole months unceasingly, men say,</l>
               <l n="651">Beneath a skyey crag, by thy lone wave,</l>
               <l n="652">Strymon, he wept, and in the caverns chill</l>
               <l n="653">Unrolled his story, melting tigers' hearts,</l>
               <l n="654">And leading with his lay the oaks along.</l>
               <l n="655">As in the poplar-shade a nightingale</l>
               <l n="656">Mourns her lost young, which some relentless swain,</l>
               <l n="657">Spying, from the nest has torn unfledged, but she</l>
               <l n="658">Wails the long night, and perched upon a spray</l>
               <l n="659">With sad insistence pipes her dolorous strain,</l>
               <l n="660">Till all the region with her wrongs o'erflows.</l>
               <l n="661">No love, no new desire, constrained his soul:</l>
               <l n="662">By snow-bound <placeName key="tgn,1123466">Tanais</placeName> and the icy north,</l>
               <l n="663">Far steppes to frost Rhipaean forever wed,</l>
               <l n="664">Alone he wandered, lost Eurydice</l>
               <l n="665">Lamenting, and the gifts of Dis ungiven.</l>
               <l n="666">Scorned by which tribute the Ciconian dames,</l>
               <l n="667">Amid their awful Bacchanalian rites</l>
               <l n="668">And midnight revellings, tore him limb from limb,</l>
               <l n="669">And strewed his fragments over the wide fields.</l>
               <l n="670">Then too, even then, what time the <placeName key="tgn,7002660">Hebrus</placeName> stream,</l>
               <l n="671">Oeagrian Hebrus, down mid-current rolled,</l>
               <l n="672">Rent from the marble neck, his drifting head,</l>
               <l n="673">The death-chilled tongue found yet a voice to cry</l>
               <l n="674">‘Eurydice! ah! poor Eurydice!’</l>
               <l n="675">With parting breath he called her, and the banks</l>
               <l n="676">From the broad stream caught up ‘Eurydice!’”</l>
