<l n="tr">to <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, the blest Lavinian strand.</l>
<l n="tr">Smitten of storms he was on land and sea</l>
<l n="tr">by violence of Heaven, to satisfy</l>
<l n="tr">stern Juno's sleepless wrath; and much in war</l>
<l n="tr">he suffered, seeking at the last to found </l>
<l n="tr">the city, and bring o'er his fathers' gods</l>
<l n="tr">to safe abode in <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName>; whence arose</l>
<l n="tr">the Latin race, old Alba's reverend lords,</l>
<l n="tr">and from her hills wide-walled, imperial <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="8" unit="card"/>O Muse, the causes tell! What sacrilege,</l>
<l n="tr">or vengeful sorrow, moved the heavenly Queen</l>
<l n="tr">to thrust on dangers dark and endless toil</l>
<l n="tr">a man whose largest honor in men's eyes</l>
<l n="tr">was serving Heaven? Can gods such anger feel?</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="12" unit="card"/>In ages gone an ancient city stood&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr"><placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, a Tyrian seat, which from afar</l>
<l n="tr">made front on <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> and on the mouths</l>
<l n="tr">of <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>'s stream; its wealth and revenues</l>
<l n="tr">were vast, and ruthless was its quest of war.</l>
<l n="tr">'T is said that Juno, of all lands she loved,</l>
<l n="tr">most cherished this,&mdash;not <placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName>' self so dear.</l>
<l n="tr">Here were her arms, her chariot; even then</l>
<l n="tr">a throne of power o'er nations near and far,</l>
<l n="tr">if Fate opposed not, 't was her darling hope</l>
<l n="tr">to 'stablish here; but anxiously she heard</l>
<l n="tr">that of the Trojan blood there was a breed</l>
<l n="tr">then rising, which upon the destined day</l>
<l n="tr">should utterly o'erwhelm her Tyrian towers,</l>
<l n="tr">a people of wide sway and conquest proud</l>
<l n="tr">should compass <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>'s doom;&mdash;such was the web</l>
<l n="tr">the Fatal Sisters spun. Such was the fear</l>
<l n="tr">of Saturn's daughter, who remembered well</l>
<l n="tr">what long and unavailing strife she waged</l>
<l n="tr">for her loved Greeks at <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>. Nor did she fail</l>
<l n="tr">to meditate th' occasions of her rage,</l>
<l n="tr">and cherish deep within her bosom proud</l>
<l n="tr">its griefs and wrongs: the choice by <persName>Paris</persName> made;</l>
<l n="tr">her scorned and slighted beauty; a whole race</l>
<l n="tr">rebellious to her godhead; and Jove's smile</l>
<l n="tr">that beamed on eagle-ravished Ganymede.</l>
<l n="tr">With all these thoughts infuriate, her power</l>
<l n="tr">pursued with tempests o'er the boundless main</l>
<l n="tr">the Trojans, though by Grecian victor spared</l>
<l n="tr">and fierce Achilles; so she thrust them far</l>
<l n="tr">from <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName>; and they drifted, Heaven-impelled,</l>
<l n="tr">year after year, o'er many an unknown sea&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">O labor vast, to found the Roman line!</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="34" unit="card"/>Below th' horizon the Sicilian isle</l>
<l n="tr">just sank from view, as for the open sea</l>
<l n="tr">with heart of hope they sailed, and every ship</l>
<l n="tr">clove with its brazen beak the salt, white waves.</l>
<l n="tr">But Juno of her everlasting wound</l>
<l n="tr">knew no surcease, but from her heart of pain</l>
<l n="tr">thus darkly mused: &ldquo;Must I, defeated, fail</l>
<l n="tr">of what I will, nor turn the Teucrian King</l>
<l n="tr">from <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> away? Can Fate oppose?</l>
<l n="tr">Had Pallas power to lay waste in flame</l>
<l n="tr">the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> fleet and sink its mariners,</l>
<l n="tr">revenging but the sacrilege obscene</l>
<l n="tr">by Ajax wrought, Oileus' desperate son?</l>
<l n="tr">She, from the clouds, herself Jove's lightning threw,</l>
<l n="tr">scattered the ships, and ploughed the sea with storms.</l>
<l n="tr">Her foe, from his pierced breast out-breathing fire,</l>
<l n="tr">in whirlwind on a deadly rock she flung.</l>
<l n="tr">But I, who move among the gods a queen,</l>
<l n="tr">Jove's sister and his spouse, with one weak tribe</l>
<l n="tr">make war so long! Who now on Juno calls?</l>
<l n="tr">What suppliant gifts henceforth her altars crown?&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="card"/>So, in her fevered heart complaining still,</l>
<l n="tr">unto the storm-cloud land the goddess came,</l>
<l n="tr">a region with wild whirlwinds in its womb,</l>
<l n="tr"><placeName key="tgn,5004216">Aeolia</placeName> named, where royal Aeolus</l>
<l n="tr">in a high-vaulted cavern keeps control</l>
<l n="tr">o'er warring winds and loud concourse of storms.</l>
<l n="tr">There closely pent in chains and bastions strong,</l>
<l n="tr">they, scornful, make the vacant mountain roar,</l>
<l n="tr">chafing against their bonds. But from a throne</l>
<l n="tr">of lofty crag, their king with sceptred hand</l>
<l n="tr">allays their fury and their rage confines.</l>
<l n="tr">Did he not so, our ocean, earth, and sky</l>
<l n="tr">were whirled before them through the vast inane.</l>
<l n="tr">But over-ruling Jove, of this in fear,</l>
<l n="tr">hid them in dungeon dark: then o'er them piled</l>
<l n="tr">huge mountains, and ordained a lawful king</l>
<l n="tr">to hold them in firm sway, or know what time,</l>
<l n="tr">with Jove's consent, to loose them o'er the world.</l>
<l n="tr">To him proud Juno thus made lowly plea:</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="card"/>&ldquo;Thou in whose hands the Father of all gods</l>
<l n="tr">and Sovereign of mankind confides the power</l>
<l n="tr">to calm the waters or with winds upturn,</l>
<l n="tr">great Aeolus! a race with me at war</l>
<l n="tr">now sails the Tuscan main towards <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>,</l>
<l n="tr">bringing their <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Ilium</placeName> and its vanquished powers.</l>
<l n="tr">Uprouse thy gales. Strike that proud navy down!</l>
<l n="tr">Hurl far and wide, and strew the waves with dead!</l>
<l n="tr">Twice seven nymphs are mine, of rarest mould;</l>
<l n="tr">of whom Deiopea, the most fair,</l>
<l n="tr">I give thee in true wedlock for thine own,</l>
<l n="tr">to mate thy noble worth; she at thy side</l>
<l n="tr">shall pass long, happy years, and fruitful bring</l>
<l n="tr">her beauteous offspring unto thee their sire.&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="76" unit="card"/>Then Aeolus: &ldquo;'T is thy sole task, O Queen,</l>
<l n="tr">to weigh thy wish and will. My fealty</l>
<l n="tr">thy high behest obeys. This humble throne</l>
<l n="tr">is of thy gift. Thy smiles for me obtain</l>
<l n="tr">authority from Jove. Thy grace concedes</l>
<l n="tr">my station at your bright Olympian board,</l>
<l n="tr">and gives me lordship of the darkening storm.&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="81" unit="card"/>Replying thus, he smote with spear reversed</l>
<l n="tr">the hollow mountain's wall; then rush the winds</l>
<l n="tr">through that wide breach in long, embattled line,</l>
<l n="tr">and sweep tumultuous from land to land:</l>
<l n="tr">with brooding pinions o'er the waters spread,</l>
<l n="tr">east wind and south, and boisterous Afric gale</l>
<l n="tr">upturn the sea; vast billows shoreward roll;</l>
<l n="tr">the shout of mariners, the creak of cordage,</l>
<l n="tr">follow the shock; low-hanging clouds conceal</l>
<l n="tr">from Trojan eyes all sight of heaven and day;</l>
<l n="tr">night o'er the ocean broods; from sky to sky</l>
<l n="tr">the thunders roll, the ceaseless lightnings glare;</l>
<l n="tr">and all things mean swift death for mortal man.</l>
<l n="tr">Straightway Aeneas, shuddering with amaze,</l>
<l n="tr">groaned loud, upraised both holy hands to Heaven,</l>
<l n="tr">and thus did plead: &ldquo;O thrice and four times blest,</l>
<l n="tr">ye whom your sires and whom the walls of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName></l>
<l n="tr">looked on in your last hour! O bravest son</l>
<l n="tr"><placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> ever bore, Tydides! O that I</l>
<l n="tr">had fallen on Ilian fields, and given this life</l>
<l n="tr">struck down by thy strong hand! where by the spear</l>
<l n="tr">of great Achilles, fiery Hector fell,</l>
<l n="tr">and huge Sarpedon; where the Simois</l>
<l n="tr">in furious flood engulfed and whirled away</l>
<l n="tr">so many helms and shields and heroes slain!&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="102" unit="card"/>While thus he cried to Heaven, a shrieking blast</l>
<l n="tr">smote full upon the sail. Up surged the waves</l>
<l n="tr">to strike the very stars; in fragments flew</l>
<l n="tr">the shattered oars; the helpless vessel veered</l>
<l n="tr">and gave her broadside to the roaring flood,</l>
<l n="tr">where watery mountains rose and burst and fell.</l>
<l n="tr">Now high in air she hangs, then yawning gulfs</l>
<l n="tr">lay bare the shoals and sands o'er which she drives.</l>
<l n="tr">Three ships a whirling south wind snatched and flung</l>
<l n="tr">on hidden rocks,&mdash;altars of sacrifice</l>
<l n="tr">Italians call them, which lie far from shore</l>
<l n="tr">a vast ridge in the sea; three ships beside</l>
<l n="tr">an east wind, blowing landward from the deep,</l>
<l n="tr">drove on the shallows,&mdash;pitiable sight,&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">and girdled them in walls of drifting sand.</l>
<l n="tr">That ship, which, with his friend Orontes, bore</l>
<l n="tr">the Lycian mariners, a great, plunging wave</l>
<l n="tr">struck straight astern, before Aeneas' eyes.</l>
<l n="tr">Forward the steersman rolled and o'er the side</l>
<l n="tr">fell headlong, while three times the circling flood</l>
<l n="tr">spun the light bark through swift engulfing seas.</l>
<l n="tr">Look, how the lonely swimmers breast the wave!</l>
<l n="tr">And on the waste of waters wide are seen</l>
<l n="tr">weapons of war, spars, planks, and treasures rare,</l>
<l n="tr">once <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Ilium</placeName>'s boast, all mingled with the storm.</l>
<l n="tr">Now o'er Achates and Ilioneus,</l>
<l n="tr">now o'er the ship of Abas or Aletes,</l>
<l n="tr">bursts the tempestuous shock; their loosened seams</l>
<l n="tr">yawn wide and yield the angry wave its will.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="124" unit="card"/>Meanwhile how all his smitten ocean moaned,</l>
<l n="tr">and how the tempest's turbulent assault</l>
<l n="tr">had vexed the stillness of his deepest cave,</l>
<l n="tr">great Neptune knew; and with indignant mien</l>
<l n="tr">uplifted o'er the sea his sovereign brow.</l>
<l n="tr">He saw the Teucrian navy scattered far</l>
<l n="tr">along the waters; and Aeneas' men</l>
<l n="tr">o'erwhelmed in mingling shock of wave and sky.</l>
<l n="tr">Saturnian Juno's vengeful stratagem</l>
<l n="tr">her brother's royal glance failed not to see;</l>
<l n="tr">and loud to eastward and to westward calling,</l>
<l n="tr">he voiced this word:<milestone ed="p" n="132" unit="card"/>&ldquo;What pride of birth or power</l>
<l n="tr">is yours, ye winds, that, reckless of my will,</l>
<l n="tr">audacious thus, ye ride through earth and heaven,</l>
<l n="tr">and stir these mountain waves? Such rebels I&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">nay, first I calm this tumult! But yourselves</l>
<l n="tr">by heavier chastisement shall expiate</l>
<l n="tr">hereafter your bold trespass. Haste away</l>
<l n="tr">and bear your king this word! Not unto him</l>
<l n="tr">dominion o'er the seas and trident dread,</l>
<l n="tr">but unto me, Fate gives. Let him possess</l>
<l n="tr">wild mountain crags, thy favored haunt and home,</l>
<l n="tr">O Eurus! In his barbarous mansion there,</l>
<l n="tr">let Aeolus look proud, and play the king</l>
<l n="tr">in yon close-bounded prison-house of storms!&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="142" unit="card"/>He spoke, and swiftlier than his word subdued</l>
<l n="tr">the swelling of the floods; dispersed afar</l>
<l n="tr">th' assembled clouds, and brought back light to heaven.</l>
<l n="tr">Cymothoe then and Triton, with huge toil,</l>
<l n="tr">thrust down the vessels from the sharp-edged reef;</l>
<l n="tr">while, with the trident, the great god's own hand</l>
<l n="tr">assists the task; then, from the sand-strewn shore</l>
<l n="tr">out-ebbing far, he calms the whole wide sea,</l>
<l n="tr">and glides light-wheeled along the crested foam.</l>
<l n="tr">As when, with not unwonted tumult, roars</l>
<l n="tr">in some vast city a rebellious mob,</l>
<l n="tr">and base-born passions in its bosom burn,</l>
<l n="tr">till rocks and blazing torches fill the air</l>
<l n="tr">(rage never lacks for arms)&mdash;if haply then</l>
<l n="tr">some wise man comes, whose reverend looks attest</l>
<l n="tr">a life to duty given, swift silence falls;</l>
<l n="tr">all ears are turned attentive; and he sways</l>
<l n="tr">with clear and soothing speech the people's will.</l>
<l n="tr">So ceased the sea's uproar, when its grave Sire</l>
<l n="tr">looked o'er th' expanse, and, riding on in light,</l>
<l n="tr">flung free rein to his winged obedient car.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="157" unit="card"/>Aeneas' wave-worn crew now landward made,</l>
<l n="tr">and took the nearest passage, whither lay</l>
<l n="tr">the coast of <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>. A haven there</l>
<l n="tr">walled in by bold sides of a rocky isle,</l>
<l n="tr">offers a spacious and secure retreat,</l>
<l n="tr">where every billow from the distant main</l>
<l n="tr">breaks, and in many a rippling curve retires.</l>
<l n="tr">Huge crags and two confronted promontories</l>
<l n="tr">frown heaven-high, beneath whose brows outspread</l>
<l n="tr">the silent, sheltered waters; on the heights</l>
<l n="tr">the bright and glimmering foliage seems to show</l>
<l n="tr">a woodland amphitheatre; and yet higher</l>
<l n="tr">rises a straight-stemmed grove of dense, dark shade.</l>
<l n="tr">Fronting on these a grotto may be seen,</l>
<l n="tr">o'erhung by steep cliffs; from its inmost wall</l>
<l n="tr">clear springs gush out; and shelving seats it has</l>
<l n="tr">of unhewn stone, a place the wood-nymphs love.</l>
<l n="tr">In such a port, a weary ship rides free</l>
<l n="tr">of weight of firm-fluked anchor or strong chain.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="card"/>Hither Aeneas of his scattered fleet</l>
<l n="tr">saving but seven, into harbor sailed;</l>
<l n="tr">with passionate longing for the touch of land,</l>
<l n="tr">forth leap the Trojans to the welcome shore,</l>
<l n="tr">and fling their dripping limbs along the ground.</l>
<l n="tr">Then good Achates smote a flinty stone,</l>
<l n="tr">secured a flashing spark, heaped on light leaves,</l>
<l n="tr">and with dry branches nursed the mounting flame.</l>
<l n="tr">Then Ceres' gift from the corrupting sea</l>
<l n="tr">they bring away; and wearied utterly</l>
<l n="tr">ply Ceres' cunning on the rescued corn,</l>
<l n="tr">and parch in flames, and mill 'twixt two smooth stones.</l>
<l n="tr">Aeneas meanwhile climbed the cliffs, and searched</l>
<l n="tr">the wide sea-prospect; haply Antheus there,</l>
<l n="tr">storm-buffeted, might sail within his ken,</l>
<l n="tr">with biremes, and his Phrygian mariners,</l>
<l n="tr">or Capys or <placeName key="tgn,1121615">Caicus</placeName> armor-clad,</l>
<l n="tr">upon a towering deck. No ship is seen;</l>
<l n="tr">but while he looks, three stags along the shore</l>
<l n="tr">come straying by, and close behind them comes</l>
<l n="tr">the whole herd, browsing through the lowland vale</l>
<l n="tr">in one long line. Aeneas stopped and seized</l>
<l n="tr">his bow and swift-winged arrows, which his friend,</l>
<l n="tr">trusty Achates, close beside him bore.</l>
<l n="tr">His first shafts brought to earth the lordly heads</l>
<l n="tr">of the high-antlered chiefs; his next assailed</l>
<l n="tr">the general herd, and drove them one and all</l>
<l n="tr">in panic through the leafy wood, nor ceased</l>
<l n="tr">the victory of his bow, till on the ground</l>
<l n="tr">lay seven huge forms, one gift for every ship.</l>
<l n="tr">Then back to shore he sped, and to his friends</l>
<l n="tr">distributed the spoil, with that rare wine</l>
<l n="tr">which good Acestes while in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName></l>
<l n="tr">had stored in jars, and prince-like sent away</l>
<l n="tr">with his Ioved guest;&mdash;this too Aeneas gave;</l>
<l n="tr">and with these words their mournful mood consoled.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="198" unit="card"/>&ldquo;Companions mine, we have not failed to feel</l>
<l n="tr">calamity till now. O, ye have borne</l>
<l n="tr">far heavier sorrow: Jove will make an end</l>
<l n="tr">also of this. Ye sailed a course hard by</l>
<l n="tr">infuriate Scylla's howling cliffs and caves.</l>
<l n="tr">Ye knew the Cyclops' crags. Lift up your hearts!</l>
<l n="tr">No more complaint and fear! It well may be</l>
<l n="tr">some happier hour will find this memory fair.</l>
<l n="tr">Through chance and change and hazard without end,</l>
<l n="tr">our goal is <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName>; where our destinies</l>
<l n="tr">beckon to blest abodes, and have ordained</l>
<l n="tr">that <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> shall rise new-born! Have patience all!</l>
<l n="tr">And bide expectantly that golden day.&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="208" unit="card"/>Such was his word, but vexed with grief and care,</l>
<l n="tr">feigned hopes upon his forehead firm he wore,</l>
<l n="tr">and locked within his heart a hero's pain.</l>
<l n="tr">Now round the welcome trophies of his chase</l>

<l n="tr">whose father gave him her first virgin bloom</l>
<l n="tr">in youthful marriage. But the kingly power</l>
<l n="tr">among the Tyrians to her brother came,</l>
<l n="tr">Pygmalion, none deeper dyed in crime</l>
<l n="tr">in all that land. Betwixt these twain there rose</l>
<l n="tr">a deadly hatred,&mdash;and the impious wretch,</l>
<l n="tr">blinded by greed, and reckless utterly</l>
<l n="tr">of his fond sister's joy, did murder foul</l>
<l n="tr">upon defenceless and unarmed Sichaeus,</l>

<l n="tr">Long did he hide the deed, and guilefully</l>
<l n="tr">deceived with false hopes, and empty words,</l>
<l n="tr">her grief and stricken love. But as she slept,</l>
<l n="tr">her husband's tombless ghost before her came,</l>
<l n="tr">with face all wondrous pale, and he laid bare</l>
<l n="tr">his heart with dagger pierced, disclosing so</l>
<l n="tr">the blood-stained altar and the infamy</l>
<l n="tr">that darkened now their house. His counsel was</l>
<l n="tr">to fly, self-banished, from her ruined land,</l>
<l n="tr">and for her journey's aid, he whispered where</l>
<l n="tr">his buried treasure lay, a weight unknown</l>
<l n="tr">of silver and of gold. Thus onward urged,</l>
<l n="tr">Dido, assembling her few trusted friends,</l>
<l n="tr">prepared her flight. There rallied to her cause</l>
<l n="tr">all who did hate and scorn the tyrant king,</l>
<l n="tr">or feared his cruelty. They seized his ships,</l>
<l n="tr">which haply rode at anchor in the bay,</l>
<l n="tr">and loaded them with gold; the hoarded wealth</l>

<l n="tr">There he beheld the citadel of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName></l>
<l n="tr">girt with embattled foes; here, Greeks in flight</l>
<l n="tr">some Trojan onset 'scaped; there, Phrygian bands</l>
<l n="tr">before tall-plumed Achilles' chariot sped.</l>
<l n="tr">The snowy tents of Rhesus spread hard by</l>
<l n="tr">(he sees them through his tears), where Diomed</l>
<l n="tr">in night's first watch burst o'er them unawares</l>
<l n="tr">with bloody havoc and a host of deaths;</l>

<l n="tr">he falls far back, but clutches still the rein;</l>
<l n="tr">his hair and shoulders on the ground go trailing,</l>
<l n="tr">and his down-pointing spear-head scrawls the dust.</l>
<l n="tr">Elsewhere, to Pallas' ever-hostile shrine,</l>

<l n="tr">There too his own presentment he could see</l>

<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="494" unit="card"/>While on such spectacle Aeneas' eyes</l>

<l n="tr">in lovely majesty drew near; a throng</l>
<l n="tr">of youthful followers pressed round her way.</l>
<l n="tr">So by the margin of Eurotas wide</l>
<l n="tr">or o'er the Cynthian steep, Diana leads</l>

<l n="tr">her glow of gracious joy, while she approved</l>

<l n="tr">was cloven, and dissolved in lucent air;</l>

<l n="tr">with echoing voices; from the gilded vault</l>
<l n="tr">far-blazing cressets swing, or torches bright</l>
<l n="tr">drive the dark night away. The Queen herself</l>
<l n="tr">called for her golden chalice studded round</l>
<l n="tr">with jewels, and o'er-brimming it with wine</l>
<l n="tr">as Belus and his proud successors use,</l>
<l n="tr">commanded silence, and this utterance made:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Great Jove, of whom are hospitable laws</l>
<l n="tr">for stranger-guest, may this auspicious day</l>
<l n="tr">bless both our Tyrians and the wanderers</l>
<l n="tr">from Trojan shore. May our posterity</l>
<l n="tr">keep this remembrance! Let kind Juno smile,</l>
<l n="tr">and Bacchus, Iord of mirth, attend us here!</l>
<l n="tr">And, O ye Tyrians, come one and all,</l>
<l n="tr">and with well-omened words our welcome share!&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">So saying, she outpoured the sacred drop</l>
<l n="tr">due to the gods, and lightly from the rim</l>
<l n="tr">sipped the first taste, then unto Bitias gave</l>
<l n="tr">with urgent cheer; he seized it, nothing loth,</l>
<l n="tr">quaffed deep and long the foaming, golden bowl,</l>
<l n="tr">then passed to others. On a gilded Iyre</l>
<l n="tr">the flowing-haired Iopas woke a song</l>
<l n="tr">taught him by famous Atlas: of the moon</l>
<l n="tr">he sang, the wanderer, and what the sun's</l>
<l n="tr">vast labors be; then would his music tell</l>
<l n="tr">whence man and beast were born, and whence were bred</l>
<l n="tr">clouds, lightnings, and Arcturus' stormful sign,</l>
<l n="tr">the Hyades, rain-stars, and nigh the Pole</l>
<l n="tr">the great and lesser Wain; for well he knew</l>
<l n="tr">why colder suns make haste to quench their orb</l>
<l n="tr">in ocean-stream, and wintry nights be slow.</l>
<l n="tr">Loudly the Tyrians their minstrel praised,</l>
<l n="tr">and <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> gave prompt applause. Dido the while</l>
<l n="tr">with varying talk prolonged the fateful night,</l>
<l n="tr">and drank both long and deep of love and wine.</l>
<l n="tr">Now many a tale of Priam would she crave,</l>
<l n="tr">of Hector many; or what radiant arms</l>
<l n="tr">Aurora's son did wear; what were those steeds</l>
<l n="tr">of Diomed, or what the stature seemed</l>
<l n="tr">of great Achilles. &ldquo;Come, illustrious guest,</l>
<l n="tr">begin the tale,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;begin and tell</l>

<l n="tr">If heaven's decree, if our own wills, that hour,</l>

<l n="tr">His firm-set mind flinched not from either goal,&mdash;</l>

<l n="tr">The thronging Trojan youth made haste his way</l>
<l n="tr">from every side, all eager to see close</l>
<l n="tr">their captive's face, and clout with emulous scorn.</l>
<l n="tr">Hear now what Greek deception is, and learn</l>
<l n="tr">from one dark wickedness the whole. For he,</l>
<l n="tr">a mark for every eye, defenceless, dazed,</l>

<l n="tr">Such groans and anguish turned all rage away</l>
<l n="tr">and stayed our lifted hands. We bade him tell</l>
<l n="tr">his birth, his errand, and from whence might be</l>
<l n="tr">such hope of mercy for a foe in chains.</l>
<l n="tr">Then fearing us no more, this speech he dared:</l>

<l n="tr">For Fortune has brought wretched Sinon low;</l>
<l n="tr">but never shall her cruelty impair</l>

<l n="tr">whom by false witness and conspiracy,</l>
<l n="tr">because his counsel was not for this war,</l>

<l n="tr">and now make much lament for him they slew.</l>
<l n="tr">I, his companion, of his kith and kin,</l>

<l n="tr">followed his arms and fortunes from my youth.</l>
<l n="tr">Long as his throne endured, and while he throve</l>

<l n="tr">lived miserably on, lamenting loud</l>

<l n="tr">that if a conqueror home to <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> I came,</l>
<l n="tr">I would avenge. Such words moved wrath, and were</l>
<l n="tr">the first shock of my ruin; from that hour,</l>
<l n="tr">Ulysses whispered slander and alarm;</l>
<l n="tr">breathed doubt and malice into all men's ears,</l>
<l n="tr">and darkly plotted how to strike his blow.</l>
<l n="tr">Nor rest had he, till Calchas, as his tool,-</l>

<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="card"/>We ply him then with passionate appeal</l>
<l n="tr">and question all his cause: of guilt so dire</l>
<l n="tr">or such Greek guile we harbored not the thought.</l>
<l n="tr">So on he prates, with well-feigned grief and fear,</l>
<l n="tr">and from his Iying heart thus told his tale:</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Full oft the Greeks had fain achieved their flight,</l>
<l n="tr">and raised the Trojan siege, and sailed away</l>
<l n="tr">war-wearied quite. O, would it had been so!</l>
<l n="tr">Full oft the wintry tumult of the seas</l>
<l n="tr">did wall them round, and many a swollen storm</l>
<l n="tr">their embarcation stayed. But chiefly when,</l>
<l n="tr">all fitly built of beams of maple fair,</l>
<l n="tr">this horse stood forth,&mdash; what thunders filled the skies!</l>
<l n="tr">With anxious fears we sent Eurypylus</l>
<l n="tr">to ask Apollo's word; and from the shrine</l>
<l n="tr">he brings the sorrowful commandment home:</l>
<l n="tr">&lsquo;By flowing blood and by a virgin slain</l>
<l n="tr">the wild winds were appeased, when first ye came,</l>
<l n="tr">ye sons of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Ilium</placeName>'s distant shore.</l>
<l n="tr">Through blood ye must return. Let some Greek life</l>
<l n="tr">your expiation be.&rsquo; The popular ear</l>
<l n="tr">the saying caught, all spirits were dimmed o'er;</l>
<l n="tr">cold doubt and horror through each bosom ran,</l>
<l n="tr">asking what fate would do, and on what wretch</l>
<l n="tr">Apollo's choice would fall. Ulysses, then,</l>
<l n="tr">amid the people's tumult and acclaim,</l>
<l n="tr">thrust Calchas forth, some prophecy to tell</l>
<l n="tr">to all the throng: he asked him o'er and o'er</l>
<l n="tr">what Heaven desired. Already not a few</l>
<l n="tr">foretold the murderous plot, and silently</l>
<l n="tr">watched the dark doom upon my life impend.</l>
<l n="tr">Twice five long days the seer his lips did seal,</l>
<l n="tr">and hid himself, refusing to bring forth</l>
<l n="tr"> His word of guile, and name what wretch should die.</l>
<l n="tr">At last, reluctant, and all loudly urged</l>
<l n="tr"> By false Ulysses, he fulfils their plot,</l>
<l n="tr">and, lifting up his voice oracular,</l>
<l n="tr">points out myself the victim to be slain.</l>
<l n="tr">Nor did one voice oppose. The mortal stroke</l>
<l n="tr">horribly hanging o'er each coward head</l>
<l n="tr">was changed to one man's ruin, and their hearts</l>
<l n="tr">endured it well. Soon rose th' accursed morn;</l>
<l n="tr">the bloody ritual was ready; salt</l>
<l n="tr">was sprinkled on the sacred loaf; my brows</l>
<l n="tr">were bound with fillets for the offering.</l>
<l n="tr">But I escaped that death&mdash;yes! I deny not!</l>
<l n="tr">I cast my fetters off, and darkling lay</l>
<l n="tr">concealed all night in lake-side sedge and mire,</l>
<l n="tr">awaiting their departure, if perchance</l>
<l n="tr">they should in truth set sail. But nevermore</l>
<l n="tr">shall my dear, native country greet these eyes.</l>
<l n="tr">No more my father or my tender babes</l>
<l n="tr">shall I behold. Nay, haply their own lives</l>
<l n="tr">are forfeit, when my foemen take revenge</l>
<l n="tr">for my escape, and slay those helpless ones,</l>

<l n="tr">O, by yon powers in heaven which witness truth,</l>
<l n="tr">by aught in this dark world remaining now</l>
<l n="tr">of spotless human faith and innocence,</l>
<l n="tr">I do implore thee look with pitying eye</l>
<l n="tr">on these long sufferings my heart hath borne.</l>
<l n="tr">O, pity! I deserve not what I bear.&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="card"/>Pity and pardon to his tears we gave,</l>
<l n="tr">and spared his life. King Priam bade unbind</l>
<l n="tr">the fettered hands and loose those heavy chains</l>
<l n="tr">that pressed him sore; then with benignant mien</l>
<l n="tr">addressed him thus: &ldquo; Whate'er thy place or name,</l>
<l n="tr">forget the people thou hast Iost, and be</l>
<l n="tr">henceforth our countryman. But tell me true!</l>
<l n="tr">What means the monstrous fabric of this horse?</l>
<l n="tr">Who made it? Why? What offering to Heaven,</l>
<l n="tr">or engin'ry of conquest may it be?&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">He spake; and in reply, with skilful guile,</l>
<l n="tr">Greek that he was! the other lifted up</l>
<l n="tr">his hands, now freed and chainless, to the skies:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;O ever-burning and inviolate fires,</l>
<l n="tr">witness my word! O altars and sharp steel,</l>
<l n="tr">whose curse I fled, O fillets of the gods,</l>
<l n="tr">which bound a victim's helpless forehead, hear!</l>
<l n="tr">'T is lawful now to break the oath that gave</l>
<l n="tr">my troth to <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>. To execrate her kings</l>
<l n="tr">is now my solemn duty. Their whole plot</l>
<l n="tr">I publish to the world. No fatherland</l>
<l n="tr">and no allegiance binds me any more.</l>
<l n="tr">O Troy, whom I have saved, I bid thee keep</l>
<l n="tr">the pledge of safety by good Priam given,</l>
<l n="tr">for my true tale shall my rich ransom be.</l>
<l n="tr">The Greeks' one hope, since first they opened war,</l>
<l n="tr">was Pallas, grace and power. But from the day</l>
<l n="tr">when Diomed, bold scorner of the gods,</l>
<l n="tr">and false Ulysses, author of all guile,</l>
<l n="tr">rose up and violently bore away</l>
<l n="tr">Palladium, her holy shrine, hewed down</l>
<l n="tr">the sentinels of her acropolis,</l>
<l n="tr">and with polluted, gory hands dared touch</l>
<l n="tr">the goddess, virgin fillets, white and pure,&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">thenceforth, I say, the courage of the Greeks</l>
<l n="tr">ebbed utterly away; their strength was Iost,</l>
<l n="tr">and favoring Pallas all her grace withdrew.</l>
<l n="tr">No dubious sign she gave. Scarce had they set</l>
<l n="tr">her statue in our camp, when glittering flame</l>
<l n="tr">flashed from the staring eyes; from all its limbs</l>
<l n="tr">salt sweat ran forth; three times (O wondrous tale!)</l>
<l n="tr">it gave a sudden skyward leap, and made</l>
<l n="tr">prodigious trembling of her lance and shield.</l>
<l n="tr">The prophet Calchas bade us straightway take</l>
<l n="tr">swift flight across the sea; for fate had willed</l>
<l n="tr">the Trojan citadel should never fall</l>
<l n="tr">by Grecian arm, till once more they obtain</l>
<l n="tr">new oracles at <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, and restore</l>
<l n="tr">that god the round ships hurried o'er the sea.</l>
<l n="tr">Now in <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName>, whither they are fled,</l>
<l n="tr">new help of heaven they find, and forge anew</l>
<l n="tr">the means of war. Back hither o'er the waves</l>
<l n="tr">they suddenly will come. So Calchas gave</l>
<l n="tr">the meaning of the god. Warned thus, they reared</l>
<l n="tr">in place of Pallas, desecrated shrine</l>
<l n="tr">yon image of the horse, to expiate</l>
<l n="tr">the woeful sacrilege. Calchas ordained</l>
<l n="tr">that they should build a thing of monstrous size</l>
<l n="tr">of jointed beams, and rear it heavenward,</l>
<l n="tr">so might it never pass your gates, nor come</l>
<l n="tr">inside your walls, nor anywise restore</l>
<l n="tr">unto the Trojans their lost help divine.</l>
<l n="tr">For had your hands Minerva's gift profaned,</l>
<l n="tr">a ruin horrible&mdash;O, may the gods</l>
<l n="tr">bring it on Calchas rather!&mdash;would have come</l>
<l n="tr">on Priam's throne and all the Phrygian power.</l>
<l n="tr">But if your hands should lift the holy thing</l>
<l n="tr">to your own citadel, then <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>'s host</l>
<l n="tr">would hurl aggression upon Pelops' land,</l>
<l n="tr">and all that curse on our own nation fall.&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="card"/>Thus Sinon's guile and practiced perjury</l>
<l n="tr">our doubt dispelled. His stratagems and tears</l>
<l n="tr">wrought victory where neither Tydeus' son,</l>
<l n="tr">nor mountain-bred Achilles could prevail,</l>
<l n="tr">nor ten years' war, nor fleets a thousand strong.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But now a vaster spectacle of fear</l>
<l n="tr">burst over us, to vex our startled souls.</l>
<l n="tr">Laocoon, that day by cast of lot</l>
<l n="tr">priest unto Neptune, was in act to slay</l>
<l n="tr">a huge bull at the god's appointed fane.</l>
<l n="tr">Lo! o'er the tranquil deep from Tenedos</l>
<l n="tr">appeared a pair (I shudder as I tell)</l>
<l n="tr">of vastly coiling serpents, side by side,</l>
<l n="tr">stretching along the waves, and to the shore</l>
<l n="tr">taking swift course; their necks were lifted high,</l>
<l n="tr">their gory dragon-crests o'ertopped the waves;</l>
<l n="tr">all else, half seen, trailed low along the sea;</l>
<l n="tr">while with loud cleavage of the foaming brine</l>
<l n="tr">their monstrous backs wound forward fold on fold.</l>
<l n="tr">Soon they made land; the furious bright eyes</l>
<l n="tr">glowed with ensanguined fire; their quivering tongues</l>
<l n="tr">lapped hungrily the hissing, gruesome jaws.</l>
<l n="tr">All terror-pale we fled. Unswerving then</l>
<l n="tr">the monsters to Laocoon made way.</l>
<l n="tr">First round the tender limbs of his two sons</l>
<l n="tr">each dragon coiled, and on the shrinking flesh</l>
<l n="tr">fixed fast and fed. Then seized they on the sire,</l>
<l n="tr">who flew to aid, a javelin in his hand,</l>
<l n="tr">embracing close in bondage serpentine</l>
<l n="tr">twice round the waist; and twice in scaly grasp</l>
<l n="tr">around his neck, and o'er him grimly peered</l>
<l n="tr">with lifted head and crest; he, all the while,</l>
<l n="tr">his holy fillet fouled with venomous blood,</l>
<l n="tr">tore at his fetters with a desperate hand,</l>
<l n="tr">and lifted up such agonizing voice,</l>
<l n="tr">as when a bull, death-wounded, seeks to flee</l>
<l n="tr">the sacrificial altar, and thrusts back</l>
<l n="tr">from his doomed head the ill-aimed, glancing blade.</l>
<l n="tr">then swiftly writhed the dragon-pair away</l>
<l n="tr">unto the templed height, and in the shrine</l>
<l n="tr">of cruel Pallas sure asylum found</l>
<l n="tr">beneath the goddess' feet and orbed shield.</l>
<l n="tr">Such trembling horror as we ne'er had known</l>

<l n="tr">By Panthus' word and by some god impelled,</l>

<l n="tr">Cassandra madly, and had made a league</l>

<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="347" unit="card"/>When these I saw close-gathered for the fight,</l>

<l n="tr">Yet not alone was Teucrian blood required:</l>

<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="card"/>Androgeos, followed by a thronging band</l>

<l n="tr">Others bear off the captives and the spoil</l>

<l n="tr">He spoke; but straightway, when no safe reply</l>
<l n="tr">returned, he knew himself entrapped, and fallen</l>
<l n="tr">into a foeman's snare; struck dumb was he</l>
<l n="tr">and stopped both word and motion; as one steps,</l>
<l n="tr">when blindly treading a thick path of thorns,</l>
<l n="tr">upon a snake, and sick with fear would flee</l>
<l n="tr">that lifted wrath and swollen gorge of green:</l>
<l n="tr">so trembling did Androgeos backward fall.</l>
<l n="tr">At them we flew and closed them round with war;</l>
<l n="tr">and since they could not know the ground, and fear </l>
<l n="tr">had whelmed them quite, we swiftly laid them low.</l>
<l n="tr">Thus Fortune on our first achievement smiled;</l>
<l n="tr">and, flushed with victory, Cormbus cried:</l>

<l n="tr">down to the dark we hurled. Some fled away,</l>
<l n="tr">seeking their safe ships and the friendly shore.</l>
<l n="tr">Some cowards foul went clambering back again</l>
<l n="tr">to that vast horse and hid them in its maw.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="402" unit="card"/>But woe is me! If gods their help withhold,</l>

<l n="tr">But, at this point, the overwhelming spears</l>

<l n="tr">from a high temple-tower; and carnage wild</l>
<l n="tr">ensued, because of the Greek arms we bore</l>
<l n="tr">and our false crests. The howling Grecian band,</l>
<l n="tr">crazed by Cassandra's rescue, charged at us</l>
<l n="tr">from every side; Ajax of savage soul,</l>
<l n="tr">the sons of Atreus, and that whole wild horde</l>

<l n="tr">the dark deep of the sea. All who did hide</l>

<l n="tr">our shields and borrowed arms, and clearly note</l>
<l n="tr">our speech of alien sound; their multitude</l>

<l n="tr">at mailed Minerva's altar prostrate lay,</l>
<l n="tr">pierced by Peneleus, blade; then Rhipeus fell;</l>
<l n="tr">we deemed him of all Trojans the most just, </l>
<l n="tr">most scrupulously righteous; but the gods</l>
<l n="tr">gave judgment otherwise. There Dymas died,</l>
<l n="tr">and Hypanis, by their compatriots slain;</l>
<l n="tr">nor thee, O Panthus, in that mortal hour,</l>

<l n="tr">Straightway the roar and tumult summoned us</l>

<l n="tr">This way to climb the palace roof I flew,</l>

<l n="tr">Huge Periphas was there; Automedon,</l>

<l n="tr">Then Scyros' island-warriors assault</l>
<l n="tr">the palaces, and hurl reiterate fire</l>
<l n="tr">at wall and tower. Pyrrhus led the van;</l>
<l n="tr">seizing an axe he clove the ponderous doors</l>
<l n="tr">and rent the hinges from their posts of bronze;</l>
<l n="tr">he cut the beams, and through the solid mass</l>
<l n="tr">burrowed his way, till like a window huge</l>
<l n="tr">the breach yawned wide, and opened to his gaze</l>

<l n="tr">Confusion, groans, and piteous turmoil</l>
<l n="tr">were in that dwelling; women shrieked and wailed</l>
<l n="tr">from many a dark retreat, and their loud cry</l>
<l n="tr">rang to the golden stars. Through those vast halls</l>
<l n="tr">the panic-stricken mothers wildly roved,</l>
<l n="tr">and clung with frantic kisses and embrace</l>
<l n="tr">unto the columns cold. Fierce as his sire,</l>
<l n="tr">Pyrrhus moves on; nor bar nor sentinel</l>
<l n="tr">may stop his way; down tumbles the great door</l>
<l n="tr">beneath the battering beam, and with it fall</l>
<l n="tr">hinges and framework violently torn.</l>
<l n="tr">Force bursts all bars; th' assailing Greeks break in,</l>

<l n="tr">My own eyes looked on Neoptolemus</l>

<l n="tr">of broidered cunning and barbaric gold,</l>

<l n="tr">Like panic-stricken doves in some dark storm,</l>
<l n="tr">close-gathering they sate, and in despair</l>
<l n="tr">embraced their graven gods. But when the Queen</l>
<l n="tr">saw Priam with his youthful harness on, </l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;What frenzy, O my wretched lord,&rdquo; she cried,</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Arrayed thee in such arms? O, whither now?</l>
<l n="tr">Not such defences, nor such arm as thine,</l>
<l n="tr">the time requires, though thy companion were</l>
<l n="tr">our Hector's self. O, yield thee, I implore!</l>
<l n="tr">This altar now shall save us one and all,</l>
<l n="tr">or we must die together.&rdquo; With these words</l>
<l n="tr">she drew him to her side, and near the shrine</l>
<l n="tr">made for her aged spouse a place to cling.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="526" unit="card"/>But, lo! just 'scaped of Pyrrhus' murderous hand,</l>
<l n="tr">Polites, one of Priam's sons, fled fast</l>
<l n="tr">along the corridors, through thronging foes</l>
<l n="tr">and a thick rain of spears. Wildly he gazed</l>
<l n="tr">across the desolate halls, wounded to death.</l>
<l n="tr">Fierce Pyrrhus followed after, pressing hard</l>
<l n="tr">with mortal stroke, and now his hand and spear</l>
<l n="tr">were close upon:&mdash; when the lost youth leaped forth</l>
<l n="tr">into his father's sight, and prostrate there</l>
<l n="tr">lay dying, while his life-blood ebbed away.</l>
<l n="tr">Then Priam, though on all sides death was nigh,</l>
<l n="tr">quit not the strife, nor from loud wrath refrained:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Thy crime and impious outrage, may the gods</l>
<l n="tr">(if Heaven to mortals render debt and due)</l>
<l n="tr">justly reward and worthy honors pay!</l>
<l n="tr">My own son's murder thou hast made me see,</l>
<l n="tr">blood and pollution impiously throwing</l>
<l n="tr">upon a father's head. Not such was he,</l>
<l n="tr">not such, Achilles, thy pretended sire,</l>
<l n="tr">when Priam was his foe. With flush of shame</l>
<l n="tr">he nobly listened to a suppliant's plea</l>
<l n="tr">in honor made. He rendered to the tomb</l>
<l n="tr">my Hector's body pale, and me did send</l>
<l n="tr">back to my throne a king.&rdquo; With this proud word</l>
<l n="tr">the aged warrior hurled with nerveless arm</l>
<l n="tr">his ineffectual spear, which hoarsely rang</l>
<l n="tr">rebounding on the brazen shield, and hung</l>
<l n="tr">piercing the midmost boss,- but all in vain.</l>
<l n="tr">Then Pyrrhus: &ldquo;Take these tidings, and convey</l>
<l n="tr">message to my father, Peleus' son!</l>
<l n="tr">tell him my naughty deeds! Be sure and say</l>
<l n="tr">how Neoptolemus hath shamed his sires.</l>
<l n="tr">Now die!&rdquo; With this, he trailed before the shrines</l>
<l n="tr">the trembling King, whose feet slipped in the stream</l>
<l n="tr">of his son's blood. Then Pyrrhus' left hand clutched</l>
<l n="tr">the tresses old and gray; a glittering sword</l>
<l n="tr">his right hand lifted high, and buried it</l>
<l n="tr">far as the hilt in that defenceless heart.</l>
<l n="tr">So Priam's story ceased. Such final doom</l>
<l n="tr">fell on him, while his dying eyes surveyed</l>

<l n="tr">in mortal agony; a vision too</l>
<l n="tr">of lost Creusa at my ravaged hearth,</l>

<l n="tr">looked round me seeking aid. But all were fled,</l>
<l n="tr">war-wearied and undone; some earthward leaped</l>

<l n="tr">came rolling o'er the main, and mountain-high</l>
<l n="tr">the wreckful surges rose; our ships were hurled</l>

<l n="tr">swept the dark waves and tossed the crested foam.</l>
<l n="tr">From such sea-peril safe, I made the shores</l>

<l n="tr">down from the high hills swooping horribly,</l>
<l n="tr">the Harpies loudly shrieking, flapped their wings,</l>
<l n="tr">snatched at our meats, and with infectious touch</l>

<l n="tr">Once more from haunts unknown the clamorous flock</l>

<l n="tr">Celaeno only on a beetling crag</l>

<l n="tr">&ldquo;Because of slaughtered kine and ravished herd,</l>

<l n="tr">and she was seen no more. But all my band</l>
<l n="tr">shuddered with shock of fear in each cold vein;</l>
<l n="tr">their drooping spirits trusted swords no more,</l>
<l n="tr">but turned to prayers and offerings, asking grace,</l>
<l n="tr">scarce knowing if those creatures were divine,</l>
<l n="tr">or but vast birds, ill-omened and unclean.</l>
<l n="tr">Father Anchises to the gods in heaven</l>
<l n="tr">uplifted suppliant hands, and on that shore</l>

<l n="tr">Smile, Heaven, upon your faithful votaries.&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">Then bade he launch away, the chain undo,</l>
<l n="tr">set every cable free and spread all sail.</l>
<l n="tr">O'er the white waves we flew, and took our way</l>

<l n="tr">Now forest-clad <placeName key="tgn,7011374">Zacynthus</placeName> met our gaze,</l>

<l n="tr">that called <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName> king, and flung our curse</l>

<l n="tr">nigh hoar Leucate's clouded crest we drew,</l>
<l n="tr">where Phoebus' temple, feared by mariners,</l>
<l n="tr">loomed o'er us; thitherward we steered and reached</l>
<l n="tr">the little port and town. Our weary fleet</l>
<l n="tr">dropped anchor, and lay beached along the strand.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="278" unit="card"/>So, safe at land, our hopeless peril past,</l>

<l n="tr">My youth, anointing their smooth, naked limbs,</l>

<l n="tr">and 'scaped our circling foes. Now had the sun</l>
<l n="tr">rolled through the year's full circle, and the waves</l>
<l n="tr">were rough with icy winter's northern gales.</l>
<l n="tr">I hung for trophy on that temple door</l>
<l n="tr">a swelling shield of brass (which once was worn</l>
<l n="tr">by mighty Abas) graven with this line:</l>

<l n="tr">Then from that haven I command them forth;</l>
<l n="tr">my good crews take the thwarts, smiting the sea</l>

<l n="tr">Soon sank Phaeacia's wind-swept citadels</l>

<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="294" unit="card"/>Here wondrous tidings met us, that the son</l>

<l n="tr">o'er many <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> cities, having wed</l>
<l n="tr">the Queen of Pyrrhus, great Achilles' son,</l>

<l n="tr">Amazement held me; all my bosom burned</l>
<l n="tr">to see the hero's face and hear this tale</l>

<l n="tr">leaving the haven, fleet, and friendly shore.</l>
<l n="tr">That self-same hour outside the city walls,</l>
<l n="tr">within a grove where flowed the mimic stream</l>
<l n="tr">of a new Simois, Andromache,</l>
<l n="tr">with offerings to the dead, and gifts of woe,</l>
<l n="tr">poured forth libation, and invoked the shade</l>
<l n="tr">of Hector, at a tomb which her fond grief</l>
<l n="tr">had consecrated to perpetual tears,</l>
<l n="tr">though void; a mound of fair green turf it stood,</l>
<l n="tr">and near it rose twin altars to his name.</l>
<l n="tr">She saw me drawing near; our Trojan helms</l>

<l n="tr">Of truth, O goddess-born? Art still in flesh?</l>
<l n="tr">Or if sweet light be fled, my Hector, where?&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">With flood of tears she spoke, and all the grove</l>
<l n="tr">reechoed to her cry. Scarce could I frame</l>
<l n="tr">brief answer to her passion, but replied</l>
<l n="tr">with broken voice and accents faltering:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;I live, 't is true. I lengthen out my days</l>

<l n="tr">Alas! what lot is thine, that wert unthroned</l>
<l n="tr">from such a husband's side? What after-fate</l>
<l n="tr">could give thee honor due? Andromache,</l>

<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="card"/>With drooping brows and lowly voice she cried :</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;O, happy only was that virgin blest,</l>

<l n="tr">in sight of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Ilium</placeName>, on a foeman's tomb!</l>
<l n="tr">No casting of the lot her doom decreed,</l>
<l n="tr">nor came she to her conqueror's couch a slave.</l>
<l n="tr">Myself from burning <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Ilium</placeName> carried far</l>
<l n="tr">o'er seas and seas, endured the swollen pride</l>
<l n="tr">of that young scion of Achilles' race,</l>
<l n="tr">and bore him as his slave a son. When he</l>
<l n="tr">sued for Hermione, of Leda's line,</l>
<l n="tr">and nuptial-bond with Lacedaemon's Iords,</l>
<l n="tr">I, the slave-wife, to Helenus was given,</l>
<l n="tr">and slave was wed with slave. But afterward</l>
<l n="tr">Orestes, crazed by loss of her he loved,</l>
<l n="tr">and ever fury-driven from crime to crime,</l>
<l n="tr">crept upon Pyrrhus in a careless hour</l>
<l n="tr">and murdered him upon his own hearth-stone.</l>
<l n="tr">Part of the realm of Neoptolemus</l>
<l n="tr">fell thus to Helenus, who called his lands</l>
<l n="tr">Chaonian, and in Trojan Chaon's name</l>
<l n="tr">his kingdom is Chaonia. Yonder height</l>
<l n="tr">is <placeName key="perseus,Pergamon">Pergamus</placeName>, our Ilian citadel.</l>
<l n="tr">What power divine did waft thee to our shore,</l>
<l n="tr">not knowing whither? Tell me of the boy</l>
<l n="tr">Ascanius! Still breathes he earthly air?</l>
<l n="tr">In <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> she bore him&mdash;is he mourning still</l>
<l n="tr">that mother ravished from his childhood's eyes?</l>
<l n="tr">what ancient valor stirs the manly soul</l>
<l n="tr">of thine own son, of Hector's sister's child?&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">Thus poured she forth full many a doleful word</l>
<l n="tr">with unavailing tears. But as she ceased,</l>
<l n="tr">out of the city gates appeared the son</l>
<l n="tr">of Priam, Helenus, with princely train.</l>
<l n="tr">He welcomed us as kin, and glad at heart</l>
<l n="tr">gave guidance to his house, though oft his words</l>
<l n="tr">fell faltering and few, with many a tear.</l>
<l n="tr">Soon to a humbler <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> I lift my eyes,</l>
<l n="tr">and of a mightier <placeName key="perseus,Pergamon">Pergamus</placeName> discern</l>
<l n="tr">the towering semblance; there a scanty stream</l>
<l n="tr">runs on in <placeName key="perseus,Xanthos">Xanthus</placeName>' name, and my glad arms</l>
<l n="tr">the pillars of a Scaean gate embrace.</l>
<l n="tr">My Teucrian mariners with welcome free</l>
<l n="tr">enjoyed the friendly town; his ample halls</l>
<l n="tr">our royal host threw wide; full wine-cups flowed</l>
<l n="tr">within the palace; golden feast was spread,</l>
<l n="tr">and many a goblet quaffed. <milestone ed="p" n="356" unit="card"/>Day followed day,</l>
<l n="tr">while favoring breezes beckoned us to sea,</l>
<l n="tr">and swelled the waiting canvas as they blew.</l>
<l n="tr">Then to the prophet-priest I made this prayer:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Offspring of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, interpreter of Heaven!</l>
<l n="tr">Who knowest Phoebus' power, and readest well</l>
<l n="tr">the tripod, stars, and vocal laurel leaves</l>
<l n="tr">to Phoebus dear, who know'st of every bird</l>
<l n="tr">the ominous swift wing or boding song,</l>
<l n="tr">o, speak! For all my course good omens showed,</l>
<l n="tr">and every god admonished me to sail</l>
<l n="tr">in quest of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>'s far-distant shores;</l>
<l n="tr">but lone Celaeno, heralding strange woe,</l>
<l n="tr">foretold prodigious horror, vengeance dark,</l>
<l n="tr">and vile, unnatural hunger. How elude</l>
<l n="tr">such perils? Or by what hard duty done</l>
<l n="tr">may such huge host of evils vanquished be?&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">Then Helenus, with sacrifice of kine</l>
<l n="tr">in order due, implored the grace of Heaven,</l>
<l n="tr">unloosed the fillets from his sacred brow,</l>
<l n="tr">and led me, Phoebus, to thy temple's door,</l>
<l n="tr">awed by th' o'er-brooding godhead, whose true priest,</l>
<l n="tr">with lips inspired, made this prophetic song:</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="374" unit="card"/>&ldquo;O goddess-born, indubitably shines</l>
<l n="tr">the blessing of great gods upon thy path</l>
<l n="tr">across the sea; the heavenly King supreme</l>
<l n="tr">thy destiny ordains; 't is he unfolds</l>
<l n="tr">the grand vicissitude, which now pursues</l>
<l n="tr">a course immutable. I will declare</l>
<l n="tr">of thy large fate a certain bounded part;</l>
<l n="tr">that fearless thou may'st view the friendly sea,</l>

<l n="tr">a milk-white, monstrous sow, with teeming brood</l>

<l n="tr">all clustering at her teats, as prone she lies.</l>
<l n="tr">There is thy city's safe, predestined ground,</l>
<l n="tr">and there thy labors' end. Vex not thy heart</l>
<l n="tr">about those &lsquo;tables bitten&rsquo;, for kind fate</l>
<l n="tr">thy path will show, and Phoebus bless thy prayer.</l>
<l n="tr">But from these lands and yon Italian shore,</l>
<l n="tr">where from this sea of ours the tide sweeps in,</l>
<l n="tr">escape and flee, for all its cities hold</l>
<l n="tr">pernicious Greeks, thy foes: the <placeName key="perseus,Locri">Locri</placeName> there</l>

<l n="tr">Yea, even when thy fleet has crossed the main,</l>
<l n="tr">and from new altars built along the shore</l>
<l n="tr">thy vows to Heaven are paid, throw o'er thy head</l>
<l n="tr">a purple mantle, veiling well thy brows,</l>
<l n="tr">lest, while the sacrificial fire ascends</l>
<l n="tr">in offering to the gods, thine eye behold</l>

<l n="tr">Let all thy people keep this custom due,</l>

<l n="tr">After departing hence, thou shalt be blown</l>

<l n="tr">Likewise Andromache in mournful guise</l>

<l n="tr">and speed them home. Now places in the line</l>
<l n="tr">are given by lot. Upon the lofty sterns</l>
<l n="tr">the captains ride, in beautiful array</l>
<l n="tr">of Tyriao purple and far-flaming gold;</l>
<l n="tr">the crews are poplar-crowned, the shoulders bare</l>
<l n="tr">rubbed well with glittering oil; their straining arms</l>
<l n="tr">make long reach to the oar, as on the thwarts</l>
<l n="tr">they sit attentive, listening for the call</l>
<l n="tr">of the loud trumpet; while with pride and fear</l>
<l n="tr">their hot hearts throb, impassioned for renown.</l>
<l n="tr">Soon pealed the signal clear; from all the line</l>
<l n="tr">instant the galleys bounded, and the air</l>
<l n="tr">rang to the rowers, shouting, while their arms</l>
<l n="tr">pulled every inch and flung the waves in foam;</l>
<l n="tr">deep cut the rival strokes; the surface fair</l>
<l n="tr">yawned wide beneath their blades and cleaving keels.</l>
<l n="tr">Not swifter scour the chariots o'er the plain,</l>
<l n="tr">sped headlong from the line behind their teams</l>
<l n="tr">of mated coursers, while each driver shakes</l>
<l n="tr">loose, rippling reins above his plunging pairs,</l>
<l n="tr">and o'er the lash leans far. With loud applause</l>
<l n="tr">vociferous and many an urgent cheer</l>
<l n="tr">the woodlands rang, and all the concave shores</l>
<l n="tr">back from the mountains took the Trojan cry</l>
<l n="tr">in answering song. <milestone ed="p" n="151" unit="card"/>Forth-flying from his peers,</l>
<l n="tr">while all the crowd acclaims, sped Gyas' keel</l>
<l n="tr">along the outmost wave. Cloanthus next</l>
<l n="tr">pushed hard upon, with stronger stroke of oars</l>
<l n="tr">but heavier ship. At equal pace behind</l>
<l n="tr">the Pristis and the Centaur fiercely strive</l>
<l n="tr">for the third place. Now Pristis seems to lead,</l>
<l n="tr">now mightier Centaur past her flies, then both</l>
<l n="tr">ride on together, prow with prow, and cleave</l>
<l n="tr">long lines of foaming furrow with swift keels.</l>
<l n="tr">Soon near the rock they drew, and either ship</l>
<l n="tr">was making goal,&mdash;when Gyas, in the lead, </l>
<l n="tr">and winner of the half-course, Ioudly hailed</l>
<l n="tr">menoetes, the ship's pilot: &ldquo;Why so far</l>
<l n="tr">to starboard, we? Keep her head round this way!</l>
<l n="tr">Hug shore! Let every oar-blade almost graze</l>
<l n="tr">that reef to larboard! Let the others take</l>
<l n="tr">the deep-sea course outside!&rdquo; But while he spoke,</l>
<l n="tr">Menoetes, dreading unknown rocks below,</l>
<l n="tr">veered off to open sea. &ldquo;Why steer so wide?</l>
<l n="tr">Round to the rock, Menoetes!&rdquo; Gyas roared, &mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">again in vain, for looking back he saw</l>
<l n="tr">cloanthus hard astern, and ever nearer,</l>
<l n="tr">who, in a trice, betwixt the booming reef</l>
<l n="tr">and Gyas' galley, lightly forward thrust</l>
<l n="tr">the beak of Scylla to the inside course,</l>
<l n="tr">and, quickly taking lead, flew past the goal</l>
<l n="tr">to the smooth seas beyond. Then wrathful grief</l>
<l n="tr">flamed in the warrior's heart, nor was his cheek</l>
<l n="tr">unwet with tears; and, reckless utterly</l>
<l n="tr">of his own honor and his comrades, lives,</l>
<l n="tr">he hurled poor, slack Menoetes from the poop</l>
<l n="tr">headlong upon the waters, while himself,</l>
<l n="tr">pilot and master both, the helm assuming,</l>
<l n="tr">urged on his crew, and landward took his way.</l>
<l n="tr">But now, with heavy limbs that hardly won</l>
<l n="tr">his rescue from the deep, engulfing wave,</l>
<l n="tr">up the rude rock graybeard Menoetes climbed</l>
<l n="tr">with garment dripping wet, and there dropped down</l>
<l n="tr">upon the cliff's dry top. With laughter loud</l>
<l n="tr">the Trojan crews had watched him plunging, swimming,</l>
<l n="tr">and now to see his drink of bitter brine</l>
<l n="tr">spewed on the ground, the sailors laughed again.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="183" unit="card"/>But Mnestheus and Sergestus, coming last,</l>
<l n="tr">have joyful hope enkindled in each heart</l>
<l n="tr">to pass the laggard Gyas. In the lead</l>
<l n="tr">Sergestus' ship shoots forth; and to the rock</l>
<l n="tr">runs boldly nigh; but not his whole long keel</l>
<l n="tr">may pass his rival; the projecting beak</l>
<l n="tr">is followed fast by Pristis' emulous prow.</l>
<l n="tr">Then, striding straight amidships through his crew,</l>
<l n="tr">thus Mnestheus urged them on: &ldquo;O Hector's friends!</l>
<l n="tr">Whom in the dying hours of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> I chose</l>
<l n="tr">for followers! Now stand ye to your best!</l>
<l n="tr">Put forth the thews of valor that ye showed</l>
<l n="tr">in the Gaetulian Syrtes, or that sea</l>
<l n="tr">Ionian, or where the waves race by</l>
<l n="tr">the Malean promontory! Mnestheus now</l>
<l n="tr">hopes not to be the first, nor do I strive</l>
<l n="tr">for victory. O Father Neptune, give</l>
<l n="tr">that garland where thou wilt! But O, the shame</l>
<l n="tr">if we are last! Endure it not, my men!</l>
<l n="tr">The infamy refuse!&rdquo; So, bending low,</l>
<l n="tr">they enter the home-stretch. Beneath their stroke</l>
<l n="tr">the brass-decked galley throbs, and under her</l>
<l n="tr">the sea-floor drops away. On, on they fly!</l>
<l n="tr">Parched are the panting lips, and sweat in streams</l>
<l n="tr">pours down their giant sides; but lucky chance</l>
<l n="tr">brought the proud heroes what their honor craved.</l>
<l n="tr">For while Sergestus furiously drove</l>
<l n="tr">his ship's beak toward the rock, and kept inside</l>
<l n="tr">the scanty passage, by his evil star</l>
<l n="tr">he grounded on the jutting reef; the cliffs</l>
<l n="tr">rang with the blow, and his entangled oars</l>
<l n="tr">grated along the jagged granite, while</l>
<l n="tr">the prow hung wrecked and helpless. With loud cry</l>
<l n="tr">upsprang the sailors, while the ship stood still,</l>
<l n="tr">and pushed off with long poles and pointed iron,</l>
<l n="tr">or snatched the smashed oars from the whirling tide.</l>
<l n="tr">Mnestheus exults; and, roused to keener strife</l>
<l n="tr">by happy fortune, with a quicker stroke</l>
<l n="tr">of each bright rank of oars, and with the breeze</l>
<l n="tr">his prayer implored, skims o'er the obedient wave</l>
<l n="tr">and sweeps the level main. Not otherwise</l>
<l n="tr">a startled dove, emerging o'er the fields</l>
<l n="tr">from secret cavern in the crannied hill</l>
<l n="tr">where her safe house and pretty nestlings lie,</l>
<l n="tr">soars from her nest, with whirring wings&mdash;but soon</l>
<l n="tr">through the still sky she takes her path of air</l>
<l n="tr">on pinions motionless. So Pristis sped</l>
<l n="tr">with Mnestheus, cleaving her last stretch of sea,</l>
<l n="tr">by her own impulse wafted. She outstripped</l>
<l n="tr">Sergestus first; for he upon the reef</l>
<l n="tr">fought with the breakers, desperately shouting</l>
<l n="tr">for help, for help in vain, with broken oars</l>
<l n="tr">contriving to move on. Then Mnestheus ran</l>
<l n="tr">past Gyas, in Chimaera's ponderous hulk,</l>
<l n="tr">of pilot now bereft; <milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="card"/>at last remains</l>
<l n="tr">Cloanthus his sole peer, whom he pursues</l>
<l n="tr">with a supreme endeavor. From the shore</l>
<l n="tr">burst echoing cheers that spur him to the chase,</l>
<l n="tr">and wild applause makes all the welkin ring.</l>
<l n="tr">The leaders now with eager souls would scorn</l>
<l n="tr">to Iose their glory, and faint-hearted fail</l>
<l n="tr">to grasp a prize half-won, but fain would buy</l>
<l n="tr">honor with life itself; the followers too</l>
<l n="tr">are flushed with proud success, and feel them strong</l>
<l n="tr">because their strength is proven. Both ships now</l>
<l n="tr">with indistinguishable prows had sped</l>
<l n="tr">to share one prize,&mdash;but with uplifted hands</l>
<l n="tr">spread o'er the sea, Cloanthus, suppliant,</l>
<l n="tr">called on the gods to bless his votive prayer:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Ye gods who rule the waves, whose waters be</l>
<l n="tr">my pathway now; for you on yonder strand</l>
<l n="tr">a white bull at the altar shall be slain</l>
<l n="tr">in grateful tribute for a granted vow;</l>
<l n="tr">and o'er the salt waves I will scatter far</l>
<l n="tr">the entrails, and outpour the flowing wine.&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">He spoke; and from the caverns under sea</l>
<l n="tr">Phorcus and virgin Panopea heard,</l>
<l n="tr">and all the sea-nymphs' choir; while with strong hand</l>
<l n="tr">the kindly God of Havens rose and thrust</l>
<l n="tr">the gliding ship along, that swifter flew</l>
<l n="tr">than south wind, or an arrow from the string,</l>
<l n="tr">and soon made land in haven safe and sure.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="244" unit="card"/>Aeneas then, assembling all to hear,</l>
<l n="tr">by a far-sounding herald's voice proclaimed</l>
<l n="tr">Cloanthus victor, and arrayed his brows</l>
<l n="tr">with the green laurel-garland; to the crews</l>
<l n="tr">three bulls, at choice, were given, and plenteous wine</l>
<l n="tr">and talent-weight of silver; to the chiefs</l>
<l n="tr">illustrious gifts beside; the victor had</l>
<l n="tr">a gold-embroidered mantle with wide band</l>
<l n="tr">of undulant Meliboean purple rare,</l>
<l n="tr">where, pictured in the woof, young Ganymede</l>
<l n="tr">through Ida's forest chased the light-foot deer</l>
<l n="tr">with javelin; all flushed and panting he.</l>
<l n="tr">But lo! Jove's thunder-bearing eagle fell,</l>
<l n="tr">and his strong talons snatched from Ida far</l>
<l n="tr">the royal boy, whose aged servitors</l>
<l n="tr">reached helpless hands to heaven; his faithful hound</l>
<l n="tr">bayed fiercely at the air. To him whose worth</l>
<l n="tr">the second place had won, Aeneas gave</l>
<l n="tr">a smooth-linked golden corselet, triple-chained,</l>
<l n="tr">of which his own victorious hand despoiled</l>
<l n="tr">Demoleos, by the swift, embattled stream</l>
<l n="tr">of Simois, under <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>,&mdash;and bade it be</l>
<l n="tr">a glory and defence on valor's field;</l>
<l n="tr">scarce might the straining shoulders of two slaves,</l>
<l n="tr">Phegeus and Sagaris, the load endure,</l>
<l n="tr">yet oft Demoleos in this armor dressed</l>
<l n="tr">charged down full speed on routed hosts of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>.</l>
<l n="tr">The third gift was two cauldrons of wrought brass,</l>
<l n="tr">and bowls of beaten silver, cunningly</l>
<l n="tr">embossed with sculpture fair. Bearing such gifts,</l>
<l n="tr">th' exultant victors onward moved, each brow</l>
<l n="tr">bound with a purple fillet. But behold!</l>
<l n="tr">Sergestus, from the grim rock just dragged off</l>
<l n="tr">by cunning toil, one halting rank of oars</l>
<l n="tr">left of his many lost, comes crawling in</l>
<l n="tr">with vanquished ship, a mockery to all.</l>
<l n="tr">As when a serpent, on the highway caught,</l>
<l n="tr">some brazen wheel has crushed, or traveller</l>
<l n="tr">with heavy-smiting blow left half alive</l>
<l n="tr">and mangled by a stone; in vain he moves</l>
<l n="tr">in writhing flight; a part is lifted high</l>
<l n="tr">with hissing throat and angry, glittering eyes;</l>
<l n="tr">but by the wounded part a captive still</l>
<l n="tr">he knots him fold on fold: with such a track</l>
<l n="tr">the maimed ship labored slow; but by her sails</l>
<l n="tr">she still made way, and with full canvas on</l>
<l n="tr">arrived at land. Aeneas then bestowed</l>
<l n="tr">a boon upon Sergestus, as was meet</l>
<l n="tr">for reward of the ship in safety brought</l>
<l n="tr">with all its men; a fair slave was the prize,</l>
<l n="tr">the Cretan Pholoe, well taught to weave,</l>
<l n="tr">and twin boy-babes upon her breast she bore.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="286" unit="card"/>Then good Aeneas, the ship-contest o'er,</l>
<l n="tr">turned to a wide green valley, circled round</l>
<l n="tr">with clasp of wood-clad hills, wherein was made</l>
<l n="tr">an amphitheatre; entering with a throng</l>
<l n="tr">of followers, the hero took his seat</l>
<l n="tr">in mid-arena on a lofty mound.</l>
<l n="tr">For the fleet foot-race, now, his summons flies, &mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">he offers gifts, and shows the rewards due.</l>
<l n="tr">The mingling youth of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName></l>
<l n="tr">hastened from far. Among the foremost came</l>
<l n="tr">the comrades Nisus and Euryalus,</l>
<l n="tr">Euryalus for beauty's bloom renowned,</l>
<l n="tr">Nisus for loyal love; close-following these</l>
<l n="tr">Diores strode, a prince of Priam's line;</l>
<l n="tr">then Salius and Patron, who were bred</l>
<l n="tr">in <placeName key="tgn,7002679">Acarnania</placeName> and Arcady;</l>
<l n="tr">then two Sicilian warriors, Helymus</l>
<l n="tr">and Panopes, both sylvan bred and born,</l>
<l n="tr">comrades of King Acestes; after these</l>
<l n="tr">the multitude whom Fame forgets to tell.</l>
<l n="tr">Aeneas, so surrounded, thus spake forth:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Hear what I purpose, and with joy receive!</l>
<l n="tr">of all your company, not one departs</l>
<l n="tr">with empty hand. The Cretan javelins</l>
<l n="tr">bright-tipped with burnished steel, and battle-axe</l>
<l n="tr">adorned with graven silver, these shall be</l>
<l n="tr">the meed of all. The three first at the goal</l>
<l n="tr">shall bind their foreheads with fair olive green,</l>
<l n="tr">and win the rewards due. The first shall lead,</l>
<l n="tr">victorious, yon rich-bridled steed away;</l>
<l n="tr">this Amazonian quiver, the next prize,</l>
<l n="tr">well-stocked with Thracian arrows; round it goes</l>
<l n="tr">a baldrick broad and golden,&mdash;in its clasp</l>
<l n="tr">a lustrous gem. The third man goes away</l>
<l n="tr">taking this helmet from the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> spoil.&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="card"/>They heard, and took their places. The loud horn</l>
<l n="tr">gave signal, and impetuous from the line,</l>
<l n="tr">swift as a bursting storm they sped away,</l>
<l n="tr">eyes fixed upon the goal. Far in advance</l>
<l n="tr">Nisus shot forward, swifter than the winds</l>
<l n="tr">or winged thunderbolt; the next in course,</l>
<l n="tr">next, but out-rivalled far, was Salius,</l>
<l n="tr">and after him a space, Euryalus</l>
<l n="tr">came third; him Helymus was hard upon;</l>
<l n="tr">and, look! Diores follows, heel on heel,</l>
<l n="tr">close at his shoulder&mdash;if the race be long</l>
<l n="tr">he sure must win, or claim a doubtful prize.</l>
<l n="tr">Now at the last stretch, spent and panting, all</l>
<l n="tr">pressed to the goal, when in a slime of blood</l>
<l n="tr">Nisus, hard fate! slipped down, where late the death</l>
<l n="tr">of victims slain had drenched the turf below.</l>
<l n="tr">Here the young victor, with his triumph flushed,</l>
<l n="tr">lost foothold on the yielding ground, and plunged</l>
<l n="tr">face forward in the pool of filth and gore;</l>
<l n="tr">but not of dear Euryalus was he</l>
<l n="tr">forgetful then, nor heedless of his friend;</l>
<l n="tr">but rising from the mire he hurled himself</l>
<l n="tr">in Salius' way; so he in equal plight</l>
<l n="tr">rolled in the filthy slough. Euryalus</l>
<l n="tr">leaped forth, the winner of the race by gift</l>
<l n="tr">of his true friend, and flying to the goal</l>
<l n="tr">stood first, by many a favoring shout acclaimed.</l>
<l n="tr">Next Helymus ran in; and, for the third, last prize,</l>
<l n="tr">Diores. But the multitude now heard</l>
<l n="tr">the hollowed hill-side ringing with wild wrath</l>
<l n="tr">from Salius, clamoring where the chieftains sate</l>
<l n="tr">for restitution of his stolen prize,</l>
<l n="tr">lost by a cheat. But general favor smiles</l>
<l n="tr">upon Euryalus, whose beauteous tears</l>
<l n="tr">commend him much, and nobler seems the worth</l>
<l n="tr">of valor clothed in youthful shape so fair.</l>
<l n="tr">Diores, too, assists the victor's claim,</l>
<l n="tr">with loud appeal&mdash;he too has won a prize,</l>
<l n="tr">and vainly holds his last place, if the first</l>
<l n="tr">to Salius fall. <milestone ed="p" n="348" unit="card"/>Aeneas then replied:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Your gifts, my gallant youths, remain secure.</l>
<l n="tr">None can re-judge the prize. But to console</l>
<l n="tr">the misadventure of a blameless friend,</l>
<l n="tr">is in my power.&rdquo; Therewith to Salius</l>
<l n="tr">an Afric lion's monstrous pelt he gave,</l>
<l n="tr">with ponderous mane, the claws o'erlaid with gold.</l>
<l n="tr">But Nisus cried: &ldquo;If such a gift be found</l>
<l n="tr">for less than victory, and men who fall</l>
<l n="tr">are worthy so much sorrow, pray, what prize</l>
<l n="tr">shall Nisus have? For surely I had won</l>
<l n="tr">the proudest of the garlands, if one stroke</l>
<l n="tr">of inauspicious fortune had not fallen</l>
<l n="tr">on Salius and me.&rdquo; So saying, he showed</l>
<l n="tr">his smeared face and his sorry limbs befouled</l>
<l n="tr">with mire and slime. Then laughed the gracious sire,</l>
<l n="tr">and bade a shield be brought, the cunning work</l>
<l n="tr">of Didymaon, which the Greeks tore down</l>
<l n="tr">from Neptune's temple; with this noble gift</l>
<l n="tr">he sent the high-born youth upon his way.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="362" unit="card"/>The foot-race over and the gifts disbursed,</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Come forth!&rdquo; he cries, &ldquo;if any in his heart</l>

<l n="tr">the gauntlets and uplift his thong-bound arms</l>
<l n="tr">in challenge.&rdquo; For the reward of this fight</l>
<l n="tr">a two-fold gift he showed: the victor's meed,</l>
<l n="tr">a bullock decked and gilded; but a sword</l>
<l n="tr">and glittering helmet to console the fallen.</l>
<l n="tr">Straightway, in all his pride of giant strength,</l>
<l n="tr">Dares Ioomed up, and wondering murmurs ran</l>
<l n="tr">along the gazing crowd; for he alone</l>
<l n="tr">was wont to match with Paris, he it was</l>
<l n="tr">met Butes, the huge-bodied champion</l>
<l n="tr">boasting the name and race of Amycus,</l>
<l n="tr">Bythinian-born; him felled he at a blow,</l>
<l n="tr">and stretched him dying on the tawny sand.</l>
<l n="tr">Such Dares was, who now held high his head,</l>
<l n="tr">fierce for the fray, bared both his shoulders broad,</l>
<l n="tr">lunged out with left and right, and beat the air.</l>
<l n="tr">Who shall his rival be? Of all the throng</l>
<l n="tr">not one puts on the gauntlets, or would face</l>
<l n="tr">the hero's challenge. Therefore, striding forth,</l>
<l n="tr">believing none now dare but yield the palm,</l>
<l n="tr">he stood before Aeneas, and straightway</l>
<l n="tr">seized with his left hand the bull's golden horn,</l>
<l n="tr">and cried, &ldquo;O goddess-born, if no man dares</l>
<l n="tr">to risk him in this fight, how Iong delay?</l>
<l n="tr">how Iong beseems it I should stand and wait?</l>
<l n="tr">Bid me bear off my prize.&rdquo; The Trojans all</l>
<l n="tr">murmured assent, and bade the due award</l>

<l n="tr">Acestes to Entellus at his side</l>

<l n="tr">who taught thee? Are thy tales of <placeName key="perseus,Eryx">Eryx</placeName> vain?</l>
<l n="tr">Does all <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicilia</placeName> praise thee? Is thy roof</l>
<l n="tr">with trophies hung?&rdquo; The other in reply:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;My jealous honor and good name yield not</l>
<l n="tr">to fear. But age, so cold and slow to move,</l>

<l n="tr">O, if I had what yonder ruffian boasts&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">my own proud youth once more! I would not ask</l>

<l n="tr">the double-folded mantle from his shoulders,</l>
<l n="tr">stripped bare the huge joints, the huge arms and thews,</l>
<l n="tr">and towered gigantic in the midmost ring.</l>
<l n="tr">Anchises' son then gave two equal pairs</l>
<l n="tr">of gauntlets, and accoutred with like arms</l>
<l n="tr">both champions. Each lifted him full height</l>
<l n="tr">on tiptoe; each with mien unterrified</l>
<l n="tr">held both fists high in air, and drew his head</l>
<l n="tr">far back from blows assailing. Then they joined</l>
<l n="tr">in struggle hand to hand, and made the fray</l>
<l n="tr">each moment fiercer. One was light of foot</l>
<l n="tr">and on his youth relied; the other strong</l>
<l n="tr">in bulk of every limb, but tottering</l>
<l n="tr">on sluggish knees, while all his body shook</l>
<l n="tr">with labor of his breath. Without avail</l>
<l n="tr">they rained their blows, and on each hollow side,</l>
<l n="tr">each sounding chest, the swift, reverberate strokes</l>
<l n="tr">fell without pause; around their ears and brows</l>
<l n="tr">came blow on blow, and with relentless shocks</l>
<l n="tr">the smitten jaws cracked loud. Entellus stands</l>
<l n="tr">unshaken, and, the self-same posture keeping,</l>
<l n="tr">only by body-movement or quick eye</l>
<l n="tr">parries attack. Dares (like one in siege</l>
<l n="tr">against a mountain-citadel, who now will drive</l>

<l n="tr">tries manifold approach, most craftily</l>
<l n="tr">invests each point of vantage, and renews</l>
<l n="tr">his unsuccessful, ever various war.</l>
<l n="tr">Then, rising to the stroke, Entellus poised</l>
<l n="tr">aloft his ponderous right; but, quick of eye,</l>
<l n="tr">the other the descending wrath foresaw</l>
<l n="tr">and nimbly slipped away; Entellus so</l>
<l n="tr">wasted his stroke on air, and, self-o'erthrown,</l>
<l n="tr">dropped prone to earth his monstrous length along,</l>
<l n="tr">as when on Erymanth or Ida falls</l>
<l n="tr">a hollowed pine from giant roots uptorn.</l>
<l n="tr">Alike the Teucrian and Trinacrian throng</l>
<l n="tr">shout wildly; while Acestes, pitying, hastes</l>
<l n="tr">to lift his gray companion. But, unchecked,</l>
<l n="tr">undaunted by his fall, the champion brave</l>
<l n="tr">rushed fiercer to the fight, his strength now roused</l>
<l n="tr">by rage, while shame and courage confident</l>
<l n="tr">kindle his soul; impetuous he drives</l>
<l n="tr">Dares full speed all round the ring, with blows</l>
<l n="tr">redoubled right and left. No stop or stay</l>
<l n="tr">gives he, but like a storm of rattling hail</l>
<l n="tr">upon a house-top, so from each huge hand</l>
<l n="tr">the champion's strokes on dizzy Dares fall.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="461" unit="card"/>Then Sire Aeneas willed to make a stay</l>
<l n="tr">to so much rage, nor let Entellus' soul</l>
<l n="tr">flame beyond bound, but bade the battle pause,</l>
<l n="tr">and, rescuing weary Dares, thus he spoke</l>
<l n="tr">in soothing words: &ldquo;Ill-starred! What mad attempt</l>
<l n="tr">is in thy mind? Will not thy heart confess</l>
<l n="tr">thy strength surpassed, and auspices averse?</l>
<l n="tr">Submit, for Heaven decrees!&rdquo; With such wise words</l>
<l n="tr">he sundered the fell strife. But trusty friends</l>
<l n="tr">bore Dares off: his spent limbs helpless trailed,</l>
<l n="tr">his head he could not lift, and from his lips</l>
<l n="tr">came blood and broken teeth. So to the ship</l>
<l n="tr">they bore him, taking, at Aeneas' word,</l>
<l n="tr">the helmet and the sword&mdash;but left behind</l>
<l n="tr">Entellus' prize of victory, the bull.</l>
<l n="tr">He, then, elate and glorying, spoke forth:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;See, goddess-born, and all ye Teucrians, see,</l>
<l n="tr">what strength was mine in youth, and from what death</l>
<l n="tr">ye have clelivered Dares.&rdquo; Saying so,</l>
<l n="tr">he turned him full front to the bull, who stood</l>
<l n="tr">for reward of the fight, and, drawing back</l>
<l n="tr">his right hand, poising the dread gauntlet high,</l>
<l n="tr">swung sheer between the horns and crushed the skull;</l>
<l n="tr">a trembling, lifeless creature, to the ground</l>
<l n="tr">the bull dropped forward dead. Above the fallen</l>
<l n="tr">Entellus cried aloud, &ldquo;This victim due</l>
<l n="tr">I give thee, <placeName key="perseus,Eryx">Eryx</placeName>, more acceptable</l>
<l n="tr">than Dares' death to thy benignant shade.</l>
<l n="tr">For this last victory and joyful day,</l>

<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="485" unit="card"/>Forthwith Aeneas summons all who will</l>
<l n="tr">to contest of swift arrows, and displays</l>
<l n="tr">reward and prize. With mighty hand he rears</l>
<l n="tr">a mast within th' arena, from the ship</l>
<l n="tr">of good Sergestus taken; and thereto</l>
<l n="tr">a fluttering dove by winding cord is bound</l>
<l n="tr">for target of their shafts. Soon to the match</l>
<l n="tr">the rival bowmen came and cast the lots</l>

<l n="tr">Hippocoon's number, son of Hyrtacus,</l>
<l n="tr">by cheers applauded; Mnestheus was the next,</l>

<l n="tr">with olive-garland; next Eurytion,</l>
<l n="tr">brother of thee, O bowman most renowned,</l>
<l n="tr">Pandarus, breaker of the truce, who hurled</l>
<l n="tr">his shaft upon the Achaeans, at the word</l>
<l n="tr">the goddess gave. Acestes' Iot and name</l>
<l n="tr">came from the helmet last, whose royal hand</l>
<l n="tr">the deeds of youth dared even yet to try.</l>
<l n="tr">Each then with strong arm bends his pliant bow,</l>
<l n="tr">each from the quiver plucks a chosen shaft.</l>
<l n="tr">First, with loud arrow whizzing from the string,</l>
<l n="tr">the young Hippocoon with skyward aim</l>
<l n="tr">cuts through the yielding air; and lo! his barb</l>
<l n="tr">pierces the very wood, and makes the mast</l>
<l n="tr">tremble; while with a fluttering, frighted wing</l>
<l n="tr">the bird tugs hard,&mdash;and plaudits fill the sky.</l>
<l n="tr">Boldly rose Mnestheus, and with bow full-drawn</l>
<l n="tr">aimed both his eye and shaft aloft; but he</l>
<l n="tr">failing, unhappy man, to bring his barb</l>
<l n="tr">up to the dove herself, just cut the cord</l>
<l n="tr">and broke the hempen bond, whereby her feet</l>
<l n="tr">were captive to the tree: she, taking flight,</l>
<l n="tr">clove through the shadowing clouds her path of air.</l>
<l n="tr">But swiftly&mdash;for upon his waiting bow</l>
<l n="tr">he held a shaft in rest&mdash;Eurytion</l>
<l n="tr">invoked his brother's shade, and, marking well</l>
<l n="tr">the dove, whose happy pinions fluttered free</l>
<l n="tr">in vacant sky, pierced her, hard by a cloud;</l>
<l n="tr">lifeless she fell, and left in light of heaven</l>
<l n="tr">her spark of life, as, floating down, she bore</l>
<l n="tr">the arrow back to earth. <milestone ed="p" n="519" unit="card"/>Acestes now</l>

<l n="tr">hurl forth one shaft in air; then suddenly</l>
<l n="tr">all eyes beheld such wonder as portends</l>
<l n="tr">events to be (but when fulfilment came,</l>
<l n="tr">too late the fearful seers its warning sung):</l>
<l n="tr">for, soaring through the stream of cloud, his shaft</l>

<l n="tr">Awe-struck both Trojan and Trinacrian stood,</l>

<l n="tr">took embers from the hearth-stones, stole the fires</l>
<l n="tr">upon the altars&mdash;faggots, branches, brands &mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">and rained them on the ships. The god of fire,</l>

<l n="tr">into their midst he flung, which he had worn</l>
<l n="tr">for pageantry of war. Aeneas, too,</l>
<l n="tr">with Trojan bands sped thither. But far off,</l>
<l n="tr">the women, panic-scattered on the shore,</l>
<l n="tr">fled many ways, and deep in caverned crags</l>
<l n="tr">or shadowed forests hid them, for they Ioathed</l>

<l n="tr">If this be my just meed, let thy dread arm</l>

<l n="tr">and multitudinous gales. The full flood pours</l>
<l n="tr">on every ship, and all the smouldering beams</l>
<l n="tr">are drenched, until the smoke and flames expire</l>
<l n="tr">and (though four ships be lost) the burning fleet</l>
<l n="tr">rides rescued from its doom. <milestone ed="p" n="700" unit="card"/>But smitten sore</l>

<l n="tr">Hither the virgin Sibyl, if thou give</l>

<l n="tr">A lofty pyre they build; then sombre boughs</l>

<l n="tr">No bird might ever pass with scathless wing,</l>
<l n="tr">So dire an exhalation is breathed out</l>
<l n="tr">From that dark deep of death to upper air :&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">Hence, in the Grecian tongue, Aornos called.</l>
<l n="tr">Here first four youthful bulls of swarthy hide</l>
<l n="tr">Were led for sacrifice; on each broad brow</l>
<l n="tr">The priestess sprinkled wine; 'twixt the two horns</l>
<l n="tr">Outplucked the lifted hair, and cast it forth</l>
<l n="tr">Upon the holy flames, beginning so</l>
<l n="tr">Her offerings; then loudly sued the power</l>
<l n="tr">of Hecate, a Queen in heaven and hell.</l>
<l n="tr">Some struck with knives, and caught in shallow bowls</l>
<l n="tr">The smoking blood. Aeneas' lifted hand</l>

<l n="tr">Beneath his weight, and, straining at each seam,</l>
<l n="tr">Took in the foul flood with unstinted flow.</l>
<l n="tr">At last the hero and his priestess-guide</l>
<l n="tr">Came safe across the river, and were moored</l>

<l n="tr">Threw down a loaf with honeyed herbs imbued</l>
<l n="tr">And drowsy essences: he, ravenous,</l>
<l n="tr">Gaped wide his three fierce mouths and snatched the bait,</l>

<l n="tr">along the sward to bear their meats were laid</l>
<l n="tr">(such was the will of Jove), and wilding fruits</l>

<l n="tr">Thou hast, O Trojan, thy desire. Thy gifts</l>
<l n="tr">I have not scorned; nor while Latinus reigns</l>

<l n="tr">Betwixt her smooth breast and her robe it wound</l>

<l n="tr">the fillets on her brow, or with her hair</l>

<l n="tr">in gentle accents such as mothers use;</l>

<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="card"/>So kindled he Alecto's wrath to flame;</l>

<l n="tr">which hissed and writhed above the grisly head</l>
<l n="tr">of the large-looming fiend. With eyes of fire</l>

<l n="tr">two coiling snakes out of her tresses, cracked</l>

<l n="tr">Then horror broke his sleep, and fearful sweat</l>
<l n="tr">dripped from his every limb. He shrieked aloud</l>

<l n="tr">Alecto on her Stygian pinions sped</l>
<l n="tr">to where the Teucrians lay. She scanned the ground</l>
<l n="tr">with eager guile, where by the river's marge</l>
<l n="tr">fair-browed Iulus with his nets and snares</l>
<l n="tr">rode fiercely to the chase. Then o'er his hounds</l>
<l n="tr">that hell-born virgin breathed a sudden rage,</l>
<l n="tr">and filled each cunning nostril with the scent</l>
<l n="tr">of stags, till forth in wild pursuit they flew.</l>
<l n="tr">Here all the woe began, and here awoke</l>
<l n="tr">in rustic souls the swift-enkindling war.</l>
<l n="tr">For a fair stag, tall-antlered, stolen away</l>
<l n="tr">even from its mother's milk, had long been kept</l>
<l n="tr">by Tyrrhus and his sons&mdash;the shepherd he</l>
<l n="tr">of all the royal flocks, and forester</l>
<l n="tr">of a wide region round. With fondest care</l>
<l n="tr">their sister Silvia entwined its horns</l>
<l n="tr">with soft, fresh garlands, tamed it to run close,</l>
<l n="tr">and combed the creature, or would bring to bathe</l>
<l n="tr">at a clear, crystal spring. It knew the hands</l>
<l n="tr">of all its gentle masters, and would feed</l>
<l n="tr">from their own dish; or wandering through the wood,</l>
<l n="tr">come back unguided to their friendly door,</l>
<l n="tr">though deep the evening shade. Iulus' dogs</l>
<l n="tr">now roused this wanderer in their ravening chase,</l>
<l n="tr">as, drifted down-stream far from home it lay,</l>
<l n="tr">on a green bank a-cooling. From bent bow</l>
<l n="tr">Ascanius, eager for a hunter's praise,</l>
<l n="tr">let go his shaft; nor did Alecto fail</l>
<l n="tr">his aim to guide: but, whistling through the air,</l>
<l n="tr">the light-winged reed pierced deep in flank and side.</l>
<l n="tr">Swift to its cover fled the wounded thing,</l>
<l n="tr">and crept loud-moaning to its wonted stall,</l>
<l n="tr">where, like a blood-stained suppliant, it seemed</l>
<l n="tr">to fill that shepherd's house with plaintive prayer.</l>
<l n="tr">Then Silvia the sister, smiting oft</l>
<l n="tr">on breast and arm, made cry for help, and called</l>
<l n="tr">the sturdy rustics forth in gathering throng.</l>
<l n="tr">These now (for in the silent forest couched</l>
<l n="tr">the cruel Fury) swift to battle flew.</l>
<l n="tr">One brandished a charred stake, another swung</l>
<l n="tr">a knotted cudgel, as rude anger shapes</l>
<l n="tr">its weapon of whate'er the searching eye</l>
<l n="tr">first haps to fall on. Tyrrhus roused his clans,</l>
<l n="tr">just when by chance he split with blows of wedge</l>
<l n="tr">an oak in four; and, panting giant breath,</l>
<l n="tr">shouldered his woodman's axe. <milestone ed="p" n="511" unit="card"/>Alecto then,</l>
<l n="tr">prompt to the stroke of mischief, soared aloft</l>
<l n="tr">from where she spying sate, to the steep roof</l>
<l n="tr">of a tall byre, and from its peak of straw</l>
<l n="tr">blew a wild signal on a shepherd's horn,</l>
<l n="tr">outflinging her infernal note so far</l>
<l n="tr">that all the forest shuddered, and the grove</l>
<l n="tr">throbbed to its deepest glen. Cold Trivia's lake</l>
<l n="tr">from end to end gave ear, and every wave</l>
<l n="tr">of the white stream of Nar, the lonely pools</l>
<l n="tr">of still Velinus heard: while at the sound</l>
<l n="tr">pale mothers to their breasts their children drew.</l>
<l n="tr">Swift to the signal of the dreadful horn, </l>
<l n="tr">snatching their weapons rude, the freeborn swains</l>
<l n="tr">assembled for the fray; the Trojan bands</l>
<l n="tr">poured from their bivouac with instant aid </l>
<l n="tr">for young Ascanius. In array of war</l>
<l n="tr">both stand confronting. Not mere rustic brawl</l>
<l n="tr">with charred oak-staff and cudgel is the fight,</l>
<l n="tr">but with the two-edged steel; the naked swords</l>
<l n="tr">wave like dark-bladed harvest-field, while far</l>
<l n="tr">the brazen arms flash in the smiting sun,</l>
<l n="tr">and skyward fling their beam: so some wide sea,</l>
<l n="tr">at first but whitened in the rising wind,</l>
<l n="tr">swells its slow-rolling mass and ever higher</l>
<l n="tr">its billows rears, until the utmost deep</l>
<l n="tr">lifts in one surge to heaven. The first to fall</l>
<l n="tr">was Almo, eldest-born of Tyrrhus' sons,</l>
<l n="tr">whom, striding in the van, a loud-winged shaft</l>
<l n="tr">laid low in death; deep in his throat it clung,</l>
<l n="tr">and silenced with his blood the dying cry</l>
<l n="tr">of his frail life. Around him fell the forms</l>
<l n="tr">of many a brave and strong; among them died</l>
<l n="tr">gray-haired Galaesus pleading for a truce:</l>
<l n="tr">righteous he was, and of Ausonian fields</l>
<l n="tr">a prosperous master; five full flocks had he</l>
<l n="tr">of bleating sheep, and from his pastures came</l>
<l n="tr">five herds of cattle home; his busy churls</l>
<l n="tr">turned with a hundred ploughs his fruitful glebe.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="540" unit="card"/>While o'er the battle-field thus doubtful swung</l>
<l n="tr">the scales of war, the Fury (to her task</l>
<l n="tr">now equal proven) having dyed the day</l>
<l n="tr">a deep-ensanguined hue, and opened fight</l>
<l n="tr">with death and slaughter, made no tarrying</l>
<l n="tr">within Hesperia, but skyward soared,</l>
<l n="tr">and, Ioud in triumph, insolently thus</l>
<l n="tr">to Juno called: &ldquo;See, at thy will, their strife</l>
<l n="tr">full-blown to war and woe! Could even thyself</l>
<l n="tr">command them now to truce and amity?</l>
<l n="tr">But I, that with Ausonia's blood befoul</l>
<l n="tr">their Trojan hands, yet more can do, if thou</l>
<l n="tr">shift not thy purpose. For with dire alarms</l>
<l n="tr">I will awake the bordering states to war</l>
<l n="tr">enkindling in their souls the frenzied lust</l>
<l n="tr">the war-god breathes; till from th' horizon round</l>
<l n="tr">the reinforcement pours&mdash;I scattering seeds</l>
<l n="tr">of carnage through the land.&rdquo; In answer spoke</l>
<l n="tr">juno: &ldquo;Enough of artifice and fear!</l>
<l n="tr">Thy provocation works. Now have they joined</l>
<l n="tr">in close and deadly combat, and warm blood</l>
<l n="tr">those sudden-leaping swords incarnadines,</l>
<l n="tr">which chance put in their hands. Such nuptial joys,</l>

<l n="tr">permits thee freely in our skies to roam.</l>
<l n="tr">Go, quit the field! Myself will take control</l>
<l n="tr">of hazards and of labors yet to be.&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">Thus Saturn's daughter spoke. Alecto then,</l>
<l n="tr">unfolding far her hissing, viperous wings,</l>
<l n="tr">turned toward her Stygian home, and took farewell</l>
<l n="tr">of upper air. Deep in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italia</placeName> lies</l>
<l n="tr">a region mountain-girded, widely famed,</l>

<l n="tr">are breathing-holes of hell, a vast abyss</l>
<l n="tr">where Acheron opes wide its noisome jaws:</l>
<l n="tr">in this Alecto plunged, concealing so</l>

<l n="tr">of earth and heaven felt the curse removed.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="572" unit="card"/>Forthwith the sovereign hands of Juno haste</l>
<l n="tr">to consummate the war. The shepherds bear</l>
<l n="tr">back from the field of battle to the town</l>
<l n="tr">the bodies of the slain: young Almo's corse</l>
<l n="tr">and gray Galaesus' bleeding head. They call</l>
<l n="tr">just gods in heaven to Iook upon their wrong,</l>
<l n="tr">and bid Latinus see it. Turnus comes,</l>
<l n="tr">and, while the angry mob surveys the slain,</l>
<l n="tr">adds fury to the hour. &ldquo;Shall the land</l>
<l n="tr">have Trojan lords? Shall Phrygian marriages</l>
<l n="tr">debase our ancient, royal blood&mdash;and I</l>
<l n="tr">be spurned upon the threshold?&rdquo; Then drew near</l>
<l n="tr">the men whose frenzied women-folk had held</l>
<l n="tr">bacchantic orgies in the pathless grove,</l>
<l n="tr">awed by Amata's name: these, gathering,</l>
<l n="tr">sued loud for war. Yea, all defied the signs</l>
<l n="tr">and venerable omens; all withstood</l>
<l n="tr">divine decrees, and clamored for revenge,</l>
<l n="tr">prompted by evil powers. They besieged</l>
<l n="tr">the house of King Latinus, shouting-loud</l>
<l n="tr">with emulous rage. But like a sea-girt rock</l>
<l n="tr">unmoved he stood; like sea-girt rock when surge</l>

<l n="tr">surround; it keeps a ponderous front of power,</l>
<l n="tr">though foaming cliffs around it vainly roar;</l>
<l n="tr">from its firm base the broken sea-weeds fall.</l>
<l n="tr">But when authority no whit could change</l>
<l n="tr">their counsels blind, and each event fulfilled</l>
<l n="tr">dread Juno's will, then with complaining prayer</l>
<l n="tr">the aged sire cried loud upon his gods</l>
<l n="tr">and on th' unheeding air: &ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; said he,</l>

<l n="tr">Now was my time to rest. But as I come</l>

<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="66" unit="card"/>So spake the river-god, and sank from view</l>
<l n="tr">down to his deepest cave; then night and sleep</l>
<l n="tr">together from Aeneas fled away.</l>
<l n="tr">He rose, and to the orient beams of morn</l>
<l n="tr">his forehead gave; in both his hollowed palms</l>
<l n="tr">he held the sacred waters of the stream,</l>
<l n="tr">and called aloud: &ldquo;O ye Laurentian nymphs,</l>

<l n="tr">If in some hallowed lake or haunted spring</l>

<l n="tr">or wheresoe'er the blessed place be found</l>
<l n="tr">whence first thy beauty flows, there evermore</l>
<l n="tr">my hands shall bring thee gift and sacrifice.</l>
<l n="tr">O chief and sovereign of Hesperian streams,</l>
<l n="tr">O river-god that hold'st the plenteous horn,</l>
<l n="tr">protect us, and confirm thy words divine!&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">He spoke; then chose twin biremes from the fleet,</l>
<l n="tr">gave them good gear and armed their loyal crews.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="81" unit="card"/>But, lo! a sudden wonder met his eyes:</l>
<l n="tr">white gleaming through the grove, with all her brood</l>
<l n="tr">white like herself, on the green bank the Sow</l>
<l n="tr">stretched prone. The good Aeneas slew her there,</l>
<l n="tr">Great Juno, for a sacrifice to thee,</l>
<l n="tr">himself the priest, and with the sucklings all</l>

<l n="tr">the god of Tiber calmed his swollen wave,</l>

<l n="tr">till like some gentle lake or sleeping pool</l>
<l n="tr">his even waters lay, and strove no more</l>
<l n="tr">against the oarsmen's toil. Upon their way</l>
<l n="tr">they speed with joyful sound; the well-oiled wood</l>
<l n="tr">slips through the watery floor; the wondering waves,</l>
<l n="tr">and all the virgin forests wondering,</l>

<l n="tr">O'er the long reaches of the winding flood</l>
<l n="tr">their sturdy oars outweary the slow course</l>

<l n="tr">green forests in the tranquil wave below.</l>
<l n="tr">Now had the flaming sun attained his way</l>
<l n="tr">to the mid-sphere of heaven, when they discerned</l>
<l n="tr">walls and a citadel in distant view,</l>
<l n="tr">with houses few and far between; 't was there,</l>
<l n="tr">where sovran <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> to-day has rivalled Heaven,</l>
<l n="tr">Evander's realm its slender strength displayed:</l>

<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="102" unit="card"/>It chanced th' Arcadian King had come that day</l>
<l n="tr">to honor Hercules, Amphitryon's son,</l>

<l n="tr">in groves outside the wall. Beside him stood</l>
<l n="tr">Pallas his son, his noblest men-at-arms,</l>
<l n="tr">and frugal senators, who at the shrines</l>
<l n="tr">burnt incense, while warm blood of victims flowed.</l>
<l n="tr">But when they saw the tall ships in the shade</l>
<l n="tr">of that dark forest plying noiseless oars,</l>
<l n="tr">the sudden sight alarmed, and all the throng</l>
<l n="tr">sprang to its feet and left the feast divine.</l>
<l n="tr">But dauntless Pallas bade them give not o'er</l>
<l n="tr">the sacred festival, and spear in hand</l>
<l n="tr">flew forward to a bit of rising ground,</l>
<l n="tr">and cried from far: &ldquo;Hail, warriors! what cause</l>

<l n="tr">Your kin, your country? Bring ye peace or war?&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">Father Aeneas then held forth a bough</l>

<l n="tr">his right hand in true welcome, and they stood</l>
<l n="tr">with lingering clasp; then hand in hand advanced</l>

<l n="tr">The sire and builder of the Trojan town</l>

<l n="tr">Accept good faith, and give! Behold, our hearts</l>

<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="152" unit="card"/>Aeneas ceased. The other long had scanned</l>

<l n="tr">his form and mien divine; in answer now</l>
<l n="tr">he briefly spoke: &ldquo;With hospitable heart,</l>
<l n="tr">O bravest warrior of all Trojan-born,</l>
<l n="tr">I know and welcome thee. I well recall</l>
<l n="tr">thy sire Anchises, how he looked and spake.</l>
<l n="tr">For I remember Priam, when he came</l>
<l n="tr">to greet his sister, Queen Hesione,</l>
<l n="tr">in <placeName key="perseus,Salamis, Cyprus">Salamis</placeName>, and thence pursued his way</l>
  <l n="tr">to our cool uplands of <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>.</l>
<l n="tr">The bloom of tender boyhood then was mine,</l>
<l n="tr">and with a wide-eyed wonder I did view</l>
<l n="tr">those Teucrian lords, Laomedon's great heir,</l>
<l n="tr">and, towering highest in their goodly throng,</l>
<l n="tr">Anchises, whom my warm young heart desired</l>
<l n="tr">to speak with and to clasp his hand in mine.</l>
<l n="tr">So I approached, and joyful led him home</l>
<l n="tr">to Pheneus' olden wall. He gave me gifts</l>

<l n="tr">filled with good Lycian arrows, a rich cloak</l>
<l n="tr">inwove with thread of gold, and bridle reins</l>
<l n="tr">all golden, now to youthful Pallas given.</l>
<l n="tr">Therefore thy plea is granted, and my hand</l>

<l n="tr">To-morrow at the sunrise thou shalt have</l>
<l n="tr">my tribute for the war, and go thy way</l>
<l n="tr">my glad ally. But now this festival,</l>
<l n="tr">whose solemn rite 't were impious to delay,</l>
<l n="tr">I pray thee celebrate, and bring with thee</l>

<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="card"/>So saying, he bade his followers renew</l>
<l n="tr">th' abandoned feast and wine; and placed each guest</l>
<l n="tr">on turf-built couch of green, most honoring</l>
<l n="tr">Aeneas by a throne of maple fair</l>
<l n="tr">decked with a lion's pelt and flowing mane.</l>
<l n="tr">Then high-born pages, with the altar's priest,</l>

<l n="tr">with baskets of fine bread; and wine they bring &mdash;</l>

<l n="tr">While good Aeneas and his Trojans share</l>
<l n="tr">the long whole ox and meats of sacrifice.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="184" unit="card"/>When hunger and its eager edge were gone,</l>
<l n="tr">Evander spoke: &ldquo;This votive holiday,</l>
<l n="tr">yon tables spread and altar so divine,</l>
<l n="tr">are not some superstition dark and vain,</l>
<l n="tr">that knows not the old gods, O Trojan King!</l>
<l n="tr">But as men saved from danger and great fear</l>
<l n="tr">this thankful sacrifice we pay. Behold,</l>
<l n="tr">yon huge rock, beetling from the mountain wall,</l>
<l n="tr">hung from the cliff above. How lone and bare</l>
<l n="tr">the hollowed mountain looks! How crag on crag</l>
<l n="tr">tumbled and tossed in huge confusion lie!</l>
<l n="tr">A cavern once it was, which ran deep down</l>
<l n="tr">into the darkness. There th' half-human shape</l>
<l n="tr">of Cacus made its hideous den, concealed</l>
<l n="tr">from sunlight and the day. The ground was wet</l>
<l n="tr">at all times with fresh gore; the portal grim</l>
<l n="tr">was hung about with heads of slaughtered men,</l>
<l n="tr">bloody and pale&mdash;a fearsome sight to see.</l>
<l n="tr">Vulcan begat this monster, which spewed forth</l>
<l n="tr">dark-fuming flames from his infernal throat,</l>
<l n="tr">and vast his stature seemed. But time and tide</l>
<l n="tr">brought to our prayers the advent of a god</l>
<l n="tr">to help us at our need. For Hercules,</l>
<l n="tr">divine avenger, came from laying low</l>
<l n="tr">three-bodied Geryon, whose spoils he wore</l>
<l n="tr">exultant, and with hands victorious drove</l>
<l n="tr">the herd of monster bulls, which pastured free</l>
<l n="tr">along our river-valley. Cacus gazed</l>
<l n="tr">in a brute frenzy, and left not untried</l>
<l n="tr">aught of bold crime or stratagem, but stole</l>
<l n="tr">four fine bulls as they fed, and heifers four,</l>
<l n="tr">all matchless; but, lest hoof-tracks point his way,</l>
<l n="tr">he dragged them cave-wards by the tails, confusing</l>
<l n="tr">the natural trail, and hid the stolen herd</l>
<l n="tr">in his dark den; and not a mark or sign</l>
<l n="tr">could guide the herdsmen to that cavern-door.</l>
<l n="tr">But after, when Amphitryon's famous son,</l>
<l n="tr">preparing to depart, would from the meads</l>
<l n="tr">goad forth the full-fed herd, his lingering bulls</l>
<l n="tr">roared loud, and by their lamentable cry</l>
<l n="tr">filled grove and hills with clamor of farewell:</l>
<l n="tr">one heifer from the mountain-cave lowed back</l>
<l n="tr">in answer, so from her close-guarded stall</l>
<l n="tr">foiling the monster's will. <milestone ed="p" n="219" unit="card"/>Then hadst thou seen</l>
<l n="tr">the wrath of Hercules in frenzy blaze</l>
<l n="tr">from his exasperate heart. His arms he seized,</l>
<l n="tr">his club of knotted oak, and climbed full-speed</l>
<l n="tr">the wind-swept hill. Now first our people saw</l>
<l n="tr">Cacus in fear, with panic in his eyes.</l>
<l n="tr">Swift to the black cave like a gale he flew,</l>
<l n="tr">his feet by terror winged. Scarce had he passed</l>
<l n="tr">the cavern door, and broken the big chains,</l>
<l n="tr">and dropped the huge rock which was pendent there</l>
<l n="tr">by Vulcan's well-wrought steel; scarce blocked and barred</l>
<l n="tr">the guarded gate: when there Tirynthius stood,</l>
<l n="tr">with heart aflame, surveying each approach,</l>
<l n="tr">rolling this way and that his wrathful eyes,</l>
<l n="tr">gnashing his teeth. Three times his ire surveyed</l>
<l n="tr">the slope of <placeName key="tgn,4012809">Aventine</placeName>; three times he stormed</l>
<l n="tr">the rock-built gate in vain; and thrice withdrew</l>
<l n="tr">to rest him in the vale. But high above</l>
<l n="tr">a pointed peak arose, sheer face of rock</l>
<l n="tr">on every side, which towered into view</l>
<l n="tr">from the long ridge above the vaulted cave,</l>
<l n="tr">fit haunt for birds of evil-boding wing.</l>
<l n="tr">This peak, which leftward toward the river leaned,</l>
<l n="tr">he smote upon its right&mdash;his utmost blow &mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">breaking its bases Ioose; then suddenly</l>
<l n="tr">thrust at it: as he thrust, the thunder-sound</l>
<l n="tr">filled all the arching sky, the river's banks</l>
<l n="tr">asunder leaped, and <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName> in alarm</l>
<l n="tr">reversed his flowing wave. So Cacus' lair</l>
<l n="tr">lay shelterless, and naked to the day</l>
<l n="tr">the gloomy caverns of his vast abode</l>
<l n="tr">stood open, deeply yawning, just as if</l>
<l n="tr">the riven earth should crack, and open wide</l>
<l n="tr">th' infernal world and fearful kingdoms pale,</l>
<l n="tr">which gods abhor; and to the realms on high</l>
<l n="tr">the measureless abyss should be laid bare,</l>
<l n="tr">and pale ghosts shrink before the entering sun.</l>
<l n="tr">Now upon Cacus, startled by the glare,</l>
<l n="tr">caged in the rocks and howling horribly,</l>
<l n="tr">Alcides hurled his weapons, raining down</l>
<l n="tr">all sorts of deadly missiles&mdash;trunks of trees,</l>
<l n="tr">and monstrous boulders from the mountain torn.</l>
<l n="tr">But when the giant from his mortal strait</l>
<l n="tr">no refuge knew, he blew from his foul jaws</l>
<l n="tr">a storm of smoke&mdash;incredible to tell &mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">and with thick darkness blinding every eye,</l>
<l n="tr">concealed his cave, uprolling from below</l>
<l n="tr">one pitch-black night of mingled gloom and fire.</l>
<l n="tr">This would Alcides not endure, but leaped</l>
<l n="tr">headlong across the flames, where densest hung</l>
<l n="tr">the rolling smoke, and through the cavern surged</l>
<l n="tr">a drifting and impenetrable cloud.</l>
<l n="tr">With Cacus, who breathed unavailing flame,</l>
<l n="tr">he grappled in the dark, locked limb with limb,</l>
<l n="tr">and strangled him, till o'er the bloodless throat</l>
<l n="tr">the starting eyeballs stared.<milestone ed="p" n="262" unit="card"/>Then Hercules</l>
<l n="tr">burst wide the doorway of the sooty den,</l>
<l n="tr">and unto Heaven and all the people showed</l>
<l n="tr">the stolen cattle and the robber's crimes,</l>
<l n="tr">and dragged forth by the feet the shapeless corpse</l>
<l n="tr">of the foul monster slain. The people gazed</l>
<l n="tr">insatiate on the grewsome eyes, the breast</l>
<l n="tr">of bristling shag, the face both beast and man,</l>
<l n="tr">and that fire-blasted throat whence breathed no more</l>
<l n="tr">the extinguished flame. 'T is since that famous day</l>
<l n="tr">we celebrate this feast, and glad of heart</l>
<l n="tr">each generation keeps the holy time.</l>
<l n="tr">Potitius began the worship due,</l>
<l n="tr">and our Pinarian house is vowed to guard</l>
<l n="tr">the rites of Hercules. An altar fair</l>

<l n="tr">Lift high the cup in every thankful hand,</l>
<l n="tr">and praise our people's god with plenteous wine.&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">He spoke; and of the poplar's changeful sheen,</l>
<l n="tr">sacred to Hercules, wove him a wreath</l>
<l n="tr">to shade his silvered brow. The sacred cup</l>
<l n="tr">he raised in his right hand, while all the rest</l>

<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="card"/>Soon from the travelling heavens the western star</l>

<l n="tr">New glory to the gods above, come down,</l>
<l n="tr">and these thine altars and thy people bless!&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">Such hymns they chanted, telling oft the tale</l>

<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="306" unit="card"/>Such worship o'er, all take the homeward way</l>

<l n="tr">though bowed with weight of years, kept at his side</l>
<l n="tr">Aeneas and his son, and as they fared,</l>
<l n="tr">with various discourse beguiled the way.</l>
<l n="tr">Aeneas scanned with quick-admiring eyes</l>
<l n="tr">the region wide, and lingered with delight</l>
<l n="tr">now here, now there, inquiring eagerly</l>
<l n="tr">of each proud monument of heroes gone.</l>
<l n="tr">Then King Evander, he who builded first</l>
  <l n="tr">On <placeName key="tgn,3000935">Palatine</placeName>, spoke thus: &ldquo;These groves erewhile</l>

<l n="tr">Nor laws nor arts they knew; nor how to tame</l>
<l n="tr">burls to the yoke, nor fill great barns with store</l>
<l n="tr">and hoard the gathered grain; but rudely fared</l>
<l n="tr">on wild fruits and such food as hunters find.</l>
<l n="tr">Then Saturn from Olympian realms came down,</l>
<l n="tr">in flight from Jove's dread arms, his sceptre lost,</l>
<l n="tr">and he an exiled King. That savage race</l>

<l n="tr">wise laws and statutes; so that latent land</l>
<l n="tr">was <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName>, &lsquo;hid land&rsquo;, where he hid so long.</l>
<l n="tr">The golden centuries by legends told</l>
<l n="tr">were under that good King, whose equal sway</l>
<l n="tr">untroubled peace to all his peoples gave.</l>
<l n="tr">But after slow decline arrived an age</l>
<l n="tr">degenerate and of a darker hue,</l>
<l n="tr">prone to insensate war and greed of gain.</l>
<l n="tr">Then came Sicanian and Ausonian tribes,</l>

<l n="tr">by all-disposing Chance and iron laws</l>

<l n="tr">Carmentis, my nymph-mother, thrust me on,</l>

<l n="tr">and lordly Pallanteum, where they dwell.</l>
<l n="tr">Next the vast grove was seen, where Romulus</l>

<l n="tr">then the Lupercal under its cold crag,</l>
<l n="tr">Wolf-hill, where old Arcadians revered</l>

<l n="tr">woke in the rustics a religious awe,</l>
<l n="tr">and bade them fear and tremble at the view</l>
<l n="tr">of that dread rock and grove. &ldquo;This leafy wood,</l>
<l n="tr">which crowns the hill-top, is the favored seat</l>
<l n="tr">of some great god,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but of his name</l>
<l n="tr">we know not surely. The Arcadians say</l>
<l n="tr">jove's dread right hand here visibly appears</l>
<l n="tr">to shake his aegis in the darkening storm,</l>
<l n="tr">the clouds compelling. Yonder rise in view</l>
<l n="tr">two strongholds with dismantled walls, which now</l>
<l n="tr">are but a memory of great heroes gone:</l>
<l n="tr">one father Janus built, and Saturn one;</l>
<l n="tr">their names, <placeName key="tgn,6005278">Saturnia</placeName> and Janiculum.&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">'Mid such good parley to the house they came</l>
<l n="tr">of King Evander, unadorned and plain,</l>
<l n="tr">whence herds of browsing cattle could be seen</l>
<l n="tr">ranging the Forum, and loud-bellowing</l>
<l n="tr">in proud Carinae. As they entered there,</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the threshold that received</l>
<l n="tr">Alcides in his triumph! This abode</l>
<l n="tr">he made his own. Dare, O illustrious guest,</l>
<l n="tr">to scorn the pomp of power. Shape thy soul</l>
<l n="tr">to be a god's fit follower. Enter here,</l>
<l n="tr">and free from pride our frugal welcome share.&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">So saying, 'neath his roof-tree scant and low</l>
<l n="tr">he led the great Aeneas, offering him</l>
<l n="tr">a couch of leaves with Libyan bear-skin spread.</l>
<l n="tr">Now night drew near, enfolding the wide world</l>
<l n="tr">in shadowy wings. <milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="card"/>But Venus, sore disturbed,</l>
<l n="tr">vexed not unwisely her maternal breast,</l>
<l n="tr">fearing Laurentum's menace and wild stir</l>
<l n="tr">of obstinate revolt, and made her plea</l>
<l n="tr">to Vulcan in their nuptial bower of gold,</l>
<l n="tr">outbreathing in the music of her words</l>
<l n="tr">celestial love: &ldquo;When warring <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> kings</l>
<l n="tr">brought ruin on <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>'s sacred citadel</l>
<l n="tr">and ramparts soon to sink in hostile flames,</l>
<l n="tr">I asked not thee to help that hopeless woe,</l>
<l n="tr">nor craved thy craft and power. For, dearest lord,</l>
<l n="tr">I would not tax in vain shine arduous toil,</l>
<l n="tr">though much to Priam's children I was bound,</l>
<l n="tr">and oft to see Aeneas burdened sore</l>
<l n="tr">I could but weep. But now by will of Jove</l>
<l n="tr">he has found foothold in Rutulian lands.</l>
<l n="tr">Therefore I come at last with lowly suit</l>
<l n="tr">before a godhead I adore, and pray</l>
<l n="tr">for gift of arms,&mdash;a mother for her son.</l>
<l n="tr">Thou wert not unrelenting to the tears</l>
<l n="tr">of Nereus' daughter or Tithonus' bride.</l>
<l n="tr">Behold what tribes conspire, what cities strong</l>
<l n="tr">behind barred gates now make the falchion keen</l>
<l n="tr">to ruin and blot out both me and mine!&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">So spake the goddess, as her arms of snow</l>
<l n="tr">around her hesitating spouse she threw</l>
<l n="tr">in tender, close embrace. He suddenly</l>
<l n="tr">knew the familiar fire, and o'er his frame</l>
<l n="tr">its wonted ardor unresisted ran,</l>
<l n="tr">swift as the glittering shaft of thunder cleaves</l>
<l n="tr">the darkened air and on from cloud to cloud</l>
<l n="tr">the rift of lightning runs. She, joyful wife;</l>
<l n="tr">felt what her beauty and her guile could do;</l>
<l n="tr">as, thralled by love unquenchable, her spouse</l>
<l n="tr">thus answered fair: &ldquo;Why wilt thou labor so</l>
<l n="tr">with far-fetched pleas? my goddess, hast thou lost</l>
<l n="tr">thy faith in me? Had such a prayer been shine,</l>
<l n="tr">I could have armed the Teucrians. Neither Jove</l>
<l n="tr">nor Destiny had grudged ten added years</l>
<l n="tr">of life to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> and Priam. If to-day</l>
<l n="tr">thou hast a war in hand, and if thy heart</l>
<l n="tr">determine so, I willingly engage</l>
<l n="tr">to lend thee all my cunning; whatsoever</l>
<l n="tr">molten alloy or welded iron can,</l>
<l n="tr">whate'er my roaring forge and flames achieve,</l>
<l n="tr">I offer thee. No more in anxious prayer</l>
<l n="tr">distrust thy beauty's power.&rdquo; So saying, he gave</l>
<l n="tr">embrace of mutual desire, and found</l>
<l n="tr">deep, peaceful sleep, on her fond heart reclined.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="407" unit="card"/>Night's course half run, soon as the first repose</l>
<l n="tr">had banished sleep,&mdash;what time some careful wife</l>
<l n="tr">whose distaff and Minerva's humble toil</l>
<l n="tr">must earn her bread, rekindling her warm hearth,</l>
<l n="tr">adds a night-burden to her laboring day,</l>
<l n="tr">and by the torch-light cheers her maidens on</l>
<l n="tr">to their long tasks; that so her husband's bed</l>
<l n="tr">she may in honor keep, and train to power</l>
<l n="tr">her dear men-children&mdash;at such prime of morn,</l>
<l n="tr">with not less eager mind the Lord of Fire</l>
<l n="tr">fled his soft couch and to his forges tried.</l>
<l n="tr">An island near Aeolian Lipara</l>
<l n="tr">not far from a Sicilian headland lies,</l>
<l n="tr">where smoking rocks precipitously tower</l>
<l n="tr">above a vast vault, which the Cyclops' skill</l>

<l n="tr">There ring the smitten anvils, and the roof</l>
<l n="tr">re-echoes, roaring loud. Chalybian ores</l>
<l n="tr">hiss in the gloom, and from the furnace mouths</l>
<l n="tr">puff the hot-panting fires. 'T is Vulcan's seat,</l>
<l n="tr">and all that island is Vulcania.</l>
<l n="tr">Thither descended now the god of fire</l>
<l n="tr">from height of heaven. <milestone ed="p" n="424" unit="card"/>At their task were found</l>
<l n="tr">the Cyclops in vast cavern forging steel,</l>
<l n="tr">naked Pyracmon and gigantic-limbed</l>
<l n="tr">Brontes and Steropes; beneath their blows</l>
<l n="tr">a lightning-shaft, half-shaped, half-burnished lay,</l>
<l n="tr">such as the Thunderer is wont to fling</l>
<l n="tr">in numbers from the sky, but formless still.</l>
<l n="tr">Three strands of whirling storm they wove with three</l>
<l n="tr">of bursting cloud, and three did interfuse</l>
<l n="tr">of ruddy-gleaming fires and winged winds;</l>
<l n="tr">then fearful lightnings on the skilful forge</l>
<l n="tr">they welded with loud horror, and with flames</l>
<l n="tr">that bear swift wrath from Jove. Elsewhere a crew</l>
<l n="tr">toiled at the chariot and winged wheel</l>
<l n="tr">wherewith the war-god wakens from repose</l>
<l n="tr">heroes and peopled cities. Others wrought</l>
<l n="tr">the awful Aegis, herald of dismay,</l>
<l n="tr">by angry Pallas worn; they burnished bright</l>
<l n="tr">the golden serpent-scales and wreathing snakes,</l>
<l n="tr">till from the corselet of the goddess glared</l>
<l n="tr">the Gorgon's severed head and rolling eyes.</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Cyclops of <placeName key="tgn,7003867">Aetna</placeName>,&rdquo; Vulcan cried, &ldquo;have done!</l>

<l n="tr">A mighty shield took shape, its single orb</l>
<l n="tr">sufficient to withstand the gathered shock</l>

<l n="tr">they welded ring with ring. Some deftly ply</l>

<l n="tr">groans with the anvil's weight, as side by side</l>

<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="454" unit="card"/>While thus the Lemnian god his labor sped</l>
<l n="tr">in far Aeolian isle, the cheerful morn</l>
<l n="tr">with voice of swallows round his lowly eaves</l>
<l n="tr">summoned Evander. From his couch arose</l>
<l n="tr">the royal sire, and o'er his aged frame</l>
<l n="tr">a tunic threw, tying beneath his feet</l>
<l n="tr">the Tuscan sandals: an Arcadian sword,</l>
<l n="tr">girt at his left, was over one shoulder slung,</l>
<l n="tr">his cloak of panther trailing from behind.</l>
<l n="tr">A pair of watch-dogs from the lofty door</l>
<l n="tr">ran close, their lord attending, as he sought</l>
<l n="tr">his guest Aeneas; for his princely soul</l>
<l n="tr">remembered faithfully his former word,</l>
<l n="tr">and promised gift. Aeneas with like mind</l>
<l n="tr">was stirring early. King Evander's son</l>
<l n="tr">Pallas was at his side; Achates too</l>
<l n="tr">accompanied his friend. All these conjoin</l>
<l n="tr">in hand-clasp and good-morrow, taking seats</l>
<l n="tr">in midcourt of the house, and give the hour</l>
<l n="tr">to converse unrestrained. First spoke the King:</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="470" unit="card"/>&ldquo;Great leader of the Teucrians, while thy life</l>
<l n="tr">in safety stands, I call not Trojan power</l>
<l n="tr">vanquished or fallen. But to help thy war</l>
<l n="tr">my small means match not thy redoubled name.</l>
<l n="tr">Yon Tuscan river is my bound. That way</l>
<l n="tr">Rutulia thrusts us hard and chafes our wall</l>
<l n="tr">with loud, besieging arms. But I propose</l>
<l n="tr">to league with thee a numerous array</l>
<l n="tr">of kings and mighty tribes, which fortune strange</l>
<l n="tr">now brings to thy defence. Thou comest here</l>
<l n="tr">because the Fates intend. Not far from ours</l>
<l n="tr">a city on an ancient rock is seen,</l>
<l n="tr">Agylla, which a warlike Lydian clan</l>
<l n="tr">built on the Tuscan hills. It prospered well</l>
<l n="tr">for many a year, then under the proud yoke</l>
<l n="tr">of King Mezentius it came and bore</l>
<l n="tr">his cruel sway. Why tell the loathsome deeds</l>
<l n="tr">and crimes unspeakable the despot wrought?</l>
<l n="tr">May Heaven requite them on his impious head</l>
<l n="tr">and on his children! For he used to chain</l>
<l n="tr">dead men to living, hand on hand was laid</l>
<l n="tr">and face on face,&mdash;torment incredible!</l>
<l n="tr">Till, locked in blood-stained, horrible embrace,</l>
<l n="tr">a lingering death they found. But at the last</l>
<l n="tr">his people rose in furious despair,</l>
<l n="tr">and while he blasphemously raged, assailed</l>
<l n="tr">his life and throne, cut down his guards</l>
<l n="tr">and fired his regal dwellings; he, the while,</l>
<l n="tr">escaped immediate death and fied away</l>
<l n="tr">to the Rutulian land, to find defence</l>
<l n="tr">in Turnus hospitality. To-day</l>
<l n="tr">Etruria, to righteous anger stirred,</l>
<l n="tr">demands with urgent arms her guilty King.</l>
<l n="tr">To their large host, Aeneas, I will give</l>
<l n="tr">an added strength, thyself. For yonder shores</l>
<l n="tr">re-echo with the tumult and the cry</l>
<l n="tr">of ships in close array; their eager lords</l>
<l n="tr">are clamoring for battle. But the song</l>
<l n="tr">of the gray omen-giver thus declares</l>
<l n="tr">their destiny: &lsquo;O goodly princes born</l>
<l n="tr">of old Maeonian lineage! Ye that are</l>
<l n="tr">the bloom and glory of an ancient race,</l>
<l n="tr">whom just occasions now and noble rage</l>
<l n="tr">enflame against Mezentius your foe,</l>
<l n="tr">it is decreed that yonder nation proud</l>
<l n="tr">shall never submit to chiefs Italian-born.</l>
<l n="tr">Seek ye a king from far!&rsquo; So in the field</l>
<l n="tr">inert and fearful lies Etruria's force,</l>
<l n="tr">disarmed by oracles. Their Tarchon sent</l>
<l n="tr">envoys who bore a sceptre and a crown</l>
<l n="tr">even to me, and prayed I should assume</l>
<l n="tr">the sacred emblems of Etruria's king,</l>
<l n="tr">and lead their host to war. But unto me</l>
<l n="tr">cold, sluggish age, now barren and outworn,</l>
<l n="tr">denies new kingdoms, and my slow-paced powers</l>
<l n="tr">run to brave deeds no more. Nor could I urge</l>
<l n="tr">my son, who by his Sabine mother's line</l>
<l n="tr">is half Italian-born. Thyself art he, </l>
<l n="tr">whose birth illustrious and manly prime </l>
<l n="tr">fate favors and celestial powers approve.</l>
<l n="tr">Therefore go forth, O bravest chief and King</l>
<l n="tr">of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>! To thee I give</l>

<l n="tr">pallas, my son, and bid him find in thee</l>
<l n="tr">a master and example, while he learns</l>
<l n="tr">the soldier's arduous toil. With thy brave deeds</l>
<l n="tr">let him familiar grow, and reverence thee</l>
<l n="tr">with youthful love and honor. In his train</l>
  <l n="tr">two hundred horsemen of <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>,</l>

<l n="tr">to follow only thee.&rdquo; <milestone ed="p" n="520" unit="card"/>Such the discourse.</l>
<l n="tr">With meditative brows and downcast eyes</l>
<l n="tr">Aeneas and Achates, sad at heart,</l>
<l n="tr">mused on unnumbered perils yet to come.</l>
<l n="tr">But out of cloudless sky Cythera's Queen</l>
<l n="tr">gave sudden signal: from th' ethereal dome</l>

<l n="tr">tumultuous broke, as if the world would fall,</l>

<l n="tr">looked clearest hung a visionary cloud,</l>
<l n="tr">whence through the brightness blazed resounding arms.</l>
<l n="tr">All hearts stood still. But <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>'s heroic son</l>
<l n="tr">knew that his mother in the skies redeemed</l>
<l n="tr">her pledge in sound of thunder: so he cried,</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Seek not, my friend, seek not thyself to read</l>

<l n="tr">what helms and shields and mighty soldiers slain</l>

<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="541" unit="card"/>He said: and from the lofty throne uprose.</l>
<l n="tr">Straightway he roused anew the slumbering fire</l>

<l n="tr">to young Ascanius of the new event,</l>
<l n="tr">and of his father. Horses then were brought</l>
<l n="tr">for all the Teucrians to Etruria bound;</l>
<l n="tr">and for Aeneas one of rarest breed,</l>

<l n="tr">nor could Mezentius with insulting sword</l>

<l n="tr">So saying, he turned him to a sacred stream,</l>

<l n="tr">ten years withstood. But look! this day hath spent</l>
<l n="tr">its better part. In what remains, rejoice</l>
<l n="tr">in noble deeds well done; let weary flesh</l>

<l n="tr">Meanwhile to block their gates with wakeful guard</l>

<l n="tr">their camp with watchfires. Then a chosen band,</l>
<l n="tr">twice seven Rutulian chieftains, man the walls</l>
<l n="tr">with soldiery; each leads a hundred men</l>
<l n="tr">crested with crimson, armed with glittering gold.</l>
<l n="tr">Some post to separate sentries, and prepare</l>
<l n="tr">alternate vigil; others, couched on grass,</l>
<l n="tr">laugh round the wine and lift the brazen bowls.</l>
<l n="tr">The camp-fires cheerly burn; the jovial guard</l>

<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="168" unit="card"/>The Trojans peering from the lofty walls</l>
<l n="tr">survey the foe, and arm for sure defence</l>
<l n="tr">of every point exposed. They prove the gates</l>
<l n="tr">with fearful care, bind bridge with tower, and bring</l>
<l n="tr">good store of javelins. Serestus bold</l>
<l n="tr">and Mnestheus to their labors promptly fly,</l>
<l n="tr">whom Sire Aeneas bade in time of stress</l>
<l n="tr">to have authority and free command</l>
<l n="tr">over his warriars. Along the walls</l>
<l n="tr">the legions, by the cast of lots, divide</l>
<l n="tr">the pain and peril, giving each his due</l>
<l n="tr">of alternating vigil and repose.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="176" unit="card"/>Nisus kept sentry at the gate: a youth</l>
<l n="tr">of eager heart for noble deeds, the son</l>
<l n="tr">of Hyrtacus, whom in Aeneas' train</l>
<l n="tr">Ida the huntress sent; swift could he speed</l>
<l n="tr">the spear or light-winged arrow to its aim.</l>
<l n="tr">Beside him was Euryalus, his friend:</l>
<l n="tr">of all th' Aeneadae no youth more fair</l>
<l n="tr">wore Trojan arms; upon his cheek unshorn</l>
<l n="tr">the tender bloom of boyhood lingered still.</l>
<l n="tr">Their loving hearts were one, and oft in war</l>
<l n="tr">they battled side by side, as in that hour</l>
<l n="tr">a common sentry at the gate they shared.</l>
<l n="tr">Said Nisus: &ldquo;Is it gods above that breathe</l>
<l n="tr">this fever in my soul, Euryalus?</l>
<l n="tr">or is the tyrant passion of each breast</l>
<l n="tr">the god it serves? Me now my urgent mind</l>
<l n="tr">to battles or some mighty deed impels,</l>
<l n="tr">and will not give me rest. Look yonder, where</l>
<l n="tr">the Rutuli in dull security</l>
<l n="tr">the siege maintain. Yet are their lights but few.</l>
<l n="tr">They are asleep or drunk, and in their line</l>
<l n="tr">is many a silent space. O, hear my thought,</l>
<l n="tr">and what my heart is pondering. To recall</l>
<l n="tr">Aeneas is the dearest wish to-night</l>
<l n="tr">of all, both high and low. They need true men</l>
<l n="tr">to find him and bring tidings. If our chiefs</l>
<l n="tr">but grant me leave to do the thing I ask</l>
<l n="tr">(Claiming no reward save what honor gives),</l>
<l n="tr">methinks I could search out by yonder hill</l>
<l n="tr">a path to Pallanteum.&rdquo; The amazed</l>
<l n="tr">Euryalus, flushed warm with eager love</l>
<l n="tr">for deeds of glory, instantly replied</l>
<l n="tr">to his high-hearted friend: &ldquo;Dost thou refuse,</l>
<l n="tr">my Nisus, to go with me hand in hand</l>
<l n="tr">when mighty deeds are done? Could I behold</l>
<l n="tr">thee venturing alone on danger? Nay!</l>
<l n="tr">Not thus my sire Opheltes, schooled in war,</l>
<l n="tr">taught me his true child, 'mid the woes of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName></l>
<l n="tr">and <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> terrors reared; not thus with thee</l>
<l n="tr">have I proved craven, since we twain were leal</l>
<l n="tr">to great Aeneas, sharing all his doom.</l>
<l n="tr">In this breast also is a heart which knows</l>
<l n="tr">contempt of life, and deems such deeds, such praise,</l>
<l n="tr">well worth a glorious death.&rdquo; Nisus to him:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;I have not doubted thee, nor e'er could have</l>
<l n="tr">one thought disloyal. May almighty Jove,</l>
<l n="tr">or whatsoe'er good power my purpose sees,</l>
<l n="tr">bring me triumphant to thy arms once more!</l>
<l n="tr">But if, as oft in doubtful deeds befalls,</l>
<l n="tr">some stroke of chance, or will divine, should turn</l>
<l n="tr">to adverse, 't is my fondest prayer that thou</l>
<l n="tr">shouldst live the longer of us twain. Thy years</l>
<l n="tr">suit better with more life. Oh! let there be</l>
<l n="tr">one mourner true to carry to its grave</l>
<l n="tr">my corpse, recaptured in the desperate fray,</l>
<l n="tr">or ransomed for a price. Or if this boon</l>
<l n="tr">should be&mdash;'t is Fortune's common way&mdash;refused,</l>
<l n="tr">then pay the debt of grief and loyal woe</l>
<l n="tr">unto my far-off dust, and garlands leave</l>
<l n="tr">upon an empty tomb. No grief I give</l>
<l n="tr">to any sorrowing mother; one alone,</l>
<l n="tr">of many Trojan mothers, had the heart</l>
<l n="tr">to follow thee, her child, and would not stay</l>
<l n="tr">in great Acestes' land.&rdquo; His friend replied:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Thou weavest but a web of empty words</l>
<l n="tr">and reasons vain, nor dost thou shake at all</l>
<l n="tr">my heart's resolve. Come, let us haste away!&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">He answered so, and summoned to the gate</l>
<l n="tr">a neighboring watch, who, bringing prompt relief,</l>
<l n="tr">the sentry-station took; then quitted he</l>
<l n="tr">his post assigned; at Nisus' side he strode,</l>
<l n="tr">and both impatient sped them to the King.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="224" unit="card"/>Now in all lands all creatures that have breath</l>
<l n="tr">lulled care in slumber, and each heart forgot</l>
<l n="tr">its load of toil and pain. But they who led</l>
<l n="tr">the Teucrian cause, with all their chosen brave,</l>
<l n="tr">took counsel in the kingdom's hour of need</l>
<l n="tr">what action to command or whom dispatch</l>
<l n="tr">with tidings to Aeneas. In mid-camp</l>
<l n="tr">on long spears leaning and with ready shield</l>
<l n="tr">to leftward slung, th' assembled warriors stood.</l>
<l n="tr">Thither in haste arrived the noble pair,</l>

<l n="tr">and craved a hearing, for their suit, they said,</l>
<l n="tr">was urgent and well-worth a patient ear.</l>
<l n="tr">Iulus to the anxious striplings gave</l>
<l n="tr">a friendly welcome, bidding Nisus speak.</l>
<l n="tr">The son of Hyrtacus obeyed: &ldquo;O, hear,</l>
<l n="tr">Princes of Teucria, with impartial mind,</l>
<l n="tr">nor judge by our unseasoned youth the worth</l>
<l n="tr">of what we bring. Yon Rutule watch is now</l>
<l n="tr">in drunken sleep, and all is silent there.</l>
<l n="tr">With our own eyes we picked out a good place</l>
<l n="tr">to steal a march, that cross-road by the gate</l>
<l n="tr">close-fronting on the bridge. Their lines of fire</l>
<l n="tr">are broken, and a murky, rolling smoke</l>
<l n="tr">fills all the region. If ye grant us leave</l>
<l n="tr">by this good luck to profit, we will find</l>
<l n="tr">Aeneas and the walls of <placeName key="tgn,3000935">Palatine</placeName>,</l>
<l n="tr">and after mighty slaughter and huge spoil</l>
<l n="tr">ye soon shall see us back. Nor need ye fear</l>
<l n="tr">we wander from the way. Oft have we seen</l>
<l n="tr">that city's crest loom o'er the shadowy vales,</l>
<l n="tr">where we have hunted all day long and know</l>
<l n="tr">each winding of yon river.&rdquo; <milestone ed="p" n="246" unit="card"/>Then uprose</l>
<l n="tr">aged Aletes, crowned with wisdom's years:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Gods of our fathers, who forevermore</l>
<l n="tr">watch over <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, ye surely had no mind</l>
<l n="tr">to blot out Teucria's name, when ye bestowed</l>
<l n="tr">such courage on young hearts, and bade them be</l>
<l n="tr">so steadfast and so leal.&rdquo; Joyful he clasped</l>
<l n="tr">their hands in his, and on their shoulders leaned,</l>
<l n="tr">his aged cheek and visage wet with tears.</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;What reward worthy of such actions fair,</l>
<l n="tr">dear heroes, could be given? Your brightest prize</l>
<l n="tr">will come from Heaven and your own hearts. The rest</l>
<l n="tr">Aeneas will right soon bestow; nor will</l>
<l n="tr">Ascanius, now in youth's unblemished prime,</l>
<l n="tr">ever forget your praise.&rdquo; Forthwith replied</l>
<l n="tr">Aeneas' son, &ldquo;By all our household gods,</l>
<l n="tr">by great Assaracus, and every shrine</l>
<l n="tr">of venerable Vesta, I confide</l>
<l n="tr">my hopes, my fortunes, and all future weal</l>
<l n="tr">to your heroic hearts. O, bring me back</l>
<l n="tr">my father! Set him in these eyes once more!</l>
<l n="tr">That day will tears be dry; and I will give</l>
<l n="tr">two silver wine-cups graven and o'erlaid</l>
<l n="tr">with clear-cut figures, which my father chose</l>
<l n="tr">out of despoiled Arisbe; also two</l>
<l n="tr">full talents of pure gold, and tripods twain,</l>
<l n="tr">and ancient wine-bowl, Tyrian Dido's token.</l>
<l n="tr">But if indeed our destiny shall be</l>
<l n="tr">to vanquish <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> in prosperous war,</l>
<l n="tr">to seize the sceptre and divide the spoil, &mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">saw you that steed of Turnus and the arms</l>
<l n="tr">in which he rode, all golden? That same steed,</l>
<l n="tr">that glittering shield and haughty crimson crest</l>
<l n="tr">I will reserve thee, e'er the lots are cast,</l>
<l n="tr">and, Nisus, they are thine. Hereto my sire</l>
<l n="tr">will add twelve captive maids of beauty rare,</l>
<l n="tr">and slaves in armor; last, thou hast the fields</l>
<l n="tr">which now Latinus holds. But as for thee,</l>
<l n="tr">to whom my youth but binds me closer still,</l>
<l n="tr">thee, kingly boy, my whole heart makes my own,</l>
<l n="tr">and through all changeful fortune we shall be</l>
<l n="tr">inseparable peers: nor will I seek</l>
<l n="tr">renown and glory, or in peace or war,</l>
<l n="tr">forgetting thee: but trust thee from this day</l>
<l n="tr">in deed and word.&rdquo; To him in answer spoke</l>
<l n="tr">euryalus, &ldquo;O, may no future show</l>
<l n="tr">this heart unworthy thy heroic call!</l>
<l n="tr">And may our fortune ever prosperous prove,</l>
<l n="tr">not adverse. But I now implore of thee</l>
<l n="tr">a single boon worth all beside. I have</l>
<l n="tr">a mother, from the venerated line</l>
<l n="tr">of Priam sprung, whom not the Trojan shore</l>
<l n="tr">nor King Acestes' city could detain,</l>
<l n="tr">alas! from following me. I leave her now</l>
<l n="tr">without farewell; nor is her love aware</l>
<l n="tr">of my supposed peril. For I swear</l>
<l n="tr">by darkness of this night and thy right hand,</l>
<l n="tr">that all my courage fails me if I see</l>
<l n="tr">a mother's tears. O, therefore, I implore,</l>
<l n="tr">be thou her sorrow's comfort and sustain</l>
<l n="tr">her solitary day. Such grace from thee</l>
<l n="tr">equip me for my war, and I shall face</l>
<l n="tr">with braver heart whatever fortune brings.&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">With sudden sorrow thrilled, the veteran lords</l>
<l n="tr">of Teucria showed their tears. But most of all</l>
<l n="tr">such likeness of his own heart's filial love</l>
<l n="tr">on fair Iulus moved, and thus he spoke:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Promise thyself what fits thy generous deeds.</l>
<l n="tr">Thy mother shall be mine, Creusa's name</l>
<l n="tr">alone not hers; nor is the womb unblest</l>
<l n="tr">that bore a child like thee. Whate'er success</l>
<l n="tr">may follow, I make oath immutable</l>
<l n="tr">by my own head, on which my father swore,</l>
<l n="tr">that all I promise thee of gift or praise</l>
<l n="tr">if home thou comest triumphing, shall be</l>
<l n="tr">the glory of thy mother and thy kin.&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">Weeping he spoke, and from his shoulder drew</l>
<l n="tr">the golden sword, well-wrought and wonderful,</l>
<l n="tr">which once in Crete Lycaon's cunning made</l>
<l n="tr">and sheathed in ivory. On Nisus then</l>
<l n="tr">Mnestheus bestowed a shaggy mantle torn</l>
<l n="tr">from a slain lion; good Aletes gave</l>
<l n="tr">exchange of crested helms. In such array</l>
<l n="tr">they hastened forth; and all the princely throng,</l>
<l n="tr">young men and old, ran with them to the gates,</l>
<l n="tr">praying all gods to bless. Iulus then,</l>
<l n="tr">a fair youth, but of grave, heroic soul</l>
<l n="tr">beyond his years, gave them in solemn charge</l>
<l n="tr">full many a message for his sire, but these</l>
<l n="tr">the hazard of wild winds soon scattered far,</l>
<l n="tr">and flung them fruitless on the darkening storm.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="314" unit="card"/>Forth through the moat they climb, and steal away</l>
<l n="tr">through midnight shades, to where their foemen lie</l>
<l n="tr">encamped in arms; of whom, before these fall,</l>
<l n="tr">a host shall die. Along the turf were seen,</l>
<l n="tr">laid low in heavy slumber and much wine,</l>
<l n="tr">a prostrate troop; the horseless chariots</l>
<l n="tr">stood tilted on the shore, 'twixt rein and wheel</l>
<l n="tr">the drivers dozed, wine-cups and idle swords</l>
<l n="tr">strewn round them without heed. The first to speak</l>
<l n="tr">was Nisus. &ldquo;Look, Euryalus,&rdquo; he cried,</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Now boldly strike. The hour to do the deed</l>
<l n="tr">is here, the path this way. Keep wide-eyed watch</l>
<l n="tr">that no man smite behind us. I myself</l>
<l n="tr">will mow the mighty fieid, and lead thee on</l>
<l n="tr">in a wide swath of slaughter.&rdquo; With this word</l>
<l n="tr">he shut his lips; and hurled him with his sword</l>
<l n="tr">on haughty Rhamnes, who lay propped at ease</l>
<l n="tr">on pillows huge, and from his heaving breast</l>
<l n="tr">poured slumber loud: of royal stem was he</l>
<l n="tr">and honored of King Turnus for his skill</l>
<l n="tr">in augury; yet could no augur's charm</l>
<l n="tr">that bloody stroke forefend. And Nisus slew</l>
<l n="tr">three slaves near by, that lay in reckless sleep</l>
<l n="tr">upon their spears; then him that bore the shield</l>
<l n="tr">of Remus, then the driver of his car</l>
<l n="tr">close to the horses caught; his sword cut through</l>
<l n="tr">their prostrate necks; then their great master's head</l>
<l n="tr">he lifted high, and left decapitate</l>
<l n="tr">the huge corpse spilling forth its crimson gore</l>
<l n="tr">o'er couch and ground. Like stroke on Lamus fell</l>
<l n="tr">and Lamyrus, with young Serranus, who</l>
<l n="tr">had gamed the midnight through and sleeping lay,</l>
<l n="tr">his fair young body to the wine-god given;</l>
<l n="tr">but happier now had that long-revelling night</l>
<l n="tr">been merry till the dawn! Thus round full folds</l>
<l n="tr">of sheep a famished lion fiercely prowls;</l>
<l n="tr">mad hunger moves him; he devours and rends</l>
<l n="tr">with bloody, roaring mouth, the feeble flock</l>
<l n="tr">that trembles and is dumb. Nor was the sword</l>
<l n="tr">of fair Euryalus less fatal found;</l>
<l n="tr">but fiercely raging on his path of death,</l>
<l n="tr">he pressed on through a base and nameless throng,</l>
<l n="tr">Rhoetus, Herbesus, Fadus, Abaris;</l>
<l n="tr">surprising all save Rhoetus, who awake</l>
<l n="tr">saw every stroke, and crouched in craven fear</l>
<l n="tr">behind a mighty wine-bowl; but not less</l>
<l n="tr">clean through his bare breast as he started forth</l>
<l n="tr">the youth thrust home his sword, then drew it back</l>
<l n="tr">death-dripping, while the bursting purple stream</l>
<l n="tr">of life outflowed, with mingling blood and wine.</l>
<l n="tr">Then, flushed with stealthy slaughter, he crept near</l>
<l n="tr">the followers of Messapus, where he saw</l>
<l n="tr">their camp-fire dying down, and tethered steeds</l>
<l n="tr">upon the meadow feeding. Nisus then</l>
<l n="tr">knew the hot lust of slaughter had swept on </l>
<l n="tr">too far, and cried, &ldquo;Hold off! For, lo,</l>
<l n="tr">the monitory dawn is nigh. Revenge</l>
<l n="tr">has fed us to the full. We have achieved</l>
<l n="tr">clean passage through the foe.&rdquo; Full many a prize</l>
<l n="tr">was left untaken: princely suits of mail</l>
<l n="tr">enwrought with silver pure, huge drinking-bowls,</l>
<l n="tr">and broideries fair. Yet grasped Euryalus</l>
<l n="tr">the blazonry at Rhamnes' corselet hung,</l>
<l n="tr">and belt adorned with gold: which were a gift</l>
<l n="tr">to Remulus of <placeName key="perseus,Tibur">Tibur</placeName> from the store</l>
<l n="tr">of opulent Caedicus, who sued from far</l>
<l n="tr">to be a friend; and these in death he gave</l>
<l n="tr">to his son's son, who slain in battle fell,</l>
<l n="tr">and proud Rutulians seized them with the spoil.</l>
<l n="tr">Euryalus about his shoulder strong</l>
<l n="tr">this booty slung&mdash;unprofitable gain! &mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">and fitted on a gorgeous, crested helm</l>
<l n="tr">which once Messapus wore. So from the camp,</l>
<l n="tr">escaping danger, the two champions ran.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="367" unit="card"/>But horsemen from the Latin city sent</l>
<l n="tr">to join the serried legions of the plain</l>
<l n="tr">had come at Turnus' call, three hundred strong</l>
<l n="tr">all bearing shields, and under the command</l>
<l n="tr">of Volscens. Nigh the camp and walls they drew;</l>
<l n="tr">and soon they spied upon the leftward path</l>
<l n="tr">th' heroic pair, where in dim shades of night</l>
<l n="tr">the helmet of Euryalus betrayed</l>
<l n="tr">the heedless boy, and with a glancing beam</l>
<l n="tr">flashed on the foe. Nor was it seen in vain.</l>
<l n="tr">Loud from the line the voice of Volscens called:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Stand, gentlemen! What business brings you here?</l>
<l n="tr">Whose your allegiance? Whither speed so fast?&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">No answer gave they save to fly in haste</l>
<l n="tr">to cover of the forest and deep gloom</l>
<l n="tr">of the defensive night. The horsemen then</l>
<l n="tr">blocked every crossway known, and, scattering wide,</l>
<l n="tr">kept sentry at the entrance. The great wood</l>
<l n="tr">was all of tangled brush and blinding shade</l>
<l n="tr">of flex-boughs. Impenetrable thorns</l>
<l n="tr">had thickly overgrown, and seldom showed</l>
<l n="tr">a pathway through the maze. Euryalus,</l>
<l n="tr">by the black branches and his ponderous spoil</l>
<l n="tr">impeded, groped along in fearful doubt,</l>
<l n="tr">deceived and quite astray. Nisus his friend</l>
<l n="tr">had quit him, and incautiously had forced</l>
<l n="tr">a sally through the close-encircling foe,</l>
<l n="tr">into that region which should after bear</l>
<l n="tr">the name of Alba&mdash;a rude shelter then</l>
<l n="tr">for King Latinus' herds. He stayed him there</l>
<l n="tr">and looked, but vainly, for the comrade gone.</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Euryalus, ill-fated boy!&rdquo; he cried,</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Where have I lost thee in the pathless wild?</l>
<l n="tr">How find thee? How retrace the blinding maze</l>
<l n="tr">of yonder treacherous wood?&rdquo; Yet ere he said,</l>
<l n="tr">on his own path he turns him back, and scans</l>
<l n="tr">his own light footprints through the tangled thorn,</l>
<l n="tr">so dark and still. But suddenly he hears</l>
<l n="tr">the tread of horses, with confusing din</l>
<l n="tr">and tumult of pursuit. Nor was it long</l>
<l n="tr">he tarried ere upon his anguished ear</l>
<l n="tr">smote a great cry: and, lo! Euryalus,</l>
<l n="tr">trapped by the dark night, the deceptive ground,</l>
<l n="tr">faced the whole onset, and fell back o'erwhelmed</l>
<l n="tr">by a loud mob of foes, while his sole sword</l>
<l n="tr">tried many a thrust in vain. O, what defence</l>
<l n="tr">may Nisus bring? With what audacious arms</l>
<l n="tr">his chosen comrade save? Shall he make bare</l>
<l n="tr">his dying breast to all their swords, and run</l>
<l n="tr">to honorable death that bloody way?</l>
<l n="tr">he swung his spear with lifted arm, then looked</l>
<l n="tr">to the still moon, in heaven, and thus implored:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;O goddess, aid me in my evil case.</l>
<l n="tr">O glory of the stars, Latona's child!</l>
<l n="tr">O guardian of groves, if in my name</l>
<l n="tr">my father Hyrtacus made offerings</l>
<l n="tr">on burning altars, if my own right hand,</l>
<l n="tr">successful in the chase, ere hung its gift</l>
<l n="tr">beneath thy dome or on thy sacred wall,</l>
<l n="tr">grant me yon troop to scatter. Guide my spear</l>
<l n="tr">along its path in air.&rdquo; He spoke, and hurled</l>
<l n="tr">with all his gathered strength the shaft of steel.</l>
<l n="tr">the swift spear clove the shades of night, and struck</l>
<l n="tr">full in the back of Sulmo, where it split,</l>
<l n="tr">but tore through to his very heart. The breast</l>
<l n="tr">poured forth life's glowing stream, and he, o'erthrown</l>
<l n="tr">lay cold in death, while his huge, heaving sides</l>
<l n="tr">gave lingering throes. The men about him stared </l>
<l n="tr">this way and that. But Nisus, fiercer still,</l>
<l n="tr">poised level with his ear a second shaft,</l>
<l n="tr">and, while the foeman paused, the whizzing spear </l>
<l n="tr">straight through the brows of Tagus drove, and clung</l>
<l n="tr">deep in the cloven brain. <milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="card"/>In frenzy rose</l>
<l n="tr">Volscens, but nowhere could espy what hand</l>
<l n="tr">the shaft had hurled, nor whither his wild rage</l>
<l n="tr">could make reply. &ldquo;But thou,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;shalt feed</l>
<l n="tr">with thy hot blood my honor and revenge</l>
<l n="tr">for both the slain.&rdquo; Then with a sword unsheathed</l>
<l n="tr">upon Euryalus he fell. Loud shrieked</l>

<l n="tr">But Turnus launched a firebrand, and pierced</l>
<l n="tr">the wooden wall with flame, which in the wind</l>
<l n="tr">leaped larger, and devoured from floor to floor,</l>
<l n="tr">burning each beam away. The trembling guards</l>
<l n="tr">sought flight in vain; and while they crowded close</l>

<l n="tr">But Lyeus, swifter-footed, forced his way</l>
<l n="tr">past the opposing spears and made escape</l>

<l n="tr">some friend above: but Turnus, spear in hand,</l>
<l n="tr">had hotly followed, and exulting loud</l>
<l n="tr">thus taunted him, &ldquo;Hadst thou the hope, rash fool,</l>
<l n="tr">beyond this grasp to fly?&rdquo; So, as he clung,</l>

<l n="tr">on every side resound. In closer siege</l>

<l n="tr">or hurl hot-flaming torches at the towers.</l>
<l n="tr">Ilioneus with mountain-mass of stone</l>

<l n="tr">So saying, from his far, ethereal seat</l>
<l n="tr">he hied him down, and, cleaving the quick winds</l>
<l n="tr">drew near Ascanius. He wore the guise</l>

<l n="tr">infuriate, to smite the scattering foe.</l>
<l n="tr">First Phaleris he caught; then cut the knees</l>
<l n="tr">of Gyges; both their spears he snatched away</l>
<l n="tr">and hurled them at the rout; 't was Juno roused</l>

<l n="tr">and Phegeus, whom he pierced right through the shield:</l>
<l n="tr">next, at the walls and urging reckless war,</l>
<l n="tr">Alcander, Halius, and Noemon gave</l>
<l n="tr">their lives, and Prytanis went down. In vain</l>

<l n="tr">Beyond these ramparts lost what stronger lie?</l>
<l n="tr">Shall one lone man here in your walls confined,</l>

<l n="tr">no pity and no shame?&rdquo; Enflamed to fight</l>
<l n="tr">by words like these, they close the line, and stand</l>
<l n="tr">in strong array. So Turnus for a space</l>
<l n="tr">out of the battle step by step withdrew</l>
<l n="tr">to make the river-bank his rearguard strong;</l>
<l n="tr">whereat the Teucrians, shouting loud, swept on</l>

<l n="tr">valor and rage constrain him ne'er to cease</l>
<l n="tr">fronting the foe; yet not for all his ire</l>
<l n="tr">can he against such serried steel make way:</l>
<l n="tr">so Turnus backward with a lingering step</l>
<l n="tr">unwilling drew, and wrath his heart oterflowed.</l>
<l n="tr">for twice already had he cloven a path</l>
<l n="tr">into the foe's mid-press, and twice had driven</l>
<l n="tr">their flying lines in panic through the town.</l>
<l n="tr">But now the whole throng from the camp he sees</l>
<l n="tr">massed to the onset. Nor will Juno now</l>
<l n="tr">dare give him vigor to withstand, for Jove</l>
<l n="tr">had sent aerial Iris out of heaven</l>
<l n="tr">with stern commandment to his sister-queen</l>
<l n="tr">that Turnus from the Teucrian walls retire.</l>
<l n="tr">Therefore the warrior's shield avails no more,</l>
<l n="tr">nor his strong arm; but he is overthrown</l>
<l n="tr">by general assault. Around his brows</l>
<l n="tr">his smitten helmet rings; the ponderous mail</l>
<l n="tr">cracks under falling stones; the haughty plumes</l>
<l n="tr">are scattered from his head, nor can the boss</l>
<l n="tr">of his stout shield endure; the Trojans hurl</l>
<l n="tr">redoubled rain of spears; and with them speeds</l>
<l n="tr">Mnestheus like thunderbolt. The hero's flesh</l>
<l n="tr">dissolves in sweat; no room to breathe has he;</l>
<l n="tr">his limbs are spent and weary; his whole frame</l>
<l n="tr">shakes with his gasping breath: then bounding fort</l>
<l n="tr">with all his harness on, headlong he plunged</l>
<l n="tr">into the flowing stream; its yellow tide</l>
<l n="tr">embraced him as he fell, and gentle waves</l>

<l n="tr">and sped their foaming barks to <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName>'s plain,</l>

<l n="tr">ripped in her dying hour, and unto thee,</l>
<l n="tr">O Phoebus, vowed, because his infant days</l>

<l n="tr">stout Cisseus and gigantic Gyas; these</l>

<l n="tr">But while he vainly raves, the whirling spear</l>

<l n="tr">they hurled: some from Aeneas' helm or shield</l>
<l n="tr">glanced off in vain; some Venus' kindly power,</l>

<l n="tr">Aeneas then to true Achates cried:</l>

<l n="tr">Then one great shaft he seized and threw; it sped</l>

<l n="tr">his mail-clad heart. Impetuous to his aid</l>

<l n="tr">sheer off; with one great stone he crushed the brows</l>
<l n="tr">of Thoas, scattering wide the broken skull,</l>
<l n="tr">bones, brains, and gore. Halaesus' prophet-sire,</l>
<l n="tr">foreseeing doom, had hid him in dark groves;</l>
<l n="tr">but when the old man's fading eyes declined</l>
<l n="tr">in death, the hand of Fate reached forth and doomed</l>
<l n="tr">the young life to Evander's sword; him now</l>
<l n="tr">Pallas assailed, first offering this prayer:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;O Father Tiber, give my poising shaft</l>
<l n="tr">through stout Halaesus' heart its lucky way!</l>
<l n="tr">The spoil and trophy of the hero slain</l>
<l n="tr">on thine own oak shall hang.&rdquo; The god received</l>
<l n="tr">the vow, and while Halaesus held his shield</l>
<l n="tr">over Imaon, his ill-fated breast</l>
<l n="tr">lay naked to th' Arcadian's hungry spear.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="426" unit="card"/>But Lausus, seeing such a hero slain,</l>
<l n="tr">bade his troop have no fear, for he himself</l>
<l n="tr">was no small strength in war; and first he slew</l>
<l n="tr">Abas, who fought hard, and had ever seemed</l>
<l n="tr">himself the sticking-point and tug of war.</l>
  <l n="tr">Down went <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>'s warriors, and slain</l>
<l n="tr">etruscans fell, with many a Trojan brave</l>
<l n="tr">the Greek had spared. Troop charges upon troop</l>
<l n="tr">well-matched in might, with chiefs of like renown;</l>
<l n="tr">the last rank crowds the first;&mdash;so fierce the press</l>
<l n="tr">scarce hand or sword can stir. Here Pallas stands,</l>
<l n="tr">and pushes back the foe; before him looms</l>
<l n="tr">Lausus, his youthful peer, conspicuous both</l>
<l n="tr">in beauty; but no star will them restore</l>
<l n="tr">to home and native land. Yet would the King</l>
<l n="tr">of high <placeName key="perseus,Olympos,Lycia">Olympus</placeName> suffer not the pair</l>
<l n="tr">to close in battle, but each hero found</l>
<l n="tr">a later doom at hands of mightier foes.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="439" unit="card"/>Now Turnus' goddess-sister bids him haste</l>
<l n="tr">to Lausus' help. So he, in wheeling car,</l>
<l n="tr">cut through the lines; and when his friends he saw,</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Let the fight stop! &ldquo; he cried, &ldquo;for none but I</l>
<l n="tr">may strike at Pallas; unto me alone</l>
<l n="tr">the prize of Pallas falls. I would his sire</l>
<l n="tr">stood by to see.&rdquo; He spake: his troop withdrew</l>
<l n="tr">a fitting space. But as they made him room,</l>
<l n="tr">the young prince, wondering at the scornful words,</l>
<l n="tr">looked upon Turnus, glancing up and down</l>
<l n="tr">that giant frame, and with fierce-frowning brows</l>
<l n="tr">scanned him from far, hurling defiant words</l>
<l n="tr">in answer to the King's. &ldquo;My honor now</l>
<l n="tr">shall have the royal trophy of this war,</l>
<l n="tr">or glorious death. For either fortune fair</l>
<l n="tr">my sire is ready. Threaten me no more!&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">So saying, to the midmost space he strode,</l>
<l n="tr">and in Arcadian hearts the blood stood still.</l>
<l n="tr">Swift from his chariot Turnus leaped, and ran</l>
<l n="tr">to closer fight. As when some lion sees</l>
<l n="tr">from his far mountain-lair a raging bull</l>
<l n="tr">that sniffs the battle from the grassy field,</l>
<l n="tr">and down the steep he flies&mdash;such picture showed</l>
<l n="tr">grim Turnus as he came. But when he seemed</l>
<l n="tr">within a spear's cast, Pallas opened fight,</l>
<l n="tr">expecting Fortune's favor to the brave</l>
<l n="tr">in such unequal match; and thus he prayed:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;O, by my hospitable father's roof,</l>
<l n="tr">where thou didst enter as a stranger-guest,</l>
<l n="tr">hear me, Alcides, and give aid divine</l>
<l n="tr">to this great deed. Let Turnus see these hands</l>
<l n="tr">strip from his half-dead breast the bloody spoil!</l>
<l n="tr">and let his eyes in death endure to see</l>
<l n="tr">his conqueror!&rdquo; Alcides heard the youth:</l>
<l n="tr">but prisoned in his heart a deep-drawn sigh,</l>
<l n="tr">and shed vain tears; for Jove, the King and Sire, .</l>
<l n="tr">spoke with benignant accents to his son:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;To each his day is given. Beyond recall</l>
<l n="tr">man's little time runs by: but to prolong</l>
<l n="tr">life's glory by great deeds is virtue's power.</l>
<l n="tr">Beneath the lofty walls of fallen <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName></l>
<l n="tr">fell many a son of Heaven. Yea, there was slain</l>
<l n="tr">Sarpedon, my own offspring. Turnus too</l>
<l n="tr">is summoned to his doom, and nears the bounds</l>
<l n="tr">of his appointed span.&rdquo; So speaking, Jove</l>
<l n="tr">turned from Rutulia's war his eyes away.</l>
<l n="tr">But Pallas hurled his lance with might and main,</l>
<l n="tr">and from its hollow scabbard flashed his sword.</l>
<l n="tr">The flying shaft touched where the plated steel</l>
<l n="tr">over the shoulders rose, and worked its way</l>
<l n="tr">through the shield's rim&mdash;then falling, glanced aside</l>
<l n="tr">from Turnus' giant body. <milestone ed="p" n="479" unit="card"/>Turnus then</l>
<l n="tr">poised, without haste, his iron-pointed spear,</l>
<l n="tr">and, launching it on Pallas, cried, &ldquo;Look now</l>
<l n="tr">will not this shaft a good bit deeper drive?&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">He said: and through the mid-boss of the shield,</l>
<l n="tr">steel scales and brass with bull's-hide folded round,</l>
<l n="tr">the quivering spear-point crashed resistlessly,</l>
<l n="tr">and through the corselet's broken barrier</l>
<l n="tr">pierced Pallas' heart. The youth plucked out in vain</l>
<l n="tr">the hot shaft from the wound; his life and blood</l>
<l n="tr">together ebbed away, as sinking prone</l>
<l n="tr">on his rent side he fell; above him rang</l>
<l n="tr">his armor; and from lips with blood defiled</l>
<l n="tr">he breathed his last upon his foeman's ground.</l>
<l n="tr">Over him Turnus stood: &ldquo;Arcadians all,&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">He cried, &ldquo;take tidings of this feat of arms</l>
<l n="tr">to King Evander. With a warrior's wage</l>
<l n="tr">his Pallas I restore, and freely grant</l>
<l n="tr">what glory in a hero's tomb may lie,</l>
<l n="tr">or comfort in a grave. They dearly pay</l>
<l n="tr">who bid Aeneas welcome at their board.&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">So saying, with his left foot he held down</l>
<l n="tr">the lifeless form, and raised the heavy weight</l>
<l n="tr">of graven belt, which pictured forth that crime</l>
<l n="tr">of youthful company by treason slain,</l>
<l n="tr">all on their wedding night, in bridal bowers</l>
<l n="tr">to horrid murder given,&mdash;which Clonus, son</l>
<l n="tr">of Eurytus, had wrought in lavish gold;</l>
<l n="tr">this Turnus in his triumph bore away,</l>
<l n="tr">exulting in the spoil. O heart of man,</l>
<l n="tr">not knowing doom, nor of events to be!</l>
<l n="tr">Nor, being lifted up, to keep thy bounds</l>
<l n="tr">in prosperous days! To Turnus comes the hour</l>
<l n="tr">when he would fain a prince's ransom give</l>
<l n="tr">had Pallas passed unscathed, and will bewail</l>
<l n="tr">cuch spoil of victory. With weeping now</l>
<l n="tr">and lamentations Ioud his comrades lay</l>
<l n="tr">young Pallas on his shield, and thronging close</l>
<l n="tr">carry him homeward with a mournful song:</l>
<l n="tr">alas! the sorrow and the glorious gain</l>
<l n="tr">thy sire shall have in thee. For one brief day</l>
<l n="tr">bore thee to battle and now bears away;</l>
<l n="tr">yet leavest thou full tale of foemen slain.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="510" unit="card"/>No doubtful rumor to Aeneas breaks</l>
<l n="tr">the direful news, but a sure messenger</l>
<l n="tr">tells him his followers' peril, and implores</l>
<l n="tr">prompt help for routed <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>. His ready sword</l>
<l n="tr">reaped down the nearest foes, and through their line</l>
<l n="tr">clove furious path and broad; the valiant blade</l>
<l n="tr">through oft-repeated bloodshed groped its way,</l>
<l n="tr">proud Turnus, unto thee! His heart beholds</l>
<l n="tr">Pallas and Sire Evander, their kind board</l>
<l n="tr">in welcome spread, their friendly league of peace</l>
<l n="tr">proffered and sealed with him, the stranger-guest.</l>
<l n="tr">So Sulmo's sons, four warriors, and four</l>
<l n="tr">of Ufens sprung, he took alive&mdash;to slay</l>
<l n="tr">as victims to the shades, and pour a stream</l>
<l n="tr">of captives' blood upon a flaming pyre.</l>
<l n="tr">Next from afar his hostile shaft he threw</l>
<l n="tr">at Mago, who with wary motion bowed</l>
<l n="tr">beneath the quivering weapon, as it sped</l>
<l n="tr">clean over him; then at Aeneas' knees</l>
<l n="tr">he crouched and clung with supplicating cry:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;O, by thy father's spirit, by thy hope</l>
<l n="tr">in young Iulus, I implore thee, spare</l>
<l n="tr">for son and father's sake this life of mine.</l>
<l n="tr">A lofty house have I, where safely hid</l>
<l n="tr">are stores of graven silver and good weight</l>
<l n="tr">of wrought and unwrought gold. The fate of war</l>
<l n="tr">hangs not on me; nor can one little life</l>
<l n="tr">thy victory decide.&rdquo; In answer spoke</l>
<l n="tr">Aeneas: &ldquo;Hoard the silver and the gold</l>
<l n="tr">for thy own sons. Such bartering in war</l>
<l n="tr">finished with Turnus, when fair Pallas fell.</l>
<l n="tr">Thus bids Anchises' shade, Iulus&mdash;thus!&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">He spoke: and, grasping with his mighty left</l>
<l n="tr">the helmet of the vainly suppliant foe,</l>
<l n="tr">bent back the throat and drove hilt-deep his sword.</l>
<l n="tr">A little space removed, Haemonides,</l>
<l n="tr">priest of Phoebus and pale Trivia, stood,</l>
<l n="tr">whose ribboned brows a sacred fillet bound:</l>
<l n="tr">in shining vesture he, and glittering arms.</l>
<l n="tr">Him too the Trojan met, repelled, and towered</l>
<l n="tr">above the fallen form, o'ermantling it</l>
<l n="tr">in mortal shade; Serestus bore away</l>
<l n="tr">those famous arms a trophy vowed to thee,</l>
<l n="tr">Gradivus, Iord of war! <milestone ed="p" n="543" unit="card"/>Soon to fresh fight</l>
<l n="tr">came Caeculus, a child of Vulcan's line,</l>
<l n="tr">and Umbro on the Marsic mountains bred:</l>
<l n="tr">these met the Trojan's wrath. His sword shore off</l>
<l n="tr"><placeName key="tgn,7006704">Anxur</placeName>'s left hand, and the whole orbed shield</l>
<l n="tr">dropped earthward at the stroke: though <placeName key="tgn,7006704">Anxur</placeName>'s tongue </l>
<l n="tr">had boasted mighty things, as if great words</l>
<l n="tr">would make him strong, and lifting his proud heart</l>
<l n="tr">as high as heaven, had hoped perchance to see</l>
<l n="tr">gray hairs and length of days. Then Tarquitus</l>
<l n="tr">strode forth, exulting in his burnished arms</l>
<l n="tr">(Him Dryope, the nymph, to Faunus bore),</l>
<l n="tr">and dared oppose Aeneas' rage. But he</l>
<l n="tr">drew back his lance and, charging, crushed at once</l>
<l n="tr">corselet and ponderous shield; then off he struck</l>
<l n="tr">the supplicating head, which seemed in vain</l>
<l n="tr">preparing speech; while o'er the reeking corpse</l>
<l n="tr">the victor stood, and thrusting it away</l>
<l n="tr">spoke thus with wrathful soul: &ldquo;Now lie thou there,</l>
<l n="tr">thou fearsome sight! No noble mother's hand</l>
<l n="tr">shall hide thee in the ground, or give those limbs</l>
<l n="tr">to their ancestral tomb. Thou shalt be left</l>

<l n="tr">where starving fishes on those wounds shall feed.&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">Antceus next and Lucas he pursues,</l>

<l n="tr">and Camers tawny-tressed, the son and heir</l>
<l n="tr">of Volscens the stout-hearted, whose domain</l>

<l n="tr">Like old Aegaeon of the hundred arms,</l>

<l n="tr">blazed fifty fiery blasts, as he made war</l>
<l n="tr">with fifty sounding shields and fifty swords</l>
<l n="tr">against Jove's thunder;&mdash;so Aeneas raged</l>
<l n="tr">victorious o'er the field, when once his steel</l>
<l n="tr">warmed to its work. But lo, he turns him now</l>
<l n="tr">where come Niphaeus' bold-advancing wheels</l>
<l n="tr">and coursers four, who, when at furious speed</l>
<l n="tr">they faced his giant stride and dreadful cry,</l>
<l n="tr">upreared in panic, and reversing spilled</l>
<l n="tr">their captain to the ground, and bore away</l>
<l n="tr">the chariot to the river's distant shore.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="575" unit="card"/>Meanwhile, with two white coursers to their car,</l>
<l n="tr">the brothers Lucagus and Liger drove</l>
<l n="tr">into the heart of battle: Liger kept</l>
<l n="tr">with skilful hand the manage of the steeds;</l>
<l n="tr">bold Lucagus swung wide his naked sword.</l>
<l n="tr">Aeneas, by their wrathful brows defied,</l>
<l n="tr">brooked not the sight, but to the onset flew,</l>
<l n="tr">huge-looming, with adverse and threatening spear.</l>
<l n="tr">Cried Liger, &ldquo;Not Achilles' chariot, ours!</l>
<l n="tr">Nor team of Diomed on <placeName key="tgn,7002613">Phrygia</placeName>'s plain!</l>
<l n="tr">The last of life and strife shall be thy meed</l>
<l n="tr">upon this very ground.&rdquo; Such raving word</l>
<l n="tr">flowed loud from Liger's lip: not with a word</l>
<l n="tr">the Trojan hero answered him, but flung</l>
<l n="tr">his whirling spear; and even as Lucagus</l>
<l n="tr">leaned o'er the horses, goading them with steel,</l>
<l n="tr">and, left foot forward, gathered all his strength</l>
<l n="tr">to strike&mdash;the spear crashed through the under rim</l>
<l n="tr">of his resplendent shield and entered deep</l>
<l n="tr">in the left groin; then from the chariot fallen,</l>
<l n="tr">the youth rolled dying on the field, while thus</l>
<l n="tr">pious Aeneas paid him taunting words:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;O Lucagus, thy chariot did not yield</l>
<l n="tr">because of horses slow to fly, or scared</l>
<l n="tr">by shadows of a foe. It was thyself</l>
<l n="tr">leaped o'er the wheel and fled.&rdquo; So saying, he grasped</l>
<l n="tr">the horses by the rein. The brother then,</l>
<l n="tr">spilled also from the car, reached wildly forth</l>
<l n="tr">his helpless hands: &ldquo;O, by thy sacred head,</l>
<l n="tr">and by the parents who such greatness gave,</l>
<l n="tr">good Trojan, let me live! Some pity show</l>
<l n="tr">to prostrate me!&rdquo; But ere he longer sued,</l>
<l n="tr">Aeneas cried, &ldquo;Not so thy language ran</l>
<l n="tr">a moment gone! Die thou! Nor let this day</l>
<l n="tr">brother from brother part!&rdquo; Then where the life</l>
<l n="tr">hides in the bosom, he thrust deep his sword.</l>
<l n="tr">Thus o'er the field of war the Dardan King</l>
<l n="tr">moved on, death-dealing: like a breaking flood</l>
<l n="tr">or cloudy whirlwind seemed his wrath. Straightway</l>
<l n="tr">the boy Ascanius from the ramparts came,</l>
<l n="tr">his warriors with him; for the siege had failed.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="606" unit="card"/>Now Jupiter to Juno thus began:</l>

<l n="tr">whose favor props&mdash;O, what discernment thine! </l>
<l n="tr">Yon Trojan power; not swift heroic hands,</l>
<l n="tr">or souls of fury facing perilous war!&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">Juno made meek reply: &ldquo;O noblest spouse!</l>
<l n="tr">Why vex one sick at heart, who humbly fears</l>
<l n="tr">thy stern command? If I could claim to-day</l>
<l n="tr">what once I had, my proper right and due,</l>

<l n="tr">to lead off Turnus from the fight unscathed,</l>
<l n="tr">and save him at his father Daunus' prayer.</l>
<l n="tr">Aye, let him die! And with his loyal blood</l>

<l n="tr">from our Saturnian stem, by fourth remove</l>
<l n="tr">sprung from Pilumnus. Oft his liberal hands</l>
<l n="tr">have heaped unstinted offering at thy shrine.&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">Thus in few words th' Olympian King replied:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;If for the fated youth thy prayer implores</l>
<l n="tr">delay and respite of impending doom,</l>
<l n="tr">if but so far thou bidst me interpose,&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">go&mdash;favor Turnus' flight, and keep him safe</l>
<l n="tr">in this imperilled hour; I may concede</l>
<l n="tr">such boon. But if thy pleading words intend</l>
<l n="tr">some larger grace, and fain would touch or change</l>
<l n="tr">the issue of the war, then art thou fed</l>
<l n="tr">on expectation vain.&rdquo; With weeping eyes</l>
<l n="tr">Juno made answer: &ldquo;Can it be thy mind</l>

<l n="tr">some cruel close his guiltless day shall see&mdash;</l>

<l n="tr">and girdled with the storm. She took her way </l>
<l n="tr">to where <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>'s warriors faced Laurentum's line.</l>
<l n="tr">There of a hollow cloud the goddess framed</l>
<l n="tr">a shape of airy, unsubstantial shade,</l>

<l n="tr">and windy words she gave of soulless sound,</l>
<l n="tr">and motion like a stride&mdash;such shapes, they say,</l>
<l n="tr">the hovering phantoms of the dead put on,</l>
<l n="tr">or empty dreams which cheat our slumbering eyes.</l>
<l n="tr">Forth to the front of battle this vain shade</l>
<l n="tr">stalked insolent, and with its voice and spear</l>
<l n="tr">challenged the warrior. At it Turnus flew,</l>
<l n="tr">and hurled a hissing spear with distant aim;</l>
<l n="tr">the thing wheeled round and fled. The foe forthwith,</l>
<l n="tr">thinking Aeneas vanquished, with blind scorn</l>
<l n="tr">flattered his own false hope: &ldquo;Where wilt thou fly,</l>
<l n="tr">Aeneas? Wilt thou break a bridegroom's word?</l>
<l n="tr">This sword will give thee title to some land</l>
<l n="tr">thou hast sailed far to find!&rdquo; So clamoring loud</l>
<l n="tr">he followed, flashing far his naked sword;</l>
<l n="tr">nor saw the light winds waft his dream away.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="653" unit="card"/>By chance in covert of a lofty crag</l>
<l n="tr">a ship stood fastened and at rest; her sides</l>

<l n="tr">Aeneas' counterfeit of flight and fear,</l>
<l n="tr">and dropped to darkness. Turnus, nothing loth,</l>
<l n="tr">gave close chase, overleaping every bar,</l>
<l n="tr">and scaling the high bridge; but scarce he reached</l>
<l n="tr">the vessel's prow, when Juno cut her loose,</l>
<l n="tr">the cables breaking, and along swift waves</l>
<l n="tr">pushed her to sea. Yet in that very hour</l>
<l n="tr">Aeneas to the battle vainly called</l>
<l n="tr">the vanished foe, and round his hard-fought path</l>
<l n="tr">stretched many a hero dead. No longer now</l>

<l n="tr">visibly upward and was Iost in cloud,</l>

<l n="tr">in his own safety, but upraised his hands</l>
<l n="tr">in prayer to Heaven: &ldquo;O Sire omnipotent!</l>
<l n="tr">Didst thou condemn me to a shame like this?</l>
<l n="tr">Such retribution dire? Whither now?</l>
<l n="tr">Whence came I here? What panic wafts away</l>
<l n="tr">this Turnus&mdash;if 't is he? Shall I behold</l>
<l n="tr">Laurentum's towers once more? But what of those</l>
<l n="tr">my heroes yonder, who took oath to me,</l>
<l n="tr">and whom&mdash;O sin and shame!&mdash;I have betrayed</l>
<l n="tr">to horrible destruction? Even now</l>

<l n="tr">their dying groans. What is this thing I do?</l>
<l n="tr">Where will the yawning earth crack wide enough</l>
<l n="tr">beneath my feet? Ye tempests, pity me!</l>
<l n="tr">On rocks and reef&mdash;'t is Turnus' faithful prayer,</l>
<l n="tr">let this bark founder; fling it on the shoals</l>
<l n="tr">of wreckful isles, where no Rutulian eye</l>
<l n="tr">can follow me, or Rumor tell my shame.&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">With such wild words his soul tossed to and fro,</l>

<l n="tr">home to his heart, or cast him in the sea,</l>

<l n="tr">for now Aeneas thrust his potent blade</l>
<l n="tr">deep through the stripling's breast and out of sight;</l>
<l n="tr">through the light shield it passed&mdash;a frail defence</l>

<l n="tr">blood filled his bosom, and on path of air</l>
<l n="tr">down to the shades the mournful soul withdrew,</l>
<l n="tr">its body quitting. As Anchises' son</l>
<l n="tr">beheld the agonizing lips and brow</l>
<l n="tr">so wondrous white in death, he groaned aloud</l>
<l n="tr">in pity, and reached o'er him his right hand,</l>

<l n="tr">his brazen helmet hung, and on the sward</l>
<l n="tr">his ponderous arms lay resting. Round him watched</l>
<l n="tr">his chosen braves. He, gasping and in pain,</l>

<l n="tr">of his sore-grieving sire. But lo! his peers</l>
<l n="tr">bore the dead Lausus back upon his shield,</l>
<l n="tr">and wept to see so strong a hero quelled</l>
<l n="tr">by stroke so strong. From long way off the sire,</l>

<l n="tr">Would my own guilty life my debt had paid&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">yea, by a thousand deaths! But, see, I live!</l>
<l n="tr">Not yet from human kind and light of day</l>
<l n="tr">have I departed. But depart I will.&rdquo;</l>

<l n="tr">and though by reason of the grievous wound</l>
<l n="tr">his forces ebbed, yet with unshaken mien</l>
<l n="tr">he bade them lead his war-horse forth, his pride,</l>
<l n="tr">his solace, which from every war</l>
<l n="tr">victorious bore him home. The master then</l>
<l n="tr">to the brave beast, which seemed to know his pain,</l>
<l n="tr">spoke thus: &ldquo;My Rhoebus, we have passed our days</l>

<l n="tr">with shaggy horse-hair crest gleamed o'er his brow.</l>
<l n="tr">Swift to the front he rode: a mingled flood</l>
<l n="tr">surged in his heart of sorrow, wrath, and shame;</l>
<l n="tr">and thrice with loud voice on his foe he called.</l>

<l n="tr">He said, and moved forth with a threatening spear.</l>
<l n="tr">The other cried: &ldquo;Hast robbed me of my son,</l>
<l n="tr">and now, implacable, wouldst fright me more?</l>
<l n="tr">That way, that only, was it in thy power</l>

<l n="tr">another and another, riding swift</l>
<l n="tr">in wide gyration round him. But the shield,</l>

<l n="tr">in duel so ill-matched. With wrathful soul</l>
<l n="tr">at length he strode forth, and between the brows</l>
<l n="tr">of the wild war-horse planted his Iong spear.</l>
<l n="tr">Up reared the creature, beating at the air</l>
<l n="tr">with quivering feet, then o'er his fallen lord</l>

<l n="tr">pinning with ponderous shoulder to the ground.</l>
<l n="tr">The Trojans and the Latins rouse the skies</l>

<l n="tr">wild pulse of rage?&rdquo; The Tuscan in reply</l>
<l n="tr">with eyes uprolled, and gasping as he gave</l>
<l n="tr">long looks at heaven, recalled his fading mind:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Why frown at me and fume, O bitterest foe?</l>
<l n="tr">Why threaten death? To slay me is no sin.</l>
<l n="tr">Not to take quarter came I to this war,</l>
<l n="tr">not truce with thee did my lost Lausus crave,</l>
<l n="tr">yet this one boon I pray,&mdash;if mercy be</l>
<l n="tr">for fallen foes: O, suffer me when dead</l>

<l n="tr">what curses of my people ring me round.</l>
<l n="tr">Defend me from that rage! I pray to be</l>

<l n="tr">He spoke: then offered with unshrinking eye</l>

<l n="tr">for grief so great, but due that mournful sire.</l>
<l n="tr">Some busy them to build of osiers fine</l>
<l n="tr">the simple litter, twining sapling oaks</l>
<l n="tr">with evergreen, till o'er death's Iofty bed</l>
<l n="tr">the branching shade extends. Upon it lay,</l>
<l n="tr">as if on shepherd's couch, the youthful dead,</l>
<l n="tr">like fairest flower by virgin fingers culled,</l>
<l n="tr">frail violet or hyacinth forlorn,</l>
<l n="tr">of color still undimmed and leaf unmarred;</l>
<l n="tr">but from the breast of mother-earth no more</l>
<l n="tr">its life doth feed. Then good Aeneas brought</l>
<l n="tr">two broidered robes of scarlet and fine gold,</l>
<l n="tr">which with the gladsome labor of her hands</l>
<l n="tr">Sidonian Dido wrought him long ago,</l>
<l n="tr">the thin-spun gold inweaving. One of these</l>
<l n="tr">the sad prince o'er the youthful body threw</l>
<l n="tr">for parting gift; and with the other veiled</l>
<l n="tr">those tresses from the fire; he heaped on high</l>
<l n="tr">Laurentum's spoils of war, and bade to bring</l>
<l n="tr">much tribute forth: horses and arms he gave,</l>
<l n="tr">seized from the fallen enemy; with hands</l>
<l n="tr">fettered behind them filed a captive train</l>
<l n="tr">doomed to appease the shades, and with the flames</l>
<l n="tr">to mix their flowing blood. He bade his chiefs</l>
<l n="tr">set up the trunks of trees and clothe them well</l>
<l n="tr">with captured arms, inscribing on each one</l>
<l n="tr">some foeman's name. Then came Acoetes forth,</l>
<l n="tr">a wretched, worn old man, who beat his breast</l>
<l n="tr">with tight-clenched hands, and tore his wrinkled face</l>
<l n="tr">with ruthless fingers; oft he cast him down</l>
<l n="tr">full length along the ground. Then lead they forth</l>
<l n="tr">the blood-stained Rutule chariots of war;</l>
<l n="tr">Aethon, the war-horse, of his harness bare,</l>
<l n="tr">walks mournful by; big teardrops wet his cheek.</l>
<l n="tr">Some bear the lance and helm; for all the rest</l>
<l n="tr">victorious Turnus seized. Then filed along</l>
<l n="tr">a mournful Teucrian cohort; next the host</l>
<l n="tr">Etrurian and the men of Arcady</l>
<l n="tr">with trailing arms reversed. Aeneas now,</l>
<l n="tr">when the long company had passed him by,</l>
<l n="tr">spoke thus and groaned aloud: &ldquo;Ourselves from hence</l>
<l n="tr">are summoned by the same dread doom of war</l>
<l n="tr">to other tears. Farewell forevermore!</l>
<l n="tr">Heroic Pallas! be forever blest!</l>
<l n="tr">I bid thee hail, farewell!&rdquo; In silence then</l>
<l n="tr">back to the stronghold's Iofty walls he moved.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="card"/>Now envoys from the Latin citadel</l>
<l n="tr">came olive-crowned, to plead for clemency:</l>
<l n="tr">would he not yield those bodies of the dead</l>
<l n="tr">sword-scattered o'er the plain, and let them lie</l>
<l n="tr">beneath an earth-built tomb? Who wages war</l>
<l n="tr">upon the vanquished, the unbreathing slain?</l>
<l n="tr">To people once his hosts and kindred called,</l>
<l n="tr">would he not mercy show? To such a prayer,</l>
<l n="tr">deemed not unworthy, good Aeneas gave</l>
<l n="tr">the boon, and this benignant answer made:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Ye Latins, what misfortune undeserved</l>
<l n="tr">has snared you in so vast a war, that now</l>
<l n="tr">you shun our friendship? Have you here implored</l>
<l n="tr">peace for your dead, by chance of battle fallen?</l>
<l n="tr">Pain would I grant it for the living too.</l>
<l n="tr">I sailed not hither save by Heaven's decree,</l>
<l n="tr">which called me to this land. I wage no war</l>
<l n="tr">with you, the people; 't was your King refused</l>
<l n="tr">our proffered bond of peace, and gave his cause</l>
<l n="tr">to Turnus' arms. More meet and just it were</l>
<l n="tr">had Turnus met this death that makes you mourn.</l>
<l n="tr">If he would end our quarrel sword in hand,</l>
<l n="tr">thrusting us Teucrians forth, 't was honor's way</l>
<l n="tr">to cross his blade with mine; that man to whom</l>
<l n="tr">the gods, or his own valor, had decreed</l>
<l n="tr">the longer life, had lived. But now depart!</l>
<l n="tr">Beneath your lost friends light the funeral fires!&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">So spoke Aeneas; and with wonder mute</l>
<l n="tr">all stood at gaze, each turning to behold</l>
<l n="tr">his neighbor's face. <milestone ed="p" n="122" unit="card"/>Then Drances, full of years,</l>
<l n="tr">and ever armed with spite and slanderous word</l>
<l n="tr">against young Turnus, made this answering plea:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;O prince of mighty name, whose feats of arms</l>
<l n="tr">are even mightier! Trojan hero, how</l>
<l n="tr">shall my poor praise exalt thee to the skies?</l>
<l n="tr">Is it thy rectitude or strenuous war</l>
<l n="tr">most bids me wonder? We will bear thy word</l>
<l n="tr">right gladly to the city of our sires;</l>
<l n="tr">and there, if Fortune favor it, contrive</l>
<l n="tr">a compact with the Latin King. Henceforth</l>
<l n="tr">let Turnus find his own allies! Ourselves</l>
<l n="tr">will much rejoice to see thy destined walls,</l>
<l n="tr">and our own shoulders will be proud to bear</l>
<l n="tr">the stone for building <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>.&rdquo; Such speech he made,</l>
<l n="tr">and all the common voice consented loud.</l>
<l n="tr">So twelve days' truce they swore, and safe from harm</l>
<l n="tr">Latins and Teucrians unmolested roved</l>
<l n="tr">together o'er the wooded hills. Now rang</l>
<l n="tr">loud steel on ash-tree bole; enormous pines,</l>
<l n="tr">once thrusting starward, to the earth they threw;</l>
<l n="tr">and with industrious wedge asunder clove</l>
<l n="tr">stout oak and odorous cedar, piling high</l>
<l n="tr">harvest of ash-trees on the creaking wain.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="139" unit="card"/>Now Rumor, herald of prodigious woe,</l>
<l n="tr">to King Evander hied, Evander's house</l>
<l n="tr">and city filling, where, but late, her word</l>
<l n="tr">had told in Latium Pallas' victory.</l>
<l n="tr">th' Arcadians thronging to the city-gates</l>
<l n="tr">bear funeral torches, the accustomed way;</l>
<l n="tr">in lines of flame the long street flashes far,</l>
<l n="tr">lighting the fields beyond. To meet them moves</l>
<l n="tr">a Phrygian company, to join with theirs</l>
<l n="tr">its lamentation loud. The Latin wives,</l>
<l n="tr">soon as they saw them entering, aroused</l>
<l n="tr">the whole sad city with shrill songs of woe.</l>
<l n="tr">No hand could stay Evander. Forth he flew</l>
<l n="tr">into the midmost tumult, and fell prone</l>
<l n="tr">on his dead Pallas, on the resting bier;</l>
<l n="tr">he clung to the pale corse with tears, with groans,</l>
<l n="tr">till anguish for a space his lips unsealed:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Not this thy promise, Pallas, to thy sire,</l>
<l n="tr">to walk not rashly in the war-god's way.</l>
<l n="tr">I knew too well how honor's morning-star,</l>
<l n="tr">and sweet, foretasted glory tempt and woo</l>
<l n="tr">in a first battle. O first-fruit forlorn</l>
<l n="tr">of youth so fair! O prelude pitiless</l>
<l n="tr">of war approaching! O my vows and prayers,</l>
<l n="tr">which not one god would hear! My blessed wife,</l>
<l n="tr">how happy was the death that spared thee not</l>
<l n="tr">to taste this bitterness! But I, the while,</l>
<l n="tr">by living longer lived to meet my doom,&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">a father sole-surviving. Would I myself</l>
<l n="tr">had perished by the Rutule's cruel spear,</l>
<l n="tr">the Trojan's cause espousing! This breath of life</l>
<l n="tr">how gladly had I given! And O, that now</l>
<l n="tr">yon black solemnity were bearing home</l>
<l n="tr">myself, not Pallas, dead! Yet blame I not,</l>
<l n="tr">O Teucrians, the hallowed pact we made,</l>
<l n="tr">nor hospitable bond and clasp of hands.</l>
<l n="tr">This doom ye bring me was writ long ago,</l>
<l n="tr">for my old age. And though my child is fallen</l>
<l n="tr">untimely, I take comfort that he fell</l>
<l n="tr">where thousands of the Volscians slaughtered lie,</l>
<l n="tr">and into <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName> led the Teucrian arms.</l>
<l n="tr">What brighter glory could I crave in death</l>
<l n="tr">for thee, my Pallas, than Aeneas brings,</l>
<l n="tr">and Phrygian princes, and Etrurian lords</l>
<l n="tr">with all Etruria's legions? Lo, they bear</l>
<l n="tr">yon glittering spoils of victims of thy sword!</l>
<l n="tr">Thou, Turnus, too, wert now an effigy</l>
<l n="tr">in giant armor clad, if but his years</l>
<l n="tr">and strength full ripe had been fair match for thine!</l>
<l n="tr">But now my woes detain the Trojan host</l>
<l n="tr">from battle. I beseech ye haste away,</l>
<l n="tr">and bear this faithful message to your King:</l>
<l n="tr">since I but linger out a life I loathe,</l>
<l n="tr">without my Pallas, nothing but thy sword</l>
<l n="tr">can bid me live. Then let thy sword repay</l>
<l n="tr">its debt to sire and son by Turnus slain!</l>
<l n="tr">Such deed alone may with thy honor fit,</l>
<l n="tr">and happier fortunes. But my life to me</l>
<l n="tr">has no joy left to pray for, save to bring</l>
<l n="tr">my son that solace in the shadowy land.&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="182" unit="card"/>Meanwhile o'er sorrowing mortals the bright morn</l>
<l n="tr">had lifted her mild beam, renewing so</l>
<l n="tr">the burden of man's toil. Aeneas now</l>
<l n="tr">built funeral pyres along the winding shore,</l>
<l n="tr">King Tarchon at his side. Each thither brought</l>
<l n="tr">the bodies of his kin, observing well</l>
<l n="tr">all ancient ritual. The fuming fires</l>
<l n="tr">burned from beneath, till highest heaven was hid</l>
<l n="tr">in blackest, overmantling cloud. Three times</l>
<l n="tr">the warriors, sheathed in proud, resplendent steel,</l>
<l n="tr">paced round the kindling pyres; and three times</l>
<l n="tr">fair companies of horsemen circled slow,</l>
<l n="tr">with loud lamenting, round the doleful flame.</l>
<l n="tr">The wail of warriors and the trumpets' blare</l>
<l n="tr">the very welkin rend. Cast on the flames</l>
<l n="tr">are spoils of slaughtered Latins,&mdash;helms and blades,</l>
<l n="tr">bridles and chariot-wheels. Yet others bring</l>
<l n="tr">gifts to the dead familiar, their own shields</l>
<l n="tr">and unavailing spears. Around them slain</l>
<l n="tr">great herds of kine give tribute unto death:</l>
<l n="tr">swine, bristly-backed, from many a field are borne,</l>
<l n="tr">and slaughtered sheep bleed o'er the sacred fire.</l>
<l n="tr">So on the shore the wailing multitude</l>
<l n="tr">behold their comrades burning, and keep guard</l>
<l n="tr">o'er the consuming pyres, nor turn away</l>
<l n="tr">till cooling night re-shifts the globe of heaven,</l>
<l n="tr">thick-strewn with numberless far-flaming stars.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="203" unit="card"/>Likewise the mournful Latins far away</l>
<l n="tr">have built their myriad pyres. Yet of the slain</l>
<l n="tr">not few in graves are laid, and borne with tears</l>
<l n="tr">to neighboring country-side or native town;</l>
<l n="tr">the rest&mdash;promiscuous mass of dead unknown&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">to nameless and unhonored ashes burn;</l>
<l n="tr">with multitude of fires the far-spread fields</l>
<l n="tr">blaze forth unweariedly. But when from heaven</l>
<l n="tr">the third morn had dispelled the dark and cold,</l>
<l n="tr">the mournful bands raked forth the mingled bones</l>
<l n="tr">and plenteous ashes from the smouldering pyres,</l>
<l n="tr">then heaped with earth the one sepulchral mound.</l>
<l n="tr">Now from the hearth-stones of the opulent town</l>
<l n="tr">of old Latinus a vast wail burst forth,</l>
<l n="tr">for there was found the chief and bitterest share</l>
<l n="tr">of all the woe. For mothers in their tears,</l>
<l n="tr">lone brides, and stricken souls of sisters fond,</l>
<l n="tr">and boys left fatherless, fling curses Ioud</l>
<l n="tr">on Turnus' troth-plight and the direful war:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Let him, let Turnus, with his single sword</l>
<l n="tr">decide the strife,&rdquo;&mdash;they cry,&mdash;&ldquo;and who shall claim</l>
<l n="tr">Lordship of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> and power supreme.&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">Fierce Drances whets their fury, urging all</l>
<l n="tr">that Turnus singly must the challenge hear,</l>
<l n="tr">and singly wage the war; but others plead</l>
<l n="tr">in Turnus' favor; the Queen's noble name</l>
<l n="tr">protects him, and his high renown in arms</l>
<l n="tr">defends his cause with well-won trophies fair.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="card"/>Amid these tumults of the wrathful throng,</l>
<l n="tr">lo, the ambassadors to Diomed</l>
<l n="tr">arrive with cloudy forehead from their quest</l>
<l n="tr">in his illustrious town; for naught availed</l>
<l n="tr">their toilsome errand, nor the gifts and gold,</l>
<l n="tr">nor strong entreaty. Other help in war</l>
<l n="tr">the Latins now must find, or humbly sue</l>
<l n="tr">peace from the Trojan. At such tidings dire</l>
<l n="tr">even Latinus trembles: Heaven's decrees</l>
<l n="tr">and influence of gods too visible</l>
<l n="tr">sustain Aeneas; so the wrath divine</l>
<l n="tr">and new-filled sepulchres conspicuous</l>
<l n="tr">give warning clear. Therefore the King convenes</l>
<l n="tr">a general council of his captains brave</l>
<l n="tr">beneath the royal towers. They, gathering,</l>
<l n="tr">throng the approaches thither, where their Iord,</l>
<l n="tr">gray-haired Latinus, takes the central throne,</l>
<l n="tr">wearing authority with mournful brow.</l>
<l n="tr">He bids the envoys from Aetolia's King</l>
<l n="tr">sent back, to speak and tell the royal words</l>
<l n="tr">in order due. Forthwith on every tongue</l>
<l n="tr">fell silence, while the princely Venulus,</l>
<l n="tr">heeding his Iord's behest, began the parle:</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="243" unit="card"/>&ldquo;My countrymen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;our eyes have seen</l>
<l n="tr">strongholds of Greeks and Diomed the King.</l>
<l n="tr">We braved all perils to our journey's end</l>
<l n="tr">and clasped that hand whereof the dreadful stroke</l>
<l n="tr">wrought <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Ilium</placeName>'s fall. The hero built a town,</l>
<l n="tr">Argyripa, hereditary name,</l>
<l n="tr">near mount Garganus in Apulian land:</l>
<l n="tr">passing that city's portal and the King's,</l>
<l n="tr">we found free audience, held forth thy gifts,</l>
<l n="tr">and told our names and fatherland. We showed</l>
<l n="tr">what condict was enkindled, and what cause</l>
<l n="tr">brought us to Arpi's King. He, hearing all,</l>
<l n="tr">with brow benign made answer to our plea:</l>
<l n="tr">&lsquo;O happy tribes in Saturn's kingdom born,</l>
<l n="tr">Ausonia's ancient stem! What fortune blind</l>
<l n="tr">tempts ye from peace away, and now ensnares</l>
<l n="tr">in wars unknown? Look how we men that dared</l>
<l n="tr">lay <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Ilium</placeName> waste (I speak not of what woes</l>
<l n="tr">in battling neath her lofty walls we bore,</l>
<l n="tr">nor of dead warriors sunk in Simois' wave)</l>
<l n="tr">have paid the penalty in many a land</l>
<l n="tr">with chastisement accurst and changeful woe,</l>
<l n="tr">till Priam's self might pity. Let the star</l>

<l n="tr">Driven asunder from one field of war,</l>

<l n="tr">and wise Ulysses saw from <placeName key="tgn,7003867">Aetna</placeName>'s caves</l>
<l n="tr">the Cyclops gathering. Why name the throne</l>
<l n="tr">of Pyrrhus, or the violated hearth</l>
<l n="tr">whence fled Idomeneus? Or Locri cast</l>
<l n="tr">on <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>'s distant shore? For even he,</l>
<l n="tr">Lord of <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName> by the Greeks obeyed,</l>

<l n="tr">of that polluted wife, whose paramour</l>
<l n="tr">trapped <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>'s conqueror. The envious gods</l>
<l n="tr">withheld me also from returning home</l>
<l n="tr">to see once more the hearth-stone of my sires,</l>
<l n="tr">the wife I yearn for, and my Calydon,</l>
<l n="tr">the beauteous land. For wonders horrible</l>
<l n="tr">pursue me still. My vanished followers</l>
<l n="tr">through upper air take wing, or haunt and rove</l>
<l n="tr">in forms of birds the island waters o'er:</l>
<l n="tr">ah me, what misery my people feel!</l>
<l n="tr">The tall rocks ring with their lament and cry.</l>
<l n="tr">Naught else had I to hope for from that day</l>
<l n="tr">when my infatuate sword on gods I drew,</l>
<l n="tr">and outraged with abominable wound</l>

<l n="tr">in mortal fray. Believe me, I have known</l>
<l n="tr">the stature of him when he lifts his shield,</l>

<l n="tr">But when their hearts and troublous tongues were still,</l>

<l n="tr">ye had provided for your country's weal,</l>
<l n="tr">O Latins, as I urged. It is no time</l>
<l n="tr">to hold dispute, while, compassing our walls,</l>
<l n="tr">the foeman waits. Ill-omened war is ours </l>
<l n="tr">against a race of gods, my countrymen,</l>
<l n="tr">invincible, unwearied in the fray,</l>
<l n="tr">and who, though lost and fallen, clutch the sword.</l>
<l n="tr">If hope ye cherished of <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName>'s power,</l>
<l n="tr">dismiss it! For what hope ye have is found</l>
<l n="tr">in your own bosoms only. But ye know</l>
<l n="tr">how slight it is and small. What ruin wide</l>
<l n="tr">has fallen, is now palpable and clear.</l>
<l n="tr">No blame I cast. What valor's uttermost</l>
<l n="tr">may do was done; our kingdom in this war</l>
<l n="tr">strained its last thews. Now therefore I will tell</l>
<l n="tr">such project as my doubtful mind may frame,</l>
<l n="tr">and briefly, if ye give good heed, unfold:</l>
<l n="tr">an ancient tract have I, close-bordering</l>
<l n="tr">the river <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>; it runs westward far</l>
<l n="tr">beyond Sicania's bound, and filth it bears</l>
<l n="tr">to Rutule and Auruncan husbandmen,</l>
<l n="tr">who furrow its hard hills or feed their flocks</l>
<l n="tr">along the stonier slopes. Let this demesne,</l>
<l n="tr">together with its pine-clad mountain tall,</l>
<l n="tr">be given the Teucrian for our pledge of peace,</l>
<l n="tr">confirmed by free and equitable league,</l>
<l n="tr">and full alliance with our kingly power.</l>
<l n="tr">Let them abide there, if it please them so,</l>
<l n="tr">and build their city's wall. But if their hearts</l>
<l n="tr">for other land or people yearn, and fate</l>
<l n="tr">permits them hence to go, then let us build</l>
<l n="tr">twice ten good galleys of Italian oak,</l>
<l n="tr">or more, if they can man them. All the wood</l>
<l n="tr">lies yonder on the shore. Let them but say</l>
<l n="tr">how numerous and large the ships they crave,</l>
<l n="tr">and we will give the brass, the artisans,</l>
<l n="tr">and ship-supplies. Let us for envoys choose</l>
<l n="tr">a hundred of the Latins noblest born</l>
<l n="tr">to tell our message and arrange the peace,</l>
<l n="tr">bearing mild olive-boughs and weighty gifts</l>
<l n="tr">of ivory and gold, with chair of state</l>

<l n="tr">thus multiplies with words the people's ire:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;A course most clear, nor needing voice of mine,</l>
<l n="tr">thy council is, good King; for all men see</l>
<l n="tr">the way of public weal, but smother close</l>
<l n="tr">the telling of it. Turnus must concede</l>
<l n="tr">freedom to speak, and his own arrogance</l>
<l n="tr">diminish! Under his ill-boding star</l>
<l n="tr">and fatal conduct&mdash;yea, I speak it plain,</l>
<l n="tr">though with his naked steel my death he swear&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">yon host of princes fell, and we behold</l>
<l n="tr">the whole land bowed with grief; while he assails</l>
<l n="tr">the Trojan camp (beating such bold retreats!)</l>
<l n="tr">and troubles Heaven with war. One gift the more,</l>
<l n="tr">among the many to the Trojans given,</l>
<l n="tr">one chiefly, best of kings, thy choice should be.</l>
<l n="tr">Let not wild violence thy will restrain</l>
<l n="tr">from granting, sire, thy virgin daughter's hand</l>
<l n="tr">to son-in-law illustrious, in a match</l>
<l n="tr">worthy of both,&mdash;and thus the lasting bond</l>
<l n="tr">of peace establish. But if verily</l>
<l n="tr">our hearts and souls be weak with craven fear,</l>
<l n="tr">let us on Turnus call, and grace implore</l>
<l n="tr">even of him. Let him no more oppose;</l>
<l n="tr">but to his country and his King concede</l>
<l n="tr">their natural right. Why wilt thou o'er and o'er</l>
<l n="tr">fling thy poor countrymen in danger's way,</l>
<l n="tr">O chief and fountain of all <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName>'s pain?</l>
<l n="tr">War will not save us. Not a voice but sues</l>
<l n="tr">for peace, O Turnus! and, not less than peace,</l>
<l n="tr">its one inviolable pledge. Behold,</l>
<l n="tr">I lead in this petition! even I</l>
<l n="tr">whom thou dost feign thy foe&mdash;(I waste no words</l>
<l n="tr">denying)&mdash;look! I supplicate of thee,</l>
<l n="tr">take pity on thy kindred; drop thy pride,</l>
<l n="tr">and get thee home defeated. We have seen</l>
<l n="tr">slaughter enough, enough of funeral flames,</l>
<l n="tr">and many a wide field waste and desolate.</l>
<l n="tr">If glory move thee, if thy martial breast</l>
<l n="tr">so swell with strength, and if a royal dower</l>
<l n="tr">be thy dear dream, go, pluck thy courage up,</l>
<l n="tr">and front thy own brave bosom to the foe.</l>
<l n="tr">for, lo, that Turnus on his wedding day</l>
<l n="tr">may win a princess, our cheap, common lives&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">we the mere mob, unwept, unsepulchred&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">must be spilled forth in battle! Thou, I say,</l>
<l n="tr">if there be mettle in thee and some drops</l>

<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="376" unit="card"/>By such discourse he stirred the burning blood</l>
<l n="tr">of Turnus, who groaned loud and from his heart</l>
<l n="tr">this utterance hurled: &ldquo;O Drances, thou art rich</l>
<l n="tr">in large words, when the day of battle calls</l>
<l n="tr">for actions. If our senators convene</l>
<l n="tr">thou comest early. But the council hall</l>
<l n="tr">is not for swollen talk, such as thy tongue</l>
<l n="tr">in safety tosses forth; so long as walls</l>
<l n="tr">hold back thy foes, and ere the trenches flow</l>

<l n="tr">Why art thou tarrying? Wilt thou linger here,</l>

<l n="tr">whom this good sword to death and dark sent down,</l>

<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="399" unit="card"/>War will not save us? Fling that prophecy</l>
<l n="tr">on the doomed Dardan's head, or on thy own,</l>

<l n="tr">disturb the general cause. Extol the power</l>
<l n="tr">of a twice-vanquished people, and decry</l>

<l n="tr">if we be so unfriended that one rout</l>

<l n="tr">never turn backward, let us, then, for peace</l>
<l n="tr">offer petition, lifting to the foe</l>
<l n="tr">our feeble, suppliant hands. Yet would I pray</l>
<l n="tr">some spark of manhood such as once we knew</l>
<l n="tr">were ours once more! I count him fortunate,</l>
<l n="tr">and of illustrious soul beyond us all,</l>
<l n="tr">who, rather than behold such things, has fallen</l>
<l n="tr">face forward, dead, his teeth upon the dust.</l>
<l n="tr">But if we still have power, and men-at-arms</l>
<l n="tr">unwasted and unscathed, if there survive</l>
<l n="tr">Italian tribes and towns for help in war,</l>
<l n="tr">aye! if the Trojans have but won success</l>
<l n="tr">at bloody cost,&mdash;for they dig graves, I ween,</l>
<l n="tr">storm-smitten not less than we,&mdash;O, wherefore now</l>
<l n="tr">stand faint and shameful on the battle's edge?</l>
<l n="tr">Why quake our knees before the trumpet call?</l>
<l n="tr">Time and the toil of shifting, changeful days</l>
<l n="tr">restore lost causes; ebbing tides of chance</l>
<l n="tr">deceive us oft, which after at their flood</l>

<l n="tr">shall be Mezentius and Tolumnius,</l>

<l n="tr">Hither the noble Volscian stem sends down</l>

<l n="tr">that challenge. Drances is not called to pay</l>
<l n="tr">the debt of death, if wrath from Heaven impend;</l>
<l n="tr">nor his a brave man's name and fame to share.&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="card"/>Thus in their doubtful cause the chieftains strove.</l>
<l n="tr">Meanwhile Aeneas his assaulting line</l>
<l n="tr">moved forward. The ill tidings wildly sped</l>
<l n="tr">from royal hall to hall, and filled the town</l>
<l n="tr">with rumors dark: for now the Trojan host</l>
<l n="tr">o'er the wide plains from <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>'s wave was spread</l>
<l n="tr">in close array of war. The people's soul</l>
<l n="tr">was vexed and shaken, and its martial rage</l>
<l n="tr">rose to the stern compulsion. Now for arms</l>
<l n="tr">their terror calls; the youthful soldiery</l>
<l n="tr">clamor for arms; the sires of riper days</l>
<l n="tr">weep or repress their tears. On every side</l>
<l n="tr">loud shouts and cries of dissonant acclaim</l>
<l n="tr">trouble the air, as when in lofty grove</l>
<l n="tr">legions of birds alight, or by the flood</l>
<l n="tr">of Padus' fishy stream the shrieking swans</l>
<l n="tr">far o'er the vocal marish fling their song.</l>
<l n="tr">Then, seizing the swift moment, Turnus cried:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Once more, my countrymen,&mdash;ye sit in parle,</l>
<l n="tr">lazily praising peace, while yonder foe</l>
<l n="tr">speeds forth in arms our kingdom to obtain.&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">He spoke no more, but hied him in hot haste,</l>
<l n="tr">and from the housetop called, &ldquo;Volusus, go!</l>
<l n="tr">Equip the Volscian companies! Lead forth</l>
<l n="tr">my Rutules also! O'er the spreading plain,</l>
<l n="tr">ye brothers Coras and Messapus range</l>
<l n="tr">our host of cavalry! Let others guard</l>
<l n="tr">the city's gates and hold the walls and towers:</l>
<l n="tr">I and my followers elsewhere oppose</l>
<l n="tr">the shock of arms.&rdquo; <milestone ed="p" n="468" unit="card"/>Now to and fro they run</l>
<l n="tr">to man the walls. Father Latinus quits&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">the place of council and his large design,</l>
<l n="tr">vexed and bewildered by the hour's distress.</l>
<l n="tr">He blames his own heart that he did not ask</l>
<l n="tr">Trojan Aeneas for his daughter's Iord,</l>
<l n="tr">and gain him for his kingdom's lasting friend.</l>
<l n="tr">They dig them trenches at the gates, or lift</l>
<l n="tr">burden of stakes and stones. The horn's harsh note</l>
<l n="tr">sounds forth its murderous signal for the war;</l>
<l n="tr">striplings and women, in a motley ring,</l>
<l n="tr">defend the ramparts; the decisive hour</l>
<l n="tr">lays tasks on all. Upon the citadel</l>
<l n="tr">a train of matrons, with the doleful Queen,</l>
<l n="tr">toward Pallas' temple moves, and in their hand</l>
<l n="tr">are gifts and offerings. See, at their side</l>
<l n="tr">the maid Lavinia, cause of all these tears,</l>
<l n="tr">drops down her lovely eyes! The incense rolls</l>
<l n="tr">in clouds above the altar; at the doors</l>
<l n="tr">with wailing voice the women make this prayer:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Tritonian virgin, arbitress of war!</l>
<l n="tr">Break of thyself yon Phrygian robber's spear!</l>
<l n="tr">Hurl him down dying in the dust! Spill forth</l>
<l n="tr">his evil blood beneath our lofty towers!&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">Fierce Turnus girds him, emulous to slay:</l>
<l n="tr">a crimson coat of mail he wears, with scales</l>
<l n="tr">of burnished bronze; beneath his knees are bound</l>
<l n="tr">the golden greaves; upon his naked brow</l>
<l n="tr">no helm he wears; but to his thigh is bound</l>
<l n="tr">a glittering sword. Down from the citadel</l>
<l n="tr">runs he, a golden glory, in his heart</l>
<l n="tr">boldly exulting, while impatient hope</l>
<l n="tr">fore-counts his fallen foes. He seemed as when,</l>
<l n="tr">from pinfold bursting, breaking his strong chain,</l>
<l n="tr">th' untrammelled stallion ranges the wide field,</l>
<l n="tr">or tries him to a herd of feeding mares,</l>
<l n="tr">or to some cooling river-bank he knows,</l>
<l n="tr">most fierce and mettlesome; the streaming mane</l>
<l n="tr">o'er neck and shoulder flies. <milestone ed="p" n="498" unit="card"/>Across his path</l>
<l n="tr">Camilla with her Volscian escort came,</l>
<l n="tr">and at the city-gate the royal maid</l>
<l n="tr">down from her charger leaped; while all her band</l>
<l n="tr">at her example glided to the ground,</l>
<l n="tr">their horses leaving. Thus the virgin spoke:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Turnus, if confidence beseem the brave,</l>
<l n="tr">I have no fear; but of myself do vow</l>
<l n="tr">to meet yon squadrons of Aeneadae</l>
<l n="tr">alone, and front me to the gathered charge</l>
<l n="tr">of Tuscan cavalry. Let me alone</l>
<l n="tr">the war's first venture-prove. Take station, thou,</l>
<l n="tr">here at the walls, this rampart to defend.&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">With fixed eyes on the terror-striking maid,</l>
<l n="tr">Turnus replied, &ldquo;O boast of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>,</l>
<l n="tr">O virgin bold! What praise, what gratitude</l>
<l n="tr">can words or deeds repay? But since thy soul</l>
<l n="tr">so large of stature shows, I bid thee share</l>
<l n="tr">my burden and my war. Our spies bring news</l>
<l n="tr">that now Aeneas with pernicious mind</l>
<l n="tr">sends light-armed horse before him, to alarm</l>
<l n="tr">the plains below, while through the wilderness</l>
<l n="tr">he climbs the steep hills, and approaches so</l>
<l n="tr">our leaguered town. But I in sheltered grove</l>
<l n="tr">a stratagem prepare, and bid my men</l>
<l n="tr">in ambush at a mountain cross-road lie.</l>
<l n="tr">Meet thou the charge of Tuscan cavalry</l>
<l n="tr">with all thy banners. For auxiliar strength</l>
<l n="tr">take bold Messapus with his Latin troop</l>
<l n="tr">and King Tiburtus' men: but the command</l>
<l n="tr">shall be thy task and care.&rdquo; He spoke, and urged</l>
<l n="tr">with like instruction for the coming fray</l>
<l n="tr">Messapus and his captains; then advanced</l>
<l n="tr">to meet the foe. <milestone ed="p" n="522" unit="card"/>There is a winding vale</l>
<l n="tr">for armed deception and insidious war</l>
<l n="tr">well fashioned, and by interlacing leaves</l>
<l n="tr">screened darkly in; a small path thither leads,</l>
<l n="tr">through strait defile-a passage boding ill.</l>
<l n="tr">Above it, on a mountain's lofty brow,</l>
<l n="tr">are points of outlook, level spaces fair,</l>
<l n="tr">and many a safe, invisible retreat</l>
<l n="tr">from whence on either hand to challenge war,</l>
<l n="tr">or, standing on the ridges, to roll down</l>
<l n="tr">huge mountain boulders. Thither Turnus fared,</l>
<l n="tr">and, ranging the familiar tract, chose out</l>
<l n="tr">his cunning ambush in the dangerous grove.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="532" unit="card"/>But now in dwellings of the gods on high,</l>
<l n="tr">Diana to fleet-footed Opis called,</l>
<l n="tr">a virgin from her consecrated train,</l>
<l n="tr">and thus in sorrow spoke: &ldquo;O maiden mine!</l>
<l n="tr">Camilla now to cruel conflict flies;</l>
<l n="tr">with weapons like my own she girds her side,</l>
<l n="tr">in vain, though dearest of all nymphs to me.</l>
<l n="tr">Nor is it some new Iove that stirs to-day</l>
<l n="tr">with sudden sweetness in Diana's breast:</l>
<l n="tr">for long ago, when from his kingdom driven,</l>
<l n="tr">for insolent and envied power, her sire</l>
<l n="tr">King Metabus, from old <placeName key="perseus,Privernum">Privernum</placeName>'s wall</l>
<l n="tr">was taking flight amidst opposing foes,</l>
<l n="tr">he bore a little daughter in his arms</l>
<l n="tr">to share his exile; and he called the child</l>
<l n="tr">(Changing Casmilla, her queen-mother's name)</l>
<l n="tr">Camilla. Bearing on his breast the babe,</l>
<l n="tr">he fled to solitary upland groves.</l>
<l n="tr">But hovering round him with keen lances, pressed</l>
<l n="tr">the Volscian soldiery. Across his path,</l>
<l n="tr">lo, Amasenus with full-foaming wave</l>
<l n="tr">o'erflowed its banks&mdash;so huge a rain had burst</l>
<l n="tr">but lately from the clouds. There would he fain</l>
<l n="tr">swim over, but the love of that sweet babe</l>
<l n="tr">restrained him, trembling for his burden dear.</l>
<l n="tr">In his perplexed heart suddenly arose</l>
<l n="tr">firm resolve. It chanced the warrior bore</l>
<l n="tr">huge spear in his brawny hand, strong shaft</l>
<l n="tr">of knotted, seasoned oak; to this he lashed</l>
<l n="tr">his little daughter with a withe of bark</l>
<l n="tr">pulled from a cork-tree, and with skilful bonds</l>
<l n="tr">fast bound her to the spear; then, poising it</l>
<l n="tr">high in his right hand, thus he called on Heaven:</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="557" unit="card"/>&lsquo;Latona's daughter, whose benignant grace</l>
<l n="tr">protects this grove, behold, her father now</l>
<l n="tr">gives thee this babe for handmaid! Lo, thy spear</l>
<l n="tr">her infant fingers hold, as from her foes</l>
<l n="tr">she flies a suppliant to thee! Receive,</l>
<l n="tr">O goddess, I implore, what now I cast</l>
<l n="tr">upon the perilous air.&rsquo;&mdash;He spoke, and hurled</l>
<l n="tr">with lifted arm the whirling shaft. The waves</l>
<l n="tr">roared loud, as on the whistling javelin</l>
<l n="tr">hapless Camilla crossed th' impetuous flood.</l>
<l n="tr">But Metabus, his foes in hot pursuit,</l>
<l n="tr">dared plunge him in mid-stream, and, triumphing,</l>
<l n="tr">soon plucked from grass-grown river-bank the spear,</l>
<l n="tr">the child upon it,&mdash;now to Trivia vowed,</l>
<l n="tr">a virgin offering. Him nevermore</l>
<l n="tr">could cities hold, nor would his wild heart yield</l>
<l n="tr">its sylvan freedom, but his days were passed</l>
<l n="tr">with shepherds on the solitary hills.</l>
<l n="tr">His daughter too in tangled woods he bred:</l>
<l n="tr">a brood-mare from the milk of her fierce breast</l>
<l n="tr">suckled the child, and to its tender lips</l>
<l n="tr">.Her udders moved; and when the infant feet</l>
<l n="tr">their first firm steps had taken, the small palms</l>
<l n="tr">were armed with a keen javelin; her sire</l>
<l n="tr">a bow and quiver from her shoulder slung.</l>
<l n="tr">Instead of golden combs and flowing pall,</l>
<l n="tr">she wore, from her girl-forehead backward thrown,</l>
<l n="tr">the whole skin of a tigress; with soft hands</l>
<l n="tr">she made her plaything of a whirling spear,</l>
<l n="tr">or, swinging round her head the polished thong</l>
<l n="tr">of her good sling, she fetched from distant sky</l>
<l n="tr">Strymonian cranes or swans of spotless wing.</l>
<l n="tr">From Tuscan towns proud matrons oft in vain</l>
<l n="tr">sought her in marriage for their sons; but she</l>
<l n="tr">to Dian only turned her stainless heart,</l>
<l n="tr">her virgin freedom and her huntress' arms</l>
<l n="tr">with faithful passion serving. Would that now</l>
<l n="tr">this Iove of war had ne'er seduced her mind</l>
<l n="tr">the Teucrians to provoke! So might she be</l>
<l n="tr">one of our wood-nymphs still. But haste, I pray,</l>
<l n="tr">for bitter is her now impending doom.</l>
<l n="tr">Descend, dear nymph, from heaven, and explore</l>
<l n="tr">the country of the Latins, where the fight</l>
<l n="tr">with unpropitious omens now begins.</l>
<l n="tr">These weapons take, and from this quiver draw</l>
<l n="tr">a vengeful arrow, wherewith he who dares</l>
<l n="tr">to wound her sacred body, though he be</l>
<l n="tr">a Trojan or Italian, shall receive</l>
<l n="tr">bloody and swift reward at my command.</l>
<l n="tr">Then, in a cloud concealed, I will consign</l>
<l n="tr">her corpse, ill-fated but inviolate</l>
<l n="tr">unto the sepulchre, restoring so</l>
<l n="tr">the virgin to her native land.&rdquo; Thus spake</l>
<l n="tr">the goddess; but her handmaid, gliding down,</l>
<l n="tr">took her loud pathway on the moving winds,</l>
<l n="tr">and mantled in dark storm her shape divine.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="597" unit="card"/>Meanwhile the Teucrian legions to the wall</l>
<l n="tr">draw near, with Tuscan lords and cavalry</l>
<l n="tr">in numbered troops arrayed. Loud-footed steeds</l>
<l n="tr">prance o'er the field, to manage of the rein</l>
<l n="tr">rebellious, but turned deftly here or there.</l>
<l n="tr">The iron harvest of keen spears spreads far,</l>

<l n="tr">the Latins wheeled once more and pressed the rein</l>
<l n="tr">strong on the yielding neck; the charging foe</l>
<l n="tr">took flight and hurried far with loose-flung rein.</l>
<l n="tr">'T was like the shock and onset of the sea</l>

<l n="tr">inextricably with their masters slain,</l>
<l n="tr">so fierce the fray. Orsilochus&mdash;afraid</l>
<l n="tr">to front the warrior's arms&mdash;launched forth a spear</l>
<l n="tr">at Remulus' horse, and left the fatal steel</l>
<l n="tr">clinging below its ear; the charger plunged</l>
<l n="tr">madly, and tossed its trembling hoofs in air,</l>
<l n="tr">sustaining not the wound; the rider fell,</l>
<l n="tr">flung headlong to the ground. Catillus slew</l>
<l n="tr">Iollas; and then struck Herminius down,</l>
<l n="tr">great-bodied and great-hearted, who could wield</l>
<l n="tr">a monster weapon, and whose yellow hair</l>
<l n="tr">from naked head to naked shoulder flowed.</l>
<l n="tr">By wounds unterrified he dared oppose</l>
<l n="tr">his huge bulk to the foe: the quivering spear</l>
<l n="tr">pierced to his broad back, and with throes of pain</l>
<l n="tr">bowed the man double and clean clove him through.</l>

<l n="tr">no flight could save him from the shock of arms</l>
<l n="tr">nor turn the royal maid's attack, began</l>
<l n="tr">with words of cunning and insidious guile:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;What glory is it if a girl be bold,</l>

<l n="tr">thinking his trick victorious, and rode off</l>

<l n="tr">goading the warrior's rage. So Tarchon rode</l>
<l n="tr">through slaughter wide and legions in retreat,</l>
<l n="tr">and roused the ranks with many a wrathful cry:</l>
<l n="tr">he called each man by name, and toward the foe</l>
<l n="tr">drove back the routed lines. &ldquo;What terrors now,</l>
<l n="tr">Tuscan cowards, dead to noble rage,</l>
<l n="tr">have seized ye? or what laggard sloth and vile</l>
<l n="tr">unmans your hearts, that now a woman's arm</l>
<l n="tr">pursues ye and this scattered host confounds?</l>
<l n="tr">Why dressed in steel, or to what purpose wear</l>
<l n="tr">your futile swords? Not slackly do ye join</l>
<l n="tr">the ranks of Venus in a midnight war;</l>
<l n="tr">or when fantastic pipes of Bacchus call</l>

<l n="tr">what ardor then! Or if your flattering priest</l>
<l n="tr">begins the revel, and to Iofty groves</l>
<l n="tr">fat flesh of victims bids ye haste away!&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">So saying, his steed he spurred, and scorning death</l>
<l n="tr">dashed into the mid-fray, where, frenzy-driven,</l>
<l n="tr">he sought out Venulus, and, grappling him</l>
<l n="tr">with one hand, from the saddle snatched his foe,</l>
<l n="tr">and, clasping strongly to his giant breast,</l>
<l n="tr">exultant bore away. The shouting rose</l>
<l n="tr">to heaven, and all the Latins gazed his way,</l>
<l n="tr">as o'er the plain the fiery Tarchon flew</l>
<l n="tr">bearing the full-armed man; then, breaking off</l>
<l n="tr">the point of his own spear, he pried a way</l>
<l n="tr">through the seam'd armor for the mortal wound;</l>
<l n="tr">the other, struggling, thrust back from his throat</l>
<l n="tr">the griping hand, full force to force opposing.</l>
<l n="tr">As when a golden eagle high in air</l>

<l n="tr">and stretches high his hissing head; whereat</l>
<l n="tr">the eagle with hooked beak the more doth rend</l>
<l n="tr">her writhing foe, and with swift stroke of wing</l>

<l n="tr">The Tuscans rallied now, well pleased to view</l>

<l n="tr">Then Arruns, marked for doom, made circling line</l>

<l n="tr">in silence dogged her footsteps and pursued;</l>
<l n="tr">or where triumphant from her fallen foes</l>
<l n="tr">she backward drew, the warrior stealthily</l>
<l n="tr">turned his swift reins that way: from every side</l>
<l n="tr">he circled her, and scanned his vantage here</l>
<l n="tr">or vantage there, his skilful javelin</l>
<l n="tr">stubbornly shaking. <milestone ed="p" n="768" unit="card"/>But it soon befell</l>
<l n="tr">that Chloreus, once a priest of Cybele,</l>

<l n="tr">o'erwrought with feathery scales of bronze and gold;</l>
<l n="tr">while he, in purples of fine foreign stain,</l>
<l n="tr">bore light Gortynian shafts and Lycian bow;</l>
<l n="tr">his bow was gold; a golden casque he wore</l>
<l n="tr">upon his priestly brow; the saffron cloak,</l>
<l n="tr">all folds of rustling cambric, was enclasped</l>
<l n="tr">in glittering gold; his skirts and tunics gay</l>
<l n="tr">were broidered, and the oriental garb</l>
<l n="tr">swathed his whole leg. Him when the maiden spied,</l>
<l n="tr">(Perchance she fain on temple walls would hang</l>

<l n="tr">her own fair shape array), she gave mad chase,</l>
<l n="tr">and reckless through the ranks her prey pursued,</l>
<l n="tr">desiring, woman-like, the splendid spoil.</l>
<l n="tr">Then from his ambush Arruns seized at last</l>
<l n="tr">the fatal moment and let speed his shaft,</l>
<l n="tr">thus uttering his vow to heavenly powers:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Chief of the gods, Apollo, who dost guard</l>

<l n="tr">and deep in glowing embers plant our feet.</l>
<l n="tr">O Sire Omnipotent, may this my spear</l>
<l n="tr">our foul disgrace put by. I do not ask</l>
<l n="tr">for plunder, spoils, or trophies in my name,</l>
<l n="tr">when yonder virgin falls; let honor's crown</l>
<l n="tr">be mine for other deeds. But if my stroke</l>

<l n="tr">Camilla by swift death; but 't was denied</l>
<l n="tr">the mountain-fatherland once more to see,</l>
<l n="tr">or safe return,&mdash;that prayer th' impetuous winds</l>
<l n="tr">swept stormfully away. Soon as the spear</l>
<l n="tr">whizzed from his hand, straight-speeding on the air,</l>
<l n="tr">the Volscians all turned eager thought and eyes</l>
<l n="tr">toward their Queen. She only did not heed</l>
<l n="tr">that windy roar, nor weapon dropped from heaven,</l>
<l n="tr">till in her bare, protruded breast the spear</l>
<l n="tr">drank, deeply driven, of her virgin blood.</l>
<l n="tr">Her terror-struck companians swiftly throng</l>
<l n="tr">around her, and uplift their sinking Queen.</l>
<l n="tr">But Arruns, panic-stricken more than all,</l>
<l n="tr">makes off, half terror and half joy, nor dares</l>
<l n="tr">hazard his lance again, nor dares oppose</l>
<l n="tr">a virgin's arms. As creeps back to the hills</l>
<l n="tr">in pathless covert ere his foes pursue,</l>
<l n="tr">from shepherd slain or mighty bull laid low,</l>
<l n="tr">some wolf, who, now of his bold trespass ware,</l>
<l n="tr">curls close against his paunch a quivering tail</l>
<l n="tr">and to the forest tries: so Arruns speeds</l>
<l n="tr">from sight of men in terror, glad to fly,</l>
<l n="tr">and hides him in the crowd. But his keen spear</l>
<l n="tr">dying Camilla from her bosom drew,</l>
<l n="tr">though the fixed barb of deeply-wounding steel</l>
<l n="tr">clung to the rib. She sank to earth undone,</l>
<l n="tr">her cold eyes closed in death, and from her cheeks</l>
<l n="tr">the roses fled. With failing breath she called</l>
<l n="tr">on Acca&mdash;who of all her maiden peers</l>
<l n="tr">was chiefly dear and shared her heart's whole pain&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">and thus she spoke: &ldquo;O Acca, sister mine,</l>

<l n="tr">Haste thee to Turnus! Tell my dying words!</l>
<l n="tr">'T is he must bear the battle and hold back</l>

<l n="tr">So saying, her fingers from the bridle-rein</l>
<l n="tr">unclasped, and helpless to the earth she fell;</l>
<l n="tr">then, colder grown, she loosed her more and more</l>
<l n="tr">out of the body's coil; she gave to death</l>
<l n="tr">her neck, her drooping head, and ceased to heed</l>

<l n="tr">the plain with dust o'erclouded, and the lines</l>
<l n="tr">of the Laurentian host extending far;</l>
<l n="tr">Turnus, as clearly, saw the war array</l>
<l n="tr">of dread Aeneas, and his ear perceived</l>
<l n="tr">loud tramp of mail-clad men and snorting steeds.</l>
<l n="tr">Soon had they sped to dreadful shock of arms,</l>
<l n="tr">hazard of war to try; but Phoebus now,</l>
<l n="tr">glowing rose-red, had dipped his wearied wheel</l>

<l n="tr">When Turnus marks how much the Latins quail</l>
<l n="tr">in adverse war, how on himself they call</l>
<l n="tr">to keep his pledge, and with indignant eyes</l>
<l n="tr">gaze all his way, fierce rage implacable</l>
<l n="tr">swells his high heart. As when on Libyan plain</l>
<l n="tr">a lion, gashed along his tawny breast</l>
<l n="tr">by the huntsman's grievous thrust, awakens him</l>
<l n="tr">unto his last grim fight, and gloriously</l>
<l n="tr">shaking the great thews of his maned neck,</l>
<l n="tr">shrinks not, but crushes the despoiler's spear</l>
<l n="tr">with blood-sprent, roaring mouth,&mdash;not less than so</l>
<l n="tr">burns the wild soul of Turnus and his ire.</l>
<l n="tr">Thus to the King he spoke with stormful brow:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;The war lags not for Turnus' sake. No cause</l>
<l n="tr">constrains the Teucrian cowards and their King</l>
<l n="tr">to eat their words and what they pledged refuse.</l>
<l n="tr">On his own terms I come. Bring forward, sire,</l>
<l n="tr">the sacrifice, and seal the pact I swear:</l>
<l n="tr">either to deepest hell this hand shall fling</l>
<l n="tr">yon Trojan runaway&mdash;the Latins all</l>

<l n="tr">efface the general shame; or let him claim</l>
<l n="tr">the conquest, and Lavinia be his bride.&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="18" unit="card"/>To him Latinus with unruffled mind</l>
<l n="tr">thus made reply: &ldquo;O youth surpassing brave!</l>
<l n="tr">The more thy sanguinary valor burns</l>
<l n="tr">beyond its wont, the more with toilsome care</l>
<l n="tr">I ponder with just fear what chance may fall,</l>
<l n="tr">weighing it well. Thy father Daunus' throne,</l>
<l n="tr">and many a city by thy sword subdued,</l>
<l n="tr">are still thy own. Latinus also boasts</l>
<l n="tr">much golden treasure and a liberal hand.</l>
<l n="tr">Other unwedded maids of noble stem</l>
<l n="tr">in <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName> and Laurentine land are found.</l>
<l n="tr">Permit me, then, to tell thee without guile</l>
<l n="tr">things hard to utter; let them deeply fill</l>
<l n="tr">thy listening soul. My sacred duty 'twas</l>
<l n="tr">to plight my daughter's hand to nonesoe'er</l>
<l n="tr">of all her earlier wooers&mdash;so declared</l>
<l n="tr">the gods and oracles; but overcome</l>
<l n="tr">by love of thee, by thy dear, kindred blood,</l>
<l n="tr">and by the sad eyes of my mournful Queen,</l>
<l n="tr">I shattered every bond; I snatched away</l>
<l n="tr">the plighted maiden from her destined lord,</l>
<l n="tr">and took up impious arms. What evil case</l>
<l n="tr">upon that deed ensued, what hapless wars,</l>
<l n="tr">thou knowest, since thyself dost chiefly bear</l>
<l n="tr">the cruel burden. In wide-ranging fight</l>
<l n="tr">twice-conquered, our own city scarce upholds</l>
<l n="tr">the hope of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. Yon <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>'s wave</l>
<l n="tr">still runs warm with my people's blood; the plains</l>
<l n="tr">far round us glisten with their bleaching bones.</l>
<l n="tr">Why tell it o'er and o'er? What maddening dream</l>
<l n="tr">perverts my mind? If after Turnus slain</l>
<l n="tr">I must for friendship of the Trojan sue,</l>
<l n="tr">were it not better to suspend the fray</l>
<l n="tr">while Turnus lives? For what will be the word</l>

<l n="tr">more wildly, and his fever fiercer burns</l>
<l n="tr">beneath the healer's hand. In answer he,</l>
<l n="tr">soon as his passion gathered voice, began:</l>

<l n="tr">blood follows. For my foeman when we meet</l>
<l n="tr">will find no goddess-mother near, with hand</l>

<l n="tr">herself in dim, deluding shade concealed.&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="54" unit="card"/>But now the Queen, whose whole heart shrank in fear</l>
<l n="tr">from these new terms of duel, wept aloud,</l>
<l n="tr">and like one dying clasped her fiery son:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;O Turnus, by these tears-if in thy heart</l>
<l n="tr">thou honorest Amata still&mdash;O thou</l>
<l n="tr">who art of our distressful, dark old age</l>

<l n="tr">thou art the mighty prop whereon is stayed</l>

<l n="tr">thy destined doom is destined to be mine</l>
<l n="tr">by the same fatal stroke. For in that hour</l>
<l n="tr">this hated life shall cease, nor will I look</l>

<l n="tr">Lavinia heard her mother's voice, and tears</l>
<l n="tr">o'erflowed her scarlet cheek, where blushes spread</l>
<l n="tr">like flame along her warm, young face and brow:</l>

<l n="tr">ensanguined crimson stain, or lilies pale</l>

<l n="tr">her virgin features bore; and love's desire</l>
<l n="tr">disturbed his breast, as, gazing on the maid,</l>

<l n="tr">while with our own spilt blood we twain will make</l>

<l n="tr">stood by and smote with hollowed hand and palm</l>
<l n="tr">the sounding chests, or combed the necks and manes.</l>
<l n="tr">But he upon his kingly shoulders clasped</l>
<l n="tr">his corselet, thick o'erlaid with blazoned gold</l>
<l n="tr">and silvery orichalch; he fitted him</l>
<l n="tr">with falchion, shield, and helm of purple plume,</l>
<l n="tr">that falchion which the Lord of Fire had made</l>
<l n="tr">for Daunus, tempering in the Stygian wave</l>
<l n="tr">when white it glowed; next grasped he the good spear</l>
<l n="tr">which leaned its weight against a column tall </l>
<l n="tr">in the mid-court, Auruncan Actor's spoil,</l>
<l n="tr">and waved it wide in air with mighty cry:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;O spear, that ne'er did fail me when I called,</l>

<l n="tr">Such frenzy goads him: his impassioned brow</l>

<l n="tr">Thus, bellowing loud before the fearful fray,</l>

<l n="tr">hailed the good omen with consenting cry,</l>

<l n="tr">And draw your swords, ye wretches, whom th' assault</l>

<l n="tr">Close up your ranks&mdash;one soul in all our breasts!</l>
<l n="tr">Defend in open war your stolen King.&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">So saying, he hurled upon th' opposing foe</l>
<l n="tr">his javelin, running forward. The strong shaft</l>

<l n="tr">unerring. Instantly vast clamor rose,</l>

<l n="tr">leaped up amazed, and every heart beat high.</l>
<l n="tr">The spear sped flying to the foeman's line,</l>

<l n="tr">His brothers then, bold band to wrath aroused</l>

<l n="tr">to try the judgment of the sword. They tore</l>
<l n="tr">the altars down: a very storm of spears</l>
<l n="tr">rose angrily to heaven, in iron rain</l>
<l n="tr">down-pouring: while the priests bore far away</l>
<l n="tr">the sacrificial bowls and sacred fires.</l>
<l n="tr">Even Latinus fled; his stricken gods</l>
<l n="tr">far from his violated oath he bore.</l>

<l n="tr">that lay behind him. But Messapus flew,</l>
<l n="tr">infuriate, a javelin in his hand,</l>
<l n="tr">and, towering o'er the suppliant, smote him strong</l>

<l n="tr">Then Corynaeus snatched a burning brand</l>
<l n="tr">out of the altar, and as Ebysus</l>
<l n="tr">came toward him for to strike, he hurled the flame</l>
<l n="tr">full in his face: the big beard quickly blazed</l>
<l n="tr">with smell of singeing; while the warrior bold</l>
<l n="tr">strode over him, and seized with firm left hand</l>
<l n="tr">his quailing foe's Iong hair; then with one knee</l>

<l n="tr">The warrior's own wild impulse swept him on,</l>
<l n="tr">and every wind that o'er his chariot blew</l>
<l n="tr">shook out his plume in air. But such advance</l>

<l n="tr">Aeneas, gashed and bleeding, whose long lance</l>

<l n="tr">bustled in vain; in vain his surgery</l>
<l n="tr">pried at the shaft, and with a forceps strong</l>
<l n="tr">seized on the buried barb. But Fortune gave</l>
<l n="tr">no remedy, nor did Apollo aid</l>

<l n="tr">Thee also, Aeolus, Laurentum saw</l>

<l n="tr">yea, dying, thou whom Greeks in serried arms</l>
<l n="tr">subdued not, nor Achilles' hand that hurled</l>

<l n="tr">of all his line, confounding <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName> so</l>

<l n="tr">the thing I do is sudden. For this day</l>
<l n="tr">I will pluck out th' offending root of war,&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">yon city where Latinus reigns. Unless</l>
<l n="tr">it bear our yoke and heed a conqueror's will,</l>
<l n="tr">will lay low in dust its blazing towers.</l>
<l n="tr">Must I wait Turnus' pleasure, till he deign</l>

<l n="tr">Scarce had he said, when with consenting souls,</l>

<l n="tr">some troops run charging at the city-gates,</l>
<l n="tr">and slay the guards; some fling the whirling spear</l>
<l n="tr">and darken heaven with arrows. In their van,</l>

<l n="tr">Dazed and bewildered by such host of ills,</l>
<l n="tr">Turnus stood dumb; in his pent bosom stirred</l>
<l n="tr">shame, frenzy, sorrow, a despairing love</l>

<l n="tr">For, lo, a pointed peak of flame uprolled</l>

<l n="tr">a tower&mdash;the very tower his own proud hands</l>

<l n="tr">O sister, thou shalt look upon my shame</l>

<l n="tr">He spoke; and leaping from his chariot, sped</l>

<l n="tr">I yield me now; heart-sick I quit the war.</l>
<l n="tr">But ask one boon, which in the book of fate</l>
<l n="tr">is not denied; for <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName>'s good I sue,</l>
<l n="tr">and high prerogatives of men that be</l>
<l n="tr">thy kith and kin: when happy wedlock vows</l>
<l n="tr">(aye, be it so!) shall join them by strong laws</l>
<l n="tr">of chartered peace, let not the Latins Iose</l>
<l n="tr">their ancient, native name. Bid them not pass</l>
<l n="tr">for Trojans, nor be hailed as Teucer's sons;</l>
<l n="tr">no alien speech, no alien garb impose.</l>
<l n="tr">Let it be <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName> ever; let the lords</l>
<l n="tr">of Alba unto distant ages reign;</l>
<l n="tr">let the strong, master blood of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> receive</l>
<l n="tr">the manhood and the might of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>.</l>
<l n="tr"><placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> perished: let its name and glory die!&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">The Author of mankind and all that is,</l>
<l n="tr">smiling benignant, answered thus her plea:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Jove's sister true, and Saturn's second child,</l>
<l n="tr">what seas of anger vex thy heart divine!</l>
<l n="tr">But come, relinquish thy rash, fruitless rage:</l>
<l n="tr">I give thee this desire, and yield to thee</l>
<l n="tr">free submission. The Ausonian tribes</l>
<l n="tr">shall keep the speech and customs of their sires;</l>
<l n="tr">the name remains as now; the Teucrian race,</l>
<l n="tr">abiding in the land, shall but infuse</l>
<l n="tr">the mixture of its blood. I will bestow</l>
<l n="tr">a league of worship, and to Latins give</l>
<l n="tr">one language only. From the mingled breed</l>
<l n="tr">a people shall come forth whom thou shalt see</l>
<l n="tr">surpass all mortal men and even outvie</l>
<l n="tr">the faithfulness of gods; for none that live</l>
<l n="tr">shall render to thy name an equal praise.&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">So Juno bowed consent, and let her will</l>
<l n="tr">be changed, as with much comfort in her breast</l>
<l n="tr">she left <placeName key="perseus,Olympos,Lycia">Olympus</placeName> and her haunt of cloud.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="843" unit="card"/>After these things Jove gave his kingly mind</l>
<l n="tr">to further action, that he might forthwith</l>
<l n="tr">cut off Juturna from her brother's cause.</l>
<l n="tr">Two plagues there be, called Furies, which were spawned</l>
<l n="tr">at one birth from the womb of wrathful Night</l>
<l n="tr">with dread Megaera, phantom out of hell;</l>
<l n="tr">and of their mother's gift, each Fury wears</l>
<l n="tr">grim-coiling serpents and tempestuous wings.</l>
<l n="tr">These at Jove's throne attend, and watch the doors</l>
<l n="tr">of that stern King&mdash;to whet the edge of fear</l>
<l n="tr">for wretched mortals, when the King of gods</l>
<l n="tr">hurls pestilence and death, or terrifies</l>
<l n="tr">offending nations with the scourge of war.</l>
<l n="tr">'T was one of these which Jove sent speeding down</l>
<l n="tr">from his ethereal seat, and bade her cross</l>
<l n="tr">the pathway of Juturna for a sign.</l>
<l n="tr">Her wings she spread, and earthward seemed to ride</l>
<l n="tr">upon a whirling storm. As when some shaft,</l>
<l n="tr">with Parthian poison tipped or Cretan gall,</l>
<l n="tr">a barb of death, shoots cloudward from the bow,</l>
<l n="tr">and hissing through the dark hastes forth unseen:</l>
<l n="tr">so earthward flew that daughter of the night.</l>
<l n="tr">Soon as she spied the Teucrians in array</l>
<l n="tr">and Turnus' lines, she shrivelled to the shape</l>
<l n="tr">of that small bird which on lone tombs and towers</l>
<l n="tr">sits perching through the midnight, and prolongs</l>
<l n="tr">in shadow and deep gloom her troubling cry.</l>
<l n="tr">In such disguise the Fury, screaming shrill,</l>
<l n="tr">flitted in Turnus' face, and with her wings</l>
<l n="tr">smote on his hollow shield. A strange affright</l>
<l n="tr">palsied his every limb; each several hair</l>
<l n="tr">lifted with horror, and his gasping voice</l>
<l n="tr">died on his lips. <milestone ed="p" n="869" unit="card"/>But when Juturna knew</l>
<l n="tr">from far the shrieking fiend's infernal wing,</l>
<l n="tr">she loosed her tresses, and their beauty tore,</l>
<l n="tr">to tell a sister's woe; with clenching hands</l>
<l n="tr">she marred her cheeks and beat her naked breast. </l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;What remedy or help, my Turnus, now</l>
<l n="tr">is in a sister's power? What way remains</l>
<l n="tr">for stubborn me? Or with what further guile</l>
<l n="tr">thy life prolong? What can my strength oppose</l>
<l n="tr">to this foul thing? I quit the strife at last.</l>
<l n="tr">Withdraw thy terror from my fearful eyes,</l>
<l n="tr">thou bird accurst! The tumult of thy wings</l>
<l n="tr">I know full well, and thy death-boding call.</l>
<l n="tr">The harsh decrees of that large-minded Jove</l>
<l n="tr">I plainly see. Is this the price he pays</l>
<l n="tr">for my lost maidenhood? Why flatter me</l>
<l n="tr">with immortality, and snatch away</l>
<l n="tr">my property of death? What boon it were</l>
<l n="tr">to end this grief this hour, and hie away</l>
<l n="tr">to be my brother's helpmeet in his grave!</l>
<l n="tr">I, an immortal? O, what dear delight</l>
<l n="tr">is mine, sweet brother, living without thee?</l>
<l n="tr">O, where will earth yawn deep enough and wide</l>
<l n="tr">to hide a goddess with the ghosts below?&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">She spoke; and veiled in glistening mantle gray</l>
<l n="tr">her mournful brow; then in her stream divine</l>
<l n="tr">the nymph sank sighing to its utmost cave.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="887" unit="card"/>Aeneas now is near; and waving wide</l>
<l n="tr">a spear like some tall tree, he called aloud</l>
<l n="tr">with unrelenting heart: &ldquo;What stays thee now?</l>
<l n="tr">Or wherefore, Turnus, backward fly? Our work</l>
<l n="tr">is not a foot-race, but the wrathful strife</l>
<l n="tr">of man with man. Aye, hasten to put on</l>
<l n="tr">tricks and disguises; gather all thou hast</l>
<l n="tr">of skill or courage; wish thou wert a bird</l>
<l n="tr">to fly to starry heaven, or hide thy head</l>
<l n="tr">safe in the hollow ground!&rdquo; The other then</l>
<l n="tr">shook his head, saying: &ldquo;It is not thy words,</l>
<l n="tr">not thy hot words, affright me, savage man!</l>
<l n="tr">Only the gods I fear, and hostile Jove.&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">Silent he stood, and glancing round him saw</l>
<l n="tr">a huge rock Iying by, huge rock and old,</l>
<l n="tr">a landmark justly sundering field from field,</l>
<l n="tr">which scarce six strong men's shoulders might upraise,</l>
<l n="tr">such men as mother-Earth brings forth to-day:</l>
<l n="tr">this grasped he with impetuous hand and hurled,</l>
<l n="tr">stretched at full height and roused to all his speed,</l>
<l n="tr">against his foe. Yet scarcely could he feel</l>
<l n="tr">it was himself that ran, himself that moved</l>
<l n="tr">with lifted hand to fling the monster stone;</l>
<l n="tr">for his knees trembled, and his languid blood</l>
<l n="tr">ran shuddering cold; nor could the stone he threw,</l>
<l n="tr">tumbling in empty air, attain its goal</l>
<l n="tr">nor strike the destined blow. But as in dreams,</l>
<l n="tr">when helpless slumber binds the darkened eyes,</l>
<l n="tr">we seem with fond desire to tread in vain</l>
<l n="tr">along a lengthening road, yet faint and fall</l>
<l n="tr">when straining to the utmost, and the tongue</l>
<l n="tr">is palsied, and the body's wonted power</l>
<l n="tr">obeys not, and we have no speech or cry:</l>
<l n="tr">so unto Turnus, whatsoever way</l>
<l n="tr">his valiant spirit moved, the direful Fiend</l>
<l n="tr">stopped in the act his will. Swift-changing thoughts</l>
<l n="tr">rush o'er his soul; on the Rutulian host,</l>
<l n="tr">then at the town he glares, shrinks back in fear,</l>
<l n="tr">and trembles at th' impending lance; nor sees</l>
<l n="tr">what path to fly, what way confront the foe:&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">no chariot now, nor sister-charioteer!</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="919" unit="card"/>Above his faltering terror gleams in air</l>
<l n="tr">Aeneas' fatal spear; whose eye perceived</l>
<l n="tr">the moment of success, and all whose strength</l>
<l n="tr">struck forth: the vast and ponderous rock outflung</l>
<l n="tr">from engines which make breach in sieged walls</l>
<l n="tr">not louder roars nor breaks in thunder-sound</l>
<l n="tr">more terrible; like some black whirlwind flew</l>
<l n="tr">the death-delivering spear, and, rending wide</l>
<l n="tr">the corselet's edges and the heavy rim</l>
<l n="tr">of the last circles of the seven-fold shield,</l>
<l n="tr">pierced, hissing, through the thigh. Huge Turnus sinks</l>
<l n="tr">o'erwhelmed upon the ground with doubling knee.</l>
<l n="tr">Up spring the Rutules, groaning; the whole hill</l>
<l n="tr">roars answering round them, and from far and wide</l>
<l n="tr">the lofty groves give back an echoing cry.</l>
<l n="tr">Lowly, with suppliant eyes, and holding forth</l>
<l n="tr">his hand in prayer: &ldquo;I have my meed,&rdquo; he cried,</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Nor ask for mercy. Use what Fate has given!</l>
<l n="tr">But if a father's grief upon thy heart</l>
<l n="tr">have power at all,&mdash;for Sire Anchises once</l>
<l n="tr">to thee was dear,&mdash;I pray thee to show grace</l>
<l n="tr">to Daunus in his desolate old age;</l>
<l n="tr">and me, or, if thou wilt, my lifeless clay,</l>
<l n="tr">to him and his restore. For, lo, thou art</l>
<l n="tr">my conqueror! Ausonia's eyes have seen</l>
<l n="tr">me suppliant, me fallen. Thou hast made</l>
<l n="tr">Lavinia thy bride. Why further urge</l>
<l n="tr">our enmity?&rdquo;With swift and dreadful arms</l>
<l n="tr">Aeneas o'er him stood, with rolling eyes,</l>
<l n="tr">but his bare sword restraining; for such words</l>
<l n="tr">moved on him more and more: when suddenly,</l>
<l n="tr">over the mighty shoulder slung, he saw</l>
<l n="tr">that fatal baldric studded with bright gold</l>
<l n="tr">which youthful Pallas wore, what time he fell</l>
<l n="tr">vanquished by Turnus' stroke, whose shoulders now</l>
<l n="tr">carried such trophy of a foeman slain.</l>
<l n="tr">Aeneas' eyes took sure and slow survey</l>
<l n="tr">of spoils that were the proof and memory</l>
<l n="tr">of cruel sorrow; then with kindling rage</l>
<l n="tr">and terrifying look, he cried, &ldquo;Wouldst thou,</l>
<l n="tr">clad in a prize stripped off my chosen friend,</l>
<l n="tr">escape this hand? In this thy mortal wound</l>
<l n="tr">'t is Pallas has a victim; Pallas takes</l>
<l n="tr">the lawful forfeit of thy guilty blood!&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">He said, and buried deep his furious blade</l>
<l n="tr">in the opposer's heart. The failing limbs</l>
<l n="tr">sank cold and helpless; and the vital breath </l>
<l n="tr">with moan of wrath to darkness fled away.</l></div1>
