               <l n="244">The prophet Calchas bade us straightway take</l>

               <l n="515">had whelmed them quite, we swiftly laid them low.</l>
               <l n="516">Thus Fortune on our first achievement smiled;</l>
               <l n="517">and, flushed with victory, Cormbus cried:</l>
               <l n="518">“Come, friends, and follow Fortune's finger, where</l>
               <l n="519">she beckons us what path deliverance lies.</l>
               <l n="520">Change we our shields, and these Greek emblems wear.</l>
               <l n="521">'Twixt guile and valor who will nicely weigh</l>

               <l n="523">With this, he dons Androgeos' crested helm</l>
               <l n="524">and beauteous, blazoned shield; and to his side</l>
               <l n="525">girds on a Grecian blade. Young Rhipeus next,</l>
               <l n="526">with Dymas and the other soldiery,</l>
               <l n="527">repeat the deed, exulting, and array</l>
               <l n="528">their valor in fresh trophies from the slain.</l>
               <l n="529">Now intermingled with our foes we moved,</l>
               <l n="530">and alien emblems wore; the long, black night</l>
               <l n="531">brought many a grapple, and a host of Greeks</l>
               <l n="532">down to the dark we hurled. Some fled away,</l>
               <l n="533">seeking their safe ships and the friendly shore.</l>
               <l n="534">Some cowards foul went clambering back again</l>
               <l n="535">to that vast horse and hid them in its maw.</l>

               <l n="54">But when at a third sheaf of myrtle spears</l>
               <l n="55">I fell upon my knees, and tugged amain</l>
               <l n="56">against the adverse ground (I dread to tell!),</l>
               <l n="57">a moaning and a wail from that deep grave</l>
               <l n="58">burst forth and murmured in my listening ear:</l>
               <l n="59">“Why wound me, great Aeneas, in my woe?</l>
               <l n="60">O, spare the dead, nor let thy holy hands</l>
               <l n="61">do sacrilege and sin! I, Trojan-born,</l>
               <l n="62">was kin of thine. This blood is not of trees.</l>
               <l n="63">Haste from this murderous shore, this land of greed.</l>
               <l n="64">O, I am Polydorus! Haste away!</l>
               <l n="65">Here was I pierced; a crop of iron spears </l>
               <l n="66">has grown up o'er my breast, and multiplied </l>
               <l n="67">to all these deadly javelins, keen and strong.”</l>
               <l n="68">Then stood I, burdened with dark doubt and fear</l>
               <l n="69">I quailed, my hair rose and my utterance choked.</l>

               <l n="258">lifting to heaven my suppliant hands and prayer,</l>
               <l n="259">and o'er my hearth poured forth libations free.</l>
               <l n="260">After th' auspicious offering, I told</l>
               <l n="261">Anchises the whole tale in order due.</l>
               <l n="262">He owned our stock two-branched, of our great sires</l>
               <l n="263">the twofold line, and that his thought had strayed,</l>
               <l n="264">in new confusion mingling ancient names;</l>
               <l n="265">then spoke: “O son, in <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Ilium</placeName>'s doom severe</l>
               <l n="266">afflicted ever! To my ears alone</l>
               <l n="267">this dark vicissitude Cassandra sang.</l>
               <l n="268">I mind me now that her wild tongue foretold</l>
               <l n="269">such destiny. For oft she called aloud</l>
               <l n="270">‘Hesperia!’ oft ‘<placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italia</placeName>'s kingdom!’ called.</l>
               <l n="271">But who had faith that Teucer's sons should come</l>
               <l n="272">to far Hesperia? What mortal ear</l>
               <l n="273">gave heed to sad Cassandra's voice divine?</l>
               <l n="274">Now Phoebus speaks. Obedient let us be,</l>
               <l n="275">and, warned by him, our happier Iot pursue!”</l>
               <l n="276">He spoke: with heart of hope we all obeyed;</l>
               <l n="277">again we changed abode; and, leaving there</l>
               <l n="278">a feeble few, again with spreading sails</l>
               <l n="279">we coursed in hollow ship the spacious sea.</l>

            <div type="textpart" subtype="card" resp="p" n="192">
               <l n="280">When from the deep the shores had faded far,</l>
               <l n="281">and only sky and sea were round our way,</l>
               <l n="282">full in the zenith hung a purple cloud,</l>
               <l n="283">storm-laden, dark as night, and every wave</l>
               <l n="284">grew black and angry, while perpetual gales</l>
               <l n="285">came rolling o'er the main, and mountain-high</l>
               <l n="286">the wreckful surges rose; our ships were hurled</l>
               <l n="287">wide o'er the whirling waters; thunder-clouds</l>
               <l n="288">and misty murk of night made end of all</l>
               <l n="289">the light of heaven, save where the rifted storm</l>
               <l n="290">flashed with the oft-reiterate shaft of Jove.</l>
               <l n="291">Then went we drifting, beaten from our course,</l>
               <l n="292">upon a trackless sea. Not even the eyes</l>
               <l n="293">of Palinurus could tell night from noon</l>
               <l n="294">or ken our way. Three days of blinding dark,</l>
               <l n="295">three nights without a star, we roved the seas;</l>
               <l n="296">The fourth, land seemed to rise. Far distant hills</l>
               <l n="297">and rolling smoke we saw. Down came our sails,</l>
               <l n="298">out flew the oars, and with prompt stroke the crews</l>
               <l n="299">swept the dark waves and tossed the crested foam.</l>
               <l n="300">From such sea-peril safe, I made the shores</l>
               <l n="301">of Strophades,—a name the Grecians gave</l>
               <l n="302">to islands in the broad Ionic main, —</l>
               <l n="303">the Strophades, where dread Celaeno bides,</l>

               <l n="305">of stricken Phineus, and for very fear</l>
               <l n="306">fled from the routed feast; no prodigy</l>
               <l n="307">more vile than these, nor plague more pitiless</l>
               <l n="308">ere rose by wrath divine from Stygian wave;</l>
               <l n="309">birds seem they, but with face like woman-kind;</l>
               <l n="310">foul-flowing bellies, hands with crooked claws,</l>
               <l n="311">and ghastly lips they have, with hunger pale.</l>
               <l n="312">Scarce had we made the haven, when, behold!</l>
               <l n="313">Fair herds of cattle roaming a wide plain,</l>
               <l n="314">and horned goats, untended, feeding free</l>
               <l n="315">in pastures green, surprised our happy eyes.</l>
               <l n="316">with eager blades we ran to take and slay,</l>
               <l n="317">asking of every god, and chicfly Jove,</l>
               <l n="318">to share the welcome prize: we ranged a feast,</l>
               <l n="319">with turf-built couches and a banquet-board</l>
               <l n="320">along the curving strand. But in a trice,</l>
               <l n="321">down from the high hills swooping horribly,</l>
               <l n="322">the Harpies loudly shrieking, flapped their wings,</l>
               <l n="323">snatched at our meats, and with infectious touch</l>
               <l n="324">polluted all; infernal was their cry,</l>
               <l n="325">the stench most vile. Once more in covert far</l>
               <l n="326">beneath a caverned rock, and close concealed</l>
               <l n="327">with trees and branching shade, we raised aloft</l>
               <l n="328">our tables, altars, and rekindled fires.</l>
               <l n="329">Once more from haunts unknown the clamorous flock</l>
               <l n="330">from every quarter flew, and seized its prey</l>
               <l n="331">with taloned feet and carrion lip most foul.</l>
               <l n="332">I called my mates to arms and opened war</l>
               <l n="333">on that accursed brood. My band obeyed;</l>
               <l n="334">and, hiding in deep grass their swords and shields,</l>
               <l n="335">in ambush lay. But presently the foe</l>
               <l n="336">swept o'er the winding shore with loud alarm :</l>
               <l n="337">then from a sentry-crag, Misenus blew</l>
               <l n="338">a signal on his hollow horn. My men</l>
               <l n="339">flew to the combat strange, and fain would wound</l>
               <l n="340">with martial steel those foul birds of the sea;</l>
               <l n="341">but on their sides no wounding blade could fall,</l>
               <l n="342">nor any plume be marred. In swiftest flight</l>
               <l n="343">to starry skies they soared, and left on earth</l>
               <l n="344">their half-gnawed, stolen feast, and footprints foul.</l>
               <l n="345">Celaeno only on a beetling crag</l>
               <l n="346">took lofty perch, and, prophetess of ill,</l>
               <l n="347">shrieked malediction from her vulture breast:</l>

               <l n="358">in some Italian haven safely moored.</l>
               <l n="359">But never shall ye rear the circling walls</l>

               <l n="361">by you unjustly spilt, your famished jaws</l>

               <l n="365">shuddered with shock of fear in each cold vein;</l>
               <l n="366">their drooping spirits trusted swords no more,</l>

               <l n="370">Father Anchises to the gods in heaven</l>

               <l n="677">the labors of her loom, with words like these:</l>
               <l n="678">“Accept these gifts, sweet youth, memorials</l>

               <l n="944">she tore at her own face, and called aloud</l>

               <l n="967">Vainly would Dido lift her sinking eyes,</l>

               <l n="978">came not by destiny, nor was the doom</l>
               <l n="979">of guilty deed, but of a hapless wight</l>
               <l n="980">to sudden madness stung, ere ripe to die,</l>
               <l n="981">therefore the Queen of Hades had not shorn</l>
               <l n="982">the fair tress from her forehead, nor assigned</l>

               <l n="987">above that pallid brow: “I come with power</l>
               <l n="988">to make this gift to Death. I set thee free</l>
               <l n="989">from thy frail body's bound.” With her right hand</l>
               <l n="990">she cut the tress: then through its every limb</l>
               <l n="991">the sinking form grew cold; the vital breath</l>

               <l n="172">rises a rock, which under swollen waves</l>
               <l n="173">lies buffeted unseen, when wintry storms</l>
               <l n="174">mantle the stars; but when the deep is calm,</l>
               <l n="175">lifts silently above the sleeping wave</l>

               <l n="178">Here was the goal; and here Aeneas set</l>

               <l n="185">of Tyriao purple and far-flaming gold;</l>
               <l n="186">the crews are poplar-crowned, the shoulders bare</l>
               <l n="187">rubbed well with glittering oil; their straining arms</l>
               <l n="188">make long reach to the oar, as on the thwarts</l>
               <l n="189">they sit attentive, listening for the call</l>

               <l n="198">Not swifter scour the chariots o'er the plain,</l>

               <l n="203">vociferous and many an urgent cheer</l>
               <l n="204">the woodlands rang, and all the concave shores</l>
               <l n="205">back from the mountains took the Trojan cry</l>
               <l n="206">in answering song. <milestone ed="p" n="151" unit="card"/>Forth-flying from his peers,</l>
               <l n="207">while all the crowd acclaims, sped Gyas' keel</l>

               <l n="209">pushed hard upon, with stronger stroke of oars</l>
               <l n="210">but heavier ship. At equal pace behind</l>
               <l n="211">the Pristis and the Centaur fiercely strive</l>
               <l n="212">for the third place. Now Pristis seems to lead,</l>
               <l n="213">now mightier Centaur past her flies, then both</l>
               <l n="214">ride on together, prow with prow, and cleave</l>
               <l n="215">long lines of foaming furrow with swift keels.</l>
               <l n="216">Soon near the rock they drew, and either ship</l>
               <l n="217">was making goal,—when Gyas, in the lead, </l>
               <l n="218">and winner of the half-course, Ioudly hailed</l>
               <l n="219">menoetes, the ship's pilot: “Why so far</l>
               <l n="220">to starboard, we? Keep her head round this way!</l>
               <l n="221">Hug shore! Let every oar-blade almost graze</l>
               <l n="222">that reef to larboard! Let the others take</l>
               <l n="223">the deep-sea course outside!” But while he spoke,</l>
               <l n="224">Menoetes, dreading unknown rocks below,</l>
               <l n="225">veered off to open sea. “Why steer so wide?</l>
               <l n="226">Round to the rock, Menoetes!” Gyas roared, —</l>
               <l n="227">again in vain, for looking back he saw</l>
               <l n="228">cloanthus hard astern, and ever nearer,</l>
               <l n="229">who, in a trice, betwixt the booming reef</l>
               <l n="230">and Gyas' galley, lightly forward thrust</l>
               <l n="231">the beak of Scylla to the inside course,</l>
               <l n="232">and, quickly taking lead, flew past the goal</l>
               <l n="233">to the smooth seas beyond. Then wrathful grief</l>
               <l n="234">flamed in the warrior's heart, nor was his cheek</l>
               <l n="235">unwet with tears; and, reckless utterly</l>
               <l n="236">of his own honor and his comrades, lives,</l>
               <l n="237">he hurled poor, slack Menoetes from the poop</l>
               <l n="238">headlong upon the waters, while himself,</l>
               <l n="239">pilot and master both, the helm assuming,</l>
               <l n="240">urged on his crew, and landward took his way.</l>
               <l n="241">But now, with heavy limbs that hardly won</l>
               <l n="242">his rescue from the deep, engulfing wave,</l>
               <l n="243">up the rude rock graybeard Menoetes climbed</l>
               <l n="244">with garment dripping wet, and there dropped down</l>
               <l n="245">upon the cliff's dry top. With laughter loud</l>
               <l n="246">the Trojan crews had watched him plunging, swimming,</l>
               <l n="247">and now to see his drink of bitter brine</l>
               <l n="248">spewed on the ground, the sailors laughed again.</l>
            </div>
            <div type="textpart" subtype="card" resp="p" n="183">
               <l n="249">But Mnestheus and Sergestus, coming last,</l>
               <l n="250">have joyful hope enkindled in each heart</l>
               <l n="251">to pass the laggard Gyas. In the lead</l>
               <l n="252">Sergestus' ship shoots forth; and to the rock</l>
               <l n="253">runs boldly nigh; but not his whole long keel</l>
               <l n="254">may pass his rival; the projecting beak</l>
               <l n="255">is followed fast by Pristis' emulous prow.</l>
               <l n="256">Then, striding straight amidships through his crew,</l>
               <l n="257">thus Mnestheus urged them on: “O Hector's friends!</l>
               <l n="258">Whom in the dying hours of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> I chose</l>
               <l n="259">for followers! Now stand ye to your best!</l>
               <l n="260">Put forth the thews of valor that ye showed</l>
               <l n="261">in the Gaetulian Syrtes, or that sea</l>
               <l n="262">Ionian, or where the waves race by</l>
               <l n="263">the Malean promontory! Mnestheus now</l>
               <l n="264">hopes not to be the first, nor do I strive</l>
               <l n="265">for victory. O Father Neptune, give</l>
               <l n="266">that garland where thou wilt! But O, the shame</l>
               <l n="267">if we are last! Endure it not, my men!</l>
               <l n="268">The infamy refuse!” So, bending low,</l>
               <l n="269">they enter the home-stretch. Beneath their stroke</l>
               <l n="270">the brass-decked galley throbs, and under her</l>
               <l n="271">the sea-floor drops away. On, on they fly!</l>
               <l n="272">Parched are the panting lips, and sweat in streams</l>
               <l n="273">pours down their giant sides; but lucky chance</l>
               <l n="274">brought the proud heroes what their honor craved.</l>
               <l n="275">For while Sergestus furiously drove</l>
               <l n="276">his ship's beak toward the rock, and kept inside</l>
               <l n="277">the scanty passage, by his evil star</l>
               <l n="278">he grounded on the jutting reef; the cliffs</l>
               <l n="279">rang with the blow, and his entangled oars</l>
               <l n="280">grated along the jagged granite, while</l>
               <l n="281">the prow hung wrecked and helpless. With loud cry</l>
               <l n="282">upsprang the sailors, while the ship stood still,</l>
               <l n="283">and pushed off with long poles and pointed iron,</l>
               <l n="284">or snatched the smashed oars from the whirling tide.</l>
               <l n="285">Mnestheus exults; and, roused to keener strife</l>
               <l n="286">by happy fortune, with a quicker stroke</l>
               <l n="287">of each bright rank of oars, and with the breeze</l>
               <l n="288">his prayer implored, skims o'er the obedient wave</l>
               <l n="289">and sweeps the level main. Not otherwise</l>
               <l n="290">a startled dove, emerging o'er the fields</l>
               <l n="291">from secret cavern in the crannied hill</l>
               <l n="292">where her safe house and pretty nestlings lie,</l>
               <l n="293">soars from her nest, with whirring wings—but soon</l>
               <l n="294">through the still sky she takes her path of air</l>
               <l n="295">on pinions motionless. So Pristis sped</l>
               <l n="296">with Mnestheus, cleaving her last stretch of sea,</l>
               <l n="297">by her own impulse wafted. She outstripped</l>
               <l n="298">Sergestus first; for he upon the reef</l>
               <l n="299">fought with the breakers, desperately shouting</l>
               <l n="300">for help, for help in vain, with broken oars</l>
               <l n="301">contriving to move on. Then Mnestheus ran</l>
               <l n="302">past Gyas, in Chimaera's ponderous hulk,</l>
               <l n="303">of pilot now bereft; <milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="card"/>at last remains</l>
               <l n="304">Cloanthus his sole peer, whom he pursues</l>
               <l n="305">with a supreme endeavor. From the shore</l>
               <l n="306">burst echoing cheers that spur him to the chase,</l>
               <l n="307">and wild applause makes all the welkin ring.</l>
               <l n="308">The leaders now with eager souls would scorn</l>
               <l n="309">to Iose their glory, and faint-hearted fail</l>
               <l n="310">to grasp a prize half-won, but fain would buy</l>
               <l n="311">honor with life itself; the followers too</l>
               <l n="312">are flushed with proud success, and feel them strong</l>
               <l n="313">because their strength is proven. Both ships now</l>
               <l n="314">with indistinguishable prows had sped</l>
               <l n="315">to share one prize,—but with uplifted hands</l>
               <l n="316">spread o'er the sea, Cloanthus, suppliant,</l>
               <l n="317">called on the gods to bless his votive prayer:</l>
               <l n="318">“Ye gods who rule the waves, whose waters be</l>

               <l n="320">a white bull at the altar shall be slain</l>
               <l n="321">in grateful tribute for a granted vow;</l>
               <l n="322">and o'er the salt waves I will scatter far</l>
               <l n="323">the entrails, and outpour the flowing wine.”</l>
               <l n="324">He spoke; and from the caverns under sea</l>
               <l n="325">Phorcus and virgin Panopea heard,</l>
               <l n="326">and all the sea-nymphs' choir; while with strong hand</l>
               <l n="327">the kindly God of Havens rose and thrust</l>
               <l n="328">the gliding ship along, that swifter flew</l>

               <l n="367">As when a serpent, on the highway caught,</l>

               <l n="369">with heavy-smiting blow left half alive</l>
               <l n="370">and mangled by a stone; in vain he moves</l>
               <l n="371">in writhing flight; a part is lifted high</l>
               <l n="372">with hissing throat and angry, glittering eyes;</l>
               <l n="373">but by the wounded part a captive still</l>
               <l n="374">he knots him fold on fold: with such a track</l>
               <l n="375">the maimed ship labored slow; but by her sails</l>
               <l n="376">she still made way, and with full canvas on</l>
               <l n="377">arrived at land. Aeneas then bestowed</l>
               <l n="378">a boon upon Sergestus, as was meet</l>
               <l n="379">for reward of the ship in safety brought</l>

               <l n="454">Diores, too, assists the victor's claim,</l>

               <l n="460">the misadventure of a blameless friend,</l>
               <l n="461">is in my power.” Therewith to Salius</l>
               <l n="462">an Afric lion's monstrous pelt he gave,</l>

               <l n="464">But Nisus cried: “If such a gift be found</l>
               <l n="465">for less than victory, and men who fall</l>
               <l n="466">are worthy so much sorrow, pray, what prize</l>
               <l n="467">shall Nisus have? For surely I had won</l>

               <l n="471">his smeared face and his sorry limbs befouled</l>
               <l n="472">with mire and slime. Then laughed the gracious sire,</l>

               <l n="475">from Neptune's temple; with this noble gift</l>

               <l n="560">in struggle hand to hand, and made the fray</l>

               <l n="565">with labor of his breath. Without avail</l>
               <l n="566">they rained their blows, and on each hollow side,</l>
               <l n="567">each sounding chest, the swift, reverberate strokes</l>
               <l n="568">fell without pause; around their ears and brows</l>
               <l n="569">came blow on blow, and with relentless shocks</l>
               <l n="570">the smitten jaws cracked loud. Entellus stands</l>
               <l n="571">unshaken, and, the self-same posture keeping,</l>
               <l n="572">only by body-movement or quick eye</l>
               <l n="573">parries attack. Dares (like one in siege</l>
               <l n="574">against a mountain-citadel, who now will drive</l>
               <l n="575">with ram and engine at the craggy wall,</l>

               <l n="579">his unsuccessful, ever various war.</l>
               <l n="580">Then, rising to the stroke, Entellus poised</l>
               <l n="581">aloft his ponderous right; but, quick of eye,</l>
               <l n="582">the other the descending wrath foresaw</l>
               <l n="583">and nimbly slipped away; Entellus so</l>
               <l n="584">wasted his stroke on air, and, self-o'erthrown,</l>
               <l n="585">dropped prone to earth his monstrous length along,</l>
               <l n="586">as when on Erymanth or Ida falls</l>
               <l n="587">a hollowed pine from giant roots uptorn.</l>
               <l n="588">Alike the Teucrian and Trinacrian throng</l>
               <l n="589">shout wildly; while Acestes, pitying, hastes</l>
               <l n="590">to lift his gray companion. But, unchecked,</l>
               <l n="591">undaunted by his fall, the champion brave</l>
               <l n="592">rushed fiercer to the fight, his strength now roused</l>
               <l n="593">by rage, while shame and courage confident</l>
               <l n="594">kindle his soul; impetuous he drives</l>
               <l n="595">Dares full speed all round the ring, with blows</l>
               <l n="596">redoubled right and left. No stop or stay</l>
               <l n="597">gives he, but like a storm of rattling hail</l>
               <l n="598">upon a house-top, so from each huge hand</l>
               <l n="599">the champion's strokes on dizzy Dares fall.</l>

               <l n="603">and, rescuing weary Dares, thus he spoke</l>

               <l n="611">came blood and broken teeth. So to the ship</l>
               <l n="612">they bore him, taking, at Aeneas' word,</l>

               <l n="615">He, then, elate and glorying, spoke forth:</l>

               <l n="619">he turned him full front to the bull, who stood</l>
               <l n="620">for reward of the fight, and, drawing back</l>
               <l n="621">his right hand, poising the dread gauntlet high,</l>
               <l n="622">swung sheer between the horns and crushed the skull;</l>
               <l n="623">a trembling, lifeless creature, to the ground</l>
               <l n="624">the bull dropped forward dead. Above the fallen</l>

               <l n="860">the clouds of smoke and hovering flame could see.</l>
               <l n="861">Ascanius, who had led with smiling brow</l>
               <l n="862">his troops of horse, accoutred as he was,</l>
               <l n="863">rode hot-haste to the turmoil of the camp,</l>

               <l n="877">they knew their kin and husbands, and their hearts</l>
               <l n="878">from Juno were set free. <milestone ed="p" n="680" unit="card"/>But none the less</l>
               <l n="879">the burning and indomitable flames</l>
               <l n="880">raged without stay; beneath the ships' smeared sides</l>
               <l n="881">the hempen fuel puffed a lingering smoke,</l>
               <l n="882">as, through the whole bulk creeping, the slow fire</l>
               <l n="883">devoured its way; and little it availed</l>
               <l n="884">that strong men fought the fire with stream on stream.</l>
               <l n="885">Then good Aeneas from his shoulder rent</l>
               <l n="886">his garment, and with lifted hands implored</l>

               <l n="897">when with a bursting deluge a dark storm</l>
               <l n="898">falls, marvellous to see; while hills and plains</l>

               <l n="902">on every ship, and all the smouldering beams</l>
               <l n="903">are drenched, until the smoke and flames expire</l>
               <l n="904">and (though four ships be lost) the burning fleet</l>
               <l n="905">rides rescued from its doom. <milestone ed="p" n="700" unit="card"/>But smitten sore</l>
               <l n="906">by this mischance, Aeneas doubtfully</l>
               <l n="907">weighs in his heart its mighty load of cares,</l>
               <l n="908">and ponders if indeed he may abide</l>

               <l n="467">Grasping the steep rock, came a cruel horde</l>
               <l n="468">Upon me with drawn blades, accounting me—</l>
               <l n="469">So blind they were!—a wrecker's prize and spoil.</l>
               <l n="470">Now are the waves my tomb; and wandering winds</l>
               <l n="471">Toss me along the coast. 0, I implore,</l>
               <l n="472">By heaven's sweet light, by yonder upper air,</l>
               <l n="473">By thy lost father, by lulus dear,</l>
               <l n="474">Thy rising hope and joy, that from these woes,</l>
               <l n="475">Unconquered chieftain, thou wilt set me free!</l>
               <l n="476">Give me a grave where <placeName key="perseus,Velia">Velia</placeName>'s haven lies,</l>

               <l n="482">Until (least gift!) death bring me peace and calm.”</l>
               <l n="483">Such words he spoke: the priestess thus replied:</l>
               <l n="484">“Why, Palinurus, these unblest desires?</l>
               <l n="485">Wouldst thou, unsepulchred, behold the wave</l>
               <l n="486">Of Styx, stern river of th' Eumenides?</l>
               <l n="487">Wouldst thou, unbidden, tread its fearful strand?</l>
               <l n="488">Hope not by prayer to change the laws of Heaven!</l>
               <l n="489">But heed my words, and in thy memory</l>
               <l n="490">Cherish and keep, to cheer this evil time.</l>
               <l n="491">Lo, far and wide, led on by signs from Heaven,</l>
               <l n="492">Thy countrymen from many a templed town</l>
               <l n="493">Shall consecrate thy dust, and build thy tomb,</l>
               <l n="494">A tomb with annual feasts and votive flowers,</l>
               <l n="495">To Palinurus a perpetual fame!”</l>
               <l n="496">Thus was his anguish stayed, from his sad heart</l>
               <l n="497">Grief ebbed awhile, and even to this day,</l>
               <l n="498">Our land is glad such noble name to wear.</l>

               <l n="499">The twain continue now their destined way</l>

               <l n="502">Hailed them, at distance, from the Stygian wave,</l>

               <l n="506">Thine errand! Stay thee where thou standest now!</l>
               <l n="507">This is ghosts' land, for sleep and slumbrous dark.</l>
               <l n="508">That flesh and blood my Stygian ship should bear</l>
               <l n="509">Were lawless wrong. Unwillingly I took</l>
               <l n="510">Alcides, Theseus, and Pirithous,</l>
               <l n="511">Though sons of gods, too mighty to be quelled.</l>
               <l n="512">One bound in chains yon warder of Hell's door,</l>
               <l n="513">And dragged him trembling from our monarch's throne:</l>
               <l n="514">The others, impious, would steal away</l>
               <l n="515">Out of her bride-bed Pluto's ravished Queen.”</l>
               <l n="516">Briefly th' Amphrysian priestess made reply:</l>

               <l n="527">“Thou knowest well.”</l>
               <l n="528">Then cooled his wrathful heart;</l>

               <l n="533">The rows of crouching ghosts along the thwarts</l>
               <l n="534">He scattered, cleared a passage, and gave room</l>
               <l n="535">To great Aeneas. The light shallop groaned</l>
               <l n="536">Beneath his weight, and, straining at each seam,</l>

               <l n="538">At last the hero and his priestess-guide</l>

               <l n="882">And musing he reviewed the legions bright</l>
               <l n="883">Of his own progeny and offspring proud—</l>
               <l n="884">Their fates and fortunes, virtues and great deeds.</l>
               <l n="885">Soon he discerned Aeneas drawing nigh</l>

               <l n="887">In eager welcome, spread them swiftly forth.</l>
               <l n="888">Tears from his eyelids rained, and thus he spoke:</l>

               <l n="890">Of me thy sire achieved yon arduous way?</l>
               <l n="891">Will Heaven, beloved son, once more allow</l>

               <l n="897">To this embrace! What perils manifold</l>
               <l n="898">Assailed thee, 0 my son, on every side!</l>
               <l n="899">How long I trembled, lest that Libyan throne</l>
               <l n="900">Should work thee woe!”</l>
               <l n="901">Aeneas thus replied:</l>
               <l n="902">“Thine image, sire, thy melancholy shade,</l>
               <l n="903">Came oft upon my vision, and impelled</l>
               <l n="904">My journey hitherward. Our fleet of ships</l>
               <l n="905">Lies safe at anchor in the Tuscan seas.</l>
               <l n="906">Come, clasp my hand! Come, father, I implore,</l>
               <l n="907">And heart to heart this fond embrace receive!”</l>
               <l n="908">So speaking, all his eyes suffused with tears;</l>
               <l n="909">Thrice would his arms in vain that shape enfold.</l>
               <l n="910">Thrice from the touch of hand the vision fled,</l>
               <l n="911">Like wafted winds or likest hovering dreams.</l>

               <l n="912">After these things Aeneas was aware</l>

               <l n="914">Where trees were whispering, and forever flowed</l>
               <l n="915">The river Lethe, through its land of calm.</l>

               <l n="924">What yonder rivers be; what people press,</l>
               <l n="925">Line after line, on those dim shores along.</l>
               <l n="926">Said Sire Anchises: “Yonder thronging souls</l>

               <l n="928">Here, at the river Lethe's wave, they quaff</l>
               <l n="929">Care-quelling floods, and long oblivion.</l>
               <l n="930">Of these I shall discourse, and to thy soul</l>

               <l n="939">“I speak, my son, nor make thee longer doubt,”</l>
               <l n="940">Anchises said, and thus the truth set forth,</l>

               <l n="963">Some hang on high, outstretched to viewless winds;</l>
               <l n="964">For some their sin's contagion must be purged</l>
               <l n="965">In vast ablution of deep-rolling seas,</l>

               <l n="75">the name of Pallanteum. They make war</l>
               <l n="76">incessant with the Latins. Therefore call </l>
               <l n="77">this people to thy side and bind them close</l>
               <l n="78">in federated power. My channel fair</l>

               <l n="82">and ere the starlight fade give honor due</l>
               <l n="83">to Juno, and with supplicating vow</l>

               <l n="114">white like herself, on the green bank the Sow</l>

               <l n="121">till like some gentle lake or sleeping pool</l>
               <l n="122">his even waters lay, and strove no more</l>
               <l n="123">against the oarsmen's toil. Upon their way</l>
               <l n="124">they speed with joyful sound; the well-oiled wood</l>
               <l n="125">slips through the watery floor; the wondering waves,</l>

               <l n="130">their sturdy oars outweary the slow course</l>

               <l n="157">Your kin, your country? Bring ye peace or war?”</l>
               <l n="158">Father Aeneas then held forth a bough</l>

               <l n="274">three-bodied Geryon, whose spoils he wore</l>
               <l n="275">exultant, and with hands victorious drove</l>
               <l n="276">the herd of monster bulls, which pastured free</l>
               <l n="277">along our river-valley. Cacus gazed</l>
               <l n="278">in a brute frenzy, and left not untried</l>
               <l n="279">aught of bold crime or stratagem, but stole</l>
               <l n="280">four fine bulls as they fed, and heifers four,</l>
               <l n="281">all matchless; but, lest hoof-tracks point his way,</l>
               <l n="282">he dragged them cave-wards by the tails, confusing</l>
               <l n="283">the natural trail, and hid the stolen herd</l>
               <l n="284">in his dark den; and not a mark or sign</l>
               <l n="285">could guide the herdsmen to that cavern-door.</l>
               <l n="286">But after, when Amphitryon's famous son,</l>
               <l n="287">preparing to depart, would from the meads</l>
               <l n="288">goad forth the full-fed herd, his lingering bulls</l>
               <l n="289">roared loud, and by their lamentable cry</l>
               <l n="290">filled grove and hills with clamor of farewell:</l>
               <l n="291">one heifer from the mountain-cave lowed back</l>
               <l n="292">in answer, so from her close-guarded stall</l>
               <l n="293">foiling the monster's will. <milestone ed="p" n="219" unit="card"/>Then hadst thou seen</l>
               <l n="294">the wrath of Hercules in frenzy blaze</l>
               <l n="295">from his exasperate heart. His arms he seized,</l>
               <l n="296">his club of knotted oak, and climbed full-speed</l>
               <l n="297">the wind-swept hill. Now first our people saw</l>
               <l n="298">Cacus in fear, with panic in his eyes.</l>
               <l n="299">Swift to the black cave like a gale he flew,</l>
               <l n="300">his feet by terror winged. Scarce had he passed</l>
               <l n="301">the cavern door, and broken the big chains,</l>
               <l n="302">and dropped the huge rock which was pendent there</l>
               <l n="303">by Vulcan's well-wrought steel; scarce blocked and barred</l>
               <l n="304">the guarded gate: when there Tirynthius stood,</l>
               <l n="305">with heart aflame, surveying each approach,</l>
               <l n="306">rolling this way and that his wrathful eyes,</l>
               <l n="307">gnashing his teeth. Three times his ire surveyed</l>
               <l n="308">the slope of <placeName key="tgn,4012809">Aventine</placeName>; three times he stormed</l>
               <l n="309">the rock-built gate in vain; and thrice withdrew</l>
               <l n="310">to rest him in the vale. But high above</l>
               <l n="311">a pointed peak arose, sheer face of rock</l>
               <l n="312">on every side, which towered into view</l>
               <l n="313">from the long ridge above the vaulted cave,</l>
               <l n="314">fit haunt for birds of evil-boding wing.</l>
               <l n="315">This peak, which leftward toward the river leaned,</l>
               <l n="316">he smote upon its right—his utmost blow —</l>
               <l n="317">breaking its bases Ioose; then suddenly</l>
               <l n="318">thrust at it: as he thrust, the thunder-sound</l>
               <l n="319">filled all the arching sky, the river's banks</l>
               <l n="320">asunder leaped, and <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName> in alarm</l>
               <l n="321">reversed his flowing wave. So Cacus' lair</l>
               <l n="322">lay shelterless, and naked to the day</l>
               <l n="323">the gloomy caverns of his vast abode</l>
               <l n="324">stood open, deeply yawning, just as if</l>
               <l n="325">the riven earth should crack, and open wide</l>
               <l n="326">th' infernal world and fearful kingdoms pale,</l>
               <l n="327">which gods abhor; and to the realms on high</l>
               <l n="328">the measureless abyss should be laid bare,</l>
               <l n="329">and pale ghosts shrink before the entering sun.</l>
               <l n="330">Now upon Cacus, startled by the glare,</l>
               <l n="331">caged in the rocks and howling horribly,</l>
               <l n="332">Alcides hurled his weapons, raining down</l>
               <l n="333">all sorts of deadly missiles—trunks of trees,</l>
               <l n="334">and monstrous boulders from the mountain torn.</l>
               <l n="335">But when the giant from his mortal strait</l>
               <l n="336">no refuge knew, he blew from his foul jaws</l>
               <l n="337">a storm of smoke—incredible to tell —</l>
               <l n="338">and with thick darkness blinding every eye,</l>
               <l n="339">concealed his cave, uprolling from below</l>
               <l n="340">one pitch-black night of mingled gloom and fire.</l>
               <l n="341">This would Alcides not endure, but leaped</l>
               <l n="342">headlong across the flames, where densest hung</l>

               <l n="344">a drifting and impenetrable cloud.</l>
               <l n="345">With Cacus, who breathed unavailing flame,</l>
               <l n="346">he grappled in the dark, locked limb with limb,</l>
               <l n="347">and strangled him, till o'er the bloodless throat</l>
               <l n="348">the starting eyeballs stared.<milestone ed="p" n="262" unit="card"/>Then Hercules</l>
               <l n="349">burst wide the doorway of the sooty den,</l>

               <l n="351">the stolen cattle and the robber's crimes,</l>
               <l n="352">and dragged forth by the feet the shapeless corpse</l>

               <l n="355">of bristling shag, the face both beast and man,</l>

               <l n="360">Potitius began the worship due,</l>

               <l n="369">He spoke; and of the poplar's changeful sheen,</l>

               <l n="418">from trees engendered and stout heart of oak.</l>

               <l n="423">Then Saturn from Olympian realms came down,</l>
               <l n="424">in flight from Jove's dread arms, his sceptre lost,</l>
               <l n="425">and he an exiled King. That savage race</l>
               <l n="426">he gathered from the mountain slopes; and gave</l>

               <l n="338">and after mighty slaughter and huge spoil</l>
               <l n="339">ye soon shall see us back. Nor need ye fear</l>
               <l n="340">we wander from the way. Oft have we seen</l>
               <l n="341">that city's crest loom o'er the shadowy vales,</l>
               <l n="342">where we have hunted all day long and know</l>
               <l n="343">each winding of yon river.” <milestone ed="p" n="246" unit="card"/>Then uprose</l>
               <l n="344">aged Aletes, crowned with wisdom's years:</l>

               <l n="346">watch over <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, ye surely had no mind</l>
               <l n="347">to blot out Teucria's name, when ye bestowed</l>
               <l n="348">such courage on young hearts, and bade them be</l>
               <l n="349">so steadfast and so leal.” Joyful he clasped</l>
               <l n="350">their hands in his, and on their shoulders leaned,</l>
               <l n="351">his aged cheek and visage wet with tears.</l>
               <l n="352">“What reward worthy of such actions fair,</l>
               <l n="353">dear heroes, could be given? Your brightest prize</l>
               <l n="354">will come from Heaven and your own hearts. The rest</l>

               <l n="364">That day will tears be dry; and I will give</l>
               <l n="365">two silver wine-cups graven and o'erlaid</l>
               <l n="366">with clear-cut figures, which my father chose</l>

               <l n="372">to seize the sceptre and divide the spoil, —</l>
               <l n="373">saw you that steed of Turnus and the arms</l>
               <l n="374">in which he rode, all golden? That same steed,</l>
               <l n="375">that glittering shield and haughty crimson crest</l>
               <l n="376">I will reserve thee, e'er the lots are cast,</l>
               <l n="377">and, Nisus, they are thine. Hereto my sire</l>
               <l n="378">will add twelve captive maids of beauty rare,</l>
               <l n="379">and slaves in armor; last, thou hast the fields</l>
               <l n="380">which now Latinus holds. But as for thee,</l>
               <l n="381">to whom my youth but binds me closer still,</l>
               <l n="382">thee, kingly boy, my whole heart makes my own,</l>
               <l n="383">and through all changeful fortune we shall be</l>
               <l n="384">inseparable peers: nor will I seek</l>
               <l n="385">renown and glory, or in peace or war,</l>
               <l n="386">forgetting thee: but trust thee from this day</l>
               <l n="387">in deed and word.” To him in answer spoke</l>
               <l n="388">euryalus, “O, may no future show</l>
               <l n="389">this heart unworthy thy heroic call!</l>
               <l n="390">And may our fortune ever prosperous prove,</l>
               <l n="391">not adverse. But I now implore of thee</l>
               <l n="392">a single boon worth all beside. I have</l>
               <l n="393">a mother, from the venerated line</l>
               <l n="394">of Priam sprung, whom not the Trojan shore</l>
               <l n="395">nor King Acestes' city could detain,</l>
               <l n="396">alas! from following me. I leave her now</l>
               <l n="397">without farewell; nor is her love aware</l>
               <l n="398">of my supposed peril. For I swear</l>
               <l n="399">by darkness of this night and thy right hand,</l>
               <l n="400">that all my courage fails me if I see</l>
               <l n="401">a mother's tears. O, therefore, I implore,</l>
               <l n="402">be thou her sorrow's comfort and sustain</l>
               <l n="403">her solitary day. Such grace from thee</l>
               <l n="404">equip me for my war, and I shall face</l>
               <l n="405">with braver heart whatever fortune brings.”</l>
               <l n="406">With sudden sorrow thrilled, the veteran lords</l>
               <l n="407">of Teucria showed their tears. But most of all</l>
               <l n="408">such likeness of his own heart's filial love</l>
               <l n="409">on fair Iulus moved, and thus he spoke:</l>
               <l n="410">“Promise thyself what fits thy generous deeds.</l>
               <l n="411">Thy mother shall be mine, Creusa's name</l>
               <l n="412">alone not hers; nor is the womb unblest</l>
               <l n="413">that bore a child like thee. Whate'er success</l>
               <l n="414">may follow, I make oath immutable</l>
               <l n="415">by my own head, on which my father swore,</l>
               <l n="416">that all I promise thee of gift or praise</l>
               <l n="417">if home thou comest triumphing, shall be</l>
               <l n="418">the glory of thy mother and thy kin.”</l>
               <l n="419">Weeping he spoke, and from his shoulder drew</l>
               <l n="420">the golden sword, well-wrought and wonderful,</l>
               <l n="421">which once in Crete Lycaon's cunning made</l>
               <l n="422">and sheathed in ivory. On Nisus then</l>
               <l n="423">Mnestheus bestowed a shaggy mantle torn</l>
               <l n="424">from a slain lion; good Aletes gave</l>
               <l n="425">exchange of crested helms. In such array</l>
               <l n="426">they hastened forth; and all the princely throng,</l>
               <l n="427">young men and old, ran with them to the gates,</l>
               <l n="428">praying all gods to bless. Iulus then,</l>
               <l n="429">a fair youth, but of grave, heroic soul</l>
               <l n="430">beyond his years, gave them in solemn charge</l>
               <l n="431">full many a message for his sire, but these</l>
               <l n="432">the hazard of wild winds soon scattered far,</l>
               <l n="433">and flung them fruitless on the darkening storm.</l>
            </div>
            <div type="textpart" subtype="card" resp="p" n="314">
               <l n="434">Forth through the moat they climb, and steal away</l>
               <l n="435">through midnight shades, to where their foemen lie</l>
               <l n="436">encamped in arms; of whom, before these fall,</l>
               <l n="437">a host shall die. Along the turf were seen,</l>
               <l n="438">laid low in heavy slumber and much wine,</l>
               <l n="439">a prostrate troop; the horseless chariots</l>
               <l n="440">stood tilted on the shore, 'twixt rein and wheel</l>
               <l n="441">the drivers dozed, wine-cups and idle swords</l>
               <l n="442">strewn round them without heed. The first to speak</l>
               <l n="443">was Nisus. “Look, Euryalus,” he cried,</l>
               <l n="444">“Now boldly strike. The hour to do the deed</l>
               <l n="445">is here, the path this way. Keep wide-eyed watch</l>
               <l n="446">that no man smite behind us. I myself</l>
               <l n="447">will mow the mighty fieid, and lead thee on</l>
               <l n="448">in a wide swath of slaughter.” With this word</l>
               <l n="449">he shut his lips; and hurled him with his sword</l>
               <l n="450">on haughty Rhamnes, who lay propped at ease</l>
               <l n="451">on pillows huge, and from his heaving breast</l>
               <l n="452">poured slumber loud: of royal stem was he</l>
               <l n="453">and honored of King Turnus for his skill</l>
               <l n="454">in augury; yet could no augur's charm</l>
               <l n="455">that bloody stroke forefend. And Nisus slew</l>
               <l n="456">three slaves near by, that lay in reckless sleep</l>
               <l n="457">upon their spears; then him that bore the shield</l>
               <l n="458">of Remus, then the driver of his car</l>
               <l n="459">close to the horses caught; his sword cut through</l>
               <l n="460">their prostrate necks; then their great master's head</l>
               <l n="461">he lifted high, and left decapitate</l>
               <l n="462">the huge corpse spilling forth its crimson gore</l>
               <l n="463">o'er couch and ground. Like stroke on Lamus fell</l>
               <l n="464">and Lamyrus, with young Serranus, who</l>
               <l n="465">had gamed the midnight through and sleeping lay,</l>
               <l n="466">his fair young body to the wine-god given;</l>
               <l n="467">but happier now had that long-revelling night</l>
               <l n="468">been merry till the dawn! Thus round full folds</l>
               <l n="469">of sheep a famished lion fiercely prowls;</l>
               <l n="470">mad hunger moves him; he devours and rends</l>
               <l n="471">with bloody, roaring mouth, the feeble flock</l>
               <l n="472">that trembles and is dumb. Nor was the sword</l>
               <l n="473">of fair Euryalus less fatal found;</l>
               <l n="474">but fiercely raging on his path of death,</l>
               <l n="475">he pressed on through a base and nameless throng,</l>
               <l n="476">Rhoetus, Herbesus, Fadus, Abaris;</l>
               <l n="477">surprising all save Rhoetus, who awake</l>
               <l n="478">saw every stroke, and crouched in craven fear</l>
               <l n="479">behind a mighty wine-bowl; but not less</l>
               <l n="480">clean through his bare breast as he started forth</l>
               <l n="481">the youth thrust home his sword, then drew it back</l>
               <l n="482">death-dripping, while the bursting purple stream</l>
               <l n="483">of life outflowed, with mingling blood and wine.</l>
               <l n="484">Then, flushed with stealthy slaughter, he crept near</l>
               <l n="485">the followers of Messapus, where he saw</l>
               <l n="486">their camp-fire dying down, and tethered steeds</l>
               <l n="487">upon the meadow feeding. Nisus then</l>
               <l n="488">knew the hot lust of slaughter had swept on </l>
               <l n="489">too far, and cried, “Hold off! For, lo,</l>
               <l n="490">the monitory dawn is nigh. Revenge</l>
               <l n="491">has fed us to the full. We have achieved</l>
               <l n="492">clean passage through the foe.” Full many a prize</l>
               <l n="493">was left untaken: princely suits of mail</l>
               <l n="494">enwrought with silver pure, huge drinking-bowls,</l>
               <l n="495">and broideries fair. Yet grasped Euryalus</l>
               <l n="496">the blazonry at Rhamnes' corselet hung,</l>
               <l n="497">and belt adorned with gold: which were a gift</l>
               <l n="498">to Remulus of <placeName key="perseus,Tibur">Tibur</placeName> from the store</l>
               <l n="499">of opulent Caedicus, who sued from far</l>
               <l n="500">to be a friend; and these in death he gave</l>
               <l n="501">to his son's son, who slain in battle fell,</l>
               <l n="502">and proud Rutulians seized them with the spoil.</l>
               <l n="503">Euryalus about his shoulder strong</l>
               <l n="504">this booty slung—unprofitable gain! —</l>
               <l n="505">and fitted on a gorgeous, crested helm</l>
               <l n="506">which once Messapus wore. So from the camp,</l>
               <l n="507">escaping danger, the two champions ran.</l>

            <div type="textpart" subtype="card" resp="p" n="367">
               <l n="508">But horsemen from the Latin city sent</l>
               <l n="509">to join the serried legions of the plain</l>
               <l n="510">had come at Turnus' call, three hundred strong</l>
               <l n="511">all bearing shields, and under the command</l>
               <l n="512">of Volscens. Nigh the camp and walls they drew;</l>
               <l n="513">and soon they spied upon the leftward path</l>
               <l n="514">th' heroic pair, where in dim shades of night</l>
               <l n="515">the helmet of Euryalus betrayed</l>
               <l n="516">the heedless boy, and with a glancing beam</l>
               <l n="517">flashed on the foe. Nor was it seen in vain.</l>
               <l n="518">Loud from the line the voice of Volscens called:</l>
               <l n="519">“Stand, gentlemen! What business brings you here?</l>
               <l n="520">Whose your allegiance? Whither speed so fast?”</l>
               <l n="521">No answer gave they save to fly in haste</l>
               <l n="522">to cover of the forest and deep gloom</l>
               <l n="523">of the defensive night. The horsemen then</l>
               <l n="524">blocked every crossway known, and, scattering wide,</l>
               <l n="525">kept sentry at the entrance. The great wood</l>
               <l n="526">was all of tangled brush and blinding shade</l>
               <l n="527">of flex-boughs. Impenetrable thorns</l>
               <l n="528">had thickly overgrown, and seldom showed</l>
               <l n="529">a pathway through the maze. Euryalus,</l>
               <l n="530">by the black branches and his ponderous spoil</l>
               <l n="531">impeded, groped along in fearful doubt,</l>
               <l n="532">deceived and quite astray. Nisus his friend</l>
               <l n="533">had quit him, and incautiously had forced</l>
               <l n="534">a sally through the close-encircling foe,</l>
               <l n="535">into that region which should after bear</l>
               <l n="536">the name of Alba—a rude shelter then</l>
               <l n="537">for King Latinus' herds. He stayed him there</l>
               <l n="538">and looked, but vainly, for the comrade gone.</l>
               <l n="539">“Euryalus, ill-fated boy!” he cried,</l>
               <l n="540">“Where have I lost thee in the pathless wild?</l>
               <l n="541">How find thee? How retrace the blinding maze</l>
               <l n="542">of yonder treacherous wood?” Yet ere he said,</l>
               <l n="543">on his own path he turns him back, and scans</l>
               <l n="544">his own light footprints through the tangled thorn,</l>
               <l n="545">so dark and still. But suddenly he hears</l>
               <l n="546">the tread of horses, with confusing din</l>
               <l n="547">and tumult of pursuit. Nor was it long</l>
               <l n="548">he tarried ere upon his anguished ear</l>
               <l n="549">smote a great cry: and, lo! Euryalus,</l>
               <l n="550">trapped by the dark night, the deceptive ground,</l>
               <l n="551">faced the whole onset, and fell back o'erwhelmed</l>
               <l n="552">by a loud mob of foes, while his sole sword</l>
               <l n="553">tried many a thrust in vain. O, what defence</l>
               <l n="554">may Nisus bring? With what audacious arms</l>
               <l n="555">his chosen comrade save? Shall he make bare</l>
               <l n="556">his dying breast to all their swords, and run</l>
               <l n="557">to honorable death that bloody way?</l>
               <l n="558">he swung his spear with lifted arm, then looked</l>
               <l n="559">to the still moon, in heaven, and thus implored:</l>
               <l n="560">“O goddess, aid me in my evil case.</l>
               <l n="561">O glory of the stars, Latona's child!</l>
               <l n="562">O guardian of groves, if in my name</l>
               <l n="563">my father Hyrtacus made offerings</l>
               <l n="564">on burning altars, if my own right hand,</l>
               <l n="565">successful in the chase, ere hung its gift</l>
               <l n="566">beneath thy dome or on thy sacred wall,</l>
               <l n="567">grant me yon troop to scatter. Guide my spear</l>
               <l n="568">along its path in air.” He spoke, and hurled</l>
               <l n="569">with all his gathered strength the shaft of steel.</l>
               <l n="570">the swift spear clove the shades of night, and struck</l>
               <l n="571">full in the back of Sulmo, where it split,</l>
               <l n="572">but tore through to his very heart. The breast</l>
               <l n="573">poured forth life's glowing stream, and he, o'erthrown</l>
               <l n="574">lay cold in death, while his huge, heaving sides</l>
               <l n="575">gave lingering throes. The men about him stared </l>
               <l n="576">this way and that. But Nisus, fiercer still,</l>
               <l n="577">poised level with his ear a second shaft,</l>
               <l n="578">and, while the foeman paused, the whizzing spear </l>
               <l n="579">straight through the brows of Tagus drove, and clung</l>
               <l n="580">deep in the cloven brain. <milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="card"/>In frenzy rose</l>
               <l n="581">Volscens, but nowhere could espy what hand</l>
               <l n="582">the shaft had hurled, nor whither his wild rage</l>
               <l n="583">could make reply. “But thou,” he cried, “shalt feed</l>
               <l n="584">with thy hot blood my honor and revenge</l>
               <l n="585">for both the slain.” Then with a sword unsheathed</l>
               <l n="586">upon Euryalus he fell. Loud shrieked</l>
               <l n="587">Nisus, of reason reft, who could not bear</l>
               <l n="588">such horror, nor in sheltering gloom of night</l>
               <l n="589">longer abide: “'T is I, 't is I!” he said.</l>
               <l n="590">look on the man who slew them! Draw on me</l>
               <l n="591">your swords, Rutulians! The whole stratagem</l>
               <l n="592">was mine, mine only, and the lad ye slay</l>
               <l n="593">dared not, and could not. O, by Heaven above</l>
               <l n="594">and by the all-beholding stars I swear,</l>
               <l n="595">he did but love his hapless friend too well.”</l>
               <l n="596">But while he spoke, the furious-thrusting sword</l>
               <l n="597">had pierced the tender body, and run through</l>
               <l n="598">the bosom white as snow. Euryalus</l>
               <l n="599">sank prone in death; upon his goodly limbs</l>
               <l n="600">the life-blood ran unstopped, and low inclined</l>
               <l n="601">the drooping head; as when some purpled flower,</l>
               <l n="602">cut by the ploughshare, dies, or poppies proud</l>
               <l n="603">with stem forlorn their ruined beauty bow</l>
               <l n="604">before the pelting storm. Then Nisus flew</l>
               <l n="605">straight at his foes; but in their throng would find</l>
               <l n="606">Volscens alone, for none but Volscens stayed:</l>
               <l n="607">they gathered thickly round and grappled him</l>
               <l n="608">in shock of steel with steel. But on he plunged,</l>
               <l n="609">swinging in ceaseless circles round his head</l>
               <l n="610">his lightning-sword, and thrust it through the face</l>
               <l n="611">of shrieking Volscens, with his own last breath</l>
               <l n="612">striking his foeman down; then cast himself</l>
               <l n="613">upon his fallen comrade's breast; and there,</l>
               <l n="614">stabbed through, found tranquil death and sure repose. </l>

               <l n="357">equip their souls for war, and wait in arms</l>

               <l n="373">uplifted its bright peak,—like streaming flame</l>

               <l n="378">which rises to bring drought and pestilence</l>
               <l n="379">to hapless men, and with ill-omened ray</l>
               <l n="380">saddens the sky. <milestone ed="p" n="276" unit="card"/>But Turnus, undismayed,</l>
               <l n="381">trusted not less to hurl th' invaders back</l>
               <l n="382">and hold the shore against them. “Look!” he cried,</l>
               <l n="383">your prayer is come to pass,—that sword in hand</l>
               <l n="384">ye now may shatter them. The might of Mars</l>

               <l n="390">Fortune will help the brave.” With words like these,</l>
               <l n="391">he chose, well-weighing, who should lead the charge,</l>
               <l n="392">who at the leaguered walls the fight sustain.</l>

               <l n="620">expecting Fortune's favor to the brave</l>
               <l n="621">in such unequal match; and thus he prayed:</l>

               <l n="655">the hot shaft from the wound; his life and blood</l>
               <l n="656">together ebbed away, as sinking prone</l>
               <l n="657">on his rent side he fell; above him rang</l>

               <l n="659">he breathed his last upon his foeman's ground.</l>
               <l n="660">Over him Turnus stood: “Arcadians all,”</l>

               <l n="749">the victor stood, and thrusting it away</l>
               <l n="750">spoke thus with wrathful soul: “Now lie thou there,</l>

               <l n="776">Meanwhile, with two white coursers to their car,</l>
               <l n="777">the brothers Lucagus and Liger drove</l>

               <l n="789">the Trojan hero answered him, but flung</l>
               <l n="790">his whirling spear; and even as Lucagus</l>
               <l n="791">leaned o'er the horses, goading them with steel,</l>
               <l n="792">and, left foot forward, gathered all his strength</l>
               <l n="793">to strike—the spear crashed through the under rim</l>
               <l n="794">of his resplendent shield and entered deep</l>
               <l n="795">in the left groin; then from the chariot fallen,</l>
               <l n="796">the youth rolled dying on the field, while thus</l>
               <l n="797">pious Aeneas paid him taunting words:</l>
               <l n="798">“O Lucagus, thy chariot did not yield</l>
               <l n="799">because of horses slow to fly, or scared</l>
               <l n="800">by shadows of a foe. It was thyself</l>
               <l n="801">leaped o'er the wheel and fled.” So saying, he grasped</l>
               <l n="802">the horses by the rein. The brother then,</l>
               <l n="803">spilled also from the car, reached wildly forth</l>
               <l n="804">his helpless hands: “O, by thy sacred head,</l>
               <l n="805">and by the parents who such greatness gave,</l>
               <l n="806">good Trojan, let me live! Some pity show</l>
               <l n="807">to prostrate me!” But ere he longer sued,</l>
               <l n="808">Aeneas cried, “Not so thy language ran</l>

               <l n="810">brother from brother part!” Then where the life</l>
               <l n="811">hides in the bosom, he thrust deep his sword.</l>
               <l n="812">Thus o'er the field of war the Dardan King</l>
               <l n="813">moved on, death-dealing: like a breaking flood</l>
               <l n="814">or cloudy whirlwind seemed his wrath. Straightway</l>
               <l n="815">the boy Ascanius from the ramparts came,</l>

               <l n="823">Juno made meek reply: “O noblest spouse!</l>

               <l n="836">Thus in few words th' Olympian King replied:</l>

               <l n="839">if but so far thou bidst me interpose,—</l>

               <l n="886">and scaling the high bridge; but scarce he reached</l>
               <l n="887">the vessel's prow, when Juno cut her loose,</l>
               <l n="888">the cables breaking, and along swift waves</l>
               <l n="889">pushed her to sea. Yet in that very hour</l>
               <l n="890">Aeneas to the battle vainly called</l>
               <l n="891">the vanished foe, and round his hard-fought path</l>

               <l n="894">visibly upward and was Iost in cloud,</l>
               <l n="895">while Turnus drifted o'er the waters wide</l>

               <l n="897">he looked around him; little joy had he</l>
               <l n="898">in his own safety, but upraised his hands</l>
               <l n="899">in prayer to Heaven: “O Sire omnipotent!</l>

               <l n="908">I see them routed, and my ears receive</l>
               <l n="909">their dying groans. What is this thing I do?</l>
               <l n="910">Where will the yawning earth crack wide enough</l>
               <l n="911">beneath my feet? Ye tempests, pity me!</l>
               <l n="912">On rocks and reef—'t is Turnus' faithful prayer,</l>
               <l n="913">let this bark founder; fling it on the shoals</l>
               <l n="914">of wreckful isles, where no Rutulian eye</l>
               <l n="915">can follow me, or Rumor tell my shame.”</l>
               <l n="916">With such wild words his soul tossed to and fro,</l>
               <l n="917">not knowing if to hide his infamy</l>
               <l n="918">with his own sword and madly drive its blade</l>
               <l n="919">home to his heart, or cast him in the sea,</l>
               <l n="920">and, swimming to the rounded shore, renew</l>
               <l n="921">his battle with the Trojan foe. Three times</l>
               <l n="922">each fatal course he tried; but Juno's power</l>
               <l n="923">three times restrained, and with a pitying hand</l>
               <l n="924">the warrior's purpose barred. So on he sped</l>

               <l n="1092">the youth made mad defence; while fiercer burned</l>
               <l n="1093">the Trojan's anger; and of Lausus' days</l>
               <l n="1094">the loom of Fate spun forth the last thin thread;</l>
               <l n="1095">for now Aeneas thrust his potent blade</l>
               <l n="1096">deep through the stripling's breast and out of sight;</l>
               <l n="1097">through the light shield it passed—a frail defence</l>
               <l n="1098">to threaten with!—and through the tunic fine</l>
               <l n="1099">his mother's hand had wrought with softest gold:</l>
               <l n="1100">blood filled his bosom, and on path of air</l>
               <l n="1101">down to the shades the mournful soul withdrew,</l>
               <l n="1102">its body quitting. As Anchises' son</l>
               <l n="1103">beheld the agonizing lips and brow</l>
               <l n="1104">so wondrous white in death, he groaned aloud</l>
               <l n="1105">in pity, and reached o'er him his right hand,</l>
               <l n="1106">touched to the heart such likeness to behold</l>
               <l n="1107">of his own filial love. “Unhappy boy!</l>
               <l n="1108">What reward worthy of heroic deeds</l>
               <l n="1109">can I award thee now? Wear still those arms</l>
               <l n="1110">so proudly worn! And I will send thee home</l>
               <l n="1111">(Perhaps thou carest!) to the kindred shades</l>
               <l n="1112">and ashes of thy sires. But let it be</l>
               <l n="1113">some solace in thy pitiable doom</l>
               <l n="1114">that none but great Aeneas wrought thy fall.”</l>
               <l n="1115">Then to the stripling's tardy followers</l>
               <l n="1116">he sternly called, and lifted from the earth</l>
               <l n="1117">with his own hand the fallen foe: dark blood</l>
               <l n="1118">defiled those princely tresses braided fair.</l>

               <l n="1119">Meanwhile Mezentius by the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>'s wave</l>
               <l n="1120">with water staunched his wound, and propped his weight</l>
               <l n="1121">against a tree; upon its limbs above</l>
               <l n="1122">his brazen helmet hung, and on the sward</l>
               <l n="1123">his ponderous arms lay resting. Round him watched</l>
               <l n="1124">his chosen braves. He, gasping and in pain,</l>
               <l n="1125">clutched at his neck and let his flowing beard</l>
               <l n="1126">loose on his bosom fall; he questions oft</l>
               <l n="1127">of Lausus, and sends many a messenger</l>
               <l n="1128">to bid him back, and bear him the command</l>
               <l n="1129">of his sore-grieving sire. But lo! his peers</l>
               <l n="1130">bore the dead Lausus back upon his shield,</l>
               <l n="1131">and wept to see so strong a hero quelled</l>
               <l n="1132">by stroke so strong. From long way off the sire,</l>
               <l n="1133">with soul prophetic of its woe, perceived</l>
               <l n="1134">what meant their wail and cry. On his gray hairs</l>
               <l n="1135">the dust he flung, and, stretching both his hands</l>
               <l n="1136">to heaven, he cast himself the corpse along.</l>
               <l n="1137">“O son,” he cried, “was life to me so sweet,</l>
               <l n="1138">that I to save myself surrendered o'er</l>

               <l n="1144">thy name with infamy—to exile driven</l>
               <l n="1145">from sceptre and hereditary throne</l>
               <l n="1146">by general curse. Would that myself had borne</l>

               <l n="1148">Would my own guilty life my debt had paid—</l>
               <l n="1149">yea, by a thousand deaths! But, see, I live!</l>
               <l n="1150">Not yet from human kind and light of day</l>
               <l n="1151">have I departed. But depart I will.”</l>
               <l n="1152">So saying, he raised him on his crippled thigh,</l>
               <l n="1153">and though by reason of the grievous wound</l>
               <l n="1154">his forces ebbed, yet with unshaken mien</l>
               <l n="1155">he bade them lead his war-horse forth, his pride,</l>
               <l n="1156">his solace, which from every war</l>
               <l n="1157">victorious bore him home. The master then</l>
               <l n="1158">to the brave beast, which seemed to know his pain,</l>
               <l n="1159">spoke thus: “My Rhoebus, we have passed our days</l>
               <l n="1160">long time together, if long time there be</l>
               <l n="1161">for mortal creatures. Either on this day</l>
               <l n="1162">thou shalt his bloody spoils in triumph bear</l>
               <l n="1163">and that Aeneas' head,—and so shalt be</l>
               <l n="1164">avenger of my Lausus' woe; or else,</l>
               <l n="1165">if I be vanquished, thou shalt sink and fall</l>
               <l n="1166">beside me. For, my bravest, thou wouldst spurn</l>
               <l n="1167">a stranger's will, and Teucrian lords to bear.”</l>
               <l n="1168">He spoke and, mounting to his back, disposed</l>
               <l n="1169">his limbs the wonted way and filled both hands</l>
               <l n="1170">with pointed javelins; a helm of brass</l>
               <l n="1171">with shaggy horse-hair crest gleamed o'er his brow.</l>
               <l n="1172">Swift to the front he rode: a mingled flood</l>
               <l n="1173">surged in his heart of sorrow, wrath, and shame;</l>
               <l n="1174">and thrice with loud voice on his foe he called.</l>

            <div type="textpart" subtype="card" resp="p" n="873">
               <l n="1175">Aeneas heard and made exulting vow:</l>
               <l n="1176">“Now may the Father of the gods on high,</l>
               <l n="1177">and great Apollo hear! Begin the fray!”</l>
               <l n="1178">He said, and moved forth with a threatening spear.</l>
               <l n="1179">The other cried: “Hast robbed me of my son,</l>
               <l n="1180">and now, implacable, wouldst fright me more?</l>
               <l n="1181">That way, that only, was it in thy power</l>
               <l n="1182">to cast me down. No fear of death I feel.</l>
               <l n="1183">Nor from thy gods themselves would I refrain.</l>
               <l n="1184">Give o'er! For fated and resolved to die</l>

               <l n="1186">these offerings.” With this he whirled a spear</l>
               <l n="1187">against his foe, and after it drove deep</l>
               <l n="1188">another and another, riding swift</l>
               <l n="1189">in wide gyration round him. But the shield,</l>
               <l n="1190">the golden boss, broke not. Three times he rode</l>
               <l n="1191">in leftward circles, hurling spear on spear</l>
               <l n="1192">against th' unmoved Aeneas: and three times</l>
               <l n="1193">the Trojan hero in his brazen shield</l>
               <l n="1194">the sheaf of spears upbore. But such slow fight,</l>
               <l n="1195">such plucking of spent shafts from out his shield,</l>
               <l n="1196">the Trojan liked not, vexed and sorely tried</l>
               <l n="1197">in duel so ill-matched. With wrathful soul</l>
               <l n="1198">at length he strode forth, and between the brows</l>
               <l n="1199">of the wild war-horse planted his Iong spear.</l>
               <l n="1200">Up reared the creature, beating at the air</l>
               <l n="1201">with quivering feet, then o'er his fallen lord</l>
               <l n="1202">entangling dropped, and prone above him lay,</l>
               <l n="1203">pinning with ponderous shoulder to the ground.</l>
               <l n="1204">The Trojans and the Latins rouse the skies</l>
               <l n="1205">with clamor Ioud. Aeneas hastening forth</l>
               <l n="1206">unsheathes his sword, and looming o'er him cries:</l>
               <l n="1207">“Where now is fierce Mezentius, and his soul's</l>
               <l n="1208">wild pulse of rage?” The Tuscan in reply</l>
               <l n="1209">with eyes uprolled, and gasping as he gave</l>
               <l n="1210">long looks at heaven, recalled his fading mind:</l>
               <l n="1211">“Why frown at me and fume, O bitterest foe?</l>
               <l n="1212">Why threaten death? To slay me is no sin.</l>
               <l n="1213">Not to take quarter came I to this war,</l>
               <l n="1214">not truce with thee did my lost Lausus crave,</l>
               <l n="1215">yet this one boon I pray,—if mercy be</l>
               <l n="1216">for fallen foes: O, suffer me when dead</l>
               <l n="1217">in covering earth to hide! Full well I know</l>
               <l n="1218">what curses of my people ring me round.</l>
               <l n="1219">Defend me from that rage! I pray to be</l>
               <l n="1220">my son's companion in our common tomb.”</l>
               <l n="1221">He spoke: then offered with unshrinking eye</l>
               <l n="1222">his veined throat to the sword. O'er the bright mail</l>
               <l n="1223">his vital breath gushed forth in streaming gore.</l>

               <l n="80">father's tears:—poor solace and too small</l>
               <l n="81">for grief so great, but due that mournful sire.</l>
               <l n="82">Some busy them to build of osiers fine</l>
               <l n="83">the simple litter, twining sapling oaks</l>
               <l n="84">with evergreen, till o'er death's Iofty bed</l>
               <l n="85">the branching shade extends. Upon it lay,</l>
               <l n="86">as if on shepherd's couch, the youthful dead,</l>
               <l n="87">like fairest flower by virgin fingers culled,</l>
               <l n="88">frail violet or hyacinth forlorn,</l>
               <l n="89">of color still undimmed and leaf unmarred;</l>
               <l n="90">but from the breast of mother-earth no more</l>
               <l n="91">its life doth feed. Then good Aeneas brought</l>
               <l n="92">two broidered robes of scarlet and fine gold,</l>
               <l n="93">which with the gladsome labor of her hands</l>
               <l n="94">Sidonian Dido wrought him long ago,</l>
               <l n="95">the thin-spun gold inweaving. One of these</l>
               <l n="96">the sad prince o'er the youthful body threw</l>
               <l n="97">for parting gift; and with the other veiled</l>
               <l n="98">those tresses from the fire; he heaped on high</l>
               <l n="99">Laurentum's spoils of war, and bade to bring</l>
               <l n="100">much tribute forth: horses and arms he gave,</l>
               <l n="101">seized from the fallen enemy; with hands</l>
               <l n="102">fettered behind them filed a captive train</l>
               <l n="103">doomed to appease the shades, and with the flames</l>
               <l n="104">to mix their flowing blood. He bade his chiefs</l>
               <l n="105">set up the trunks of trees and clothe them well</l>
               <l n="106">with captured arms, inscribing on each one</l>
               <l n="107">some foeman's name. Then came Acoetes forth,</l>
               <l n="108">a wretched, worn old man, who beat his breast</l>
               <l n="109">with tight-clenched hands, and tore his wrinkled face</l>
               <l n="110">with ruthless fingers; oft he cast him down</l>
               <l n="111">full length along the ground. Then lead they forth</l>
               <l n="112">the blood-stained Rutule chariots of war;</l>
               <l n="113">Aethon, the war-horse, of his harness bare,</l>
               <l n="114">walks mournful by; big teardrops wet his cheek.</l>
               <l n="115">Some bear the lance and helm; for all the rest</l>
               <l n="116">victorious Turnus seized. Then filed along</l>
               <l n="117">a mournful Teucrian cohort; next the host</l>
               <l n="118">Etrurian and the men of Arcady</l>
               <l n="119">with trailing arms reversed. Aeneas now,</l>
               <l n="120">when the long company had passed him by,</l>
               <l n="121">spoke thus and groaned aloud: “Ourselves from hence</l>
               <l n="122">are summoned by the same dread doom of war</l>
               <l n="123">to other tears. Farewell forevermore!</l>
               <l n="124">Heroic Pallas! be forever blest!</l>
               <l n="125">I bid thee hail, farewell!” In silence then</l>
               <l n="126">back to the stronghold's Iofty walls he moved.</l>

               <l n="139">you shun our friendship? Have you here implored</l>

               <l n="141">Pain would I grant it for the living too.</l>

               <l n="147">had Turnus met this death that makes you mourn.</l>
               <l n="148">If he would end our quarrel sword in hand,</l>

               <l n="161">shall my poor praise exalt thee to the skies?</l>
               <l n="162">Is it thy rectitude or strenuous war</l>

               <l n="171">and all the common voice consented loud.</l>

               <l n="721">he bore a little daughter in his arms</l>

               <l n="723">(Changing Casmilla, her queen-mother's name)</l>
               <l n="724">Camilla. Bearing on his breast the babe,</l>
               <l n="725">he fled to solitary upland groves.</l>
               <l n="726">But hovering round him with keen lances, pressed</l>
               <l n="727">the Volscian soldiery. Across his path,</l>
               <l n="728">lo, Amasenus with full-foaming wave</l>
               <l n="729">o'erflowed its banks—so huge a rain had burst</l>
               <l n="730">but lately from the clouds. There would he fain</l>
               <l n="731">swim over, but the love of that sweet babe</l>
               <l n="732">restrained him, trembling for his burden dear.</l>
               <l n="733">In his perplexed heart suddenly arose</l>
               <l n="734">firm resolve. It chanced the warrior bore</l>
               <l n="735">huge spear in his brawny hand, strong shaft</l>
               <l n="736">of knotted, seasoned oak; to this he lashed</l>

               <l n="738">pulled from a cork-tree, and with skilful bonds</l>
               <l n="739">fast bound her to the spear; then, poising it</l>
               <l n="740">high in his right hand, thus he called on Heaven:</l>

               <l n="741">‘Latona's daughter, whose benignant grace</l>
               <l n="742">protects this grove, behold, her father now</l>
               <l n="743">gives thee this babe for handmaid! Lo, thy spear</l>
               <l n="744">her infant fingers hold, as from her foes</l>
               <l n="745">she flies a suppliant to thee! Receive,</l>

               <l n="751">But Metabus, his foes in hot pursuit,</l>
               <l n="752">dared plunge him in mid-stream, and, triumphing,</l>
               <l n="753">soon plucked from grass-grown river-bank the spear,</l>
               <l n="754">the child upon it,—now to Trivia vowed,</l>
               <l n="755">a virgin offering. Him nevermore</l>
               <l n="756">could cities hold, nor would his wild heart yield</l>
               <l n="757">its sylvan freedom, but his days were passed</l>
               <l n="758">with shepherds on the solitary hills.</l>
               <l n="759">His daughter too in tangled woods he bred:</l>
               <l n="760">a brood-mare from the milk of her fierce breast</l>
               <l n="761">suckled the child, and to its tender lips</l>
               <l n="762">.Her udders moved; and when the infant feet</l>
               <l n="763">their first firm steps had taken, the small palms</l>
               <l n="764">were armed with a keen javelin; her sire</l>
               <l n="765">a bow and quiver from her shoulder slung.</l>
               <l n="766">Instead of golden combs and flowing pall,</l>

               <l n="768">the whole skin of a tigress; with soft hands</l>
               <l n="769">she made her plaything of a whirling spear,</l>
               <l n="770">or, swinging round her head the polished thong</l>
               <l n="771">of her good sling, she fetched from distant sky</l>
               <l n="772">Strymonian cranes or swans of spotless wing.</l>
               <l n="773">From Tuscan towns proud matrons oft in vain</l>
               <l n="774">sought her in marriage for their sons; but she</l>
               <l n="775">to Dian only turned her stainless heart,</l>
               <l n="776">her virgin freedom and her huntress' arms</l>
               <l n="777">with faithful passion serving. Would that now</l>

               <l n="779">the Teucrians to provoke! So might she be</l>
               <l n="780">one of our wood-nymphs still. But haste, I pray,</l>
               <l n="781">for bitter is her now impending doom.</l>
               <l n="782">Descend, dear nymph, from heaven, and explore</l>
               <l n="783">the country of the Latins, where the fight</l>
               <l n="784">with unpropitious omens now begins.</l>

               <l n="788">a Trojan or Italian, shall receive</l>
               <l n="789">bloody and swift reward at my command.</l>

               <l n="923">The turn of Butes and Orsilochus</l>
               <l n="924">came next, who were the Trojans, hugest twain:</l>
               <l n="925">yet Butes with her javelin-point she clove</l>
               <l n="926">from rearward, 'twixt the hauberk and the helm,</l>
               <l n="927">just where the horseman's neck showed white, and where</l>
               <l n="928">from shoulder leftward slung the light-weight shield.</l>
               <l n="929">From swift Orsilochus she feigned to fly,</l>
               <l n="930">through a wide circle sweeping, craftily</l>
               <l n="931">taking the inside track, pursuing so</l>
               <l n="932">her own pursuer; then she raised herself</l>
               <l n="933">to her full height, and through the warrior's helm</l>
               <l n="934">drove to his very skull with doubling blows</l>
               <l n="935">of her strong battle-axe,—while he implored</l>
               <l n="936">her mercy with loud prayers: his cloven brain</l>
               <l n="937">spilt o'er his face. Next in her pathway came—</l>
               <l n="938">but shrank in startled fear—the warrior son</l>
               <l n="939">of Aunus, haunter of the Apennine,</l>
               <l n="940">not least of the Ligurians ere his doom</l>
               <l n="941">cut short a life of lies. He, knowing well</l>
               <l n="942">no flight could save him from the shock of arms</l>
               <l n="943">nor turn the royal maid's attack, began</l>
               <l n="944">with words of cunning and insidious guile:</l>

               <l n="946">on sturdy steed depending? Fly me not!</l>
               <l n="947">But, venturing with me on this equal ground,</l>

               <l n="949">which one of us by windy boast achieves</l>
               <l n="950">a false renown.” He spoke; but she, to pangs</l>
               <l n="951">of keenest fury stung, gave o'er her steed</l>
               <l n="952">in charge of a companion, and opposed</l>
               <l n="953">her foe at equal vantage, falchion drawn,</l>
               <l n="954">on foot, and, though her shield no blazon bore,</l>
               <l n="955">of fear incapable. But the warrior fled,</l>
               <l n="956">thinking his trick victorious, and rode off</l>
               <l n="957">full speed, with reins reversed,—his iron heel</l>
               <l n="958">goading his charger's flight. Camilla cried:</l>
               <l n="959">“Ligurian cheat! In vain thy boastful heart</l>

               <l n="963">Herewith on winged feet that virgin bold</l>
               <l n="964">flew past the war-horse, seized the streaming rein,</l>
               <l n="965">and, fronting him, took vengeance on her foe</l>
               <l n="966">in bloody strokes: with not less ease a hawk,</l>
               <l n="967">dark bird of omen, from his mountain crag</l>
               <l n="968">pursues on pinions strong a soaring dove</l>

               <l n="978">and roused the ranks with many a wrathful cry:</l>
               <l n="979">he called each man by name, and toward the foe</l>
               <l n="980">drove back the routed lines. “What terrors now,</l>

               <l n="984">pursues ye and this scattered host confounds?</l>
               <l n="985">Why dressed in steel, or to what purpose wear</l>
               <l n="986">your futile swords? Not slackly do ye join</l>
               <l n="987">the ranks of Venus in a midnight war;</l>

               <l n="1005">the other, struggling, thrust back from his throat</l>
               <l n="1006">the griping hand, full force to force opposing.</l>
               <l n="1007">As when a golden eagle high in air</l>

               <l n="1014">lashes the air: so Tarchon, from the ranks</l>
               <l n="1015">of Tibur's sons, triumphant snatched his prey.</l>
               <l n="1016">The Tuscans rallied now, well pleased to view</l>

               <l n="1033">while he, in purples of fine foreign stain,</l>

               <l n="544">for many a day, by herbs of virtue known</l>
               <l n="545">to leechcraft; and without reward or praise</l>
               <l n="546">his silent art he plied. Aeneas stood,</l>

               <l n="548">a throng of warriors were near him, and</l>
               <l n="549">Iulus, sorrowing. The aged man</l>
               <l n="550">gathered his garments up as leeches do,</l>
               <l n="551">and with skilled hand and Phoebus' herbs of power</l>
               <l n="552">bustled in vain; in vain his surgery</l>
               <l n="553">pried at the shaft, and with a forceps strong</l>
               <l n="554">seized on the buried barb. But Fortune gave</l>
               <l n="555">no remedy, nor did Apollo aid</l>
               <l n="556">his votary. So more and more grim fear</l>
               <l n="557">stalks o'er the field of war, and nearer hies</l>
               <l n="558">the fatal hour; the very heavens are dust;</l>

               <l n="560">a rain of javelins pours. The dismal cry</l>

               <l n="580">Iapyx shouted, being first to fire</l>

               <l n="584">Some mighty god thy vigor gives again</l>

               <l n="1166">in shadow and deep gloom her troubling cry.</l>
               <l n="1167">In such disguise the Fury, screaming shrill,</l>
               <l n="1168">flitted in Turnus' face, and with her wings</l>
               <l n="1169">smote on his hollow shield. A strange affright</l>
               <l n="1170">palsied his every limb; each several hair</l>
               <l n="1171">lifted with horror, and his gasping voice</l>
               <l n="1172">died on his lips. <milestone ed="p" n="869" unit="card"/>But when Juturna knew</l>
               <l n="1173">from far the shrieking fiend's infernal wing,</l>
               <l n="1174">she loosed her tresses, and their beauty tore,</l>
               <l n="1175">to tell a sister's woe; with clenching hands</l>
               <l n="1176">she marred her cheeks and beat her naked breast. </l>
               <l n="1177">“What remedy or help, my Turnus, now</l>
               <l n="1178">is in a sister's power? What way remains</l>
               <l n="1179">for stubborn me? Or with what further guile</l>
               <l n="1180">thy life prolong? What can my strength oppose</l>
               <l n="1181">to this foul thing? I quit the strife at last.</l>
               <l n="1182">Withdraw thy terror from my fearful eyes,</l>
               <l n="1183">thou bird accurst! The tumult of thy wings</l>
               <l n="1184">I know full well, and thy death-boding call.</l>
               <l n="1185">The harsh decrees of that large-minded Jove</l>
               <l n="1186">I plainly see. Is this the price he pays</l>
               <l n="1187">for my lost maidenhood? Why flatter me</l>
               <l n="1188">with immortality, and snatch away</l>
               <l n="1189">my property of death? What boon it were</l>
               <l n="1190">to end this grief this hour, and hie away</l>
               <l n="1191">to be my brother's helpmeet in his grave!</l>
               <l n="1192">I, an immortal? O, what dear delight</l>
               <l n="1193">is mine, sweet brother, living without thee?</l>
               <l n="1194">O, where will earth yawn deep enough and wide</l>
               <l n="1195">to hide a goddess with the ghosts below?”</l>
               <l n="1196">She spoke; and veiled in glistening mantle gray</l>
               <l n="1197">her mournful brow; then in her stream divine</l>
               <l n="1198">the nymph sank sighing to its utmost cave.</l>

               <l n="1199">Aeneas now is near; and waving wide</l>
               <l n="1200">a spear like some tall tree, he called aloud</l>
               <l n="1201">with unrelenting heart: “What stays thee now?</l>
               <l n="1202">Or wherefore, Turnus, backward fly? Our work</l>
               <l n="1203">is not a foot-race, but the wrathful strife</l>
               <l n="1204">of man with man. Aye, hasten to put on</l>
               <l n="1205">tricks and disguises; gather all thou hast</l>
               <l n="1206">of skill or courage; wish thou wert a bird</l>
               <l n="1207">to fly to starry heaven, or hide thy head</l>
               <l n="1208">safe in the hollow ground!” The other then</l>
               <l n="1209">shook his head, saying: “It is not thy words,</l>
               <l n="1210">not thy hot words, affright me, savage man!</l>
               <l n="1211">Only the gods I fear, and hostile Jove.”</l>
               <l n="1212">Silent he stood, and glancing round him saw</l>
               <l n="1213">a huge rock Iying by, huge rock and old,</l>
               <l n="1214">a landmark justly sundering field from field,</l>
               <l n="1215">which scarce six strong men's shoulders might upraise,</l>
               <l n="1216">such men as mother-Earth brings forth to-day:</l>
               <l n="1217">this grasped he with impetuous hand and hurled,</l>
               <l n="1218">stretched at full height and roused to all his speed,</l>
               <l n="1219">against his foe. Yet scarcely could he feel</l>
               <l n="1220">it was himself that ran, himself that moved</l>
               <l n="1221">with lifted hand to fling the monster stone;</l>
               <l n="1222">for his knees trembled, and his languid blood</l>
               <l n="1223">ran shuddering cold; nor could the stone he threw,</l>
               <l n="1224">tumbling in empty air, attain its goal</l>
               <l n="1225">nor strike the destined blow. But as in dreams,</l>
               <l n="1226">when helpless slumber binds the darkened eyes,</l>
               <l n="1227">we seem with fond desire to tread in vain</l>
               <l n="1228">along a lengthening road, yet faint and fall</l>
               <l n="1229">when straining to the utmost, and the tongue</l>
               <l n="1230">is palsied, and the body's wonted power</l>
               <l n="1231">obeys not, and we have no speech or cry:</l>
               <l n="1232">so unto Turnus, whatsoever way</l>
               <l n="1233">his valiant spirit moved, the direful Fiend</l>
               <l n="1234">stopped in the act his will. Swift-changing thoughts</l>
               <l n="1235">rush o'er his soul; on the Rutulian host,</l>
               <l n="1236">then at the town he glares, shrinks back in fear,</l>
               <l n="1237">and trembles at th' impending lance; nor sees</l>
               <l n="1238">what path to fly, what way confront the foe:—</l>
               <l n="1239">no chariot now, nor sister-charioteer!</l>

               <l n="1242">the moment of success, and all whose strength</l>
               <l n="1243">struck forth: the vast and ponderous rock outflung</l>
               <l n="1244">from engines which make breach in sieged walls</l>

               <l n="1254">the lofty groves give back an echoing cry.</l>
               <l n="1255">Lowly, with suppliant eyes, and holding forth</l>

               <l n="1267">our enmity?”With swift and dreadful arms</l>
               <l n="1268">Aeneas o'er him stood, with rolling eyes,</l>

               <l n="1271">over the mighty shoulder slung, he saw</l>
               <l n="1272">that fatal baldric studded with bright gold</l>
               <l n="1273">which youthful Pallas wore, what time he fell</l>
               <l n="1274">vanquished by Turnus' stroke, whose shoulders now</l>

               <l n="1279">and terrifying look, he cried, “Wouldst thou,</l>
