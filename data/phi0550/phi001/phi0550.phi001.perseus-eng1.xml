               <l n="15">And how accomplished by no tool of Gods.</l>
               <l n="16">Suppose all sprang from all things: any kind</l>
               <l n="17">Might take its origin from any thing,</l>
               <l n="18">No fixed seed required. Men from the sea</l>
               <l n="19">Might rise, and from the land the scaly breed,</l>
               <l n="20">And, fowl full fledged come bursting from the sky;</l>
               <l n="21">The horned cattle, the herds and all the wild</l>
               <l n="22">Would haunt with varying offspring tilth and waste;</l>
               <l n="23">Nor would the same fruits keep their olden trees,</l>
               <l n="24">But each might grow from any stock or limb</l>
               <l n="25">By chance and change. Indeed, and were there not</l>
               <l n="26">For each its procreant atoms, could things have</l>
               <l n="27">Each its unalterable mother old?</l>
               <l n="28">But, since produced from fixed seeds are all,</l>
               <l n="29">Each birth goes forth upon the shores of light</l>
               <l n="30">From its own stuff, from its own primal bodies.</l>
               <l n="31">And all from all cannot become, because</l>
               <l n="32">In each resides a secret power its own.</l>
               <l n="33">Again, why see we lavished o'er the lands</l>
               <l n="34">At spring the rose, at summer heat the corn,</l>
               <l n="35">The vines that mellow when the autumn lures,</l>
               <l n="36">If not because the fixed seeds of things</l>
               <l n="37">At their own season must together stream,</l>
               <l n="38">And new creations only be revealed</l>
               <l n="39">When the due times arrive and pregnant earth</l>
               <l n="40">Safely may give unto the shores of light</l>
               <l n="41">Her tender progenies? But if from naught</l>
               <l n="42">Were their becoming, they would spring abroad</l>
               <l n="43">Suddenly, unforeseen, in alien months,</l>
               <l n="44">With no primordial germs, to be preserved</l>
               <l n="45">From procreant unions at an adverse hour.</l>

               <l n="3">Were life an increment of nothing: then</l>
               <l n="4">The tiny babe forthwith would walk a man,</l>

               <l n="6">Wonders unheard of; for, by Nature, each</l>
               <l n="7">Slowly increases from its lawful seed,</l>
               <l n="8">And through that increase shall conserve its kind.</l>

               <l n="14">Prolongs its kind and guards its life no more.</l>
               <l n="15">Thus easier 'tis to hold that many things</l>
               <l n="16">Have primal bodies in common (as we see</l>
               <l n="17">The single letters common to many words)</l>

               <l n="24">The changeless stuff, and what from that may spring</l>
               <l n="25">Is fixed forevermore? Lastly we see</l>

               <l n="31">And kneads the mould, we quicken into birth.</l>
               <l n="32">Else would ye mark, without all toil of ours,</l>

               <l n="93">Lastly whatever days and nature add</l>
               <l n="94">Little by little, constraining things to grow</l>

               <l n="29">Reverberant through shut doorways of a house;</l>
               <l n="30">And stiffening frost seeps inward to our bones.</l>
               <l n="31">Which but for voids for bodies to go through</l>
               <l n="32">'Tis clear could happen in nowise at all.</l>
               <l n="33">Again, why see we among objects some</l>
               <l n="34">Of heavier weight, but of no bulkier size?</l>
               <l n="35">Indeed, if in a ball of wool there be</l>
               <l n="36">As much of body as in lump of lead,</l>
               <l n="37">The two should weigh alike, since body tends</l>
               <l n="38">To load things downward, while the void abides,</l>
               <l n="39">By contrary nature, the imponderable.</l>
               <l n="40">Therefore, an object just as large but lighter</l>
               <l n="41">Declares infallibly its more of void;</l>
               <l n="42">Even as the heavier more of matter shows,</l>
               <l n="43">And how much less of vacant room inside.</l>
               <l n="44">That which we're seeking with sagacious quest</l>
               <l n="45">Exists, infallibly, commixed with things-</l>
               <l n="46">The void, the invisible inane.</l>

               <l n="1">I am compelled a question to expound,</l>
               <l n="2">Forestalling something certain folk suppose,</l>
               <l n="3">Lest it avail to lead thee off from truth:</l>
               <l n="4">Waters (they say) before the shining breed</l>
               <l n="5">Of the swift scaly creatures somehow give,</l>
               <l n="6">And straightway open sudden liquid paths,</l>
               <l n="7">Because the fishes leave behind them room</l>
               <l n="8">To which at once the yielding billows stream.</l>
               <l n="9">Thus things among themselves can yet be moved,</l>
               <l n="10">And change their place, however full the Sum-</l>
               <l n="11">Received opinion, wholly false forsooth.</l>
               <l n="12">For where can scaly creatures forward dart,</l>
               <l n="13">Save where the waters give them room? Again,</l>
               <l n="14">Where can the billows yield a way, so long</l>
               <l n="15">As ever the fish are powerless to go?</l>
               <l n="16">Thus either all bodies of motion are deprived,</l>
               <l n="17">Or things contain admixture of a void</l>
               <l n="18">Where each thing gets its start in moving on.</l>
               <l rend="indent">  Lastly, where after impact two broad bodies</l>
               <l n="19">Suddenly spring apart, the air must crowd</l>
               <l n="20">The whole new void between those bodies formed;</l>
               <l n="21">But air, however it stream with hastening gusts,</l>
               <l n="22">Can yet not fill the gap at once- for first</l>
               <l n="23">It makes for one place, ere diffused through all.</l>
               <l n="24">And then, if haply any think this comes,</l>
               <l n="25">When bodies spring apart, because the air</l>
               <l n="26">Somehow condenses, wander they from truth:</l>
               <l n="27">For then a void is formed, where none before;</l>
               <l n="28">And, too, a void is filled which was before.</l>
               <l n="29">Nor can air be condensed in such a wise;</l>
               <l n="30">Nor, granting it could, without a void, I hold,</l>
               <l n="31">It still could not contract upon itself</l>
               <l n="32">And draw its parts together into one.</l>
               <l n="33">Wherefore, despite demur and counter-speech,</l>
               <l n="34">Confess thou must there is a void in things.</l>
               <l rend="indent">  And still I might by many an argument</l>
               <l n="35">Here scrape together credence for my words.</l>
               <l n="36">But for the keen eye these mere footprints serve,</l>
               <l n="37">Whereby thou mayest know the rest thyself.</l>
               <l n="38">As dogs full oft with noses on the ground,</l>
               <l n="39">Find out the silent lairs, though hid in brush,</l>
               <l n="40">Of beasts, the mountain-rangers, when but once</l>
               <l n="41">They scent the certain footsteps of the way,</l>
               <l n="42">Thus thou thyself in themes like these alone</l>
               <l n="43">Can hunt from thought to thought, and keenly wind</l>
               <l n="44">Along even onward to the secret places</l>
               <l n="45">And drag out truth. But, if thou loiter loth</l>
               <l n="46">Or veer, however little, from the point,</l>
               <l n="47">This I can promise, Memmius, for a fact:</l>
               <l n="48">Such copious drafts my singing tongue shall pour</l>
               <l n="49">From the large well-springs of my plenished breast</l>
               <l n="50">That much I dread slow age will steal and coil</l>
               <l n="51">Along our members, and unloose the gates</l>
               <l n="52">Of life within us, ere for thee my verse</l>
               <l n="53">Hath put within thine ears the stores of proofs</l>

               <l n="1">But, now again to weave the tale begun,</l>
               <l n="2">All nature, then, as self-sustained, consists</l>
               <l n="3">Of twain of things: of bodies and of void</l>
               <l n="4">In which they're set, and where they're moved around.</l>

               <l n="6">That body of itself exists: unless</l>
               <l n="7">This primal faith, deep-founded, fail us not,</l>
               <l n="8">Naught will there be whereunto to appeal</l>

               <l n="11">That place and room, which we do call the inane,</l>
               <l n="12">Nowhere could bodies then be set, nor go</l>
               <l n="13">Hither or thither at all- as shown before.</l>
               <l n="14">Besides, there's naught of which thou canst declare</l>
               <l n="15">It lives disjoined from body, shut from void-</l>
               <l n="16">A kind of third in nature. For whatever</l>
               <l n="17">Exists must be a somewhat; and the same,</l>
               <l n="18">If tangible, however fight and slight,</l>
               <l n="19">Will yet increase the count of body's sum,</l>
               <l n="20">With its own augmentation big or small;</l>
               <l n="21">But, if intangible and powerless ever</l>
               <l n="22">To keep a thing from passing through itself</l>
               <l n="23">On any side, 'twill be naught else but that</l>
               <l n="24">Which we do call the empty, the inane.</l>

               <l n="29">Naught but the inane can furnish room. And thus,</l>

               <l n="33">Under our senses, nor be seized and seen</l>
               <l n="34">By any man through reasonings of mind.</l>
               <l n="35">Name o'er creation with what names thou wilt,</l>
               <l n="36">Thou'lt find but properties of those first twain,</l>
               <l n="37">Or see but accidents those twain produce.</l>
               <l rend="indent">  A property is that which not at all</l>
               <l n="38">Can be disjoined and severed from a thing</l>
               <l n="39">Without a fatal dissolution: such,</l>
               <l n="40">Weight to the rocks, heat to the fire, and flow</l>
               <l n="41">To the wide waters, touch to corporal things,</l>
               <l n="42">Intangibility to the viewless void.</l>
               <l n="43">But state of slavery, pauperhood, and wealth,</l>
               <l n="44">Freedom, and war, and concord, and all else</l>
               <l n="45">Which come and go whilst nature stands the same,</l>
               <l n="46">We're wont, and rightly, to call accidents.</l>
               <l n="47">Even time exists not of itself; but sense</l>
               <l n="48">Reads out of things what happened long ago,</l>
               <l n="49">What presses now, and what shall follow after:</l>
               <l n="50">No man, we must admit, feels time itself,</l>
               <l n="51">Disjoined from motion and repose of things.</l>
               <l n="52">Thus, when they say there "is" the ravishment</l>
               <l n="53">Of Princess Helen, "is" the siege and sack</l>
               <l n="54">Of Trojan Town, look out, they force us not</l>
               <l n="55">To admit these acts existent by themselves,</l>
               <l n="56">Merely because those races of mankind</l>
               <l n="57">(Of whom these acts were accidents) long since</l>
               <l n="58">Irrevocable age has borne away:</l>
               <l n="59">For all past actions may be said to be</l>
               <l n="60">But accidents, in one way, of mankind,-</l>
               <l n="61">In other, of some region of the world.</l>
               <l n="62">Add, too, had been no matter, and no room</l>
               <l n="63">Wherein all things go on, the fire of love</l>
               <l n="64">Upblown by that fair form, the glowing coal</l>
               <l n="65">Under the Phrygian Alexander's breast,</l>
               <l n="66">Had ne'er enkindled that renowned strife</l>

               <l n="69">At midnight of a brood of the Hellenes.</l>
               <l n="70">And thus thou canst remark that every act</l>
               <l n="71">At bottom exists not of itself, nor is</l>
               <l n="72">As body is, nor has like name with void;</l>
               <l n="73">But rather of sort more fitly to be called</l>
               <l n="74">An accident of body, and of place</l>

               <l n="4">No power can quench; for in the end they conquer</l>
               <l n="5">By their own solidness; though hard it be</l>

               <l n="14">Since, with the cups held rightly in the hand,</l>
               <l n="15">We oft feel both, as from above is poured</l>
               <l n="16">The dew of waters between their shining sides:</l>
               <l n="17">So true it is no solid form is found.</l>
               <l n="18">But yet because true reason and nature of things</l>
               <l n="19">Constrain us, come, whilst in few verses now</l>
               <l n="20">I disentangle how there still exist</l>
               <l n="21">Bodies of solid, everlasting frame-</l>
               <l n="22">The seeds of things, the primal germs we teach,</l>
               <l n="23">Whence all creation around us came to be.</l>
               <l n="24">First since we know a twofold nature exists,</l>
               <l n="25">Of things, both twain and utterly unlike-</l>
               <l n="26">Body, and place in which an things go on-</l>
               <l n="27">Then each must be both for and through itself,</l>
               <l n="28">And all unmixed: where'er be empty space,</l>
               <l n="29">There body's not; and so where body bides,</l>
               <l n="30">There not at all exists the void inane.</l>
               <l n="31">Thus primal bodies are solid, without a void.</l>
               <l n="32">But since there's void in all begotten things,</l>
               <l n="33">All solid matter must be round the same;</l>
               <l n="34">Nor, by true reason canst thou prove aught hides</l>
               <l n="35">And holds a void within its body, unless</l>
               <l n="36">Thou grant what holds it be a solid. Know,</l>
               <l n="37">That which can hold a void of things within</l>
               <l n="38">Can be naught else than matter in union knit.</l>
               <l n="39">Thus matter, consisting of a solid frame,</l>
               <l n="40">Hath power to be eternal, though all else,</l>
               <l n="41">Though all creation, be dissolved away.</l>
               <l n="42">Again, were naught of empty and inane,</l>
               <l n="43">The world were then a solid; as, without</l>
               <l n="44">Some certain bodies to fill the places held,</l>
               <l n="45">The world that is were but a vacant void.</l>
               <l n="46">And so, infallibly, alternate-wise</l>
               <l n="47">Body and void are still distinguished,</l>
               <l n="48">Since nature knows no wholly full nor void.</l>
               <l n="49">There are, then, certain bodies, possessed of power</l>
               <l n="50">To vary forever the empty and the full;</l>
               <l n="51">And these can nor be sundered from without</l>
               <l n="52">By beats and blows, nor from within be torn</l>
               <l n="53">By penetration, nor be overthrown</l>
               <l n="54">By any assault soever through the world-</l>
               <l n="55">For without void, naught can be crushed, it seems,</l>
               <l n="56">Nor broken, nor severed by a cut in twain,</l>
               <l n="57">Nor can it take the damp, or seeping cold</l>
               <l n="58">Or piercing fire, those old destroyers three;</l>
               <l n="59">But the more void within a thing, the more</l>
               <l n="60">Entirely it totters at their sure assault.</l>
               <l n="61">Thus if first bodies be, as I have taught,</l>
               <l n="62">Solid, without a void, they must be then</l>
               <l n="63">Eternal; and, if matter ne'er had been</l>
               <l n="64">Eternal, long ere now had all things gone</l>
               <l n="65">Back into nothing utterly, and all</l>
               <l n="66">We see around from nothing had been born-</l>
               <l n="67">But since I taught above that naught can be</l>
               <l n="68">From naught created, nor the once begotten</l>
               <l n="69">To naught be summoned back, these primal germs</l>
               <l n="70">Must have an immortality of frame.</l>
               <l n="71">And into these must each thing be resolved,</l>

               <l n="9">And blood created out of drops of blood,</l>
               <l n="10">Conceiving gold compact of grains of gold,</l>
               <l n="11">And earth concreted out of bits of earth,</l>

               <l n="7">'Tis sweet, again, to view the mighty strife</l>

               <l n="12">Whence thou may'st look below on other men</l>
               <l n="13">And see them ev'rywhere wand'ring, all dispersed</l>
               <l n="14">In their lone seeking for the road of life;</l>
               <l n="15">Rivals in genius, or emulous in rank,</l>
               <l n="16">Pressing through days and nights with hugest toil</l>
               <l n="17">For summits of power and mastery of the world.</l>
               <l n="18">O wretched minds of men! O blinded hearts!</l>
               <l n="19">In how great perils, in what darks of life</l>
               <l n="20">Are spent the human years, however brief!-</l>
               <l n="21">O not to see that nature for herself</l>

               <l n="29">More grateful 'tis at times (for nature craves</l>

               <l n="31">There be no golden images of boys</l>

               <l n="33">The lamps ablaze, the lights for evening feasts,</l>
               <l n="34">And if the house doth glitter not with gold</l>
               <l n="35">Nor gleam with silver, and to the lyre resound</l>
               <l n="36">No fretted and gilded ceilings overhead,</l>
               <l n="37">Yet still to lounge with friends in the soft grass</l>
               <l n="38">Beside a river of water, underneath</l>
               <l n="39">A big tree's boughs, and merrily to refresh</l>
               <l n="40">Our frames, with no vast outlay- most of all</l>

               <l n="43">Nor yet the quicker will hot fevers go,</l>
               <l n="44">If on a pictured tapestry thou toss,</l>
               <l n="45">Or purple robe, than if 'tis thine to lie</l>
               <l n="46">Upon the poor man's bedding. Wherefore, since</l>
               <l n="47">Treasure, nor rank, nor glory of a reign</l>
               <l n="48">Avail us naught for this our body, thus</l>
               <l n="49">Reckon them likewise nothing for the mind:</l>
               <l n="50">Save then perchance, when thou beholdest forth</l>
               <l n="51">Thy legions swarming round the Field of Mars,</l>
               <l n="52">Rousing a mimic warfare- either side</l>
               <l n="53">Strengthened with large auxiliaries and horse,</l>
               <l n="54">Alike equipped with arms, alike inspired;</l>
               <l n="55">Or save when also thou beholdest forth</l>
               <l n="56">Thy fleets to swarm, deploying down the sea:</l>
               <l n="57">For then, by such bright circumstance abashed,</l>
               <l n="58">Religion pales and flees thy mind; O then</l>
               <l n="59">The fears of death leave heart so free of care.</l>
               <l n="60">But if we note how all this pomp at last</l>
               <l n="61">Is but a drollery and a mocking sport,</l>
               <l n="62">And of a truth man's dread, with cares at heels,</l>
               <l n="63">Dreads not these sounds of arms, these savage swords</l>
               <l n="64">But among kings and lords of all the world</l>
               <l n="65">Mingles undaunted, nor is overawed</l>
               <l n="66">By gleam of gold nor by the splendour bright</l>
               <l n="67">Of purple robe, canst thou then doubt that this</l>
               <l n="68">Is aught, but power of thinking?- when, besides</l>
               <l n="69">The whole of life but labours in the dark.</l>
               <l n="70">For just as children tremble and fear all</l>
               <l n="71">In the viewless dark, so even we at times</l>
               <l n="72">Dread in the light so many things that be</l>
               <l n="73">No whit more fearsome than what children feign,</l>
               <l n="74">Shuddering, will be upon them in the dark.</l>
               <l n="75">This terror then, this darkness of the mind,</l>
               <l n="76">Not sunrise with its flaring spokes of light,</l>
               <l n="77">Nor glittering arrows of morning can disperse,</l>
               <l n="78">But only nature's aspect and her law.</l>

               <l n="1">To prove for thee this too: nothing corporeal</l>

               <l rend="indent">                              In these affairs</l>
               <l n="1">We wish thee also well aware of this:</l>
               <l n="2">The atoms, as their own weight bears them down</l>
               <l n="3">Plumb through the void, at scarce determined times,</l>
               <l n="4">In scarce determined places, from their course</l>
               <l n="5">Decline a little- call it, so to speak,</l>
               <l n="6">Mere changed trend. For were it not their wont</l>
               <l n="7">Thuswise to swerve, down would they fall, each one,</l>
               <l n="8">Like drops of rain, through the unbottomed void;</l>
               <l n="9">And then collisions ne'er could be nor blows</l>
               <l n="10">Among the primal elements; and thus</l>
               <l n="11">Nature would never have created aught.</l>
               <l rend="indent">  But, if perchance be any that believe</l>
               <l n="12">The heavier bodies, as more swiftly borne</l>
               <l n="13">Plumb down the void, are able from above</l>
               <l n="14">To strike the lighter, thus engendering blows</l>
               <l n="15">Able to cause those procreant motions, far</l>
               <l n="16">From highways of true reason they retire.</l>
               <l n="17">For whatsoever through the waters fall,</l>
               <l n="18">Or through thin air, must quicken their descent,</l>
               <l n="19">Each after its weight- on this account, because</l>
               <l n="20">Both bulk of water and the subtle air</l>
               <l n="21">By no means can retard each thing alike,</l>
               <l n="22">But give more quick before the heavier weight;</l>
               <l n="23">But contrariwise the empty void cannot,</l>
               <l n="24">On any side, at any time, to aught</l>
               <l n="25">Oppose resistance, but will ever yield,</l>
               <l n="26">True to its bent of nature. Wherefore all,</l>
               <l n="27">With equal speed, though equal not in weight,</l>
               <l n="28">Must rush, borne downward through the still inane.</l>
               <l n="29">Thus ne'er at all have heavier from above</l>
               <l n="30">Been swift to strike the lighter, gendering strokes</l>
               <l n="31">Which cause those divers motions, by whose means</l>
               <l n="32">Nature transacts her work. And so I say,</l>
               <l n="33">The atoms must a little swerve at times-</l>
               <l n="34">But only the least, lest we should seem to feign</l>
               <l n="35">Motions oblique, and fact refute us there.</l>
               <l n="36">For this we see forthwith is manifest:</l>
               <l n="37">Whatever the weight, it can't obliquely go,</l>
               <l n="38">Down on its headlong journey from above,</l>
               <l n="39">At least so far as thou canst mark; but who</l>
               <l n="40">Is there can mark by sense that naught can swerve</l>
               <l n="41">At all aside from off its road's straight line?</l>
               <l rend="indent">  Again, if ev'r all motions are co-linked,</l>
               <l n="42">And from the old ever arise the new</l>
               <l n="43">In fixed order, and primordial seeds</l>
               <l n="44">Produce not by their swerving some new start</l>
               <l n="45">Of motion to sunder the covenants of fate,</l>
               <l n="46">That cause succeed not cause from everlasting,</l>
               <l n="47">Whence this free will for creatures o'er the lands,</l>
               <l n="48">Whence is it wrested from the fates,- this will</l>
               <l n="49">Whereby we step right forward where desire</l>
               <l n="50">Leads each man on, whereby the same we swerve</l>
               <l n="51">In motions, not as at some fixed time,</l>
               <l n="52">Nor at some fixed line of space, but where</l>
               <l n="53">The mind itself has urged? For out of doubt</l>
               <l n="54">In these affairs 'tis each man's will itself</l>
               <l n="55">That gives the start, and hence throughout our limbs</l>
               <l n="56">Incipient motions are diffused. Again,</l>
               <l n="57">Dost thou not see, when, at a point of time,</l>
               <l n="58">The bars are opened, how the eager strength</l>
               <l n="59">Of horses cannot forward break as soon</l>
               <l n="60">As pants their mind to do? For it behooves</l>
               <l n="61">That all the stock of matter, through the frame,</l>
               <l n="62">Be roused, in order that, through every joint,</l>
               <l n="63">Aroused, it press and follow mind's desire;</l>
               <l n="64">So thus thou seest initial motion's gendered</l>
               <l n="65">From out the heart, aye, verily, proceeds</l>

               <l n="77">Throughout our members and throughout our joints,</l>
               <l n="78">And, after being forward cast, to be</l>

               <l n="80">So seest thou not, how, though external force</l>
               <l n="81">Drive men before, and often make them move,</l>
               <l n="82">Onward against desire, and headlong snatched,</l>
               <l n="83">Yet is there something in these breasts of ours</l>
               <l n="84">Strong to combat, strong to withstand the same?-</l>
               <l n="85">Wherefore no less within the primal seeds</l>
               <l n="86">Thou must admit, besides all blows and weight,</l>
               <l n="87">Some other cause of motion, whence derives</l>
               <l n="88">This power in us inborn, of some free act.-</l>
               <l n="89">Since naught from nothing can become, we see.</l>
               <l n="90">For weight prevents all things should come to pass</l>
               <l n="91">Through blows, as 'twere, by some external force;</l>
               <l n="92">But that man's mind itself in all it does</l>

               <l n="4">A thing shows motion of its frame as whole.</l>
               <l n="5">For far beneath the ken of senses lies</l>
               <l n="6">The nature of those ultimates of the world;</l>
               <l n="7">And so, since those themselves thou canst not see,</l>
               <l n="8">Their motion also must they veil from men-</l>
               <l n="9">For mark, indeed, how things we can see, oft</l>
               <l n="10">Yet hide their motions, when afar from us</l>
               <l n="11">Along the distant landscape. Often thus,</l>
               <l n="12">Upon a hillside will the woolly flocks</l>
               <l n="13">Be cropping their goodly food and creeping about</l>
               <l n="14">Whither the summons of the grass, begemmed</l>
               <l n="15">With the fresh dew, is calling, and the lambs,</l>
               <l n="16">Well filled, are frisking, locking horns in sport:</l>
               <l n="17">Yet all for us seem blurred and blent afar-</l>
               <l n="18">A glint of white at rest on a green hill.</l>
               <l n="19">Again, when mighty legions, marching round,</l>
               <l n="20">Fill all the quarters of the plains below,</l>
               <l n="21">Rousing a mimic warfare, there the sheen</l>
               <l n="22">Shoots up the sky, and all the fields about</l>
               <l n="23">Glitter with brass, and from beneath, a sound</l>
               <l n="24">Goes forth from feet of stalwart soldiery,</l>
               <l n="25">And mountain walls, smote by the shouting, send</l>
               <l n="26">The voices onward to the stars of heaven,</l>
               <l n="27">And hither and thither darts the cavalry,</l>
               <l n="28">And of a sudden down the midmost fields</l>
               <l n="29">Charges with onset stout enough to rock</l>
               <l n="30">The solid earth: and yet some post there is</l>
               <l n="31">Up the high mountains, viewed from which they seem</l>
               <l n="32">To stand- a gleam at rest along the plains.</l>

               <l n="26">Beside the incense-burning altars slain,</l>
               <l n="27">Drops down the yearling calf, from out its breast</l>

               <l n="33">And, stopping short, filleth the leafy lanes</l>
               <l n="34">With her complaints; and oft she seeks again</l>

               <l n="43">Do know their horned dams, and butting lambs</l>
               <l n="44">The flocks of sheep, and thus they patter on,</l>

               <l n="29">A smell of scorching enters in our frame</l>
               <l n="30">Where the bright colour from the dye goes not;</l>
               <l n="31">And colour in one way, flavour in quite another</l>
               <l n="32">Works inward to our senses- so mayst see</l>
               <l n="33">They differ too in elemental shapes.</l>
               <l n="34">Thus unlike forms into one mass combine,</l>

               <l n="39">At times big branches sprouting from man's trunk,</l>
               <l n="40">Limbs of a sea-beast to a land-beast knit,</l>
               <l n="41">And nature along the all-producing earth</l>
               <l n="42">Feeding those dire Chimaeras breathing flame</l>
               <l n="43">From hideous jaws- Of which 'tis simple fact</l>
               <l n="44">That none have been begot; because we see</l>

               <l n="47">Throughout their growth their own ancestral type.</l>
               <l n="48">This happens surely by a fixed law:</l>
               <l n="49">For from all food-stuff, when once eaten down,</l>
               <l n="50">Go sundered atoms, suited to each creature,</l>
               <l n="51">Throughout their bodies, and, conjoining there,</l>
               <l n="52">Produce the proper motions; but we see</l>
               <l n="53">How, contrariwise, nature upon the ground</l>
               <l n="54">Throws off those foreign to their frame; and many</l>
               <l n="55">With viewless bodies from their bodies fly,</l>
               <l n="56">By blows impelled- those impotent to join</l>
               <l n="57">To any part, or, when inside, to accord</l>
               <l n="58">And to take on the vital motions there.</l>
               <l n="59">But think not, haply, living forms alone</l>
               <l n="60">Are bound by these laws: they distinguished all.</l>
               <l rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</l>
               <l n="61">For just as all things of creation are,</l>
               <l n="62">In their whole nature, each to each unlike,</l>
               <l n="63">So must their atoms be in shape unlike-</l>
               <l n="64">Not since few only are fashioned of like form,</l>
               <l n="65">But since they all, as general rule, are not</l>
               <l n="66">The same as all. Nay, here in these our verses,</l>
               <l n="67">Elements many, common to many words,</l>
               <l n="68">Thou seest, though yet 'tis needful to confess</l>
               <l n="69">The words and verses differ, each from each,</l>
               <l n="70">Compounded out of different elements-</l>
               <l n="71">Not since few only, as common letters, run</l>
               <l n="72">Through all the words, or no two words are made,</l>
               <l n="73">One and the other, from all like elements,</l>
               <l n="74">But since they all, as general rule, are not</l>
               <l n="75">The same as all. Thus, too, in other things,</l>
               <l n="76">Whilst many germs common to many things</l>
               <l n="77">There are, yet they, combined among themselves,</l>
               <l n="78">Can form new wholes to others quite unlike.</l>
               <l n="79">Thus fairly one may say that humankind,</l>
               <l n="80">The grains, the gladsome trees, are all made up</l>
               <l n="81">Of different atoms. Further, since the seeds</l>
               <l n="82">Are different, difference must there also be</l>
               <l n="83">In intervening spaces, thoroughfares,</l>
               <l n="84">Connections, weights, blows, clashings, motions, all</l>
               <l n="85">Which not alone distinguish living forms,</l>
               <l n="86">But sunder earth's whole ocean from the lands,</l>
               <l n="87">And hold all heaven from the lands away.</l>

               <l n="1">O thou who first uplifted in such dark</l>
               <l n="2">So clear a torch aloft, who first shed light</l>
               <l n="3">Upon the profitable ends of man,</l>
               <l n="4">O thee I follow, glory of the Greeks,</l>
               <l n="5">And set my footsteps squarely planted now</l>
               <l n="6">Even in the impress and the marks of thine-</l>
               <l n="7">Less like one eager to dispute the palm,</l>
               <l n="8">More as one craving out of very love</l>
               <l n="9">That I may copy thee!- for how should swallow</l>
               <l n="10">Contend with swans or what compare could be</l>
               <l n="11">In a race between young kids with tumbling legs</l>
               <l n="12">And the strong might of the horse? Our father thou,</l>
               <l n="13">And finder-out of truth, and thou to us</l>
               <l n="14">Suppliest a father's precepts; and from out</l>
               <l n="15">Those scriven leaves of thine, renowned soul</l>

               <l n="18">Golden, and ever worthiest endless life.</l>
               <l n="19">For soon as ever thy planning thought that sprang</l>
               <l n="20">From god-like mind begins its loud proclaim</l>
               <l n="21">Of nature's courses, terrors of the brain</l>
               <l n="22">Asunder flee, the ramparts of the world</l>
               <l n="23">Dispart away, and through the void entire</l>
               <l n="24">I see the movements of the universe.</l>
               <l n="25">Rises to vision the majesty of gods,</l>
               <l n="26">And their abodes of everlasting calm</l>
               <l n="27">Which neither wind may shake nor rain-cloud splash,</l>
               <l n="28">Nor snow, congealed by sharp frosts, may harm</l>
               <l n="29">With its white downfall: ever, unclouded sky</l>
               <l n="30">O'er roofs, and laughs with far-diffused light.</l>
               <l n="31">And nature gives to them their all, nor aught</l>
               <l n="32">May ever pluck their peace of mind away.</l>
               <l n="33">But nowhere to my vision rise no more</l>
               <l n="34">The vaults of <placeName key="tgn,1120946">Acheron</placeName>, though the broad earth</l>
               <l n="35">Bars me no more from gazing down o'er all</l>
               <l n="36">Which under our feet is going on below</l>
               <l n="37">Along the void. O, here in these affairs</l>
               <l n="38">Some new divine delight and trembling awe</l>
               <l n="39">Takes hold through me, that thus by power of thine</l>
               <l n="40">Nature, so plain and manifest at last,</l>
               <l n="41">Hath been on every side laid bare to man!</l>
               <l rend="indent">  And since I've taught already of what sort</l>
               <l n="42">The seeds of all things are, and how, distinct</l>
               <l n="43">In divers forms, they flit of own accord,</l>
               <l n="44">Stirred with a motion everlasting on,</l>
               <l n="45">And in what mode things be from them create,</l>
               <l n="46">Now, after such matters, should my verse, meseems,</l>
               <l n="47">Make clear the nature of the mind and soul,</l>
               <l n="48">And drive that dread of <placeName key="tgn,1120946">Acheron</placeName> without,</l>
               <l n="49">Headlong, which so confounds our human life</l>
               <l n="50">Unto its deeps, pouring o'er all that is</l>
               <l n="51">The black of death, nor leaves not anything</l>
               <l n="52">To prosper- a liquid and unsullied joy.</l>

               <l n="1">For as to what men sometimes will affirm:</l>
               <l n="2">That more than Tartarus (the realm of death)</l>
               <l n="3">They fear diseases and a life of shame,</l>
               <l n="4">And know the substance of the soul is blood,</l>
               <l n="5">Or rather wind (if haply thus their whim),</l>
               <l n="6">And so need naught of this our science, then</l>
               <l n="7">Thou well may'st note from what's to follow now</l>
               <l n="8">That more for glory do they braggart forth</l>
               <l n="9">Than for belief. For mark these very same:</l>
               <l n="10">Exiles from country, fugitives afar</l>
               <l n="11">From sight of men, with charges foul attaint,</l>
               <l n="12">Abased with every wretchedness, they yet</l>
               <l n="13">Live, and where'er the wretches come, they yet</l>
               <l n="14">Make the ancestral sacrifices there,</l>
               <l n="15">Butcher the black sheep, and to gods below</l>
               <l n="16">Offer the honours, and in bitter case</l>
               <l n="17">Turn much more keenly to religion.</l>
               <l n="18">Wherefore, it's surer testing of a man</l>
               <l n="19">In doubtful perils- mark him as he is</l>
               <l n="20">Amid adversities; for then alone</l>
               <l n="21">Are the true voices conjured from his breast,</l>
               <l n="22">The mask off-stripped, reality behind.</l>
               <l n="23">And greed, again, and the blind lust of honours</l>
               <l n="24">Which force poor wretches past the bounds of law,</l>
               <l n="25">And, oft allies and ministers of crime,</l>
               <l n="26">To push through nights and days with hugest toil</l>
               <l n="27">To rise untrammelled to the peaks of power-</l>
               <l n="28">These wounds of life in no mean part are kept</l>
               <l n="29">Festering and open by this fright of death.</l>
               <l n="30">For ever we see fierce Want and foul Disgrace</l>
               <l n="31">Dislodged afar from secure life and sweet,</l>
               <l n="32">Like huddling Shapes before the doors of death.</l>
               <l n="33">And whilst, from these, men wish to scape afar,</l>
               <l n="34">Driven by false terror, and afar remove,</l>
               <l n="35">With civic blood a fortune they amass,</l>
               <l n="36">They double their riches, greedy, heapers-up</l>
               <l n="37">Of corpse on corpse they have a cruel laugh</l>
               <l n="38">For the sad burial of a brother-born,</l>
               <l n="39">And hatred and fear of tables of their kin.</l>
               <l n="40">Likewise, through this same terror, envy oft</l>
               <l n="41">Makes them to peak because before their eyes</l>
               <l n="42">That man is lordly, that man gazed upon</l>
               <l n="43">Who walks begirt with honour glorious,</l>
               <l n="44">Whilst they in filth and darkness roll around;</l>
               <l n="45">Some perish away for statues and a name,</l>
               <l n="46">And oft to that degree, from fright of death,</l>
               <l n="47">Will hate of living and beholding light</l>
               <l n="48">Take hold on humankind that they inflict</l>
               <l n="49">Their own destruction with a gloomy heart-</l>
               <l n="50">Forgetful that this fear is font of cares,</l>
               <l n="51">This fear the plague upon their sense of shame,</l>
               <l n="52">And this that breaks the ties of comradry</l>
               <l n="53">And oversets all reverence and faith,</l>
               <l n="54">Mid direst slaughter. For long ere to-day</l>
               <l n="55">Often were traitors to country and dear parents</l>
               <l n="56">Through quest to shun the realms of <placeName key="tgn,1120946">Acheron</placeName>.</l>
               <l n="57">For just as children tremble and fear all</l>
               <l n="58">In the viewless dark, so even we at times</l>
               <l n="59">Dread in the light so many things that be</l>
               <l n="60">No whit more fearsome than what children feign,</l>
               <l n="61">Shuddering, will be upon them in the dark.</l>
               <l n="62">This terror, then, this darkness of the mind,</l>
               <l n="63">Not sunrise with its flaring spokes of light,</l>
               <l n="64">Nor glittering arrows of morning sun disperse,</l>
               <l n="65">But only nature's aspect and her law.</l>

               <head> NATURE AND COMPOSITION OF THE MIND</head>

               <l rend="indent">  First, then, I say, the mind which oft we call</l>
               <l n="1">The intellect, wherein is seated life's</l>
               <l n="2">Counsel and regimen, is part no less</l>
               <l n="3">Of man than hand and foot and eyes are parts</l>
               <l n="4">Of one whole breathing creature. [But some hold]</l>
               <l n="5">That sense of mind is in no fixed part seated,</l>
               <l n="6">But is of body some one vital state,-</l>
               <l n="7">Named "harmony" by Greeks, because thereby</l>
               <l n="8">We live with sense, though intellect be not</l>
               <l n="9">In any part: as oft the body is said</l>
               <l n="10">To have good health (when health, however, 's not</l>
               <l n="11">One part of him who has it), so they place</l>
               <l n="12">The sense of mind in no fixed part of man.</l>
               <l n="13">Mightily, diversly, meseems they err.</l>
               <l n="14">Often the body palpable and seen</l>
               <l n="15">Sickens, while yet in some invisible part</l>
               <l n="16">We feel a pleasure; oft the other way,</l>
               <l n="17">A miserable in mind feels pleasure still</l>
               <l n="18">Throughout his body- quite the same as when</l>
               <l n="19">A foot may pain without a pain in head.</l>
               <l n="20">Besides, when these our limbs are given o'er</l>
               <l n="21">To gentle sleep and lies the burdened frame</l>
               <l n="22">At random void of sense, a something else</l>
               <l n="23">Is yet within us, which upon that time</l>
               <l n="24">Bestirs itself in many a wise, receiving</l>
               <l n="25">All motions of joy and phantom cares of heart.</l>
               <l n="26">Now, for to see that in man's members dwells</l>
               <l n="27">Also the soul, and body ne'er is wont</l>
               <l n="28">To feel sensation by a "harmony"</l>
               <l n="29">Take this in chief: the fact that life remains</l>
               <l n="30">Oft in our limbs, when much of body's gone;</l>
               <l n="31">Yet that same life, when particles of heat,</l>
               <l n="32">Though few, have scattered been, and through the mouth</l>
               <l n="33">Air has been given forth abroad, forthwith</l>
               <l n="34">Forever deserts the veins, and leaves the bones.</l>
               <l n="35">Thus mayst thou know that not all particles</l>
               <l n="36">Perform like parts, nor in like manner all</l>
               <l n="37">Are props of weal and safety: rather those-</l>
               <l n="38">The seeds of wind and exhalations warm-</l>
               <l n="39">Take care that in our members life remains.</l>
               <l n="40">Therefore a vital heat and wind there is</l>
               <l n="41">Within the very body, which at death</l>
               <l n="42">Deserts our frames. And so, since nature of mind</l>
               <l n="43">And even of soul is found to be, as 'twere,</l>
               <l n="44">A part of man, give over "harmony"-</l>
               <l n="45">Name to musicians brought from Helicon,-</l>
               <l n="46">Unless themselves they filched it otherwise,</l>
               <l n="47">To serve for what was lacking name till then.</l>
               <l n="48">Whate'er it be, they're welcome to it- thou,</l>
               <l n="49">Hearken my other maxims.</l>

               <l n="1">I say, are held conjoined one with other,</l>
               <l n="2">And form one single nature of themselves;</l>
               <l n="3">But chief and regnant through the frame entire</l>
               <l n="4">Is still that counsel which we call the mind,</l>
               <l n="5">And that cleaves seated in the midmost breast.</l>
               <l n="6">Here leap dismay and terror; round these haunts</l>
               <l n="7">Be blandishments of joys; and therefore here</l>
               <l n="8">The intellect, the mind. The rest of soul,</l>
               <l n="9">Throughout the body scattered, but obeys-</l>

               <l n="11">This, for itself, sole through itself, hath thought;</l>
               <l n="12">This for itself hath mirth, even when the thing</l>
               <l n="13">That moves it, moves nor soul nor body at all.</l>
               <l n="14">And as, when head or eye in us is smit</l>
               <l n="15">By assailing pain, we are not tortured then</l>
               <l n="16">Through all the body, so the mind alone</l>
               <l n="17">Is sometimes smitten, or livens with a joy,</l>
               <l n="18">Whilst yet the soul's remainder through the limbs</l>
               <l n="19">And through the frame is stirred by nothing new.</l>
               <l n="20">But when the mind is moved by shock more fierce,</l>
               <l n="21">We mark the whole soul suffering all at once</l>
               <l n="22">Along man's members: sweats and pallors spread</l>
               <l n="23">Over the body, and the tongue is broken,</l>
               <l n="24">And fails the voice away, and ring the ears,</l>
               <l n="25">Mists blind the eyeballs, and the joints collapse,-</l>
               <l n="26">Aye, men drop dead from terror of the mind.</l>
               <l n="27">Hence, whoso will can readily remark</l>
               <l n="28">That soul conjoined is with mind, and, when</l>
               <l n="29">'Tis strook by influence of the mind, forthwith</l>
               <l n="30">In turn it hits and drives the body too.</l>
               <l rend="indent">  And this same argument establisheth</l>
               <l n="31">That nature of mind and soul corporeal is:</l>
               <l n="32">For when 'tis seen to drive the members on,</l>
               <l n="33">To snatch from sleep the body, and to change</l>
               <l n="34">The countenance, and the whole state of man</l>
               <l n="35">To rule and turn,- what yet could never be</l>
               <l n="36">Sans contact, and sans body contact fails-</l>
               <l n="37">Must we not grant that mind and soul consist</l>
               <l n="38">Of a corporeal nature?- And besides</l>
               <l n="39">Thou markst that likewise with this body of ours</l>
               <l n="40">Suffers the mind and with our body feels.</l>
               <l n="41">If the dire speed of spear that cleaves the bones</l>
               <l n="42">And bares the inner thews hits not the life,</l>
               <l n="43">Yet follows a fainting and a foul collapse,</l>
               <l n="44">And, on the ground, dazed tumult in the mind,</l>
               <l n="45">And whiles a wavering will to rise afoot.</l>
               <l n="46">So nature of mind must be corporeal, since</l>

               <l n="12">More tardy its flow; for all its stock of matter</l>
               <l n="13">Cleaves more together, since, indeed, 'tis made</l>
               <l n="14">Of atoms not so smooth, so fine, and round.</l>
               <l n="15">For the light breeze that hovers yet can blow</l>
               <l n="16">High heaps of poppy-seed away for thee</l>

               <l n="60">Nor mounts away, as at one time, entire,</l>

               <l n="63">Can inward draw along the frame, and bring</l>

               <l n="65">From all the members draw the sense away,</l>
               <l n="66">Why, then, that place in which such stock of soul</l>

               <l n="11">That there exist those somewhats which we call</l>

               <l n="18">And images of people lorn of light,</l>
               <l n="19">Which oft have horribly roused us when we lay</l>
               <l n="20">In slumber- that haply nevermore may we</l>
               <l n="21">Suppose that souls get loose from <placeName key="tgn,1120946">Acheron</placeName>,</l>

               <l n="3">That send forth bodies, loosely some diffused-</l>

               <l n="17">No power has man to open mouth to tell;</l>
               <l n="18">Especially, since on outsides of things</l>
               <l n="19">Are bodies many and minute which could,</l>
               <l n="20">In the same order which they had before,</l>
               <l n="21">And with the figure of their form preserved,</l>
               <l n="22">Be thrown abroad, and much more swiftly too,</l>
               <l n="23">Being less subject to impediments,</l>
               <l n="24">As few in number and placed along the front.</l>
               <l n="25">For truly many things we see discharge</l>
               <l n="26">Their stuff at large, not only from their cores</l>
               <l n="27">Deep-set within, as we have said above,</l>
               <l n="28">But from their surfaces at times no less-</l>
               <l n="29">Their very colours too. And commonly</l>
               <l n="30">The awnings, saffron, red and dusky blue,</l>
               <l n="31">Stretched overhead in mighty theatres,</l>
               <l n="32">Upon their poles and cross-beams fluttering,</l>
               <l n="33">Have such an action quite; for there they dye</l>
               <l n="34">And make to undulate with their every hue</l>
               <l n="35">The circled throng below, and all the stage,</l>
               <l n="36">And rich attire in the patrician seats.</l>

               <l n="3">Whilst coming from the deeps of body forth</l>

               <l n="9">There 'tis so rent that it cannot give back</l>
               <l n="10">An image. But when gleaming objects dense,</l>
               <l n="11">As chiefly mirrors, have been set before it,</l>

               <l n="15">'Tis therefore that from them the images</l>

               <l n="21">Thus many images in little time</l>
               <l n="22">Are gendered; so their origin is named</l>
               <l n="23">Rightly a speedy. And even as the sun</l>
               <l n="24">Must send below, in little time, to earth</l>
               <l n="25">So many beams to keep all things so full</l>
               <l n="26">Of light incessant; thus, on grounds the same,</l>
               <l n="27">From things there must be borne, in many modes,</l>

               <l n="9">That images the things? Wherefore it seems</l>
               <l n="10">The source of seeing is in images,</l>
               <l n="11">Nor without these can anything be viewed.</l>
               <l rend="indent">  Now these same films I name are borne about</l>

               <l n="15">Our sight, all things do strike against it there</l>

               <l n="17">Each thing may be away, the image yields</l>
               <l n="18">To us the power to see and chance to tell:</l>
               <l n="19">For when 'tis sent, at once it shoves ahead</l>
               <l n="20">And drives along the air that's in the space</l>

               <l n="34">Upon the eyes cannot be singly seen,</l>
               <l n="35">The things themselves may be perceived. For thus</l>
               <l n="36">When the wind beats upon us stroke by stroke</l>
               <l n="37">And when the sharp cold streams, 'tis not our wont</l>

               <l n="39">Or of that cold, but rather all at once;</l>
               <l n="40">And so we see how blows affect our body,</l>
               <l n="41">As if one thing were beating on the same</l>
               <l n="42">And giving us the feel of its own body</l>
               <l n="43">Outside of us. Again, whene'er we thump</l>

               <l n="14">The image of the glass projects itself,</l>
               <l n="15">As to our gaze it comes, it shoves ahead</l>

               <l n="22">Comes back unto our eyes, and driving rolls</l>

               <l n="31">All divers hues and whatso things there be</l>
               <l n="32">Conjoined with hues. Likewise the tasting tongue</l>
               <l n="33">Has its own power apart, and smells apart</l>
               <l n="34">And sounds apart are known. And thus it is</l>
               <l n="35">That no one sense can e'er convict another.</l>
               <l n="36">Nor shall one sense have power to blame itself,</l>
               <l n="37">Because it always must be deemed the same,</l>
               <l n="38">Worthy of equal trust. And therefore what</l>
               <l n="39">At any time unto these senses showed,</l>
               <l n="40">The same is true.</l>

            <div type="textpart" n="522" subtype="card">
               <l rend="indent">  And now remains to demonstrate with ease</l>
               <l n="1">How other senses each their things perceive.</l>
               <l rend="indent">  Firstly, a sound and every voice is heard,</l>
               <l n="2">When, getting into ears, they strike the sense</l>
               <l n="3">With their own body. For confess we must</l>
               <l n="4">Even voice and sound to be corporeal,</l>
               <l n="5">Because they're able on the sense to strike.</l>
               <l n="6">Besides voice often scrapes against the throat,</l>
               <l n="7">And screams in going out do make more rough</l>
               <l n="8">The wind-pipe- naturally enough, methinks,</l>
               <l n="9">When, through the narrow exit rising up</l>
               <l n="10">In larger throng, these primal germs of voice</l>
               <l n="11">Have thus begun to issue forth. In sooth,</l>
               <l n="12">Also the door of the mouth is scraped against</l>
               <l n="13">[By air blown outward] from distended [cheeks].</l>
               <l rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</l>
               <l n="14">And thus no doubt there is, that voice and words</l>
               <l n="15">Consist of elements corporeal,</l>
               <l n="16">With power to pain. Nor art thou unaware</l>
               <l n="17">Likewise how much of body's ta'en away,</l>
               <l n="18">How much from very thews and powers of men</l>
               <l n="19">May be withdrawn by steady talk, prolonged</l>
               <l n="20">Even from the rising splendour of the morn</l>
               <l n="21">To shadows of black evening,- above all</l>
               <l n="22">If 't be outpoured with most exceeding shouts.</l>
               <l n="23">Therefore the voice must be corporeal,</l>
               <l n="24">Since the long talker loses from his frame</l>
               <l n="25">A part.</l>
               <l rend="indent">        Moreover, roughness in the sound</l>
               <l n="26">Comes from the roughness in the primal germs,</l>
               <l n="27">As a smooth sound from smooth ones is create;</l>
               <l n="28">Nor have these elements a form the same</l>
               <l n="29">When the trump rumbles with a hollow roar,</l>
               <l n="30">As when barbaric Berecynthian pipe</l>
               <l n="31">Buzzes with raucous boomings, or when swans</l>
               <l n="32">By night from icy shores of Helicon</l>
               <l n="33">With wailing voices raise their liquid dirge.</l>

            <div type="textpart" n="549" subtype="card">
               <l rend="indent">  Thus, when from deep within our frame we force</l>
               <l n="1">These voices, and at mouth expel them forth,</l>
               <l n="2">The mobile tongue, artificer of words,</l>
               <l n="3">Makes them articulate, and too the lips</l>
               <l n="4">By their formations share in shaping them.</l>
               <l n="5">Hence when the space is short from starting-point</l>
               <l n="6">To where that voice arrives, the very words</l>
               <l n="7">Must too be plainly heard, distinctly marked.</l>
               <l n="8">For then the voice conserves its own formation,</l>
               <l n="9">Conserves its shape. But if the space between</l>
               <l n="10">Be longer than is fit, the words must be</l>
               <l n="11">Through the much air confounded, and the voice</l>
               <l n="12">Disordered in its flight across the winds-</l>
               <l n="13">And so it haps, that thou canst sound perceive,</l>
               <l n="14">Yet not determine what the words may mean;</l>
               <l n="15">To such degree confounded and encumbered</l>
               <l n="16">The voice approaches us. Again, one word,</l>
               <l n="17">Sent from the crier's mouth, may rouse all ears</l>
               <l n="18">Among the populace. And thus one voice</l>
               <l n="19">Scatters asunder into many voices,</l>
               <l n="20">Since it divides itself for separate ears,</l>
               <l n="21">Imprinting form of word and a clear tone.</l>
               <l n="22">But whatso part of voices fails to hit</l>
               <l n="23">The ears themselves perishes, borne beyond,</l>
               <l n="24">Idly diffused among the winds. A part,</l>
               <l n="25">Beating on solid porticoes, tossed back</l>
               <l n="26">Returns a sound; and sometimes mocks the ear</l>
               <l n="27">With a mere phantom of a word. </l>

               <l n="34">That thou mayst know by what devices this</l>

               <l n="37">Commixed in things in divers modes. Again,</l>
               <l n="38">As all the breathing creatures which take food</l>

               <l n="41">Each differing kind by kind, they thus consist</l>
               <l n="42">Of seeds of varying shape. And furthermore,</l>

               <l n="49">And certain of them many-angled too</l>

               <l n="1">Now come, and I will indicate what wise</l>
               <l n="2">Impact of odour on the nostrils touches.</l>
               <l n="3">And first, 'tis needful there be many things</l>
               <l n="4">From whence the streaming flow of varied odours</l>
               <l n="5">May roll along, and we're constrained to think</l>
               <l n="6">They stream and dart and sprinkle themselves about</l>
               <l n="7">Impartially. But for some breathing creatures</l>
               <l n="8">One odour is more apt, to others another-</l>
               <l n="9">Because of differing forms of seeds and pores.</l>
               <l n="10">Thus on and on along the zephyrs bees</l>
               <l n="11">Are led by odour of honey, vultures too</l>
               <l n="12">By carcasses. Again, the forward power</l>
               <l n="13">Of scent in dogs doth lead the hunter on</l>
               <l n="14">Whithersoever the splay-foot of wild beast</l>
               <l n="15">Hath hastened its career; and the white goose,</l>
               <l n="16">The saviour of the Roman citadel,</l>
               <l n="17">Forescents afar the odour of mankind.</l>
               <l n="18">Thus, diversly to divers ones is given</l>
               <l n="19">Peculiar smell that leadeth each along</l>
               <l n="20">To his own food or makes him start aback</l>
               <l n="21">From loathsome poison, and in this wise are</l>
               <l n="22">The generations of the wild preserved.</l>
               <l rend="indent">  Yet is this pungence not alone in odours</l>
               <l n="23">Or in the class of flavours; but, likewise,</l>
               <l n="24">The look of things and hues agree not all</l>

               <l n="26">Some unto some will be, to gaze upon,</l>
               <l n="27">More keen and painful. Lo, the raving lions,</l>
               <l n="28">They dare not face and gaze upon the cock</l>
               <l n="29">Who's wont with wings to flap away the night</l>
               <l n="30">From off the stage, and call the beaming morn</l>
               <l n="31">With clarion voice- and lions straightway thus</l>
               <l n="32">Bethink themselves of flight, because, ye see,</l>
               <l n="33">Within the body of the cocks there be</l>
               <l n="34">Some certain seeds, which, into lions' eyes</l>
               <l n="35">Injected, bore into the pupils deep</l>
               <l n="36">And yield such piercing pain they can't hold out</l>
               <l n="37">Against the cocks, however fierce they be-</l>
               <l n="38">Whilst yet these seeds can't hurt our gaze the least,</l>
               <l n="39">Either because they do not penetrate,</l>
               <l n="40">Or since they have free exit from the eyes</l>
               <l n="41">As soon as penetrating, so that thus</l>
               <l n="42">They cannot hurt our eyes in any part</l>
               <l n="43">By there remaining.</l>
               <l rend="indent">                     To speak once more of odour;</l>
               <l n="44">Whatever assail the nostrils, some can travel</l>
               <l n="45">A longer way than others. None of them,</l>
               <l n="46">However, 's borne so far as sound or voice-</l>
               <l n="47">While I omit all mention of such things</l>
               <l n="48">As hit the eyesight and assail the vision.</l>
               <l n="49">For slowly on a wandering course it comes</l>
               <l n="50">And perishes sooner, by degrees absorbed</l>
               <l n="51">Easily into all the winds of air;-</l>
               <l n="52">And first, because from deep inside the thing</l>
               <l n="53">It is discharged with labour (for the fact</l>
               <l n="54">That every object, when 'tis shivered, ground,</l>

               <l n="56">Is sign that odours flow and part away</l>
               <l n="57">From inner regions of the things). And next,</l>
               <l n="58">Thou mayest see that odour is create</l>
               <l n="59">Of larger primal germs than voice, because</l>
               <l n="60">It enters not through stony walls, wherethrough</l>
               <l n="61">Unfailingly the voice and sound are borne;</l>
               <l n="62">Wherefore, besides, thou wilt observe 'tis not</l>
               <l n="63">So easy to trace out in whatso place</l>
               <l n="64">The smelling object is. For, dallying on</l>
               <l n="65">Along the winds, the particles cool off,</l>
               <l n="66">And then the scurrying messengers of things</l>
               <l n="67">Arrive our senses, when no longer hot.</l>
               <l n="68">So dogs oft wander astray, and hunt the scent.</l>

               <l rend="indent">  Now mark, and hear what objects move the mind,</l>
               <l n="1">And learn, in few, whence unto intellect</l>
               <l n="2">Do come what come. And first I tell thee this:</l>
               <l n="3">That many images of objects rove</l>
               <l n="4">In many modes to every region round-</l>

               <l n="7">Like gossamer or gold-leaf. For, indeed,</l>
               <l n="8">Far thinner are they in their fabric than</l>
               <l n="9">Those images which take a hold on eyes</l>
               <l n="10">And smite the vision, since through body's pores</l>
               <l n="11">They penetrate, and inwardly stir up</l>
               <l n="12">The subtle nature of mind and smite the sense.</l>
               <l n="13">Thus, Centaurs and the limbs of Scyllas, thus</l>
               <l n="14">The Cerberus-visages of dogs we see,</l>
               <l n="15">And images of people gone before-</l>
               <l n="16">Dead men whose bones earth bosomed long ago;</l>
               <l n="17">Because the images of every kind</l>
               <l n="18">Are everywhere about us borne- in part</l>
               <l n="19">Those which are gendered in the very air</l>
               <l n="20">Of own accord, in part those others which</l>
               <l n="21">From divers things do part away, and those</l>
               <l n="22">Which are compounded, made from out their shapes.</l>
               <l n="23">For soothly from no living Centaur is</l>
               <l n="24">That phantom gendered, since no breed of beast</l>
               <l n="25">Like him was ever; but, when images</l>
               <l n="26">Of horse and man by chance have come together,</l>
               <l n="27">They easily cohere, as aforesaid,</l>
               <l n="28">At once, through subtle nature and fabric thin.</l>
               <l n="29">In the same fashion others of this ilk</l>
               <l n="30">Created are. And when they're quickly borne</l>
               <l n="31">In their exceeding lightness, easily</l>
               <l n="32">(As earlier I showed) one subtle image,</l>
               <l n="33">Compounded, moves by its one blow the mind,</l>
               <l n="34">Itself so subtle and so strangely quick.</l>
               <l rend="indent">  That these things come to pass as I record,</l>
               <l n="35">From this thou easily canst understand:</l>
               <l n="36">So far as one is unto other like,</l>
               <l n="37">Seeing with mind as well as with the eyes</l>
               <l n="38">Must come to pass in fashion not unlike.</l>
               <l n="39">Well, now, since I have shown that I perceive</l>
               <l n="40">Haply a lion through those idol-films</l>
               <l n="41">Such as assail my eyes, 'tis thine to know</l>
               <l n="42">Also the mind is in like manner moved,</l>
               <l n="43">And sees, nor more nor less than eyes do see</l>
               <l n="44">(Except that it perceives more subtle films)</l>
               <l n="45">The lion and aught else through idol-films.</l>
               <l n="46">And when the sleep has overset our frame,</l>
               <l n="47">The mind's intelligence is now awake,</l>
               <l n="48">Still for no other reason, save that these-</l>
               <l n="49">The self-same films as when we are awake-</l>
               <l n="50">Assail our minds, to such degree indeed</l>
               <l n="51">That we do seem to see for sure the man</l>
               <l n="52">Whom, void of life, now death and earth have gained</l>
               <l n="53">Dominion over. And nature forces this</l>
               <l n="54">To come to pass because the body's senses</l>
               <l n="55">Are resting, thwarted through the members all,</l>
               <l n="56">Unable now to conquer false with true;</l>
               <l n="57">And memory lies prone and languishes</l>
               <l n="58">In slumber, nor protests that he, the man</l>
               <l n="59">Whom the mind feigns to see alive, long since</l>
               <l n="60">Hath been the gain of death and dissolution.</l>
               <l rend="indent">  And further, 'tis no marvel idols move</l>
               <l n="61">And toss their arms and other members round</l>
               <l n="62">In rhythmic time- and often in men's sleeps</l>
               <l n="63">It haps an image this is seen to do;</l>
               <l n="64">In sooth, when perishes the former image,</l>
               <l n="65">And other is gendered of another pose,</l>
               <l n="66">That former seemeth to have changed its gestures.</l>
               <l n="67">Of course the change must be conceived as speedy;</l>
               <l n="68">So great the swiftness and so great the store</l>
               <l n="69">Of idol-things, and (in an instant brief</l>
               <l n="70">As mind can mark) so great, again, the store</l>
               <l n="71">Of separate idol-parts to bring supplies.</l>
               <l rend="indent">  It happens also that there is supplied</l>

               <l n="3">Why doth the mind of one to whom the whim</l>

               <l n="7">Directly we desire- if heart prefer</l>
               <l n="8">The sea, the land, or after all the sky?</l>
               <l n="9">Assemblies of the citizens, parades,</l>

               <l n="11">Nature, create and furnish at our word?-</l>
               <l n="12">Maugre the fact that in same place and spot</l>
               <l n="13">Another's mind is meditating things</l>
               <l n="14">All far unlike. And what, again, of this:</l>
               <l n="15">When we in sleep behold the idols step,</l>
               <l n="16">In measure, forward, moving supple limbs,</l>
               <l n="17">Whilst forth they put each supple arm in turn</l>
               <l n="18">With speedy motion, and with eyeing heads</l>
               <l n="19">Repeat the movement, as the foot keeps time?</l>
               <l n="20">Forsooth, the idols they are steeped in art,</l>
               <l n="21">And wander to and fro well taught indeed,-</l>
               <l n="22">Thus to be able in the time of night</l>
               <l n="23">To make such games! Or will the truth be this:</l>
               <l n="24">Because in one least moment that we mark-</l>
               <l n="25">That is, the uttering of a single sound-</l>

               <l n="28">That, in a moment how so brief ye will,</l>
               <l n="29">The divers idols are hard by, and ready</l>
               <l n="30">Each in its place diverse? So great the swiftness,</l>
               <l n="31">So great, again, the store of idol-things,</l>

               <l n="34">The former seemeth to have changed its gestures.</l>
               <l n="35">And since they be so tenuous, mind can mark</l>
               <l n="36">Sharply alone the ones it strains to see;</l>
               <l n="37">And thus the rest do perish one and all,</l>

               <l n="44">Unable sharply to perceive at all?</l>

               <l n="6">Thuswise can bended be, that we might step</l>
               <l n="7">With goodly strides ahead; or forearms joined</l>
               <l n="8">Unto the sturdy uppers, or serving hands</l>
               <l n="9">On either side were given, that we might do</l>
               <l n="10">Life's own demands. All such interpretation</l>
               <l n="11">Is aft-for-fore with inverse reasoning,</l>
               <l n="12">Since naught is born in body so that we</l>
               <l n="13">May use the same, but birth engenders use:</l>
               <l n="14">No seeing ere the lights of eyes were born,</l>
               <l n="15">No speaking ere the tongue created was;</l>
               <l n="16">But origin of tongue came long before</l>
               <l n="17">Discourse of words, and ears created were</l>
               <l n="18">Much earlier than any sound was heard;</l>
               <l n="19">And all the members, so meseems, were there</l>
               <l n="20">Before they got their use: and therefore, they</l>
               <l n="21">Could not be gendered for the sake of use.</l>
               <l n="22">But contrariwise, contending in the fight</l>
               <l n="23">With hand to hand, and rending of the joints,</l>
               <l n="24">And fouling of the limbs with gore, was there,</l>
               <l n="25">O long before the gleaming spears ere flew;</l>
               <l n="26">And nature prompted man to shun a wound,</l>
               <l n="27">Before the left arm by the aid of art</l>
               <l n="28">Opposed the shielding targe. And, verily,</l>
               <l n="29">Yielding the weary body to repose,</l>
               <l n="30">Far ancienter than cushions of soft beds,</l>
               <l n="31">And quenching thirst is earlier than cups.</l>
               <l n="32">These objects, therefore, which for use and life</l>
               <l n="33">Have been devised, can be conceived as found</l>
               <l n="34">For sake of using. But apart from such</l>
               <l n="35">Are all which first were born and afterwards</l>
               <l n="36">Gave knowledge of their own utility-</l>
               <l n="37">Chief in which sort we note the senses, limbs:</l>
               <l n="38">Wherefore, again, 'tis quite beyond thy power</l>
               <l n="39">To hold that these could thus have been create</l>
               <l n="40">For office of utility.</l>

               <l n="3">Yes, since I've taught thee that from off the things</l>
               <l n="4">Stream and depart innumerable bodies</l>
               <l n="5">In modes innumerable too; but most</l>
               <l n="6">Must be the bodies streaming from the living-</l>
               <l n="7">Which bodies, vexed by motion evermore,</l>
               <l n="8">Are through the mouth exhaled innumerable,</l>

               <l n="11">Thus body rarefies, so undermined</l>
               <l n="12">In all its nature, and pain attends its state.</l>
               <l n="13">And so the food is taken to underprop</l>

               <l n="16">The longing, open-mouthed through limbs and veins,</l>

               <l n="6">I say that first some idol-films of walking</l>
               <l n="7">Into our mind do fall and smite the mind,</l>
               <l n="8">As said before. Thereafter will arises;</l>
               <l n="9">For no one starts to do a thing, before</l>
               <l n="10">The intellect previsions what it wills;</l>
               <l n="11">And what it there pre-visioneth depends</l>

               <l n="15">That energy of soul that's sown about</l>
               <l n="16">In all the body through the limbs and frame-</l>
               <l n="17">And this is easy of performance, since</l>
               <l n="18">The soul is close conjoined with the mind.</l>
               <l n="19">Next, soul in turn strikes body, and by degrees</l>
               <l n="20">Thus the whole mass is pushed along and moved.</l>
               <l n="21">Then too the body rarefies, and air,</l>
               <l n="22">Forsooth as ever of such nimbleness,</l>
               <l n="23">Comes on and penetrates aboundingly</l>
               <l n="24">Through opened pores, and thus is sprinkled round</l>

               <l n="52">Into each other, pressing teeth on mouths-</l>
               <l n="53">Yet to no purpose, since they're powerless</l>

               <l n="55">With body entire into body- for oft</l>
               <l n="56">They seem to strive and struggle thus to do;</l>
               <l n="57">So eagerly they cling in Venus' bonds,</l>
               <l n="58">Whilst melt away their members, overcome</l>
               <l n="59">By violence of delight. But when at last</l>

               <l n="64">When once again they seek and crave to reach</l>
               <l n="65">They know not what, all powerless to find</l>
               <l n="66">The artifice to subjugate the bane.</l>
               <l n="67">In such uncertain state they waste away</l>

               <l n="59">Like unto milk; even as a woman now</l>

               <l n="1">Urged men to utter various sounds of tongue</l>
               <l n="2">And need and use did mould the names of things,</l>

               <l n="29">To know and see in mind what 'twas he willed?</l>
               <l n="30">Besides, one only man could scarce subdue</l>
               <l n="31">An overmastered multitude to choose</l>
               <l n="32">To get by heart his names of things. A task</l>
               <l n="33">Not easy 'tis in any wise to teach</l>

               <l n="54">And when with fondling tongue they start to lick</l>
               <l n="55">Their puppies, or do toss them round with paws,</l>
               <l n="56">Feigning with gentle bites to gape and snap,</l>
               <l n="57">They fawn with yelps of voice far other then</l>
               <l n="58">Than when, alone within the house, they bay,</l>
               <l n="59">Or whimpering slink with cringing sides from blows.</l>
               <l n="60">Again the neighing of the horse, is that</l>

               <l n="63">Goaded by winged Love, amongst the mares,</l>
               <l n="64">And when with widening nostrils out he snorts</l>
               <l n="65">The call to battle, and when haply he</l>
               <l n="66">Whinnies at times with terror-quaking limbs?</l>
               <l n="67">Lastly, the flying race, the dappled birds,</l>
               <l n="68">Hawks, ospreys, sea-gulls, searching food and life</l>
               <l n="69">Amid the ocean billows in the brine,</l>
               <l n="70">Utter at other times far other cries</l>
               <l n="71">Than when they fight for food, or with their prey</l>
               <l n="72">Struggle and strain. And birds there are which change</l>
               <l n="73">With changing weather their own raucous songs-</l>
               <l n="74">As long-lived generations of the crows</l>

               <l n="76">For rain and water and to call at times</l>

               <l n="2">Of thine own self divine. Man's ancient arms</l>
               <l n="3">Were hands, and nails and teeth, stones too and boughs-</l>
               <l n="4">Breakage of forest trees- and flame and fire,</l>
               <l n="5">As soon as known. Thereafter force of iron</l>
               <l n="6">And copper discovered was; and copper's use</l>
               <l n="7">Was known ere iron's, since more tractable</l>
               <l n="8">Its nature is and its abundance more.</l>
               <l n="9">With copper men to work the soil began,</l>
               <l n="10">With copper to rouse the hurly waves of war,</l>
               <l n="11">To straw the monstrous wounds, and seize away</l>
               <l n="12">Another's flocks and fields. For unto them,</l>
               <l n="13">Thus armed, all things naked of defence</l>
               <l n="14">Readily yielded. Then by slow degrees</l>
               <l n="15">The sword of iron succeeded, and the shape</l>
               <l n="16">Of brazen sickle into scorn was turned:</l>
               <l n="17">With iron to cleave the soil of earth they 'gan,</l>
               <l n="18">And the contentions of uncertain war</l>
               <l n="19">Were rendered equal.</l>
               <l rend="indent">                     And, lo, man was wont</l>
               <l n="20">Armed to mount upon the ribs of horse</l>
               <l n="21">And guide him with the rein, and play about</l>
               <l n="22">With right hand free, oft times before he tried</l>
               <l n="23">Perils of war in yoked chariot;</l>
               <l n="24">And yoked pairs abreast came earlier</l>
               <l n="25">Than yokes of four, or scythed chariots</l>
               <l n="26">Whereinto clomb the men-at-arms. And next</l>
               <l n="27">The Punic folk did train the elephants-</l>
               <l n="28">Those curst Lucanian oxen, hideous,</l>
               <l n="29">The serpent-handed, with turrets on their bulks-</l>
               <l n="30">To dure the wounds of war and panic-strike</l>
               <l n="31">The mighty troops of <placeName key="tgn,2008886">Mars</placeName>. Thus Discord sad</l>
               <l n="32">Begat the one Thing after other, to be</l>
               <l n="33">The terror of the nations under arms,</l>
               <l n="34">And day by day to horrors of old war</l>

               <l n="3">The sheaves of harvest, and re-ordered life,</l>
               <l n="4">And decreed laws; and she the first that gave</l>
               <l n="5">Life its sweet solaces, when she begat</l>
               <l n="6">A man of heart so wise, who whilom poured</l>
               <l n="7">All wisdom forth from his truth-speaking mouth;</l>
               <l n="8">The glory of whom, though dead, is yet to-day,</l>
               <l n="9">Because of those discoveries divine</l>
               <l n="10">Renowned of old, exalted to the sky.</l>
               <l n="11">For when saw he that well-nigh everything</l>
               <l n="12">Which needs of man most urgently require</l>
               <l n="13">Was ready to hand for mortals, and that life,</l>
               <l n="14">As far as might be, was established safe,</l>
               <l n="15">That men were lords in riches, honour, praise,</l>
               <l n="16">And eminent in goodly fame of sons,</l>
               <l n="17">And that they yet, O yet, within the home,</l>
               <l n="18">Still had the anxious heart which vexed life</l>
               <l n="19">Unpausingly with torments of the mind,</l>
               <l n="20">And raved perforce with angry plaints, then he,</l>
               <l n="21">Then he, the master, did perceive that 'twas</l>
               <l n="22">The vessel itself which worked the bane, and all,</l>
               <l n="23">However wholesome, which from here or there</l>
               <l n="24">Was gathered into it, was by that bane</l>
               <l n="25">Spoilt from within,- in part, because he saw</l>
               <l n="26">The vessel so cracked and leaky that nowise</l>
               <l n="27">'T could ever be filled to brim; in part because</l>
               <l n="28">He marked how it polluted with foul taste</l>
               <l n="29">Whate'er it got within itself. So he,</l>
               <l n="30">The master, then by his truth-speaking words,</l>
               <l n="31">Purged the breasts of men, and set the bounds</l>
               <l n="32">Of lust and terror, and exhibited</l>
               <l n="33">The supreme good whither we all endeavour,</l>
               <l n="34">And showed the path whereby we might arrive</l>
               <l n="35">Thereunto by a little cross-cut straight,</l>
               <l n="36">And what of ills in all affairs of mortals</l>
               <l n="37">Upsprang and flitted deviously about</l>
               <l n="38">(Whether by chance or force), since nature thus</l>
               <l n="39">Had destined; and from out what gates a man</l>
               <l n="40">Should sally to each combat. And he proved</l>
               <l n="41">That mostly vainly doth the human race</l>
               <l n="42">Roll in its bosom the grim waves of care.</l>
               <l n="43">For just as children tremble and fear all</l>
               <l n="44">In the viewless dark, so even we at times</l>
               <l n="45">Dread in the light so many things that be</l>
               <l n="46">No whit more fearsome than what children feign,</l>
               <l n="47">Shuddering, will be upon them in the dark.</l>
               <l n="48">This terror then, this darkness of the mind,</l>

               <l n="50">Nor glittering arrows of morning can disperse,</l>
               <l n="51">But only nature's aspect and her law.</l>

               <l n="16">Despite innumerable collisions, but</l>
               <l n="17">Flies shooting onward with a swift elan.</l>
               <l n="18">Next, since by nature always every weight</l>

               <l n="29">Augments the bolt's vast powers and to the blow</l>
               <l n="30">Gives larger vigour; for it forces all,</l>

               <l n="35">In coming along, it pulls from out the air</l>
               <l n="36">Some certain bodies, which by their own blows</l>
               <l n="37">Enkindle its velocity. And, lo,</l>

               <l n="46">Brass it unbinds and quickly fuseth gold,</l>

               <head>EXTRAORDINARY AND PARADOXICAL TELLURIC PHENOMENA</head>

               <l rend="indent">  In chief, men marvel nature renders not</l>
               <l n="1">Bigger and bigger the bulk of ocean, since</l>
               <l n="2">So vast the down-rush of the waters be,</l>
               <l n="3">And every river out of every realm</l>
               <l n="4">Cometh thereto; and add the random rains</l>
               <l n="5">And flying tempests, which spatter every sea</l>
               <l n="6">And every land bedew; add their own springs:</l>
               <l n="7">Yet all of these unto the ocean's sum</l>
               <l n="8">Shall be but as the increase of a drop.</l>
               <l n="9">Wherefore 'tis less a marvel that the sea,</l>
               <l n="10">The mighty ocean, increaseth not. Besides,</l>
               <l n="11">Sun with his heat draws off a mighty part:</l>
               <l n="12">Yea, we behold that sun with burning beams</l>
               <l n="13">To dry our garments dripping all with wet;</l>
               <l n="14">And many a sea, and far out-spread beneath,</l>
               <l n="15">Do we behold. Therefore, however slight</l>
               <l n="16">The portion of wet that sun on any spot</l>
               <l n="17">Culls from the level main, he still will take</l>
               <l n="18">From off the waves in such a wide expanse</l>
               <l n="19">Abundantly. Then, further, also winds,</l>
               <l n="20">Sweeping the level waters, can bear off</l>
               <l n="21">A mighty part of wet, since we behold</l>
               <l n="22">Oft in a single night the highways dried</l>
               <l n="23">By winds, and soft mud crusted o'er at dawn.</l>
               <l n="24">Again, I've taught thee that the clouds bear off</l>
               <l n="25">Much moisture too, up-taken from the reaches</l>
               <l n="26">Of the mighty main, and sprinkle it about</l>
               <l n="27">O'er all the zones, when rain is on the lands</l>
               <l n="28">And winds convey the aery racks of vapour.</l>
               <l n="29">Lastly, since earth is porous through her frame,</l>
               <l n="30">And neighbours on the seas, girdling their shores,</l>
               <l n="31">The water's wet must seep into the lands</l>
               <l n="32">From briny ocean, as from lands it comes</l>
               <l n="33">Into the seas. For brine is filtered off,</l>
               <l n="34">And then the liquid stuff seeps back again</l>
               <l n="35">And all re-poureth at the river-heads,</l>
               <l n="36">Whence in fresh-water currents it returns</l>
               <l n="37">Over the lands, adown the channels which</l>
               <l n="38">Were cleft erstwhile and erstwhile bore along</l>
               <l n="39">The liquid-footed floods.</l>

               <l n="1">Yea, even the sturdy guiders of curved ploughs,</l>
               <l n="2">Began to sicken, and their bodies would lie</l>
               <l n="3">Huddled within back-corners of their huts,</l>
               <l n="4">Delivered by squalor and disease to death.</l>
               <l n="5">O often and often couldst thou then have seen</l>
               <l n="6">On lifeless children lifeless parents prone,</l>
               <l n="7">Or offspring on their fathers', mothers' corpse</l>
               <l n="8">Yielding the life. And into the city poured</l>
               <l n="9">O not in least part from the countryside</l>
               <l n="10">That tribulation, which the peasantry</l>
               <l n="11">Sick, sick, brought thither, thronging from every quarter,</l>
               <l n="12">Plague-stricken mob. All places would they crowd,</l>
               <l n="13">All buildings too; whereby the more would death</l>
               <l n="14">Up-pile a-heap the folk so crammed in town.</l>
               <l n="15">Ah, many a body thirst had dragged and rolled</l>
               <l n="16">Along the highways there was lying strewn</l>
               <l n="17">Besides Silenus-headed water-fountains,-</l>
               <l n="18">The life-breath choked from that too dear desire</l>
               <l n="19">Of pleasant waters. Ah, everywhere along</l>
               <l n="20">The open places of the populace,</l>
               <l n="21">And along the highways, O thou mightest see</l>
               <l n="22">Of many a half-dead body the sagged limbs,</l>
               <l n="23">Rough with squalor, wrapped around with rags,</l>
               <l n="24">Perish from very nastiness, with naught</l>
               <l n="25">But skin upon the bones, well-nigh already</l>
               <l n="26">Buried- in ulcers vile and obscene filth.</l>
               <l n="27">All holy temples, too, of deities</l>
               <l n="28">Had Death becrammed with the carcasses;</l>
               <l n="29">And stood each fane of the Celestial Ones</l>
               <l n="30">Laden with stark cadavers everywhere-</l>
               <l n="31">Places which warders of the shrines had crowded</l>
               <l n="32">With many a guest. For now no longer men</l>
               <l n="33">Did mightily esteem the old Divine,</l>
               <l n="34">The worship of the gods: the woe at hand</l>
               <l n="35">Did over-master. Nor in the city then</l>
               <l n="36">Remained those rites of sepulture, with which</l>
               <l n="37">That pious folk had evermore been wont</l>
               <l n="38">To buried be. For it was wildered all</l>
               <l n="39">In wild alarms, and each and every one</l>
               <l n="40">With sullen sorrow would bury his own dead,</l>
               <l n="41">As present shift allowed. And sudden stress</l>
               <l n="42">And poverty to many an awful act</l>
               <l n="43">Impelled; and with a monstrous screaming they</l>
               <l n="44">Would, on the frames of alien funeral pyres,</l>
               <l n="45">Place their own kin, and thrust the torch beneath</l>
               <l n="46">Oft brawling with much bloodshed round about</l>
               <l n="47">Rather than quit dead bodies loved in life.</l>
