               <l>A laurel wreath of bright perennial leaves,</l>

               <l>Yet Ennius too in everlasting verse</l>
               <l>Proclaims those vaults of Acheron to be,</l>
               <l>Though thence, he said, nor souls nor bodies fare,</l>
               <l>But only phantom figures, strangely wan,</l>
               <l>And tells how once from out those regions rose</l>
               <l>Old Homer's ghost to him and shed salt tears</l>
               <l>And with his words unfolded Nature's source.</l>
               <l>Then be it ours with steady mind to clasp</l>
               <l>The purport of the skies- the law behind</l>

               <l>To scan the powers that speed all life below;</l>

               <l>Of what the mind, of what the soul is made,</l>
               <l>And what it is so terrible that breaks</l>
               <l>On us asleep, or waking in disease,</l>
               <l>Until we seem to mark and hear at hand</l>

               <l>Meantime, when once we know from nothing still</l>

               <l>From which alone all things created are,</l>
               <l>And how accomplished by no tool of Gods.</l>
               <l>Suppose all sprang from all things: any kind</l>
               <l>Might take its origin from any thing,</l>
               <l>No fixed seed required. Men from the sea</l>
               <l>Might rise, and from the land the scaly breed,</l>
               <l>And, fowl full fledged come bursting from the sky;</l>
               <l>The horned cattle, the herds and all the wild</l>

               <l>Nor would the same fruits keep their olden trees,</l>
               <l>But each might grow from any stock or limb</l>
               <l>By chance and change. Indeed, and were there not</l>
               <l>For each its procreant atoms, could things have</l>
               <l>Each its unalterable mother old?</l>
               <l>But, since produced from fixed seeds are all,</l>
               <l>Each birth goes forth upon the shores of light</l>
               <l>From its own stuff, from its own primal bodies.</l>
               <l>And all from all cannot become, because</l>
               <l>In each resides a secret power its own.</l>
               <l>Again, why see we lavished o'er the lands</l>
               <l>At spring the rose, at summer heat the corn,</l>
               <l>The vines that mellow when the autumn lures,</l>
               <l>If not because the fixed seeds of things</l>
               <l>At their own season must together stream,</l>
               <l>And new creations only be revealed</l>
               <l>When the due times arrive and pregnant earth</l>
               <l>Safely may give unto the shores of light</l>
               <l>Her tender progenies? But if from naught</l>
               <l>Were their becoming, they would spring abroad</l>
               <l>Suddenly, unforeseen, in alien months,</l>
               <l>With no primordial germs, to be preserved</l>
               <l>From procreant unions at an adverse hour.</l>
            </div>
            <div type="card" n="185">
               <l>Nor on the mingling of the living seeds</l>
               <l>Would space be needed for the growth of things</l>
               <l>Were life an increment of nothing: then</l>
               <l>The tiny babe forthwith would walk a man,</l>
               <l>And from the turf would leap a branching tree-</l>
               <l>Wonders unheard of; for, by Nature, each</l>
               <l>Slowly increases from its lawful seed,</l>
               <l>And through that increase shall conserve its kind.</l>
               <l>Whence take the proof that things enlarge and feed</l>
               <l>From out their proper matter. Thus it comes</l>
               <l>That earth, without her seasons of fixed rains,</l>
               <l>Could bear no produce such as makes us glad,</l>
               <l>And whatsoever lives, if shut from food,</l>
               <l>Prolongs its kind and guards its life no more.</l>
               <l>Thus easier 'tis to hold that many things</l>
               <l>Have primal bodies in common (as we see</l>
               <l>The single letters common to many words)</l>
               <l>Than aught exists without its origins.</l>
               <l>Moreover, why should Nature not prepare</l>
               <l>Men of a bulk to ford the seas afoot,</l>
               <l>Or rend the mighty mountains with their hands,</l>
               <l>Or conquer Time with length of days, if not</l>
               <l>Because for all begotten things abides</l>
               <l>The changeless stuff, and what from that may spring</l>
               <l>Is fixed forevermore? Lastly we see</l>
               <l>How far the tilled surpass the fields untilled</l>
               <l>And to the labour of our hands return</l>
               <l>Their more abounding crops; there are indeed</l>
               <l>Within the earth primordial germs of things,</l>
               <l>Which, as the ploughshare turns the fruitful clods</l>
               <l>And kneads the mould, we quicken into birth.</l>
               <l>Else would ye mark, without all toil of ours,</l>

               <l>Wherefrom to reach the gentle fields of air.</l>

               <l>The winds infuriate lash our face and frame,</l>
               <l>Unseen, and swamp huge ships and rend the clouds,</l>
               <l>Or, eddying wildly down, bestrew the plains</l>
               <l>With mighty trees, or scour the mountain tops</l>
               <l>With forest-crackling blasts. Thus on they rave</l>
               <l>With uproar shrill and ominous moan. The winds,</l>

               <l>Vexing and whirling and seizing all amain;</l>
               <l>And forth they flow and pile destruction round,</l>
               <l>Even as the water's soft and supple bulk</l>
               <l>Becoming a river of abounding floods,</l>
               <l>Which a wide downpour from the lofty hills</l>
               <l>Swells with big showers, dashes headlong down</l>

               <l>Nor can the solid bridges bide the shock</l>
               <l>As on the waters whelm: the turbulent stream,</l>
               <l>Strong with a hundred rains, beats round the piers,</l>
               <l>Crashes with havoc, and rolls beneath its waves</l>

               <l>Hurling away whatever would oppose.</l>
               <l>Even so must move the blasts of all the winds,</l>

               <l>The winds are sightless bodies and naught else-</l>
               <l>Since both in works and ways they rival well</l>
               <l>The mighty rivers, the visible in form.</l>
               <l>Then too we know the varied smells of things</l>
               <l>Yet never to our nostrils see them come;</l>
               <l>With eyes we view not burning heats, nor cold,</l>
               <l>Nor are we wont men's voices to behold.</l>
               <l>Yet these must be corporeal at the base,</l>
               <l>Since thus they smite the senses: naught there is</l>
               <l>Save body, having property of touch.</l>
               <l>And raiment, hung by surf-beat shore, grows moist,</l>
               <l>The same, spread out before the sun, will dry;</l>
               <l>Yet no one saw how sank the moisture in,</l>
               <l>Nor how by heat off-driven. Thus we know,</l>
               <l>That moisture is dispersed about in bits</l>
               <l>Too small for eyes to see. Another case:</l>

               <l>Along the under side, with years and suns;</l>
               <l>The drippings from the eaves will scoop the stone;</l>
               <l>The hooked ploughshare, though of iron, wastes</l>
               <l>Amid the fields insidiously. We view</l>
               <l>The rock-paved highways worn by many feet;</l>
               <l>And at the gates the brazen statues show</l>
               <l>Their right hands leaner from the frequent touch</l>
               <l>Of wayfarers innumerable who greet.</l>
               <l>We see how wearing-down hath minished these,</l>
               <l>But just what motes depart at any time,</l>
               <l>The envious nature of vision bars our sight.</l>
               <l>Lastly whatever days and nature add</l>
               <l>Little by little, constraining things to grow</l>
               <l>In due proportion, no gaze however keen</l>
               <l>Of these our eyes hath watched and known. No more</l>
               <l>Can we observe what's lost at any time,</l>
               <l>When things wax old with eld and foul decay,</l>
               <l>Or when salt seas eat under beetling crags.</l>

               <head>THE VOID</head>
               <l>But yet creation's neither crammed nor blocked</l>
               <l>About by body: there's in things a void-</l>
               <l>Which to have known will serve thee many a turn,</l>
               <l>Nor will not leave thee wandering in doubt,</l>
               <l>Forever searching in the sum of all,</l>
               <l>And losing faith in these pronouncements mine.</l>
               <l>There's place intangible, a void and room.</l>
               <l>For were it not, things could in nowise move;</l>
               <l>Since body's property to block and check</l>
               <l>Would work on all and at an times the same.</l>
               <l>Thus naught could evermore push forth and go,</l>
               <l>Since naught elsewhere would yield a starting place.</l>
               <l>But now through oceans, lands, and heights of heaven,</l>
               <l>By divers causes and in divers modes,</l>
               <l>Before our eyes we mark how much may move,</l>
               <l>Which, finding not a void, would fail deprived</l>
               <l>Of stir and motion; nay, would then have been</l>
               <l>Nowise begot at all, since matter, then,</l>
               <l>Had staid at rest, its parts together crammed.</l>
               <l>Then too, however solid objects seem,</l>
               <l>They yet are formed of matter mixed with void:</l>
               <l>In rocks and caves the watery moisture seeps,</l>
               <l>And beady drops stand out like plenteous tears;</l>
               <l>And food finds way through every frame that lives;</l>
               <l>The trees increase and yield the season's fruit</l>
               <l>Because their food throughout the whole is poured,</l>
               <l>Even from the deepest roots, through trunks and boughs;</l>
               <l>And voices pass the solid walls and fly</l>
               <l>Reverberant through shut doorways of a house;</l>
               <l>And stiffening frost seeps inward to our bones.</l>
               <l>Which but for voids for bodies to go through</l>
               <l>'Tis clear could happen in nowise at all.</l>
               <l>Again, why see we among objects some</l>
               <l>Of heavier weight, but of no bulkier size?</l>
               <l>Indeed, if in a ball of wool there be</l>
               <l>As much of body as in lump of lead,</l>
               <l>The two should weigh alike, since body tends</l>
               <l>To load things downward, while the void abides,</l>
               <l>By contrary nature, the imponderable.</l>
               <l>Therefore, an object just as large but lighter</l>
               <l>Declares infallibly its more of void;</l>
               <l>Even as the heavier more of matter shows,</l>
               <l>And how much less of vacant room inside.</l>
               <l>That which we're seeking with sagacious quest</l>

               <l>And straightway open sudden liquid paths,</l>

               <l>To which at once the yielding billows stream.</l>
               <l>Thus things among themselves can yet be moved,</l>
               <l>And change their place, however full the Sum-</l>
               <l>Received opinion, wholly false forsooth.</l>
               <l>For where can scaly creatures forward dart,</l>
               <l>Save where the waters give them room? Again,</l>
               <l>Where can the billows yield a way, so long</l>
               <l>As ever the fish are powerless to go?</l>
               <l>Thus either all bodies of motion are deprived,</l>
               <l>Or things contain admixture of a void</l>
               <l>Where each thing gets its start in moving on.</l>
               <l rend="indent">  Lastly, where after impact two broad bodies</l>

               <l>When bodies spring apart, because the air</l>
               <l>Somehow condenses, wander they from truth:</l>
               <l>For then a void is formed, where none before;</l>
               <l>And, too, a void is filled which was before.</l>
               <l>Nor can air be condensed in such a wise;</l>
               <l>Nor, granting it could, without a void, I hold,</l>
               <l>It still could not contract upon itself</l>
               <l>And draw its parts together into one.</l>
               <l>Wherefore, despite demur and counter-speech,</l>
               <l>Confess thou must there is a void in things.</l>
               <l rend="indent">  And still I might by many an argument</l>
               <l>Here scrape together credence for my words.</l>

               <l>Whereby thou mayest know the rest thyself.</l>
               <l>As dogs full oft with noses on the ground,</l>
               <l>Find out the silent lairs, though hid in brush,</l>
               <l>Of beasts, the mountain-rangers, when but once</l>

               <head>NOTHING EXISTS per se EXCEPT ATOMS AND THE VOID</head>

               <l>But, now again to weave the tale begun,</l>
               <l>All nature, then, as self-sustained, consists</l>
               <l>Of twain of things: of bodies and of void</l>
               <l>In which they're set, and where they're moved around.</l>
               <l>For common instinct of our race declares</l>
               <l>That body of itself exists: unless</l>
               <l>This primal faith, deep-founded, fail us not,</l>
               <l>Naught will there be whereunto to appeal</l>
               <l>On things occult when seeking aught to prove</l>
               <l>By reasonings of mind. Again, without</l>
               <l>That place and room, which we do call the inane,</l>
               <l>Nowhere could bodies then be set, nor go</l>
               <l>Hither or thither at all- as shown before.</l>
               <l>Besides, there's naught of which thou canst declare</l>
               <l>It lives disjoined from body, shut from void-</l>
               <l>A kind of third in nature. For whatever</l>
               <l>Exists must be a somewhat; and the same,</l>
               <l>If tangible, however fight and slight,</l>
               <l>Will yet increase the count of body's sum,</l>
               <l>With its own augmentation big or small;</l>
               <l>But, if intangible and powerless ever</l>
               <l>To keep a thing from passing through itself</l>
               <l>On any side, 'twill be naught else but that</l>
               <l>Which we do call the empty, the inane.</l>
               <l>Again, whate'er exists, as of itself,</l>
               <l>Must either act or suffer action on it,</l>
               <l>Or else be that wherein things move and be:</l>
               <l>Naught, saving body, acts, is acted on;</l>
               <l>Naught but the inane can furnish room. And thus,</l>
               <l>Beside the inane and bodies, is no third</l>
               <l>Nature amid the number of all things-</l>
               <l>Remainder none to fall at any time</l>
               <l>Under our senses, nor be seized and seen</l>
               <l>By any man through reasonings of mind.</l>
               <l>Name o'er creation with what names thou wilt,</l>
               <l>Thou'lt find but properties of those first twain,</l>
               <l>Or see but accidents those twain produce.</l>
               <l rend="indent">  A property is that which not at all</l>
               <l>Can be disjoined and severed from a thing</l>
               <l>Without a fatal dissolution: such,</l>
               <l>Weight to the rocks, heat to the fire, and flow</l>
               <l>To the wide waters, touch to corporal things,</l>
               <l>Intangibility to the viewless void.</l>
               <l>But state of slavery, pauperhood, and wealth,</l>
               <l>Freedom, and war, and concord, and all else</l>
               <l>Which come and go whilst nature stands the same,</l>
               <l>We're wont, and rightly, to call accidents.</l>
               <l>Even time exists not of itself; but sense</l>
               <l>Reads out of things what happened long ago,</l>
               <l>What presses now, and what shall follow after:</l>
               <l>No man, we must admit, feels time itself,</l>
               <l>Disjoined from motion and repose of things.</l>
               <l>Thus, when they say there "is" the ravishment</l>
               <l>Of Princess Helen, "is" the siege and sack</l>
               <l>Of Trojan Town, look out, they force us not</l>
               <l>To admit these acts existent by themselves,</l>
               <l>Merely because those races of mankind</l>
               <l>(Of whom these acts were accidents) long since</l>
               <l>Irrevocable age has borne away:</l>
               <l>For all past actions may be said to be</l>
               <l>But accidents, in one way, of mankind,-</l>
               <l>In other, of some region of the world.</l>
               <l>Add, too, had been no matter, and no room</l>
               <l>Wherein all things go on, the fire of love</l>
               <l>Upblown by that fair form, the glowing coal</l>
               <l>Under the Phrygian Alexander's breast,</l>
               <l>Had ne'er enkindled that renowned strife</l>
               <l>Of savage war, nor had the wooden horse</l>
               <l>Involved in flames old Pergama, by a birth</l>
               <l>At midnight of a brood of the Hellenes.</l>
               <l>And thus thou canst remark that every act</l>
               <l>At bottom exists not of itself, nor is</l>
               <l>As body is, nor has like name with void;</l>
               <l>But rather of sort more fitly to be called</l>
               <l>An accident of body, and of place</l>
               <l>Wherein all things go on.</l>

               <l rend="indent">                        Bodies, again,</l>
               <l>Are partly primal germs of things, and partly</l>
               <l>Unions deriving from the primal germs.</l>
               <l>And those which are the primal germs of things</l>
               <l>No power can quench; for in the end they conquer</l>
               <l>By their own solidness; though hard it be</l>
               <l>To think that aught in things has solid frame;</l>
               <l>For lightnings pass, no less than voice and shout,</l>
               <l>Through hedging walls of houses, and the iron</l>
               <l>White-dazzles in the fire, and rocks will burn</l>
               <l>With exhalations fierce and burst asunder.</l>

               <l>The ice of bronze melts conquered in the flame;</l>
               <l>Warmth and the piercing cold through silver seep,</l>
               <l>Since, with the cups held rightly in the hand,</l>
               <l>We oft feel both, as from above is poured</l>
               <l>The dew of waters between their shining sides:</l>
               <l>So true it is no solid form is found.</l>
               <l>But yet because true reason and nature of things</l>
               <l>Constrain us, come, whilst in few verses now</l>
               <l>I disentangle how there still exist</l>
               <l>Bodies of solid, everlasting frame-</l>
               <l>The seeds of things, the primal germs we teach,</l>
               <l>Whence all creation around us came to be.</l>
               <l>First since we know a twofold nature exists,</l>
               <l>Of things, both twain and utterly unlike-</l>
               <l>Body, and place in which an things go on-</l>
               <l>Then each must be both for and through itself,</l>
               <l>And all unmixed: where'er be empty space,</l>
               <l>There body's not; and so where body bides,</l>
               <l>There not at all exists the void inane.</l>
               <l>Thus primal bodies are solid, without a void.</l>
               <l>But since there's void in all begotten things,</l>
               <l>All solid matter must be round the same;</l>
               <l>Nor, by true reason canst thou prove aught hides</l>
               <l>And holds a void within its body, unless</l>
               <l>Thou grant what holds it be a solid. Know,</l>
               <l>That which can hold a void of things within</l>
               <l>Can be naught else than matter in union knit.</l>
               <l>Thus matter, consisting of a solid frame,</l>
               <l>Hath power to be eternal, though all else,</l>
               <l>Though all creation, be dissolved away.</l>
               <l>Again, were naught of empty and inane,</l>
               <l>The world were then a solid; as, without</l>
               <l>Some certain bodies to fill the places held,</l>
               <l>The world that is were but a vacant void.</l>
               <l>And so, infallibly, alternate-wise</l>
               <l>Body and void are still distinguished,</l>
               <l>Since nature knows no wholly full nor void.</l>
               <l>There are, then, certain bodies, possessed of power</l>
               <l>To vary forever the empty and the full;</l>
               <l>And these can nor be sundered from without</l>
               <l>By beats and blows, nor from within be torn</l>
               <l>By penetration, nor be overthrown</l>
               <l>By any assault soever through the world-</l>
               <l>For without void, naught can be crushed, it seems,</l>
               <l>Nor broken, nor severed by a cut in twain,</l>
               <l>Nor can it take the damp, or seeping cold</l>
               <l>Or piercing fire, those old destroyers three;</l>
               <l>But the more void within a thing, the more</l>
               <l>Entirely it totters at their sure assault.</l>
               <l>Thus if first bodies be, as I have taught,</l>
               <l>Solid, without a void, they must be then</l>
               <l>Eternal; and, if matter ne'er had been</l>
               <l>Eternal, long ere now had all things gone</l>
               <l>Back into nothing utterly, and all</l>
               <l>We see around from nothing had been born-</l>
               <l>But since I taught above that naught can be</l>
               <l>From naught created, nor the once begotten</l>
               <l>To naught be summoned back, these primal germs</l>
               <l>Must have an immortality of frame.</l>
               <l>And into these must each thing be resolved,</l>
               <l>When comes its supreme hour, that thus there be</l>
               <l>At hand the stuff for plenishing the world.</l>

               <l>So primal germs have solid singleness</l>
               <l>Nor otherwise could they have been conserved</l>
               <l>Through aeons and infinity of time</l>

               <l>Cannot perceive: That bounding point indeed</l>
               <l>Exists without all parts, a minimum</l>
               <l>Of nature, nor was e'er a thing apart,</l>
               <l>As of itself,- nor shall hereafter be,</l>
               <l>Since 'tis itself still parcel of another,</l>
               <l>A first and single part, whence other parts</l>
               <l>And others similar in order lie</l>
               <l>In a packed phalanx, filling to the full</l>
               <l>The nature of first body: being thus</l>
               <l>Not self-existent, they must cleave to that</l>
               <l>From which in nowise they can sundered be.</l>
               <l>So primal germs have solid singleness,</l>
               <l>Which tightly packed and closely joined cohere</l>
               <l>By virtue of their minim particles-</l>
               <l>No compound by mere union of the same;</l>
               <l>But strong in their eternal singleness,</l>
               <l>Nature, reserving them as seeds for things,</l>
               <l>Permitteth naught of rupture or decrease.</l>
               <l rend="indent">  Moreover, were there not a minimum,</l>
               <l>The smallest bodies would have infinites,</l>
               <l>Since then a half-of-half could still be halved,</l>
               <l>With limitless division less and less.</l>
               <l>Then what the difference 'twixt the sum and least?</l>
               <l>None: for however infinite the sum,</l>
               <l>Yet even the smallest would consist the same</l>
               <l>Of infinite parts. But since true reason here</l>
               <l>Protests, denying that the mind can think it,</l>
               <l>Convinced thou must confess such things there are</l>

               <l>Were wont to force all things to be resolved</l>
               <l>Unto least parts, then would she not avail</l>

               <head>CONFUTATION OF OTHER PHILOSOPHERS</head>

               <l rend="indent">  And on such grounds it is that those who held</l>
               <l>The stuff of things is fire, and out of fire</l>
               <l>Alone the cosmic sum is formed, are seen</l>
               <l>Mightily from true reason to have lapsed.</l>
               <l>Of whom, chief leader to do battle, comes</l>
               <l>That Heraclitus, famous for dark speech</l>
               <l>Among the silly, not the serious Greeks</l>
               <l>Who search for truth. For dolts are ever prone</l>
               <l>That to bewonder and adore which hides</l>
               <l>Beneath distorted words, holding that true</l>
               <l>Which sweetly tickles in their stupid ears,</l>
               <l>Or which is rouged in finely finished phrase.</l>
               <l>For how, I ask, can things so varied be,</l>
               <l>If formed of fire, single and pure? No whit</l>
               <l>'Twould help for fire to be condensed or thinned,</l>
               <l>If all the parts of fire did still preserve</l>
               <l>But fire's own nature, seen before in gross.</l>
               <l>The heat were keener with the parts compressed,</l>
               <l>Milder, again, when severed or dispersed-</l>
               <l>And more than this thou canst conceive of naught</l>
               <l>That from such causes could become; much less</l>
               <l>Might earth's variety of things be born</l>
               <l>From any fires soever, dense or rare.</l>
               <l>This too: if they suppose a void in things,</l>
               <l>Then fires can be condensed and still left rare;</l>
               <l>But since they see such opposites of thought</l>
               <l>Rising against them, and are loath to leave</l>
               <l>An unmixed void in things, they fear the steep</l>
               <l>And lose the road of truth. Nor do they see,</l>
               <l>That, if from things we take away the void,</l>
               <l>All things are then condensed, and out of all</l>
               <l>One body made, which has no power to dart</l>
               <l>Swiftly from out itself not anything-</l>
               <l>As throws the fire its light and warmth around,</l>
               <l>Giving thee proof its parts are not compact.</l>
               <l>But if perhaps they think, in other wise,</l>
               <l>Fires through their combinations can be quenched</l>
               <l>And change their substance, very well: behold,</l>
               <l>If fire shall spare to do so in no part,</l>
               <l>Then heat will perish utterly and all,</l>
               <l>And out of nothing would the world be formed.</l>
               <l>For change in anything from out its bounds</l>
               <l>Means instant death of that which was before;</l>
               <l>And thus a somewhat must persist unharmed</l>
               <l>Amid the world, lest all return to naught,</l>
               <l>And, born from naught, abundance thrive anew.</l>
               <l>Now since indeed there are those surest bodies</l>
               <l>Which keep their nature evermore the same,</l>
               <l>Upon whose going out and coming in</l>
               <l>And changed order things their nature change,</l>
               <l>And all corporeal substances transformed,</l>
               <l>'Tis thine to know those primal bodies, then,</l>
               <l>Are not of fire. For 'twere of no avail</l>
               <l>Should some depart and go away, and some</l>
               <l>Be added new, and some be changed in order,</l>
               <l>If still all kept their nature of old heat:</l>
               <l>For whatsoever they created then</l>
               <l>Would still in any case be only fire.</l>
               <l>The truth, I fancy, this: bodies there are</l>
               <l>Whose clashings, motions, order, posture, shapes</l>
               <l>Produce the fire and which, by order changed,</l>
               <l>Do change the nature of the thing produced,</l>
               <l>And are thereafter nothing like to fire</l>
               <l>Nor whatso else has power to send its bodies</l>
               <l>With impact touching on the senses' touch.</l>
               <l rend="indent">  Again, to say that all things are but fire</l>
               <l>And no true thing in number of all things</l>
               <l>Exists but fire, as this same fellow says,</l>
               <l>Seems crazed folly. For the man himself</l>
               <l>Against the senses by the senses fights,</l>
               <l>And hews at that through which is all belief,</l>
               <l>Through which indeed unto himself is known</l>
               <l>The thing he calls the fire. For, though he thinks</l>
               <l>The senses truly can perceive the fire,</l>
               <l>He thinks they cannot as regards all else,</l>
               <l>Which still are palpably as clear to sense-</l>
               <l>To me a thought inept and crazy too.</l>
               <l>For whither shall we make appeal? for what</l>
               <l>More certain than our senses can there be</l>
               <l>Whereby to mark asunder error and truth?</l>
               <l>Besides, why rather do away with all,</l>
               <l>And wish to allow heat only, then deny</l>
               <l>The fire and still allow all else to be?-</l>

               <l>And life dissolve from out his thews and bones;</l>
               <l>For out of doubt recruited and fed are we</l>
               <l>By certain things, as other things by others.</l>
               <l>Because in many ways the many germs</l>
               <l>Common to many things are mixed in things,</l>
               <l>No wonder 'tis that therefore divers things</l>
               <l>By divers things are nourished. And, again,</l>
               <l>Often it matters vastly with what others,</l>
               <l>In what positions the primordial germs</l>
               <l>Are bound together, and what motions, too,</l>
               <l>They give and get among themselves; for these</l>
               <l>Same germs do put together sky, sea, lands,</l>
               <l>Rivers, and sun, grains, trees, and breathing things,</l>
               <l>But yet commixed they are in divers modes</l>
               <l>With divers things, forever as they move.</l>
               <l>Nay, thou beholdest in our verses here</l>
               <l>Elements many, common to many worlds,</l>
               <l>Albeit thou must confess each verse, each word</l>
               <l>From one another differs both in sense</l>
               <l>And ring of sound- so much the elements</l>
               <l>Can bring about by change of order alone.</l>
               <l>But those which are the primal germs of things</l>
               <l>Have power to work more combinations still,</l>
               <l>Whence divers things can be produced in turn.</l>

               <l rend="indent">  Now let us also take for scrutiny</l>
               <l>The homeomeria of Anaxagoras,</l>
               <l>So called by Greeks, for which our pauper-speech</l>
               <l>Yieldeth no name in the Italian tongue,</l>
               <l>Although the thing itself is not o'erhard</l>
               <l>For explanation. First, then, when he speaks</l>
               <l>Of this homeomeria of things, he thinks</l>
               <l>Bones to be sprung from littlest bones minute,</l>
               <l>And from minute and littlest flesh all flesh,</l>
               <l>And blood created out of drops of blood,</l>
               <l>Conceiving gold compact of grains of gold,</l>
               <l>And earth concreted out of bits of earth,</l>
               <l>Fire made of fires, and water out of waters,</l>
               <l>Feigning the like with all the rest of stuff.</l>
               <l>Yet he concedes not any void in things,</l>
               <l>Nor any limit to cutting bodies down.</l>
               <l>Wherefore to me he seems on both accounts</l>
               <l>To err no less than those we named before.</l>
            </div>
            <div type="card" n="847">
               <l>Add too: these germs he feigns are far too frail-</l>
               <l>If they be germs primordial furnished forth</l>
               <l>With but same nature as the things themselves,</l>
               <l>And travail and perish equally with those,</l>
               <l>And no rein curbs them from annihilation.</l>
               <l>For which will last against the grip and crush</l>
               <l>Under the teeth of death? the fire? the moist?</l>
               <l>Or else the air? which then? the blood? the bones?</l>
               <l>No one, methinks, when every thing will be</l>
               <l>At bottom as mortal as whate'er we mark</l>
               <l>To perish by force before our gazing eyes.</l>
               <l>But my appeal is to the proofs above</l>
               <l>That things cannot fall back to naught, nor yet</l>
               <l>From naught increase. And now again, since food</l>
               <l>Augments and nourishes the human frame,</l>
               <l>'Tis thine to know our veins and blood and bones</l>
               <l>And thews are formed of particles unlike</l>
               <l>To them in kind; or if they say all foods</l>
               <l>Are of mixed substance having in themselves</l>
               <l>Small bodies of thews, and bones, and also veins</l>
               <l>And particles of blood, then every food,</l>
               <l>Solid or liquid, must itself be thought</l>
               <l>As made and mixed of things unlike in kind-</l>
               <l>Of bones, of thews, of ichor and of blood.</l>
               <l>Again, if all the bodies which upgrow</l>
               <l>From earth, are first within the earth, then earth</l>
               <l>Must be compound of alien substances.</l>
               <l>Which spring and bloom abroad from out the earth.</l>
               <l>Transfer the argument, and thou may'st use</l>
               <l>The selfsame words: if flame and smoke and ash</l>
               <l>Still lurk unseen within the wood, the wood</l>
               <l>Must be compound of alien substances</l>

               <l>Indeed we ought to find, when crumbling up</l>

               <l>That, too, the sum of things itself may not</l>
               <l>Have power to fix a measure of its own,</l>
               <l>Great nature guards, she who compels the void</l>
               <l>To bound all body, as body all the void,</l>
               <l>Thus rendering by these alternates the whole</l>
               <l>An infinite; or else the one or other,</l>
               <l>Being unbounded by the other, spreads,</l>

               <l>Immeasurably forth....</l>
               <l>Nor sea, nor earth, nor shining vaults of sky,</l>
               <l>Nor breed of mortals, nor holy limbs of gods</l>
               <l>Could keep their place least portion of an hour:</l>
               <l>For, driven apart from out its meetings fit,</l>
               <l>The stock of stuff, dissolved, would be borne</l>
               <l>Along the illimitable inane afar,</l>
               <l>Or rather, in fact, would ne'er have once combined</l>
               <l>And given a birth to aught, since, scattered wide,</l>
               <l>It could not be united. For of truth</l>
               <l>Neither by counsel did the primal germs</l>
               <l>'Stablish themselves, as by keen act of mind,</l>
               <l>Each in its proper place; nor did they make,</l>
               <l>Forsooth, a compact how each germ should move;</l>
               <l>But since, being many and changed in many modes</l>
               <l>Along the All, they're driven abroad and vexed</l>
               <l>By blow on blow, even from all time of old,</l>
               <l>They thus at last, after attempting all</l>
               <l>The kinds of motion and conjoining, come</l>
               <l>Into those great arrangements out of which</l>
               <l>This sum of things established is create,</l>
               <l>By which, moreover, through the mighty years,</l>
               <l>It is preserved, when once it has been thrown</l>
               <l>Into the proper motions, bringing to pass</l>
               <l>That ever the streams refresh the greedy main</l>
               <l>With river-waves abounding, and that earth,</l>
               <l>Lapped in warm exhalations of the sun,</l>
               <l>Renews her broods, and that the lusty race</l>
               <l>Of breathing creatures bears and blooms, and that</l>
               <l>The gliding fires of ether are alive-</l>
               <l>What still the primal germs nowise could do,</l>
               <l>Unless from out the infinite of space</l>
               <l>Could come supply of matter, whence in season</l>
               <l>They're wont whatever losses to repair.</l>
               <l>For as the nature of breathing creatures wastes,</l>
               <l>Losing its body, when deprived of food:</l>
               <l>So all things have to be dissolved as soon</l>
               <l>As matter, diverted by what means soever</l>
               <l>From off its course, shall fail to be on hand.</l>
               <l>Nor can the blows from outward still conserve,</l>
               <l>On every side, whatever sum of a world</l>
               <l>Has been united in a whole. They can</l>
               <l>Indeed, by frequent beating, check a part,</l>
               <l>Till others arriving may fulfil the sum;</l>
               <l>But meanwhile often are they forced to spring</l>
               <l>Rebounding back, and, as they spring, to yield,</l>
               <l>Unto those elements whence a world derives,</l>
               <l>Room and a time for flight, permitting them</l>
               <l>To be from off the massy union borne</l>
               <l>Free and afar. Wherefore, again, again:</l>
               <l>Needs must there come a many for supply;</l>
               <l>And also, that the blows themselves shall be</l>
               <l>Unfailing ever, must there ever be</l>
               <l>An infinite force of matter all sides round.</l>

               <l>No whit more fearsome than what children feign,</l>
               <l>Shuddering, will be upon them in the dark.</l>
               <l>This terror then, this darkness of the mind,</l>

               <l>Nor glittering arrows of morning can disperse,</l>

               <l rend="indent">                       But if thou believe</l>
               <l>That the primordial germs of things can stop,</l>
               <l>And in their stopping give new motions birth,</l>
               <l>Afar thou wanderest from the road of truth.</l>
               <l>For since they wander through the void inane,</l>
               <l>All the primordial germs of things must needs</l>
               <l>Be borne along, either by weight their own,</l>
               <l>Or haply by another's blow without.</l>
               <l>For, when, in their incessancy so oft</l>
               <l>They meet and clash, it comes to pass amain</l>
               <l>They leap asunder, face to face: not strange-</l>
               <l>Being most hard, and solid in their weights,</l>
               <l>And naught opposing motion, from behind.</l>
               <l>And that more clearly thou perceive how all</l>
               <l>These mites of matter are darted round about,</l>
               <l>Recall to mind how nowhere in the sum</l>
               <l>Of All exists a bottom,- nowhere is</l>
               <l>A realm of rest for primal bodies; since</l>
               <l>(As amply shown and proved by reason sure)</l>
               <l>Space has no bound nor measure, and extends</l>
               <l>Unmetered forth in all directions round.</l>
               <l>Since this stands certain, thus 'tis out of doubt</l>
               <l>No rest is rendered to the primal bodies</l>
               <l>Along the unfathomable inane; but rather,</l>
               <l>Inveterately plied by motions mixed,</l>
               <l>Some, at their jamming, bound aback and leave</l>
               <l>Huge gaps between, and some from off the blow</l>
               <l>Are hurried about with spaces small between.</l>
               <l>And all which, brought together with slight gaps,</l>
               <l>In more condensed union bound aback,</l>
               <l>Linked by their own all inter-tangled shapes,-</l>
               <l>These form the irrefragable roots of rocks</l>
               <l>And the brute bulks of iron, and what else</l>
               <l>Is of their kind...</l>
               <l>The rest leap far asunder, far recoil,</l>
               <l>Leaving huge gaps between: and these supply</l>
               <l>For us thin air and splendour-lights of the sun.</l>
               <l>And many besides wander the mighty void-</l>
               <l>Cast back from unions of existing things,</l>
               <l>Nowhere accepted in the universe,</l>
               <l>And nowise linked in motions to the rest.</l>
               <l>And of this fact (as I record it here)</l>
               <l>An image, a type goes on before our eyes</l>
               <l>Present each moment; for behold whenever</l>
               <l>The sun's light and the rays, let in, pour down</l>
               <l>Across dark halls of houses: thou wilt see</l>
               <l>The many mites in many a manner mixed</l>
               <l>Amid a void in the very light of the rays,</l>
               <l>And battling on, as in eternal strife,</l>
               <l>And in battalions contending without halt,</l>
               <l>In meetings, partings, harried up and down.</l>
               <l>From this thou mayest conjecture of what sort</l>
               <l>The ceaseless tossing of primordial seeds</l>
               <l>Amid the mightier void- at least so far</l>
               <l>As small affair can for a vaster serve,</l>
               <l>And by example put thee on the spoor</l>
               <l>Of knowledge. For this reason too 'tis fit</l>
               <l>Thou turn thy mind the more unto these bodies</l>
               <l>Which here are witnessed tumbling in the light:</l>
               <l>Namely, because such tumblings are a sign</l>
               <l>That motions also of the primal stuff</l>
               <l>Secret and viewless lurk beneath, behind.</l>
               <l>For thou wilt mark here many a speck, impelled</l>
               <l>By viewless blows, to change its little course,</l>
               <l>And beaten backwards to return again,</l>
               <l>Hither and thither in all directions round.</l>
               <l>Lo, all their shifting movement is of old,</l>
               <l>From the primeval atoms; for the same</l>
               <l>Primordial seeds of things first move of self,</l>
               <l>And then those bodies built of unions small</l>
               <l>And nearest, as it were, unto the powers</l>
               <l>Of the primeval atoms, are stirred up</l>
               <l>By impulse of those atoms' unseen blows,</l>
               <l>And these thereafter goad the next in size:</l>
               <l>Thus motion ascends from the primevals on,</l>
               <l>And stage by stage emerges to our sense,</l>
               <l>Until those objects also move which we</l>
               <l>Can mark in sunbeams, though it not appears</l>
               <l>What blows do urge them.</l>

               <l>How suddenly the risen sun is wont</l>
               <l>At such an hour to overspread and clothe</l>

            <div type="card" n="184">
               <l rend="indent">  Now is the place, meseems, in these affairs</l>
               <l>To prove for thee this too: nothing corporeal</l>
               <l>Of its own force can e'er be upward borne,</l>
               <l>Or upward go- nor let the bodies of flames</l>

               <l>Though all the weight within them downward bears.</l>
               <l>Nor, when the fires will leap from under round</l>
               <l>The roofs of houses, and swift flame laps up</l>
               <l>Timber and beam, 'tis then to be supposed</l>
               <l>They act of own accord, no force beneath</l>
               <l>To urge them up. 'Tis thus that blood, discharged</l>
               <l>From out our bodies, spurts its jets aloft</l>
               <l>And spatters gore. And hast thou never marked</l>
               <l>With what a force the water will disgorge</l>
               <l>Timber and beam? The deeper, straight and down,</l>
               <l>We push them in, and, many though we be,</l>
               <l>The more we press with main and toil, the more</l>
               <l>The water vomits up and flings them back,</l>
               <l>That, more than half their length, they there emerge,</l>
               <l>Rebounding. Yet we never doubt, meseems,</l>
               <l>That all the weight within them downward bears</l>
               <l>Through empty void. Well, in like manner, flames</l>
               <l>Ought also to be able, when pressed out,</l>
               <l>Through winds of air to rise aloft, even though</l>

               <l>How after them they draw long trails of flame</l>
               <l>Wherever Nature gives a thoroughfare?</l>
               <l>How stars and constellations drop to earth,</l>

               <l>We wish thee also well aware of this:</l>
               <l>The atoms, as their own weight bears them down</l>
               <l>Plumb through the void, at scarce determined times,</l>
               <l>In scarce determined places, from their course</l>
               <l>Decline a little- call it, so to speak,</l>
               <l>Mere changed trend. For were it not their wont</l>
               <l>Thuswise to swerve, down would they fall, each one,</l>
               <l>Like drops of rain, through the unbottomed void;</l>
               <l>And then collisions ne'er could be nor blows</l>
               <l>Among the primal elements; and thus</l>
               <l>Nature would never have created aught.</l>
               <l rend="indent">  But, if perchance be any that believe</l>
               <l>The heavier bodies, as more swiftly borne</l>
               <l>Plumb down the void, are able from above</l>
               <l>To strike the lighter, thus engendering blows</l>
               <l>Able to cause those procreant motions, far</l>
               <l>From highways of true reason they retire.</l>
               <l>For whatsoever through the waters fall,</l>
               <l>Or through thin air, must quicken their descent,</l>
               <l>Each after its weight- on this account, because</l>
               <l>Both bulk of water and the subtle air</l>
               <l>By no means can retard each thing alike,</l>
               <l>But give more quick before the heavier weight;</l>
               <l>But contrariwise the empty void cannot,</l>
               <l>On any side, at any time, to aught</l>
               <l>Oppose resistance, but will ever yield,</l>
               <l>True to its bent of nature. Wherefore all,</l>
               <l>With equal speed, though equal not in weight,</l>
               <l>Must rush, borne downward through the still inane.</l>
               <l>Thus ne'er at all have heavier from above</l>
               <l>Been swift to strike the lighter, gendering strokes</l>
               <l>Which cause those divers motions, by whose means</l>
               <l>Nature transacts her work. And so I say,</l>
               <l>The atoms must a little swerve at times-</l>
               <l>But only the least, lest we should seem to feign</l>
               <l>Motions oblique, and fact refute us there.</l>
               <l>For this we see forthwith is manifest:</l>
               <l>Whatever the weight, it can't obliquely go,</l>
               <l>Down on its headlong journey from above,</l>
               <l>At least so far as thou canst mark; but who</l>
               <l>Is there can mark by sense that naught can swerve</l>
               <l>At all aside from off its road's straight line?</l>
               <l rend="indent">  Again, if ev'r all motions are co-linked,</l>
               <l>And from the old ever arise the new</l>
               <l>In fixed order, and primordial seeds</l>
               <l>Produce not by their swerving some new start</l>
               <l>Of motion to sunder the covenants of fate,</l>
               <l>That cause succeed not cause from everlasting,</l>

               <l>Whereby we step right forward where desire</l>
               <l>Leads each man on, whereby the same we swerve</l>
               <l>In motions, not as at some fixed time,</l>
               <l>Nor at some fixed line of space, but where</l>
               <l>The mind itself has urged? For out of doubt</l>
               <l>In these affairs 'tis each man's will itself</l>
               <l>That gives the start, and hence throughout our limbs</l>
               <l>Incipient motions are diffused. Again,</l>
               <l>Dost thou not see, when, at a point of time,</l>
               <l>The bars are opened, how the eager strength</l>
               <l>Of horses cannot forward break as soon</l>
               <l>As pants their mind to do? For it behooves</l>
               <l>That all the stock of matter, through the frame,</l>
               <l>Be roused, in order that, through every joint,</l>

               <l>First from the spirit's will, whence at the last</l>

               <l>Quite otherwise it is, when forth we move,</l>

               <l>And mighty urge; for then 'tis clear enough</l>
               <l>All matter of our total body goes,</l>
               <l>Hurried along, against our own desire-</l>

               <l>For were these shapes quite infinite, some seeds</l>

               <l>If thou percase wouldst vary its old shapes,</l>
               <l>New parts must then be added; follows next,</l>
               <l>If thou percase wouldst vary still its shapes,</l>
               <l>That by like logic each arrangement still</l>

               <l>Of bones, blood, veins, heat, moisture, flesh, and thews-</l>
               <l>All differing vastly in their forms, and built</l>
               <l>Of elements dissimilar in shape.</l>
               <l>Again, all things by fire consumed ablaze,</l>
               <l>Within their frame lay up, if naught besides,</l>
               <l>At least those atoms whence derives their power</l>
               <l>To throw forth fire and send out light from under,</l>
               <l>To shoot the sparks and scatter embers wide.</l>
               <l>If, with like reasoning of mind, all else</l>
               <l>Thou traverse through, thou wilt discover thus</l>
               <l>That in their frame the seeds of many things</l>
               <l>They hide, and divers shapes of seeds contain.</l>
               <l>Further, thou markest much, to which are given</l>
               <l>Along together colour and flavour and smell,</l>

               <l rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</l>

               <l>A smell of scorching enters in our frame</l>
               <l>Where the bright colour from the dye goes not;</l>
               <l>And colour in one way, flavour in quite another</l>
               <l>Works inward to our senses- so mayst see</l>
               <l>They differ too in elemental shapes.</l>
               <l>Thus unlike forms into one mass combine,</l>
               <l>And things exist by intermixed seed.</l>
               <l rend="indent">  But still 'tmust not be thought that in all ways</l>
               <l>All things can be conjoined; for then wouldst view</l>
               <l>Portents begot about thee every side:</l>
               <l>Hulks of mankind half brute astarting up,</l>
               <l>At times big branches sprouting from man's trunk,</l>
               <l>Limbs of a sea-beast to a land-beast knit,</l>
               <l>And nature along the all-producing earth</l>
               <l>Feeding those dire Chimaeras breathing flame</l>
               <l>From hideous jaws- Of which 'tis simple fact</l>
               <l>That none have been begot; because we see</l>
               <l>All are from fixed seed and fixed dam</l>
               <l>Engendered and so function as to keep</l>
               <l>Throughout their growth their own ancestral type.</l>
               <l>This happens surely by a fixed law:</l>
               <l>For from all food-stuff, when once eaten down,</l>
               <l>Go sundered atoms, suited to each creature,</l>
               <l>Throughout their bodies, and, conjoining there,</l>
               <l>Produce the proper motions; but we see</l>
               <l>How, contrariwise, nature upon the ground</l>
               <l>Throws off those foreign to their frame; and many</l>
               <l>With viewless bodies from their bodies fly,</l>
               <l>By blows impelled- those impotent to join</l>
               <l>To any part, or, when inside, to accord</l>
               <l>And to take on the vital motions there.</l>
               <l>But think not, haply, living forms alone</l>
               <l>Are bound by these laws: they distinguished all.</l>
               <l rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</l>
               <l>For just as all things of creation are,</l>
               <l>In their whole nature, each to each unlike,</l>
               <l>So must their atoms be in shape unlike-</l>
               <l>Not since few only are fashioned of like form,</l>
               <l>But since they all, as general rule, are not</l>
               <l>The same as all. Nay, here in these our verses,</l>
               <l>Elements many, common to many words,</l>
               <l>Thou seest, though yet 'tis needful to confess</l>
               <l>The words and verses differ, each from each,</l>
               <l>Compounded out of different elements-</l>
               <l>Not since few only, as common letters, run</l>
               <l>Through all the words, or no two words are made,</l>
               <l>One and the other, from all like elements,</l>
               <l>But since they all, as general rule, are not</l>
               <l>The same as all. Thus, too, in other things,</l>
               <l>Whilst many germs common to many things</l>
               <l>There are, yet they, combined among themselves,</l>
               <l>Can form new wholes to others quite unlike.</l>
               <l>Thus fairly one may say that humankind,</l>
               <l>The grains, the gladsome trees, are all made up</l>
               <l>Of different atoms. Further, since the seeds</l>
               <l>Are different, difference must there also be</l>
               <l>In intervening spaces, thoroughfares,</l>
               <l>Connections, weights, blows, clashings, motions, all</l>
               <l>Which not alone distinguish living forms,</l>
               <l>But sunder earth's whole ocean from the lands,</l>
               <l>And hold all heaven from the lands away.</l>

               <l>A cube's produced all uniform in shape,</l>

               <l>Seeing, moreover, this world too hath been</l>

               <l>By innate motion chanced to clash and cling-</l>
               <l>After they'd been in many a manner driven</l>
               <l>Together at random, without design, in vain-</l>
               <l>And as at last those seeds together dwelt,</l>
               <l>Which, when together of a sudden thrown,</l>
               <l>Should alway furnish the commencements fit</l>
               <l>Of mighty things- the earth, the sea, the sky,</l>
               <l>And race of living creatures. Thus, I say,</l>
               <l>Again, again, 'tmust be confessed there are</l>
               <l>Such congregations of matter otherwhere,</l>
               <l>Like this our world which vasty ether holds</l>

               <l>Perforce. And now, if store of seeds there is</l>
               <l>So great that not whole life-times of the living</l>
               <l>Can count the tale...</l>
               <l>And if their force and nature abide the same,</l>
               <l>Able to throw the seeds of things together</l>

               <l>One member of some generated race,</l>

               <l>To be begot, and lastly the mute flocks</l>
               <l>Of scaled fish, and winged frames of birds.</l>
               <l>Wherefore confess we must on grounds the same</l>
               <l>That earth, sun, moon, and ocean, and all else,</l>
               <l>Exist not sole and single- rather in number</l>

               <l>Old boundary stone of life remains for them</l>

               <l>And whilst, from these, men wish to scape afar,</l>
               <l>Driven by false terror, and afar remove,</l>
               <l>With civic blood a fortune they amass,</l>
               <l>They double their riches, greedy, heapers-up</l>
               <l>Of corpse on corpse they have a cruel laugh</l>
               <l>For the sad burial of a brother-born,</l>
               <l>And hatred and fear of tables of their kin.</l>
               <l>Likewise, through this same terror, envy oft</l>
               <l>Makes them to peak because before their eyes</l>
               <l>That man is lordly, that man gazed upon</l>
               <l>Who walks begirt with honour glorious,</l>
               <l>Whilst they in filth and darkness roll around;</l>
               <l>Some perish away for statues and a name,</l>
               <l>And oft to that degree, from fright of death,</l>
               <l>Will hate of living and beholding light</l>
               <l>Take hold on humankind that they inflict</l>
               <l>Their own destruction with a gloomy heart-</l>
               <l>Forgetful that this fear is font of cares,</l>
               <l>This fear the plague upon their sense of shame,</l>
               <l>And this that breaks the ties of comradry</l>
               <l>And oversets all reverence and faith,</l>
               <l>Mid direst slaughter. For long ere to-day</l>
               <l>Often were traitors to country and dear parents</l>
               <l>Through quest to shun the realms of <placeName key="tgn,1120946">Acheron</placeName>.</l>
               <l>For just as children tremble and fear all</l>
               <l>In the viewless dark, so even we at times</l>
               <l>Dread in the light so many things that be</l>
               <l>No whit more fearsome than what children feign,</l>
               <l>Shuddering, will be upon them in the dark.</l>
               <l>This terror, then, this darkness of the mind,</l>
               <l>Not sunrise with its flaring spokes of light,</l>
               <l>Nor glittering arrows of morning sun disperse,</l>

               <head> NATURE AND COMPOSITION OF THE MIND</head>

               <l rend="indent">  First, then, I say, the mind which oft we call</l>
               <l>The intellect, wherein is seated life's</l>
               <l>Counsel and regimen, is part no less</l>
               <l>Of man than hand and foot and eyes are parts</l>
               <l>Of one whole breathing creature. [But some hold]</l>
               <l>That sense of mind is in no fixed part seated,</l>
               <l>But is of body some one vital state,-</l>
               <l>Named "harmony" by Greeks, because thereby</l>
               <l>We live with sense, though intellect be not</l>
               <l>In any part: as oft the body is said</l>
               <l>To have good health (when health, however, 's not</l>
               <l>One part of him who has it), so they place</l>
               <l>The sense of mind in no fixed part of man.</l>
               <l>Mightily, diversly, meseems they err.</l>
               <l>Often the body palpable and seen</l>
               <l>Sickens, while yet in some invisible part</l>
               <l>We feel a pleasure; oft the other way,</l>
               <l>A miserable in mind feels pleasure still</l>
               <l>Throughout his body- quite the same as when</l>
               <l>A foot may pain without a pain in head.</l>
               <l>Besides, when these our limbs are given o'er</l>
               <l>To gentle sleep and lies the burdened frame</l>
               <l>At random void of sense, a something else</l>
               <l>Is yet within us, which upon that time</l>
               <l>Bestirs itself in many a wise, receiving</l>
               <l>All motions of joy and phantom cares of heart.</l>
               <l>Now, for to see that in man's members dwells</l>
               <l>Also the soul, and body ne'er is wont</l>
               <l>To feel sensation by a "harmony"</l>
               <l>Take this in chief: the fact that life remains</l>
               <l>Oft in our limbs, when much of body's gone;</l>
               <l>Yet that same life, when particles of heat,</l>
               <l>Though few, have scattered been, and through the mouth</l>
               <l>Air has been given forth abroad, forthwith</l>
               <l>Forever deserts the veins, and leaves the bones.</l>
               <l>Thus mayst thou know that not all particles</l>
               <l>Perform like parts, nor in like manner all</l>
               <l>Are props of weal and safety: rather those-</l>
               <l>The seeds of wind and exhalations warm-</l>
               <l>Take care that in our members life remains.</l>
               <l>Therefore a vital heat and wind there is</l>
               <l>Within the very body, which at death</l>
               <l>Deserts our frames. And so, since nature of mind</l>
               <l>And even of soul is found to be, as 'twere,</l>
               <l>A part of man, give over "harmony"-</l>
               <l>Name to musicians brought from Helicon,-</l>
               <l>Unless themselves they filched it otherwise,</l>
               <l>To serve for what was lacking name till then.</l>
               <l>Whate'er it be, they're welcome to it- thou,</l>
               <l>Hearken my other maxims.</l>

               <l rend="indent">                                Mind and soul,</l>
               <l>I say, are held conjoined one with other,</l>
               <l>And form one single nature of themselves;</l>
               <l>But chief and regnant through the frame entire</l>
               <l>Is still that counsel which we call the mind,</l>
               <l>And that cleaves seated in the midmost breast.</l>
               <l>Here leap dismay and terror; round these haunts</l>
               <l>Be blandishments of joys; and therefore here</l>
               <l>The intellect, the mind. The rest of soul,</l>
               <l>Throughout the body scattered, but obeys-</l>
               <l>Moved by the nod and motion of the mind.</l>
               <l>This, for itself, sole through itself, hath thought;</l>
               <l>This for itself hath mirth, even when the thing</l>
               <l>That moves it, moves nor soul nor body at all.</l>
               <l>And as, when head or eye in us is smit</l>
               <l>By assailing pain, we are not tortured then</l>
               <l>Through all the body, so the mind alone</l>
               <l>Is sometimes smitten, or livens with a joy,</l>
               <l>Whilst yet the soul's remainder through the limbs</l>
               <l>And through the frame is stirred by nothing new.</l>
               <l>But when the mind is moved by shock more fierce,</l>
               <l>We mark the whole soul suffering all at once</l>
               <l>Along man's members: sweats and pallors spread</l>
               <l>Over the body, and the tongue is broken,</l>
               <l>And fails the voice away, and ring the ears,</l>
               <l>Mists blind the eyeballs, and the joints collapse,-</l>
               <l>Aye, men drop dead from terror of the mind.</l>
               <l>Hence, whoso will can readily remark</l>
               <l>That soul conjoined is with mind, and, when</l>
               <l>'Tis strook by influence of the mind, forthwith</l>
               <l>In turn it hits and drives the body too.</l>
               <l rend="indent">  And this same argument establisheth</l>
               <l>That nature of mind and soul corporeal is:</l>
               <l>For when 'tis seen to drive the members on,</l>
               <l>To snatch from sleep the body, and to change</l>
               <l>The countenance, and the whole state of man</l>
               <l>To rule and turn,- what yet could never be</l>
               <l>Sans contact, and sans body contact fails-</l>
               <l>Must we not grant that mind and soul consist</l>
               <l>Of a corporeal nature?- And besides</l>
               <l>Thou markst that likewise with this body of ours</l>
               <l>Suffers the mind and with our body feels.</l>
               <l>If the dire speed of spear that cleaves the bones</l>
               <l>And bares the inner thews hits not the life,</l>
               <l>Yet follows a fainting and a foul collapse,</l>
               <l>And, on the ground, dazed tumult in the mind,</l>
               <l>And whiles a wavering will to rise afoot.</l>
               <l>So nature of mind must be corporeal, since</l>
               <l>From stroke and spear corporeal 'tis in throes.</l>
               <l rend="indent">  Now, of what body, what components formed</l>
               <l>Is this same mind I will go on to tell.</l>
               <l>First, I aver, 'tis superfine, composed</l>
               <l>Of tiniest particles- that such the fact</l>
               <l>Thou canst perceive, if thou attend, from this:</l>
            </div>
            <div type="card" n="182">
               <l>Nothing is seen to happen with such speed</l>
               <l>As what the mind proposes and begins;</l>
               <l>Therefore the same bestirs itself more swiftly</l>
               <l>Than aught whose nature's palpable to eyes.</l>
               <l>But what's so agile must of seeds consist</l>
               <l>Most round, most tiny, that they may be moved,</l>
               <l>When hit by impulse slight. So water moves,</l>
               <l>In waves along, at impulse just the least-</l>
               <l>Being create of little shapes that roll;</l>
               <l>But, contrariwise, the quality of honey</l>
               <l>More stable is, its liquids more inert,</l>
               <l>More tardy its flow; for all its stock of matter</l>
               <l>Cleaves more together, since, indeed, 'tis made</l>
               <l>Of atoms not so smooth, so fine, and round.</l>
               <l>For the light breeze that hovers yet can blow</l>
               <l>High heaps of poppy-seed away for thee</l>
               <l>Downward from off the top; but, contrariwise,</l>
               <l>A pile of stones or spiny ears of wheat</l>
               <l>It can't at all. Thus, in so far as bodies</l>
               <l>Are small and smooth, is their mobility;</l>
               <l>But, contrariwise, the heavier and more rough,</l>
               <l>The more immovable they prove. Now, then,</l>
               <l>Since nature of mind is movable so much,</l>
               <l>Consist it must of seeds exceeding small</l>
               <l>And smooth and round. Which fact once known to thee,</l>
               <l>Good friend, will serve thee opportune in else.</l>
               <l>This also shows the nature of the same,</l>
               <l>How nice its texture, in how small a space</l>
               <l>'Twould go, if once compacted as a pellet:</l>
               <l>When death's unvexed repose gets hold on man</l>
               <l>And mind and soul retire, thou markest there</l>
               <l>From the whole body nothing ta'en in form,</l>
               <l>Nothing in weight. Death grants ye everything,</l>
               <l>But vital sense and exhalation hot.</l>
               <l>Thus soul entire must be of smallmost seeds,</l>
               <l>Twined through the veins, the vitals, and the thews,</l>
               <l>Seeing that, when 'tis from whole body gone,</l>
               <l>The outward figuration of the limbs</l>
               <l>Is unimpaired and weight fails not a whit.</l>
               <l>Just so, when vanished the bouquet of wine,</l>
               <l>Or when an unguent's perfume delicate</l>
               <l>Into the winds away departs, or when</l>
               <l>From any body savour's gone, yet still</l>
               <l>The thing itself seems minished naught to eyes,</l>
               <l>Thereby, nor aught abstracted from its weight-</l>
               <l>No marvel, because seeds many and minute</l>
               <l>Produce the savours and the redolence</l>

               <l>For, since the nature of all heat is rare,</l>
               <l>Athrough it many seeds of air must move.</l>
               <l>Thus nature of mind is triple; yet those all</l>

               <l>Must added be a somewhat, and a fourth;</l>
               <l>That somewhat's altogether void of name;</l>

               <l>That room for life will fail, and parts of soul</l>

               <l>And seems the very soul of all the soul,</l>
               <l>And holds dominion o'er the body all.</l>
               <l>And by like reason wind and air and heat</l>
               <l>Must function so, commingled through the frame,</l>

               <l>But more of hot have they whose restive hearts,</l>
               <l>Whose minds of passion quickly seethe in rage-</l>
               <l>Of which kind chief are fierce abounding lions,</l>
               <l>Who often with roaring burst the breast o'erwrought,</l>
               <l>Unable to hold the surging wrath within;</l>
               <l>But the cold mind of stags has more of wind,</l>
               <l>And speedier through their inwards rouses up</l>
               <l>The icy currents which make their members quake.</l>
               <l>But more the oxen live by tranquil air,</l>

               <l>Stags and fierce lions. Thus the race of men:</l>
               <l>Though training make them equally refined,</l>
               <l>It leaves those pristine vestiges behind</l>
               <l>Of each mind's nature. Nor may we suppose</l>
               <l>Evil can e'er be rooted up so far</l>
               <l>That one man's not more given to fits of wrath,</l>
               <l>Another's not more quickly touched by fear,</l>
               <l>A third not more long-suffering than he should.</l>
               <l>And needs must differ in many things besides</l>
               <l>The varied natures and resulting habits</l>

               <l>Expound the hidden causes, nor find names</l>
               <l>Enough for all the divers shapes of those</l>
               <l>Primordials whence this variation springs.</l>
               <l>But this meseems I'm able to declare:</l>
               <l>Those vestiges of natures left behind</l>
               <l>Which reason cannot quite expel from us</l>
               <l>Are still so slight that naught prevents a man</l>
               <l>From living a life even worthy of the gods.</l>
               <l rend="indent">  So then this soul is kept by all the body,</l>
               <l>Itself the body's guard, and source of weal:</l>
               <l>For they with common roots cleave each to each,</l>
               <l>Nor can be torn asunder without death.</l>
               <l>Not easy 'tis from lumps of frankincense</l>
               <l>To tear their fragrance forth, without its nature</l>
               <l>Perishing likewise: so, not easy 'tis</l>
               <l>From all the body nature of mind and soul</l>
               <l>To draw away, without the whole dissolved.</l>
               <l>With seeds so intertwined even from birth,</l>
               <l>They're dowered conjointly with a partner-life;</l>
               <l>No energy of body or mind, apart,</l>
               <l>Each of itself without the other's power,</l>
               <l>Can have sensation; but our sense, enkindled</l>
               <l>Along the vitals, to flame is blown by both</l>
               <l>With mutual motions. Besides the body alone</l>
               <l>Is nor begot nor grows, nor after death</l>
               <l>Seen to endure. For not as water at times</l>
               <l>Gives off the alien heat, nor is thereby</l>
               <l>Itself destroyed, but unimpaired remains-</l>
               <l>Not thus, I say, can the deserted frame</l>
               <l>Bear the dissevering of its joined soul,</l>
               <l>But, rent and ruined, moulders all away.</l>
               <l>Thus the joint contact of the body and soul</l>
               <l>Learns from their earliest age the vital motions,</l>
               <l>Even when still buried in the mother's womb;</l>
               <l>So no dissevering can hap to them,</l>
               <l>Without their bane and ill. And thence mayst see</l>
               <l>That, as conjoined is their source of weal,</l>
               <l>Conjoined also must their nature be.</l>

               <l>Before our eyes, and sputter foam, and grunt,</l>
               <l>Blither, and twist about with sinews taut,</l>
               <l>Gasp up in starts, and weary out his limbs</l>
               <l>With tossing round. No marvel, since distract</l>

               <l>As on the salt sea boil the billows round</l>
               <l>Under the master might of winds. And now</l>
               <l>A groan's forced out, because his limbs are griped,</l>
               <l>But, in the main, because the seeds of voice</l>
               <l>Are driven forth and carried in a mass</l>
               <l>Outwards by mouth, where they are wont to go,</l>
               <l>And have a builded highway. He becomes</l>
               <l>Mere fool, since energy of mind and soul</l>
               <l>Confounded is, and, as I've shown, to-riven,</l>
               <l>Asunder thrown, and torn to pieces all</l>
               <l>By the same venom. But, again, where cause</l>
               <l>Of that disease has faced about, and back</l>
               <l>Retreats sharp poison of corrupted frame</l>
               <l>Into its shadowy lairs, the man at first</l>
               <l>Arises reeling, and gradually comes back</l>
               <l>To all his senses and recovers soul.</l>
               <l>Thus, since within the body itself of man</l>
               <l>The mind and soul are by such great diseases</l>
               <l>Shaken, so miserably in labour distraught,</l>
               <l>Why, then, believe that in the open air,</l>
               <l>Without a body, they can pass their life,</l>
               <l>Immortal, battling with the master winds?</l>
               <l>And, since we mark the mind itself is cured,</l>
               <l>Like the sick body, and restored can be</l>
               <l>By medicine, this is forewarning too</l>
               <l>That mortal lives the mind. For proper it is</l>
               <l>That whosoe'er begins and undertakes</l>
               <l>To alter the mind, or meditates to change</l>
               <l>Any another nature soever, should add</l>
               <l>New parts, or readjust the order given,</l>
               <l>Or from the sum remove at least a bit.</l>
               <l>But what's immortal willeth for itself</l>
               <l>Its parts be nor increased, nor rearranged,</l>
               <l>Nor any bit soever flow away:</l>
               <l>For change of anything from out its bounds</l>
               <l>Means instant death of that which was before.</l>
               <l>Ergo, the mind, whether in sickness fallen,</l>
               <l>Or by the medicine restored, gives signs,</l>
               <l>As I have taught, of its mortality.</l>
               <l>So surely will a fact of truth make head</l>
               <l>'Gainst errors' theories all, and so shut off</l>
               <l>All refuge from the adversary, and rout</l>

               <l>For them to live as if they seemed to grow</l>
               <l>Along with limbs and frame, even in the blood,</l>
               <l>But rather as in a cavern all alone.</l>
               <l>(Yet all the body duly throngs with sense.)</l>
               <l>But public fact declares against all this:</l>
               <l>For soul is so entwined through the veins,</l>
               <l>The flesh, the thews, the bones, that even the teeth</l>
               <l>Share in sensation, as proven by dull ache,</l>
               <l>By twinge from icy water, or grating crunch</l>
               <l>Upon a stone that got in mouth with bread.</l>
               <l>Wherefore, again, again, souls must be thought</l>
               <l>Nor void of birth, nor free from law of death;</l>
               <l>Nor, if, from outward, in they wound their way,</l>
               <l>Could they be thought as able so to cleave</l>
               <l>To these our frames, nor, since so interwove,</l>
               <l>Appears it that they're able to go forth</l>
               <l>Unhurt and whole and loose themselves unscathed</l>
               <l>From all the thews, articulations, bones.</l>
               <l>But, if perchance thou thinkest that the soul,</l>
               <l>From outward winding in its way, is wont</l>
               <l>To seep and soak along these members ours,</l>
               <l>Then all the more 'twill perish, being thus</l>
               <l>With body fused- for what will seep and soak</l>
               <l>Will be dissolved and will therefore die.</l>
               <l>For just as food, dispersed through all the pores</l>
               <l>Of body, and passed through limbs and all the frame,</l>
               <l>Perishes, supplying from itself the stuff</l>

               <l>Though whole and new into a body going,</l>
               <l>Are yet, by seeping in, dissolved away,</l>
               <l>Whilst, as through pores, to all the frame there pass</l>

               <l>Sick, sick, and guessing not the cause of ail.</l>
               <l>Yet should he see but that, O chiefly then,</l>

               <l>From regions where the Muses never yet</l>

               <l>Song so pellucid, touching all throughout</l>
               <l>Even with the Muses' charm- which, as 'twould seem,</l>
               <l>Is not without a reasonable ground:</l>
               <l>For as physicians, when they seek to give</l>
               <l>Young boys the nauseous wormwood, first do touch</l>
               <l>The brim around the cup with the sweet juice</l>
               <l>And yellow of the honey, in order that</l>
               <l>The thoughtless age of boyhood be cajoled</l>
               <l>As far as the lips, and meanwhile swallow down</l>
               <l>The wormwood's bitter draught, and, though befooled,</l>

               <l>That mind returns to its primordials,</l>
               <l>Now will I undertake an argument-</l>
               <l>One for these matters of supreme concern-</l>
               <l>That there exist those somewhats which we call</l>
               <l>The images of things: these, like to films</l>
               <l>Scaled off the utmost outside of the things,</l>
               <l>Flit hither and thither through the atmosphere,</l>

               <l>When oft we peer at wonderful strange shapes</l>
               <l>And images of people lorn of light,</l>
               <l>Which oft have horribly roused us when we lay</l>
               <l>In slumber- that haply nevermore may we</l>
               <l>Suppose that souls get loose from <placeName key="tgn,1120946">Acheron</placeName>,</l>
               <l>Or shades go floating in among the living,</l>
               <l>Or aught of us is left behind at death,</l>
               <l>When body and mind, destroyed together, each</l>
               <l>Back to its own primordials goes away.</l>
               <l rend="indent">  And thus I say that effigies of things,</l>
               <l>And tenuous shapes from off the things are sent,</l>
               <l>From off the utmost outside of the things,</l>
               <l>Which are like films or may be named a rind,</l>
               <l>Because the image bears like look and form</l>
               <l>With whatso body has shed it fluttering forth-</l>

            <div type="card" n="54">
               <l>Well learn from this: mainly, because we see</l>
               <l>Even 'mongst visible objects many be</l>
               <l>That send forth bodies, loosely some diffused-</l>
               <l>Like smoke from oaken logs and heat from fires-</l>
               <l>And some more interwoven and condensed-</l>
               <l>As when the locusts in the summertime</l>
               <l>Put off their glossy tunics, or when calves</l>
               <l>At birth drop membranes from their body's surface,</l>
               <l>Or when, again, the slippery serpent doffs</l>
               <l>Its vestments 'mongst the thorns- for oft we see</l>
               <l>The breres augmented with their flying spoils:</l>
               <l>Since such takes place, 'tis likewise certain too</l>
               <l>That tenuous images from things are sent,</l>
               <l>From off the utmost outside of the things.</l>
               <l>For why those kinds should drop and part from things,</l>
               <l>Rather than others tenuous and thin,</l>
               <l>No power has man to open mouth to tell;</l>
               <l>Especially, since on outsides of things</l>
               <l>Are bodies many and minute which could,</l>
               <l>In the same order which they had before,</l>
               <l>And with the figure of their form preserved,</l>
               <l>Be thrown abroad, and much more swiftly too,</l>
               <l>Being less subject to impediments,</l>
               <l>As few in number and placed along the front.</l>
               <l>For truly many things we see discharge</l>
               <l>Their stuff at large, not only from their cores</l>
               <l>Deep-set within, as we have said above,</l>
               <l>But from their surfaces at times no less-</l>
               <l>Their very colours too. And commonly</l>
               <l>The awnings, saffron, red and dusky blue,</l>
               <l>Stretched overhead in mighty theatres,</l>
               <l>Upon their poles and cross-beams fluttering,</l>
               <l>Have such an action quite; for there they dye</l>
               <l>And make to undulate with their every hue</l>
               <l>The circled throng below, and all the stage,</l>
               <l>And rich attire in the patrician seats.</l>
               <l>And ever the more the theatre's dark walls</l>
               <l>Around them shut, the more all things within</l>
               <l>Laugh in the bright suffusion of strange glints,</l>
               <l>The daylight being withdrawn. And therefore, since</l>
               <l>The canvas hangings thus discharge their dye</l>
               <l>From off their surface, things in general must</l>
               <l>Likewise their tenuous effigies discharge,</l>
               <l>Because in either case they are off-thrown</l>
               <l>From off the surface. So there are indeed</l>
               <l>Such certain prints and vestiges of forms</l>
               <l>Which flit around, of subtlest texture made,</l>
               <l>Invisible, when separate, each and one.</l>

            <div type="card" n="90">
               <l>Again, all odour, smoke, and heat, and such</l>
               <l>Streams out of things diffusedly, because,</l>
               <l>Whilst coming from the deeps of body forth</l>
               <l>And rising out, along their bending path</l>
               <l>They're torn asunder, nor have gateways straight</l>
               <l>Wherethrough to mass themselves and struggle abroad.</l>
               <l>But contrariwise, when such a tenuous film</l>
               <l>Of outside colour is thrown off, there's naught</l>
               <l>Can rend it, since 'tis placed along the front</l>
               <l>Ready to hand. Lastly those images</l>
               <l>Which to our eyes in mirrors do appear,</l>
               <l>In water, or in any shining surface,</l>
               <l>Must be, since furnished with like look of things,</l>
               <l>Fashioned from images of things sent out.</l>
               <l>There are, then, tenuous effigies of forms,</l>
               <l>Like unto them, which no one can divine</l>
               <l>When taken singly, which do yet give back,</l>
               <l>When by continued and recurrent discharge</l>
               <l>Expelled, a picture from the mirrors' plane.</l>
               <l>Nor otherwise, it seems, can they be kept</l>
               <l>So well conserved that thus be given back</l>

               <l>From waves of ocean, eater-out of walls</l>
               <l>Around the coasts. Nor ever cease to flit</l>
               <l>The varied voices, sounds athrough the air.</l>
               <l>Then too there comes into the mouth at times</l>
               <l>The wet of a salt taste, when by the sea</l>
               <l>We roam about; and so, whene'er we watch</l>
               <l>The wormword being mixed, its bitter stings.</l>
               <l>To such degree from all things is each thing</l>
               <l>Borne streamingly along, and sent about</l>
               <l>To every region round; and nature grants</l>

               <l>Since 'tis incessantly we feeling have,</l>

               <l>Besides, since shape examined by our hands</l>
               <l>Within the dark is known to be the same</l>
               <l>As that by eyes perceived within the light</l>
               <l>And lustrous day, both touch and sight must be</l>
               <l>By one like cause aroused. So, if we test</l>
               <l>A square and get its stimulus on us</l>
               <l>Within the dark, within the light what square</l>
               <l>Can fall upon our sight, except a square</l>
               <l>That images the things? Wherefore it seems</l>
               <l>The source of seeing is in images,</l>

               <l rend="indent">  Now these same films I name are borne about</l>

               <l>It follows hence that whitherso we turn</l>
               <l>Our sight, all things do strike against it there</l>
               <l>With form and hue. And just how far from us</l>
               <l>Each thing may be away, the image yields</l>
               <l>To us the power to see and chance to tell:</l>
               <l>For when 'tis sent, at once it shoves ahead</l>
               <l>And drives along the air that's in the space</l>
               <l>Betwixt it and our eyes. And thus this air</l>
               <l>All glides athrough our eyeballs, and, as 'twere,</l>
               <l>Brushes athrough our pupils and thuswise</l>
               <l>Passes across. Therefore it comes we see</l>
               <l>How far from us each thing may be away,</l>

               <l>Against our eyes, the farther off removed</l>
               <l>Each thing is seen to be: forsooth, this work</l>
               <l>With mightily swift order all goes on,</l>
               <l>So that upon one instant we may see</l>

               <l>Upon the eyes cannot be singly seen,</l>
               <l>The things themselves may be perceived. For thus</l>
               <l>When the wind beats upon us stroke by stroke</l>
               <l>And when the sharp cold streams, 'tis not our wont</l>
               <l>To feel each private particle of wind</l>
               <l>Or of that cold, but rather all at once;</l>
               <l>And so we see how blows affect our body,</l>
               <l>As if one thing were beating on the same</l>
               <l>And giving us the feel of its own body</l>
               <l>Outside of us. Again, whene'er we thump</l>
               <l>With finger-tip upon a stone, we touch</l>
               <l>But the rock's surface and the outer hue,</l>
               <l>Nor feel that hue by contact- rather feel</l>

               <l>Beyond the house. Also that sight is made</l>
               <l>By a twofold twin air: for first is seen</l>
               <l>The air inside the door-posts; next the doors,</l>
               <l>The twain to left and right; and afterwards</l>

               <l>That we perceive the air ere yet the glass.</l>
               <l>But when we've also seen the glass itself,</l>
               <l>Forthwith that image which from us is borne</l>
               <l>Reaches the glass, and there thrown back again</l>
               <l>Comes back unto our eyes, and driving rolls</l>
               <l>Ahead of itself another air, that then</l>
               <l>'Tis this we see before itself, and thus</l>
               <l>It looks so far removed behind the glass.</l>

               <l>The right part of our members is observed</l>
               <l>Upon the left, because, when comes the image</l>
               <l>Hitting against the level of the glass,</l>
               <l>'Tis not returned unshifted; but forced off</l>

               <l>Each distant angle is perceived obtuse,</l>
               <l>Or rather it is not perceived at all;</l>
               <l>And perishes its blow nor to our gaze</l>
               <l>Arrives its stroke, since through such length of air</l>
               <l>Are borne along the idols that the air</l>
               <l>Makes blunt the idol of the angle's point</l>
               <l>By numerous collidings. When thuswise</l>
               <l>The angles of the tower each and all</l>
               <l>Have quite escaped the sense, the stones appear</l>
               <l>As rubbed and rounded on a turner's wheel-</l>
               <l>Yet not like objects near and truly round,</l>
               <l>But with a semblance to them, shadowily.</l>
               <l>Likewise, our shadow in the sun appears</l>
               <l>To move along and follow our own steps</l>
               <l>And imitate our carriage- if thou thinkest</l>
               <l>Air that is thus bereft of light can walk,</l>
               <l>Following the gait and motion of mankind.</l>
               <l>For what we use to name a shadow, sure</l>
               <l>Is naught but air deprived of light. No marvel:</l>
               <l>Because the earth from spot to spot is reft</l>
               <l>Progressively of light of sun, whenever</l>
               <l>In moving round we get within its way,</l>
               <l>While any spot of earth by us abandoned</l>
               <l>Is filled with light again, on this account</l>
               <l>It comes to pass that what was body's shadow</l>
               <l>Seems still the same to follow after us</l>
               <l>In one straight course. Since, evermore pour in</l>
               <l>New lights of rays, and perish then the old,</l>
               <l>Just like the wool that's drawn into the flame.</l>
               <l>Therefore the earth is easily spoiled of light</l>
               <l>And easily refilled and from herself</l>
               <l>Washeth the black shadows quite away.</l>

               <l>Accuse this touch or shall the nose confute</l>
               <l>Or eyes defeat it? Methinks not so it is:</l>

               <l>How other senses each their things perceive.</l>
               <l rend="indent">  Firstly, a sound and every voice is heard,</l>

               <l>Even voice and sound to be corporeal,</l>
               <l>Because they're able on the sense to strike.</l>
               <l>Besides voice often scrapes against the throat,</l>
               <l>And screams in going out do make more rough</l>
               <l>The wind-pipe- naturally enough, methinks,</l>
               <l>When, through the narrow exit rising up</l>
               <l>In larger throng, these primal germs of voice</l>
               <l>Have thus begun to issue forth. In sooth,</l>

               <l>Consist of elements corporeal,</l>
               <l>With power to pain. Nor art thou unaware</l>

               <l>If 't be outpoured with most exceeding shouts.</l>
               <l>Therefore the voice must be corporeal,</l>
               <l>Since the long talker loses from his frame</l>

               <l>Must too be plainly heard, distinctly marked.</l>
               <l>For then the voice conserves its own formation,</l>
               <l>Conserves its shape. But if the space between</l>

               <l>Firstly, we feel a flavour in the mouth,</l>
               <l>When forth we squeeze it, in chewing up our food,-</l>
               <l>As any one perchance begins to squeeze</l>
               <l>With hand and dry a sponge with water soaked.</l>
               <l>Next, all which forth we squeeze is spread about</l>
               <l>Along the pores and intertwined paths</l>
               <l>Of the loose-textured tongue. And so, when smooth</l>
               <l>The bodies of the oozy flavour, then</l>
               <l>Delightfully they touch, delightfully</l>

               <l>Distribute well digested to the frame</l>

               <l>I will unfold, or wherefore what to some</l>
               <l>Is foul and bitter, yet the same to others</l>
               <l>Can seem delectable to eat,- why here</l>
               <l>So great the distance and the difference is</l>
               <l>That what is food to one to some becomes</l>
               <l>Fierce poison, as a certain snake there is</l>
               <l>Which, touched by spittle of a man, will waste</l>
               <l>And end itself by gnawing up its coil.</l>
               <l>Again, fierce poison is the hellebore</l>
               <l>To us, but puts the fat on goats and quails.</l>
               <l>That thou mayst know by what devices this</l>
               <l>Is brought about, in chief thou must recall</l>
               <l>What we have said before, that seeds are kept</l>
               <l>Commixed in things in divers modes. Again,</l>
               <l>As all the breathing creatures which take food</l>
               <l>Are outwardly unlike, and outer cut</l>
               <l>And contour of their members bounds them round,</l>
               <l>Each differing kind by kind, they thus consist</l>
               <l>Of seeds of varying shape. And furthermore,</l>
               <l>Since seeds do differ, divers too must be</l>
               <l>The interstices and paths (which we do call</l>
               <l>The apertures) in all the members, even</l>
               <l>In mouth and palate too. Thus some must be</l>
               <l>More small or yet more large, three-cornered some</l>
               <l>And others squared, and many others round,</l>
               <l>And certain of them many-angled too</l>
               <l>In many modes. For, as the combination</l>
               <l>And motion of their divers shapes demand,</l>
               <l>The shapes of apertures must be diverse</l>
               <l>And paths must vary according to their walls</l>
               <l>That bound them. Hence when what is sweet to some,</l>
               <l>Becomes to others bitter, for him to whom</l>
               <l>'Tis sweet, the smoothest particles must needs</l>
               <l>Have entered caressingly the palate's pores.</l>
               <l>And, contrariwise, with those to whom that sweet</l>
               <l>Is sour within the mouth, beyond a doubt</l>
               <l>The rough and barbed particles have got</l>
               <l>Into the narrows of the apertures.</l>

               <l>There the whole frame is now upset, and there</l>
               <l>All the positions of the seeds are changed,-</l>
               <l>So that the bodies which before were fit</l>
               <l>To cause the savour, now are fit no more,</l>
               <l>And now more apt are others which be able</l>

               <l>May roll along, and we're constrained to think</l>

               <l>One odour is more apt, to others another-</l>

               <l>Thus on and on along the zephyrs bees</l>
               <l>Are led by odour of honey, vultures too</l>
               <l>By carcasses. Again, the forward power</l>
               <l>Of scent in dogs doth lead the hunter on</l>
               <l>Whithersoever the splay-foot of wild beast</l>

               <l>The saviour of the Roman citadel,</l>
               <l>Forescents afar the odour of mankind.</l>
               <l>Thus, diversly to divers ones is given</l>
               <l>Peculiar smell that leadeth each along</l>
               <l>To his own food or makes him start aback</l>
               <l>From loathsome poison, and in this wise are</l>

               <l>Bethink themselves of flight, because, ye see,</l>
               <l>Within the body of the cocks there be</l>
               <l>Some certain seeds, which, into lions' eyes</l>

               <l>Either because they do not penetrate,</l>
               <l>Or since they have free exit from the eyes</l>

               <l>Easily into all the winds of air;-</l>
               <l>And first, because from deep inside the thing</l>
               <l>It is discharged with labour (for the fact</l>
               <l>That every object, when 'tis shivered, ground,</l>
               <l>Or crumbled by the fire, will smell the stronger</l>
               <l>Is sign that odours flow and part away</l>
               <l>From inner regions of the things). And next,</l>
               <l>Thou mayest see that odour is create</l>
               <l>Of larger primal germs than voice, because</l>
               <l>It enters not through stony walls, wherethrough</l>
               <l>Unfailingly the voice and sound are borne;</l>

               <l>So easy to trace out in whatso place</l>
               <l>The smelling object is. For, dallying on</l>
               <l>Along the winds, the particles cool off,</l>
               <l>And then the scurrying messengers of things</l>

               <l>The subtle nature of mind and smite the sense.</l>
               <l>Thus, Centaurs and the limbs of Scyllas, thus</l>
               <l>The Cerberus-visages of dogs we see,</l>
               <l>And images of people gone before-</l>
               <l>Dead men whose bones earth bosomed long ago;</l>
               <l>Because the images of every kind</l>
               <l>Are everywhere about us borne- in part</l>
               <l>Those which are gendered in the very air</l>
               <l>Of own accord, in part those others which</l>
               <l>From divers things do part away, and those</l>
               <l>Which are compounded, made from out their shapes.</l>
               <l>For soothly from no living Centaur is</l>
               <l>That phantom gendered, since no breed of beast</l>
               <l>Like him was ever; but, when images</l>
               <l>Of horse and man by chance have come together,</l>
               <l>They easily cohere, as aforesaid,</l>
               <l>At once, through subtle nature and fabric thin.</l>
               <l>In the same fashion others of this ilk</l>
               <l>Created are. And when they're quickly borne</l>
               <l>In their exceeding lightness, easily</l>
               <l>(As earlier I showed) one subtle image,</l>
               <l>Compounded, moves by its one blow the mind,</l>
               <l>Itself so subtle and so strangely quick.</l>
               <l rend="indent">  That these things come to pass as I record,</l>
               <l>From this thou easily canst understand:</l>
               <l>So far as one is unto other like,</l>
               <l>Seeing with mind as well as with the eyes</l>
               <l>Must come to pass in fashion not unlike.</l>
               <l>Well, now, since I have shown that I perceive</l>
               <l>Haply a lion through those idol-films</l>
               <l>Such as assail my eyes, 'tis thine to know</l>
               <l>Also the mind is in like manner moved,</l>
               <l>And sees, nor more nor less than eyes do see</l>
               <l>(Except that it perceives more subtle films)</l>
               <l>The lion and aught else through idol-films.</l>
               <l>And when the sleep has overset our frame,</l>
               <l>The mind's intelligence is now awake,</l>
               <l>Still for no other reason, save that these-</l>
               <l>The self-same films as when we are awake-</l>
               <l>Assail our minds, to such degree indeed</l>
               <l>That we do seem to see for sure the man</l>
               <l>Whom, void of life, now death and earth have gained</l>
               <l>Dominion over. And nature forces this</l>
               <l>To come to pass because the body's senses</l>
               <l>Are resting, thwarted through the members all,</l>
               <l>Unable now to conquer false with true;</l>
               <l>And memory lies prone and languishes</l>
               <l>In slumber, nor protests that he, the man</l>
               <l>Whom the mind feigns to see alive, long since</l>
               <l>Hath been the gain of death and dissolution.</l>
               <l rend="indent">  And further, 'tis no marvel idols move</l>
               <l>And toss their arms and other members round</l>
               <l>In rhythmic time- and often in men's sleeps</l>
               <l>It haps an image this is seen to do;</l>
               <l>In sooth, when perishes the former image,</l>
               <l>And other is gendered of another pose,</l>
               <l>That former seemeth to have changed its gestures.</l>
               <l>Of course the change must be conceived as speedy;</l>
               <l>So great the swiftness and so great the store</l>
               <l>Of idol-things, and (in an instant brief</l>

               <l>Sometimes an image not of kind the same;</l>

               <l>Is seen to stand there, altered into male;</l>

               <l>And much, illumination- if we crave</l>
               <l>With plainness to exhibit facts. And first,</l>
               <l>Why doth the mind of one to whom the whim</l>
               <l>To think has come behold forthwith that thing?</l>
               <l>Or do the idols watch upon our will,</l>
               <l>And doth an image unto us occur,</l>
               <l>Directly we desire- if heart prefer</l>
               <l>The sea, the land, or after all the sky?</l>

               <l>Another's mind is meditating things</l>
               <l>All far unlike. And what, again, of this:</l>
               <l>When we in sleep behold the idols step,</l>
               <l>In measure, forward, moving supple limbs,</l>
               <l>Whilst forth they put each supple arm in turn</l>
               <l>With speedy motion, and with eyeing heads</l>
               <l>Repeat the movement, as the foot keeps time?</l>
               <l>Forsooth, the idols they are steeped in art,</l>
               <l>And wander to and fro well taught indeed,-</l>
               <l>Thus to be able in the time of night</l>
               <l>To make such games! Or will the truth be this:</l>
               <l>Because in one least moment that we mark-</l>
               <l>That is, the uttering of a single sound-</l>
               <l>There lurk yet many moments, which the reason</l>
               <l>Discovers to exist, therefore it comes</l>
               <l>That, in a moment how so brief ye will,</l>
               <l>The divers idols are hard by, and ready</l>
               <l>Each in its place diverse? So great the swiftness,</l>
               <l>So great, again, the store of idol-things,</l>

               <l>The former seemeth to have changed its gestures.</l>
               <l>And since they be so tenuous, mind can mark</l>
               <l>Sharply alone the ones it strains to see;</l>
               <l>And thus the rest do perish one and all,</l>
               <l>Save those for which the mind prepares itself.</l>
               <l>Further, it doth prepare itself indeed,</l>
               <l>And hopes to see what follows after each-</l>
               <l>Hence this result. For hast thou not observed</l>
               <l>How eyes, essaying to perceive the fine,</l>

               <l>We crave that thou wilt passionately flee</l>
               <l>The one offence, and anxiously wilt shun</l>
               <l>The error of presuming the clear lights</l>
               <l>Of eyes created were that we might see;</l>
               <l>Or thighs and knees, aprop upon the feet,</l>
               <l>Thuswise can bended be, that we might step</l>
               <l>With goodly strides ahead; or forearms joined</l>
               <l>Unto the sturdy uppers, or serving hands</l>
               <l>On either side were given, that we might do</l>
               <l>Life's own demands. All such interpretation</l>
               <l>Is aft-for-fore with inverse reasoning,</l>
               <l>Since naught is born in body so that we</l>
               <l>May use the same, but birth engenders use:</l>
               <l>No seeing ere the lights of eyes were born,</l>
               <l>No speaking ere the tongue created was;</l>
               <l>But origin of tongue came long before</l>
               <l>Discourse of words, and ears created were</l>
               <l>Much earlier than any sound was heard;</l>
               <l>And all the members, so meseems, were there</l>
               <l>Before they got their use: and therefore, they</l>
               <l>Could not be gendered for the sake of use.</l>
               <l>But contrariwise, contending in the fight</l>
               <l>With hand to hand, and rending of the joints,</l>
               <l>And fouling of the limbs with gore, was there,</l>
               <l>O long before the gleaming spears ere flew;</l>
               <l>And nature prompted man to shun a wound,</l>
               <l>Before the left arm by the aid of art</l>
               <l>Opposed the shielding targe. And, verily,</l>
               <l>Yielding the weary body to repose,</l>
               <l>Far ancienter than cushions of soft beds,</l>
               <l>And quenching thirst is earlier than cups.</l>
               <l>These objects, therefore, which for use and life</l>
               <l>Have been devised, can be conceived as found</l>
               <l>For sake of using. But apart from such</l>
               <l>Are all which first were born and afterwards</l>
               <l>Gave knowledge of their own utility-</l>
               <l>Chief in which sort we note the senses, limbs:</l>
               <l>Wherefore, again, 'tis quite beyond thy power</l>

               <l>The liquid on arriving dissipates</l>
               <l>And quenches like a fire, that parching heat</l>

               <l>Comes on and penetrates aboundingly</l>

               <l>Whatever its momentum, and one helm</l>
               <l>Whirls it around, whither ye please; and loads,</l>

               <l>In sooth, where no one part of soul remained</l>
               <l>Lurking among the members, even as fire</l>
               <l>Lurks buried under many ashes, whence</l>
               <l>Could sense amain rekindled be in members,</l>
               <l>As flame can rise anew from unseen fire?</l>

               <l rend="indent">  By what devices this strange state and new</l>
               <l>May be occasioned, and by what the soul</l>
               <l>Can be confounded and the frame grow faint,</l>
               <l>I will untangle: see to it, thou, that I</l>
               <l>Pour forth my words not unto empty winds.</l>
               <l>In first place, body on its outer parts-</l>
               <l>Since these are touched by neighbouring aery gusts-</l>
               <l>Must there be thumped and strook by blows of air</l>
               <l>Repeatedly. And therefore almost all</l>
               <l>Are covered either with hides, or else with shells,</l>
               <l>Or with the horny callus, or with bark.</l>
               <l>Yet this same air lashes their inner parts,</l>
               <l>When creatures draw a breath or blow it out.</l>
               <l>Wherefore, since body thus is flogged alike</l>
               <l>Upon the inside and the out, and blows</l>
               <l>Come in upon us through the little pores</l>
               <l>Even inward to our body's primal parts</l>
               <l>And primal elements, there comes to pass</l>
               <l>By slow degrees, along our members then,</l>
               <l>A kind of overthrow; for then confounded</l>
               <l>Are those arrangements of the primal germs</l>
               <l>Of body and of mind. It comes to pass</l>
               <l>That next a part of soul's expelled abroad,</l>
               <l>A part retreateth in recesses hid,</l>
               <l>A part, too, scattered all about the frame,</l>
               <l>Cannot become united nor engage</l>
               <l>In interchange of motion. Nature now</l>
               <l>So hedges off approaches and the paths;</l>
               <l>And thus the sense, its motions all deranged,</l>
               <l>Retires down deep within; and since there's naught,</l>
               <l>As 'twere, to prop the frame, the body weakens,</l>
               <l>And all the members languish, and the arms</l>
               <l>And eyelids fall, and, as ye lie abed,</l>
               <l>Even there the houghs will sag and loose their powers.</l>
               <l>Again, sleep follows after food, because</l>
               <l>The food produces same result as air,</l>
               <l>Whilst being scattered round through all the veins;</l>
               <l>And much the heaviest is that slumber which,</l>
               <l>Full or fatigued, thou takest; since 'tis then</l>
               <l>That the most bodies disarrange themselves,</l>
               <l>Bruised by labours hard. And in same wise,</l>
               <l>This three-fold change: a forcing of the soul</l>
               <l>Down deeper, more a casting-forth of it,</l>
               <l>A moving more divided in its parts</l>

               <l>They'd caught the scented foot-prints of wild beasts,</l>

               <l>Many amid their slumbers talk about</l>
               <l>Their mighty enterprises, and have often</l>
               <l>Enough become the proof of their own crimes.</l>
               <l>Many meet death; many, as if headlong</l>
               <l>From lofty mountains tumbling down to earth</l>
               <l>With all their frame, are frenzied in their fright;</l>
               <l>And after sleep, as if still mad in mind,</l>
               <l>They scarce come to, confounded as they are</l>
               <l>By ferment of their frame. The thirsty man,</l>
               <l>Likewise, he sits beside delightful spring</l>
               <l>Or river and gulpeth down with gaping throat</l>
               <l>Nigh the whole stream. And oft the innocent young,</l>
               <l>By sleep o'ermastered, think they lift their dress</l>
               <l>By pail or public jordan and then void</l>
               <l>The water filtered down their frame entire</l>
               <l>And drench the Babylonian coverlets,</l>
               <l>Magnificently bright. Again, those males</l>

               <l>And that, moreover, another air above</l>
               <l>Streams on athwart the top of the sphere and tends</l>
               <l>In same direction as are rolled along</l>

               <l>This only do I show, and follow on</l>

               <l>Even several causes which 'tis possible</l>

               <l>That sun, in winding onward, takes a year,</l>
               <l>Illumining the sky and all the lands</l>
               <l>With oblique light- as men declare to us</l>
               <l>Who by their diagrams have charted well</l>
               <l>Those regions of the sky which be adorned</l>
               <l>With the arranged signs of Zodiac.</l>
               <l>Or else, because in certain parts the air</l>
               <l>Under the lands is denser, the tremulous</l>
               <l>Bright beams of fire do waver tardily,</l>
               <l>Nor easily can penetrate that air</l>
               <l>Nor yet emerge unto their rising-place:</l>
               <l>For this it is that nights in winter time</l>
               <l>Do linger long, ere comes the many-rayed</l>
               <l>Round Badge of the day. Or else because, as said,</l>
               <l>In alternating seasons of the year</l>
               <l>Fires, now more quick, and now more slow, are wont</l>
               <l>To stream together,- the fires which make the sun</l>
               <l>To rise in some one spot- therefore it is</l>

               <l>In the beginning, earth gave forth, around</l>

               <l>The race of grasses and the shining green;</l>

               <l>With greening colour, and thereafter, lo,</l>
               <l>Unto the divers kinds of trees was given</l>

               <l>Obtained with never labours of their own,</l>

               <l>Beasts quite unfit by own free will to thrive</l>

               <l>In thanks for which we should permit their kind</l>

               <l>Those, of a truth, were wont to be exposed,</l>

               <l>Such beings could have been engendered</l>
               <l>When earth was new and the young sky was fresh</l>

               <l>Not then were sturdy guiders of curved ploughs,</l>

               <l>Produced, enough for those poor wretches there.</l>

               <l>The thirsty generations of the wild.</l>

               <l>The dripping rocks, and trickled from above</l>
               <l>Over the verdant moss; and here and there</l>
               <l>Welled up and burst across the open flats.</l>
               <l>As yet they knew not to enkindle fire</l>
               <l>Against the cold, nor hairy pelts to use</l>
               <l>And clothe their bodies with the spoils of beasts;</l>

               <l>O'ertaken, they would throw, like bristly boars,</l>
               <l>Their wildman's limbs naked upon the earth,</l>
               <l>Rolling themselves in leaves and fronded boughs.</l>

               <l>Quaking and wand'ring in shadows of the night;</l>
               <l>But, silent and buried in a sleep, they'd wait</l>
               <l>Until the sun with rosy flambeau brought</l>
               <l>The glory to the sky. From childhood wont</l>

               <l>In times alternate, never might they be</l>

               <l>Eternal should possess the lands, with light</l>

               <l>Of boar, the spumy-lipped, or lion strong,</l>

               <l>With claws and paws and bites are at the fray</l>
               <l>Already, when their teeth and claws be scarce</l>
               <l>As yet engendered. So again, we see</l>
               <l>All breeds of winged creatures trust to wings</l>
               <l>And from their fledgling pinions seek to get</l>
               <l>A fluttering assistance. Thus, to think</l>
               <l>That in those days some man apportioned round</l>
               <l>To things their names, and that from him men learned</l>
               <l>Their first nomenclature, is foolery.</l>
               <l>For why could he mark everything by words</l>
               <l>And utter the various sounds of tongue, what time</l>
               <l>The rest may be supposed powerless</l>
               <l>To do the same? And, if the rest had not</l>
               <l>Already one with other used words,</l>
               <l>Whence was implanted in the teacher, then,</l>
               <l>Fore-knowledge of their use, and whence was given</l>
               <l>To him alone primordial faculty</l>
               <l>To know and see in mind what 'twas he willed?</l>
               <l>Besides, one only man could scarce subdue</l>
               <l>An overmastered multitude to choose</l>
               <l>To get by heart his names of things. A task</l>
               <l>Not easy 'tis in any wise to teach</l>
               <l>And to persuade the deaf concerning what</l>
               <l>'Tis needful for to do. For ne'er would they</l>
               <l>Allow, nor ne'er in anywise endure</l>
               <l>Perpetual vain dingdong in their ears</l>
               <l>Of spoken sounds unheard before. And what,</l>
               <l>At last, in this affair so wondrous is,</l>
               <l>That human race (in whom a voice and tongue</l>
               <l>Were now in vigour) should by divers words</l>
               <l>Denote its objects, as each divers sense</l>
               <l>Might prompt?- since even the speechless herds, aye, since</l>
               <l>The very generations of wild beasts</l>
               <l>Are wont dissimilar and divers sounds</l>
               <l>To rouse from in them, when there's fear or pain,</l>
               <l>And when they burst with joys. And this, forsooth,</l>
               <l>'Tis thine to know from plainest facts: when first</l>
               <l>Huge flabby jowls of mad Molossian hounds,</l>
               <l>Baring their hard white teeth, begin to snarl,</l>
               <l>They threaten, with infuriate lips peeled back,</l>
               <l>In sounds far other than with which they bark</l>
               <l>And fill with voices all the regions round.</l>
               <l>And when with fondling tongue they start to lick</l>
               <l>Their puppies, or do toss them round with paws,</l>
               <l>Feigning with gentle bites to gape and snap,</l>
               <l>They fawn with yelps of voice far other then</l>
               <l>Than when, alone within the house, they bay,</l>
               <l>Or whimpering slink with cringing sides from blows.</l>
               <l>Again the neighing of the horse, is that</l>
               <l>Not seen to differ likewise, when the stud</l>
               <l>In buoyant flower of his young years raves,</l>
               <l>Goaded by winged Love, amongst the mares,</l>
               <l>And when with widening nostrils out he snorts</l>
               <l>The call to battle, and when haply he</l>
               <l>Whinnies at times with terror-quaking limbs?</l>
               <l>Lastly, the flying race, the dappled birds,</l>
               <l>Hawks, ospreys, sea-gulls, searching food and life</l>
               <l>Amid the ocean billows in the brine,</l>
               <l>Utter at other times far other cries</l>
               <l>Than when they fight for food, or with their prey</l>
               <l>Struggle and strain. And birds there are which change</l>
               <l>With changing weather their own raucous songs-</l>
               <l>As long-lived generations of the crows</l>
               <l>Or flocks of rooks, when they be said to cry</l>
               <l>For rain and water and to call at times</l>
               <l>For winds and gales. Ergo, if divers moods</l>
               <l>Compel the brutes, though speechless evermore,</l>
               <l>To send forth divers sounds, O truly then</l>
               <l>How much more likely 'twere that mortal men</l>
               <l>In those days could with many a different sound</l>
               <l>Denote each separate thing.</l>

               <l>The conflagrations burned the forest trees</l>

               <l>Of lightning from the sky, or else because</l>
               <l>Men, warring in the woodlands, on their foes</l>
               <l>Had hurled fire to frighten and dismay,</l>
               <l>Or yet because, by goodness of the soil</l>

               <l>Howso the fact, and from what cause soever</l>
               <l>The flamy heat with awful crack and roar</l>
               <l>Had there devoured to their deepest roots</l>
               <l>The forest trees and baked the earth with fire,</l>
               <l>Then from the boiling veins began to ooze</l>
               <l>O rivulets of silver and of gold,</l>
               <l>Of lead and copper too, collecting soon</l>
               <l>Into the hollow places of the ground.</l>
               <l>And when men saw the cooled lumps anon</l>

               <l>Much taken with that lustrous smooth delight,</l>
               <l>They 'gan to pry them out, and saw how each</l>
               <l>Had got a shape like to its earthy mould.</l>
               <l>Then would it enter their heads how these same lumps,</l>
               <l>If melted by heat, could into any form</l>
               <l>Or figure of things be run, and how, again,</l>
               <l>If hammered out, they could be nicely drawn</l>
               <l>To sharpest points or finest edge, and thus</l>
               <l>Yield to the forgers tools and give them power</l>
               <l>To chop the forest down, to hew the logs,</l>
               <l>To shave the beams and planks, besides to bore</l>
               <l>And punch and drill. And men began such work</l>
               <l>At first as much with tools of silver and gold</l>
               <l>As with the impetuous strength of the stout copper;</l>

               <l>Would soon give way, unable to endure,</l>
               <l>Like copper, such hard labour. In those days</l>
               <l>Copper it was that was the thing of price;</l>

               <l>Now lies the copper low, and gold hath come</l>

               <l>Which needs of man most urgently require</l>
               <l>Was ready to hand for mortals, and that life,</l>
               <l>As far as might be, was established safe,</l>
               <l>That men were lords in riches, honour, praise,</l>
               <l>And eminent in goodly fame of sons,</l>

               <l>And raved perforce with angry plaints, then he,</l>

               <l>However wholesome, which from here or there</l>
               <l>Was gathered into it, was by that bane</l>
               <l>Spoilt from within,- in part, because he saw</l>
               <l>The vessel so cracked and leaky that nowise</l>

               <l>Had destined; and from out what gates a man</l>
               <l>Should sally to each combat. And he proved</l>
               <l>That mostly vainly doth the human race</l>
               <l>Roll in its bosom the grim waves of care.</l>

               <l>In following wise all things seem oft to quake</l>
               <l>At shock of heavy thunder, and mightiest walls</l>
               <l>Of the wide reaches of the upper world</l>
               <l>There on the instant to have sprung apart,</l>
               <l>Riven asunder, what time a gathered blast</l>
               <l>Of the fierce hurricane hath all at once</l>
               <l>Twisted its way into a mass of clouds,</l>
               <l>And, there enclosed, ever more and more</l>
               <l>Compelleth by its spinning whirl the cloud</l>
               <l>To grow all hollow with a thickened crust</l>
               <l>Surrounding; for thereafter, when the force</l>
               <l>And the keen onset of the wind have weakened</l>
               <l>That crust, lo, then the cloud, to-split in twain,</l>
               <l>Gives forth a hideous crash with bang and boom.</l>
               <l>No marvel this; since oft a bladder small,</l>
               <l>Filled up with air, will, when of sudden burst,</l>
               <l>Give forth a like large sound.</l>
               <l rend="indent">                             There's reason, too,</l>
               <l>Why clouds make sounds, as through them blow the winds:</l>
               <l>We see, borne down the sky, oft shapes of clouds</l>
               <l>Rough-edged or branched many forky ways;</l>
               <l>And 'tis the same, as when the sudden flaws</l>
               <l>Of north-west wind through the dense forest blow,</l>
               <l>Making the leaves to sough and limbs to crash.</l>
               <l>It happens too at times that roused force</l>
               <l>Of the fierce hurricane to-rends the cloud,</l>
               <l>Breaking right through it by a front assault;</l>
               <l>For what a blast of wind may do up there</l>
               <l>Is manifest from facts when here on earth</l>
               <l>A blast more gentle yet uptwists tall trees</l>
               <l>And sucks them madly from their deepest roots.</l>
               <l>Besides, among the clouds are waves, and these</l>
               <l>Give, as they roughly break, a rumbling roar;</l>
               <l>As when along deep streams or the great sea</l>
               <l>Breaks the loud surf. It happens, too, whenever</l>
               <l>Out from one cloud into another falls</l>
               <l>The fiery energy of thunderbolt,</l>
               <l>That straightaway the cloud, if full of wet,</l>
               <l>Extinguishes the fire with mighty noise;</l>
               <l>As iron, white from the hot furnaces,</l>
               <l>Sizzles, when speedily we've plunged its glow</l>
               <l>Down the cold water. Further, if a cloud</l>
               <l>More dry receive the fire, 'twill suddenly</l>
               <l>Kindle to flame and burn with monstrous sound,</l>
               <l>As if a flame with whirl of winds should range</l>
               <l>Along the laurel-tressed mountains far,</l>
               <l>Upburning with its vast assault those trees;</l>
               <l>Nor is there aught that in the crackling flame</l>
               <l>Consumes with sound more terrible to man</l>
               <l>Than Delphic laurel of Apollo lord.</l>
               <l>Oft, too, the multitudinous crash of ice</l>
               <l>And down-pour of swift hail gives forth a sound</l>
               <l>Among the mighty clouds on high; for when</l>
               <l>The wind hath packed them close, each mountain mass</l>
               <l>Of rain-cloud, there congealed utterly</l>

               <l>Likewise, it lightens, when the clouds have struck,</l>

               <l>As if a stone should smite a stone or steel,</l>

               <l>At same time with the fire and by same cause,</l>
               <l>Born of the same collision.</l>

               <l>The clouds suffuse with leaping light the lands,</l>
               <l>And the storm flashes with tremulous elan:</l>
               <l>When the wind hath invaded a cloud, and, whirling there,</l>
               <l>Hath wrought (as I have shown above) the cloud</l>
               <l>Into a hollow with a thickened crust,</l>

               <l>Hath split black cloud, it scatters the fire-seeds,</l>
               <l>Which, so to say, have been pressed out by force</l>

               <l>As know thou mayst- at times when clouds are dense</l>
               <l>And one upon the other piled aloft</l>

               <l>Deceived because we see how broad their base</l>

               <l>For make thine observations at a time</l>
               <l>When winds shall bear athwart the horizon's blue</l>
               <l>Clouds like to mountain-ranges moving on,</l>

               <l>Canst view their caverns, as if builded there</l>
               <l>Of beetling crags; which, when the hurricanes</l>
               <l>In gathered storm have filled utterly,</l>
               <l>Then, prisoned in clouds, they rave around</l>
               <l>With mighty roarings, and within those dens</l>
               <l>Bluster like savage beasts, and now from here,</l>
               <l>And now from there, send growlings through the clouds,</l>
               <l>And seeking an outlet, whirl themselves about,</l>
               <l>And roll from 'mid the clouds the seeds of fire,</l>
               <l>And heap them multitudinously there,</l>
               <l>And in the hollow furnaces within</l>
               <l>Wheel flame around, until from bursted cloud</l>

               <l>That yon swift golden hue of liquid fire</l>
               <l>Darts downward to the earth: because the clouds</l>
               <l>Themselves must hold abundant seeds of fire;</l>
               <l>For, when they be without all moisture, then</l>
               <l>They be for most part of a flamy hue</l>

               <l>And therefore, when the wind hath driven and thrust,</l>

               <l>Likewise, it lightens also when the clouds</l>

               <l>And breaketh asunder as they move, those seeds</l>
               <l>Which make the lightnings must by nature fall;</l>
               <l>At such an hour the horizon lightens round</l>
               <l>Without the hideous terror of dread noise</l>

               <l>It loseth many bodies of stark cold</l>
               <l>And taketh into itself along the air</l>
               <l>New particles of fire. It happens, too,</l>

               <l>No marvel, because, when with terrific stroke</l>
               <l>'Thas smitten, the elements of fiery-stuff</l>
               <l>Can stream together from out the very wind</l>

               <l rend="indent">  And, now, the speed and stroke of thunderbolt</l>
               <l>Is so tremendous, and with glide so swift</l>
               <l>Those thunderbolts rush on and down, because</l>
               <l>Their roused force itself collects itself</l>
               <l>First always in the clouds, and then prepares</l>
               <l>For the huge effort of their going-forth;</l>
               <l>Next, when the cloud no longer can retain</l>
               <l>The increment of their fierce impetus,</l>
               <l>Their force is pressed out, and therefore flies</l>
               <l>With impetus so wondrous, like to shots</l>
               <l>Hurled from the powerful Roman catapults.</l>
               <l>Note, too, this force consists of elements</l>
               <l>Both small and smooth, nor is there aught that can</l>
               <l>With ease resist such nature. For it darts</l>
               <l>Between and enters through the pores of things;</l>
               <l>And so it never falters in delay</l>
               <l>Despite innumerable collisions, but</l>
               <l>Flies shooting onward with a swift elan.</l>
               <l>Next, since by nature always every weight</l>
               <l>Bears downward, doubled is the swiftness then</l>
               <l>And that elan is still more wild and dread,</l>
               <l>When, verily, to weight are added blows,</l>
               <l>So that more madly and more fiercely then</l>
               <l>The thunderbolt shakes into shivers all</l>
               <l>That blocks its path, following on its way.</l>
               <l>Then, too, because it comes along, along</l>
               <l>With one continuing elan, it must</l>
               <l>Take on velocity anew, anew,</l>
               <l>Which still increases as it goes, and ever</l>
               <l>Augments the bolt's vast powers and to the blow</l>
               <l>Gives larger vigour; for it forces all,</l>
               <l>All of the thunder's seeds of fire, to sweep</l>
               <l>In a straight line unto one place, as 'twere,-</l>
               <l>Casting them one by other, as they roll,</l>
               <l>Into that onward course. Again, perchance,</l>
               <l>In coming along, it pulls from out the air</l>
               <l>Some certain bodies, which by their own blows</l>
               <l>Enkindle its velocity. And, lo,</l>
               <l>It comes through objects leaving them unharmed,</l>
               <l>It goes through many things and leaves them whole,</l>
               <l>Because the liquid fire flieth along</l>
               <l>Athrough their pores. And much it does transfix,</l>
               <l>When these primordial atoms of the bolt</l>
               <l>Have fallen upon the atoms of these things</l>
               <l>Precisely where the intertwined atoms</l>
               <l>Are held together. And, further, easily</l>
               <l>Brass it unbinds and quickly fuseth gold,</l>
               <l>Because its force is so minutely made</l>
               <l>Of tiny parts and elements so smooth</l>
               <l>That easily they wind their way within,</l>
               <l>And, when once in, quickly unbind all knots</l>

               <l>With the thick darkness of swart cloud, because</l>
               <l>When first the mists do form, ere ever the eyes</l>
               <l>Can there behold them (tenuous as they be),</l>
               <l>The carrier-winds will drive them up and on</l>
               <l>Unto the topmost summits of the mountain;</l>
               <l>And then at last it happens, when they be</l>
               <l>In vaster throng upgathered, that they can</l>
               <l>By this very condensation lie revealed,</l>
               <l>And that at same time they are seen to surge</l>
               <l>From very vertex of the mountain up</l>
               <l>Into far ether. For very fact and feeling,</l>
               <l>As we up-climb high mountains, proveth clear</l>
               <l>That windy are those upward regions free.</l>

               <l>Besides, the clothes hung-out along the shore,</l>
               <l>When in they take the clinging moisture, prove</l>
               <l>That nature lifts from over all the sea</l>
               <l>Unnumbered particles. Whereby the more</l>
               <l>'Tis manifest that many particles</l>
               <l>Even from the salt upheavings of the main</l>

               <l>Of massed clouds. For moistures in these twain</l>
               <l>Are near akin. Besides, from out all rivers,</l>
               <l>As well as from the land itself, we see</l>
               <l>Up-rising mists and steam, which like a breath</l>
               <l>Are forced out from them and borne aloft,</l>
               <l>To curtain heaven with their murk, and make,</l>
               <l>By slow foregathering, the skiey clouds.</l>
               <l>For, in addition, lo, the heat on high</l>
               <l>Of constellated ether burdens down</l>
               <l>Upon them, and by sort of condensation</l>
               <l>Weaveth beneath the azure firmament</l>
               <l>The reek of darkling cloud. It happens, too,</l>
               <l>That hither to the skies from the Beyond</l>
               <l>Do come those particles which make the clouds</l>
               <l>And flying thunderheads. For I have taught</l>
               <l>That this their number is innumerable</l>
               <l>And infinite the sum of the Abyss,</l>
               <l>And I have shown with what stupendous speed</l>

               <l>From out all things, and that they both increase-</l>
               <l>Both clouds and water which is in the clouds-</l>
               <l>In like proportion, as our frames increase</l>

               <l>As sweat or any moisture in our members.</l>
               <l>Besides, the clouds take in from time to time</l>
               <l>Much moisture risen from the broad marine,-</l>
               <l>Whilst the winds bear them o'er the mighty sea,</l>
               <l>Like hanging fleeces of white wool. Thuswise,</l>
               <l>Even from all rivers is there lifted up</l>
               <l>Moisture into the clouds. And when therein</l>
               <l>The seeds of water so many in many ways</l>
               <l>Have come together, augmented from all sides,</l>
               <l>The close-jammed clouds then struggle to discharge</l>
               <l>Their rain-storms for a two-fold reason: lo,</l>
               <l>The wind's force crowds them, and the very excess</l>
               <l>Of storm-clouds (massed in a vaster throng)</l>
               <l>Giveth an urge and pressure from above</l>
               <l>And makes the rains out-pour. Besides when, too,</l>
               <l>The clouds are winnowed by the winds, or scattered</l>
               <l>Smitten on top by heat of sun, they send</l>
               <l>Their rainy moisture, and distil their drops,</l>

               <l>Both by their cumulated mass and by</l>

               <l>Now come, and what the law of earthquakes is</l>
               <l>Hearken, and first of all take care to know</l>
               <l>That the under-earth, like to the earth around us,</l>
               <l>Is full of windy caverns all about;</l>
               <l>And many a pool and many a grim abyss</l>
               <l>She bears within her bosom, ay, and cliffs</l>
               <l>And jagged scarps; and many a river, hid</l>
               <l>Beneath her chine, rolls rapidly along</l>
               <l>Its billows and plunging boulders. For clear fact</l>
               <l>Requires that earth must be in every part</l>
               <l>Alike in constitution. Therefore, earth,</l>
               <l>With these things underneath affixed and set,</l>
               <l>Trembleth above, jarred by big down-tumblings,</l>
               <l>When time hath undermined the huge caves,</l>
               <l>The subterranean. Yea, whole mountains fall,</l>
               <l>And instantly from spot of that big jar</l>
               <l>There quiver the tremors far and wide abroad.</l>
               <l>And with good reason: since houses on the street</l>
               <l>Begin to quake throughout, when jarred by a cart</l>
               <l>Of no large weight; and, too, the furniture</l>
               <l>Within the house up-bounds, when a paving-block</l>
               <l>Gives either iron rim of the wheels a jolt.</l>
               <l>It happens, too, when some prodigious bulk</l>
               <l>Of age-worn soil is rolled from mountain slopes</l>
               <l>Into tremendous pools of water dark,</l>
               <l>That the reeling land itself is rocked about</l>
               <l>By the water's undulations; as a basin</l>
               <l>Sometimes won't come to rest until the fluid</l>

               <l>When subterranean winds, up-gathered there</l>
               <l>In the hollow deeps, bulk forward from one spot,</l>
               <l>And press with the big urge of mighty powers</l>
               <l>Against the lofty grottos, then the earth</l>
               <l>Bulks to that quarter whither push amain</l>
               <l>The headlong winds. Then all the builded houses</l>
               <l>Above ground- and the more, the higher up-reared</l>
               <l>Unto the sky- lean ominously, careening</l>
               <l>Into the same direction; and the beams,</l>
               <l>Wrenched forward, over-hang, ready to go.</l>
               <l>Yet dread men to believe that there awaits</l>
               <l>The nature of the mighty world a time</l>
               <l>Of doom and cataclysm, albeit they see</l>
               <l>So great a bulk of lands to bulge and break!</l>
               <l>And lest the winds blew back again, no force</l>
               <l>Could rein things in nor hold from sure career</l>
               <l>On to disaster. But now because those winds</l>
               <l>Blow back and forth in alternation strong,</l>
               <l>And, so to say, rallying charge again,</l>
               <l>And then repulsed retreat, on this account</l>
               <l>Earth oftener threatens than she brings to pass</l>
               <l>Collapses dire. For to one side she leans,</l>
               <l>Then back she sways; and after tottering</l>
               <l>Forward, recovers then her seats of poise.</l>
               <l>Thus, this is why whole houses rock, the roofs</l>
               <l>More than the middle stories, middle more</l>
               <l>Than lowest, and the lowest least of all.</l>

               <l rend="indent">  In chief, men marvel nature renders not</l>
               <l>Bigger and bigger the bulk of ocean, since</l>
               <l>So vast the down-rush of the waters be,</l>
               <l>And every river out of every realm</l>
               <l>Cometh thereto; and add the random rains</l>
               <l>And flying tempests, which spatter every sea</l>
               <l>And every land bedew; add their own springs:</l>
               <l>Yet all of these unto the ocean's sum</l>
               <l>Shall be but as the increase of a drop.</l>
               <l>Wherefore 'tis less a marvel that the sea,</l>
               <l>The mighty ocean, increaseth not. Besides,</l>
               <l>Sun with his heat draws off a mighty part:</l>
               <l>Yea, we behold that sun with burning beams</l>
               <l>To dry our garments dripping all with wet;</l>
               <l>And many a sea, and far out-spread beneath,</l>
               <l>Do we behold. Therefore, however slight</l>
               <l>The portion of wet that sun on any spot</l>
               <l>Culls from the level main, he still will take</l>
               <l>From off the waves in such a wide expanse</l>
               <l>Abundantly. Then, further, also winds,</l>
               <l>Sweeping the level waters, can bear off</l>
               <l>A mighty part of wet, since we behold</l>
               <l>Oft in a single night the highways dried</l>
               <l>By winds, and soft mud crusted o'er at dawn.</l>
               <l>Again, I've taught thee that the clouds bear off</l>
               <l>Much moisture too, up-taken from the reaches</l>
               <l>Of the mighty main, and sprinkle it about</l>
               <l>O'er all the zones, when rain is on the lands</l>
               <l>And winds convey the aery racks of vapour.</l>
               <l>Lastly, since earth is porous through her frame,</l>
               <l>And neighbours on the seas, girdling their shores,</l>
               <l>The water's wet must seep into the lands</l>
               <l>From briny ocean, as from lands it comes</l>
               <l>Into the seas. For brine is filtered off,</l>
               <l>And then the liquid stuff seeps back again</l>

               <l>I will unfold: for with no middling might</l>
               <l>Of devastation the flamy tempest rose</l>
               <l>And held dominion in Sicilian fields:</l>

               <l>Of neighbouring clans, what time they saw afar</l>
               <l>The skiey vaults a-fume and sparkling all,</l>
               <l>And filled their bosoms with dread anxiety</l>

               <l>To peer to every quarter, that thou mayst</l>
               <l>Remember how boundless is the Sum-of-Things,</l>
               <l>And mark how infinitely small a part</l>
               <l>Of the whole Sum is this one sky of ours-</l>
               <l>O not so large a part as is one man</l>
               <l>Of the whole earth. And plainly if thou viewest</l>

               <l>A fever, gathering head with fiery heat,</l>
               <l>Or any other dolorous disease</l>

               <l>Out-breaks the sacred fire, and, crawling on</l>

               <l>It seizeth on, and works its hideous way</l>
               <l>Along the frame. No marvel this, since, lo,</l>
               <l>Of things innumerable be seeds enough,</l>
               <l>And this our earth and sky do bring to us</l>
               <l>Enough of bane from whence can grow the strength</l>
               <l>Of maladies uncounted. Thuswise, then,</l>
               <l>We must suppose to all the sky and earth</l>

               <l>For wind is made when air hath been uproused</l>
               <l>By violent agitation. When this air</l>
               <l>Is heated through and through, and, raging round,</l>
               <l>Hath made the earth and all the rocks it touches</l>
               <l>Horribly hot, and hath struck off from them</l>
               <l>Fierce fire of swiftest flame, it lifts itself</l>
               <l>And hurtles thus straight upwards through its throat</l>
               <l>Into high heav'n, and thus bears on afar</l>
               <l>Its burning blasts and scattereth afar</l>
               <l>Its ashes, and rolls a smoke of pitchy murk</l>

               <l>Fill him o'erfull and force his flow to stop.</l>
               <l>For out of doubt these blasts which driven be</l>
               <l>From icy constellations of the pole</l>
               <l>Are borne straight up the river. Comes that river</l>

               <l>As to the Birdless spots and Birdless tarns,</l>
               <l>What sort of nature they are furnished with.</l>
               <l>First, as to name of "birdless,"- that derives</l>
               <l>From very fact, because they noxious be</l>
               <l>Unto all birds. For when above those spots</l>
               <l>In horizontal flight the birds have come,</l>
               <l>Forgetting to oar with wings, they furl their sails,</l>

               <l>Charged with the pungent sulphur, and increased</l>

               <l>Within the walls of <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName>, even there</l>
               <l>On summit of Acropolis, beside</l>

               <l>But evermore they flee- yet not from wrath</l>
               <l>Of Pallas, grieved at that espial old,</l>
               <l>As poets of the Greeks have sung the tale;</l>

               <l>Lo, all these wonders work by natural law,</l>
               <l>And from what causes they are brought to pass</l>
               <l>The origin is manifest; so, haply,</l>

               <l>Contains them mingled and gives forth discrete.</l>
               <l>And we have shown before that certain things</l>
               <l>Be unto certain creatures suited more</l>
               <l>For ends of life, by virtue of a nature,</l>
               <l>A texture, and primordial shapes, unlike</l>
               <l>For kinds alike. Then too 'tis thine to see</l>
               <l>How many things oppressive be and foul</l>
               <l>To man, and to sensation most malign:</l>
               <l>Many meander miserably through ears;</l>
               <l>Many in-wind athrough the nostrils too,</l>
               <l>Malign and harsh when mortal draws a breath;</l>
               <l>Of not a few must one avoid the touch;</l>
               <l>Of not a few must one escape the sight;</l>
               <l>And some there be all loathsome to the taste;</l>
               <l>And many, besides, relax the languid limbs</l>
               <l>Along the frame, and undermine the soul</l>
               <l>In its abodes within. To certain trees</l>
               <l>There hath been given so dolorous a shade</l>
               <l>That often they gender achings of the head,</l>
               <l>If one but be beneath, outstretched on the sward.</l>
               <l>There is, again, on Helicon's high hills</l>
               <l>A tree that's wont to kill a man outright</l>
               <l>By fetid odour of its very flower.</l>
               <l>And when the pungent stench of the night-lamp,</l>
               <l>Extinguished but a moment since, assails</l>
               <l>The nostrils, then and there it puts to sleep</l>
               <l>A man afflicted with the falling sickness</l>
               <l>And foamings at the mouth. A woman, too,</l>
               <l>At the heavy castor drowses back in chair,</l>
               <l>And from her delicate fingers slips away</l>
               <l>Her gaudy handiwork, if haply she</l>

               <l>In daylight cold and hot in time of night.</l>
               <l>This fountain men be-wonder over-much,</l>
               <l>And think that suddenly it seethes in heat</l>
               <l>By intense sun, the subterranean, when</l>
               <l>Night with her terrible murk hath cloaked the lands-</l>
               <l>What's not true reasoning by a long remove:</l>
               <l>I' faith when sun o'erhead, touching with beams</l>
               <l>An open body of water, had no power</l>
               <l>To render it hot upon its upper side,</l>
               <l>Though his high light possess such burning glare,</l>
               <l>How, then, can he, when under the gross earth,</l>
               <l>Make water boil and glut with fiery heat?-</l>
               <l>And, specially, since scarcely potent he</l>
               <l>Through hedging walls of houses to inject</l>
               <l>His exhalations hot, with ardent rays.</l>
               <l>What, then's, the principle? Why, this, indeed:</l>
               <l>The earth about that spring is porous more</l>
               <l>Than elsewhere the telluric ground, and be</l>
               <l>Many the seeds of fire hard by the water;</l>
               <l>On this account, when night with dew-fraught shades</l>
               <l>Hath whelmed the earth, anon the earth deep down</l>
               <l>Grows chill, contracts; and thuswise squeezes out</l>
               <l>Into the spring what seeds she holds of fire</l>
               <l>(As one might squeeze with fist), which render hot</l>
               <l>The touch and steam of the fluid. Next, when sun,</l>
               <l>Up-risen, with his rays has split the soil</l>
               <l>And rarefied the earth with waxing heat,</l>
               <l>Again into their ancient abodes return</l>
               <l>The seeds of fire, and all the Hot of water</l>
               <l>Into the earth retires; and this is why</l>
               <l>The fountain in the daylight gets so cold.</l>
               <l>Besides, the water's wet is beat upon</l>
               <l>By rays of sun, and, with the dawn, becomes</l>
               <l>Rarer in texture under his pulsing blaze;</l>
               <l>And, therefore, whatso seeds it holds of fire</l>

               <l>By blows that air asunder lying betwixt</l>

               <l>Conveys it onward, pushing from the rear.</l>
               <l>For ever doth the circumambient air</l>
               <l>Drub things unmoved, but here it pushes forth</l>
               <l>The iron, because upon one side the space</l>
               <l>Lies void and thus receives the iron in.</l>
               <l>This air, whereof I am reminding thee,</l>
               <l>Winding athrough the iron's abundant pores</l>
               <l>So subtly into the tiny parts thereof,</l>
               <l>Shoves it and pushes, as wind the ship and sails.</l>
               <l>The same doth happen in all directions forth:</l>

               <l>Whether from crosswise or above, forthwith</l>
               <l>The neighbour particles are borne along</l>

               <l>They're set a-going by poundings from elsewhere,</l>
               <l>Nor by themselves of own accord can they</l>

               <l>Must in their framework hold some air, because</l>
               <l>They are of framework porous, and the air</l>

               <l>Findeth all spaces full, nor now hath holes</l>
               <l>To swim through, as before. 'Tis thus constrained</l>
               <l>With its own current 'gainst the iron's fabric</l>
               <l>To dash and beat; by means whereof it spues</l>
               <l>Forth from itself- and through the brass stirs up-</l>
               <l>The things which otherwise without the brass</l>
               <l>It sucks into itself. In these affairs</l>
               <l>Marvel thou not that from this stone the tide</l>
               <l>Prevails not likewise other things to move</l>

               <l>The water-pits, tumbling with eager mouth</l>
               <l>Already agape. The insatiable thirst</l>
               <l>That whelmed their parched bodies, lo, would make</l>
               <l>A goodly shower seem like to scanty drops.</l>
               <l>Respite of torment was there none. Their frames</l>
               <l>Forspent lay prone. With silent lips of fear</l>
               <l>Would Medicine mumble low, the while she saw</l>
               <l>So many a time men roll their eyeballs round,</l>
               <l>Staring wide-open, unvisited of sleep,</l>

               <l>Was given many another sign of death:</l>

               <l>Deranged, the sad brow, the countenance</l>
               <l>Fierce and delirious, the tormented ears</l>
               <l>Beset with ringings, the breath quick and short</l>
               <l>Or huge and intermittent, soaking sweat</l>
               <l>A-glisten on neck, the spittle in fine gouts</l>
               <l>Tainted with colour of crocus and so salt,</l>
               <l>The cough scarce wheezing through the rattling throat.</l>
               <l>Aye, and the sinews in the fingered hands</l>
               <l>Were sure to contract, and sure the jointed frame</l>
               <l>To shiver, and up from feet the cold to mount</l>
               <l>Inch after inch: and toward the supreme hour</l>
               <l>At last the pinched nostrils, nose's tip</l>
               <l>A very point, eyes sunken, temples hollow,</l>
               <l>Skin cold and hard, the shuddering grimace,</l>
               <l>The pulled and puffy flesh above the brows!-</l>
               <l>O not long after would their frames lie prone</l>
               <l>In rigid death. And by about the eighth</l>
               <l>Resplendent light of sun, or at the most</l>
               <l>On the ninth flaming of his flambeau, they</l>
               <l>Would render up the life. If any then</l>

               <l>And black discharges of the belly, or else</l>
               <l>Through the clogged nostrils would there ooze along</l>
               <l>Much fouled blood, oft with an aching head:</l>
               <l>Hither would stream a man's whole strength and flesh.</l>

               <l>And some, besides, were by oblivion</l>
