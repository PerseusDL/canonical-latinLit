            </p>
            <p>We see that Horace nowhere employed verse of this rhythm continuously, but the
                learned Arbiter uses it often in his works. You will remember these lines, which we
                are used to sing: <quote>

            <p>We know that the lyric poets inserted some lines of this rhythm and form in their

            </p>
            <p>Now the analysis, which we will explain, will give us the metre in which they say
                that Anacreon wrote his sweet old songs. We find that Petronius, as well as many
                others, used this metre, when he says that this same lyric poet sang in words
                harmonious to the Muses. But I will explain with what kind of caesura this verse is
                written. In the line <quote>
