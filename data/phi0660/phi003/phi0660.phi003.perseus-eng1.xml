<l>At last the love I've waited for has come.</l>
<l>(No shame to say so:  more to cover up).</l>
<l>My Camenae called on her in prayer,</l>
<l>and Cytherea brought him to my heart.</l>
<l n="5"><placeName key="tgn,2021646;tgn,2066902;tgn,2081683;tgn,2094077;tgn,2096104;tgn,2100948;tgn,2108237;tgn,2744069;tgn,2744070;tgn,2744071;tgn,2744072;tgn,2744073">Venus</placeName> kept her promise:  now she can tell</l>
<l>my tale of joy to those who don't believe.</l>
<l>I hardly want to give this letter up</l>
<l>so no one else sees it before he does.</l>
<l>I'm glad I did it &mdash; why wear a prudish mask,</l>
<l>as if he wasn't good enough for me!
</l></div1>
<div1 type="poem" n="2">
<l>My stupid birthday's here, and I'm supposed</l>
<l>to go away and leave Cerinthus here.</l>
<l>What's better than the city?  On the farm,</l>
<l>it's cold and rustic &mdash; no place for a girl.</l>
<l n="5">Messalla, uncle, you're thinking of me,</l>
<l>but stop it:  this is no time for a trip.</l>
<l>Take me away, I'll leave my heart and mind</l>
<l>In <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>:  what good's free will?  You make the rules.
</l></div1>
<div1 type="poem" n="3">
<l>You know, that trip's been taken off my mind:</l>
<l>your girlfriend gets to spend her day in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</l>
<l>Let's spend the day together, as we hoped:</l>
<l>we've had the good luck you were waiting for.
</l></div1>
<div1 type="poem" n="4">
<l>I should be glad you think that you can cheat:</l>
<l>what a fool I'd be to fall into your arms.</l>
<l>Go:  court your working girl as she spins her wool</l>
<l>instead of Sulpicia daughter of Servius.</l>
<l n="5">My family are concerned I might lose out</l>
<l>to the affections of an unknown's bed.
</l></div1>
<div1 type="poem" n="5">
<l>Cerinthus, do you care that I am sick,</l>
<l>my body wracked with fever and fatigue?</l>
<l>I cannot hope that I'll be well again</l>
<l>unless I think that that's what you want too.</l>
<l n="5">But if my sickness doesn't worry you,</l>
<l>what good is it to me to be well again?
</l></div1>
<div1 type="poem" n="6">
<l>My light, may you not love me any more</l>
<l>the way I think you did a few days since,</l>
<l>if I have ever in my youthful life</l>
<l>done anything as stupid as I did</l>
<l n="5">yesterday, when I left you all alone</l>
<l>because I didn't want to show my love.</l></div1>
