   <head>THE SPEECH OF M. T. CICERO IN DEFENCE OF MARCUS AEMILIUS SCAURUS. <note anchored="true">This oration is in a very corrupt and fragmentary state. It is here translated as corrected
    and filled up by Beier in the edition of Orellius. Beier's "supplements," as Orellius calls
    them, are inserted between brackets [ ].</note>

   <head>THE ARGUMENT</head>
   <p>Marcus Scaurus was the stepson of Sulla, in the time of whose triumph he had behaved with the
    greatest moderation. He had been aedile, in which office he had exhibited the games with the
    greatest magnificence, so as greatly to embarrass his private fortunes. He then became praetor
    and afterwards having received Sardinia as his province, he lost his character for moderation,
    being said to have treated the natives with rapacity and excessive arrogance. After his return
    to Rome, he obtained some celebrity by defending some persons under prosecution; and among
    others Caius Cato. </p>
   <p>At the end of June A. U. C. 699, he returned to Rome to stand for the consulship; on which he
    was accused by Publius Valerius Triarius, (a young man of a high reputation for industry and
    eloquence) of acts of oppression and extortion among the Sardinians. And the trial came on
    before Marcus Cato, who was a great friend of Triarius, only three days after Caius Cato had
    been acquitted by the exertions of Scaurus. Lucius Marius and Marcus and Quintus Pacuvius
    seconded Triarius in the prosecution, these two last having had a commission given to them to
    go to Corsica and Sardinia to inquire into the state of the case there, which commission they
    had neglected, excusing themselves on the ground that the consular <foreign xml:lang="lat">comitia</foreign> were at hand and that they were afraid that while they were away Scaurus
    would buy the consulship, and so get the means of oppressing other provinces. </p>
   <p>Scaurus relied on the support of Pompeius with whom he was connected by marriage; and he was
    defended by Cicero and five other advocates among whom was Quintus Hortensius. While the
    prosecution was going on, Faustus Sulla, the son of the great Sulla, and half brother of
    Scaurus, who was also quaestor at the time, came out among the people severely wounded crying
    out that Scaurus' competitors had attempted to murder him. He went about with three hundred
    armed guard prepared to defend himself, if need were, by force; Scaurus also made a speech on
    his own behalf and produced a great effect on the judges by the recollection of his own
    aedileship and the recollection of his father's high character. He was acquitted, but he did
    not succeed in obtaining the consulship.</p>

    seek a remedy for her embarrassment by hanging herself. For the very first desire which is
    implanted in man by nature, and one which we have in common with the very beasts, is that which

   [But still it can be proved by examples. Lucretia having been ravished by force by the king's
    son, having invoked the citizens to revenge her, slew herself. And this indignation of hers was
    the cause of liberty to the state. And even the bravest men have not sought death of their own
    accord, except in the most extreme necessity, for the purpose of avoiding some disgrace. As
    Publius Crassus Mucianus, when waging war against Aristonicus, in Asia, being intercepted
    between Elaea and Smyrna, by the Thracians, of whom Aristonicus had a great number in his
    different garrisons, and fearing to fall into his power, escaped disgrace by provoking death
    intentionally. For he is said to have run the stick which he had been using to manage his horse,
    into the eye of one of the barbarians, who, being infiltrated by the pain, stabbed Crassus with
    his dagger, and so, while avenging himself, delivered the Roman general from the disgrace of
    captivity. And by this means Crassus showed to Fortune how little the man whom she was loading
    with such bitter insult deserved it, since with equal prudence and courage he burst the chains
    which she was throwing over his liberty, and restored himself to his own dignity, though she had
    almost given him to Aristonicus.] <gap reason="lost"/><!-- Should be n="1r", based on the Latin text --> This, indeed, we know from hearsay; but
    this we ourselves can recollect and have almost seen, namely, how Publius Crassus, of the same
    family and name, slew himself that he might not fall into the hands of the enemy. <gap reason="lost"/>
   <milestone unit="para"/><!-- Should be n="1s", based on the Latin text -->But Marcus Aquillius, who had behaved like a thoroughly brave man in war, and who had attained
    the same honours as the elder Crassus, could not imitate his action </p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
    <gap reason="lost"/>[but] he disgraced [the recollection of his you]th and of his early exploits
    by the infamy of his old age. What need I say besides? Could either those most illustrious men
    the Julii, or could Marcus Antonius a man of the very highest ability, imitate the conduct of
    the other Crassus in those times? </p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Need I cite any more
    instances? Who is there found among all the records of Greece (which are richer in fine stories
    than in great actions) if you only forget Ajax and the plays of the tragedians, who of his own
    accord, as the poet says, being <quote>
     <l>A conqueror all unused to infamy</l>
     <l>Would not survive defeat,</l>
    </quote> except Themistocles the Athenian who did put himself to death? </p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>But these Greeks invent heaps of stories and among them they make out that
    Cleombrotus of Ambracia threw himself down from a high wall not because he had suffered any
    misfortune, but (as I see it written among the Greeks) after having read a very eloquently and
    elegantly written book, of that greatest of philosophers Plato about death; the one, I suppose,
    in which Socrates, on that very day on which he was to die, argues at great length that this is
    death which we fancy to be life when the soul is held in shut up in the body as in a prison and
    that that is life when the same soul, having been released from the bonds of the body, flies
    back to that place from which it originated. </p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>Had that Sardinian
    woman of yours then, known anything about or had she read Pythagoras or Plato? Though even these
    men praise death with such limitations that they forbid our flying from life, and say that such
    conduct is contrary to the conditions and laws of nature. And in truth you will not be able to
    find any other reason which can justify a voluntary death. And this, too, the prosecutor saw;
    for he let out an insinuation, somewhere, that that woman preferred being deprived of life to
    being robbed of her chastity. </p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>But immediately he went off from
    that point and said no more about chastity, being afraid, I suppose, lest he should be giving us
    some opportunity for joking and laughing. For it is quite notorious that she was abominably ugly
    and excessively old. And so, however lustful that Sardinian may have been, what suspicions of
    licentiousness or love can there be on the part of my client? </p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>
   <milestone unit="para"/>And that you may not suppose, O Triarius, that I am inventing the allegations which I am now
    making, and that I have not derived my information on the subject from the instructions of the
    defendant, I will tell you what were the opinions in Sardinia about that woman's death, (for
    there were two opinions,) so that you may the more easily <gap reason="lost"/> [and that these
    men may see the innocence of Scaurus, and the audacity of your witnesses, and the scandalous
    nature of the actions which were then done. Aris, the husband of that Sardinian woman <gap reason="lost"/>] had for a long time loved [the mother of Bostar <gap reason="lost"/>]
     </p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>
    <gap reason="lost"/> a licentious and wicked woman, and had lived in shameless and notorious
    adultery with her. He was afraid of his wife, who was an old woman, rich and ill-tempered;
    still, though he did not like to keep her as his wife, because of her ugliness, he did not like
    to divorce her, because of her riches. And so, by previous agreement he concerted a plan with
    the mother of Bostar, that they should both of them come to Rome; and he promised that when
    there he would find out some contrivance for making her his wife. </p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>
   <milestone unit="para"/>There were, as I have said, two opinions,—one, not inconsistent with the circumstances or with
    the nature of the case, that the wife of Aris was very indignant at his adultery when she heard
    that he had fled to Rome with that love of his, pretending to have fled for fear of her, or in
    order, as there had been a criminal connection between them before, to be now formally joined in
    wedlock; and that she was so excited with feminine indignation, that she preferred dying to
    bearing it. </p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>The other was no less probable, and, as I believe,
    was even more generally believed in Sardinia, namely, that Aris, that witness and host of yours,
    O Triarius, when departing for Rome, had entrusted the commission to his freedman, not indeed to
    offer open violence to that old woman, for that would not have been right to his mistress, but
    to press her throat with his two fingers, and then to fasten a little cord round it, so that she
    might be supposed to have died by hanging. </p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>And this suspicion
    prevailed all the more, because, when the Norensians were celebrating their festivals in honour
    of the dead, and <gap reason="lost"/> had all, according to the custom of their tribe, left
    the city, then she was said by the freedman to have hanged herself; and it was clearly desirable
    for a man who strangled his mistress to seek for the solitary time when the people left the
    city; but his mistress, who wished to die, had no such necessity for doing so. </p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>And the suspicion was confirmed, because, immediately after the old woman was
    dead, the freedman started for Rome, as if he had executed his commission; and Aris, as soon as
    his freedman brought him news of the death of his wife, instantly, at Rome, married that mother
    of Bostar. </p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>
   <milestone unit="para"/>See now, O judges, to what a foul and polluted and infamous <gap reason="lost"/> family you are
    called on, O judges, to surrender this family of Scaurus. Just consider who the witnesses are by
    whom you are required to be influenced in your decision about a great man, about a noble family,
    about an illustrious name! Do you think that it becomes you to forget the crimes of the mothers
    against their children, and of the husbands against their wives? You see, you behold infamous
    lust mingled with cruelty. You have before you the authors of two most enormous crimes, by which
    our cause is endeavoured to be tainted by men who are either ignorant of the truth, or else who

    which I could efface, which I could argue about which I could dilate upon; because it was a
    charge of that sort which did not entirely depend on the witness, but which the judge could by
    himself form his own opinion on. </p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>Nor, O judges, ought we to do

    prefer being called,) but even more civilized and scrupulous men than they, are liable to be
    prompted, or deterred, or guided, or diverted from their purpose; and such a man is the master
    of his own inclination, and may, if he pleases, lie with impunity. </p></div>

    assumed. Wherefore, if I were worsted by that sort of accusation, I should yield and submit; I

    instituted a prosecution against Quintus Multo, a very mean man. And when he was asked what

    for the priesthood of Mars, and for other offices, he had stood as a patrician. Wherefore, while he was consul he did not wish his brother to meet with

    their covetousness, which was excited by the hope and promise of rewards, does so too. Lastly,
    their national origin does so, for the worthlessness of their nation is such that they think

    they come like honest men, and without having been bribed, and of their own accord, and not
    because of the instigation of any one else, and under no obligation to any one, and free. And
    when all these circumstances are united, still they may exult and marvel if they are believed.

    those most holy gods in that temple in your sight, that they might gain from you the safety of
    his grandson by their entreaties, as they have, before now, often aided by their divine
    assistance many other men in distress who implored their help.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47"><p>That Capitol, adorned with three
    temples,—the approaches to the temples of the all-good and all-powerful Jupiter, and of Juno the
    queen, and of Minerva, adorned by most magnificent presents of this man's father and of himself;
    defend Marcus Scaurus [before you now by the recollection of this munificence and liberality to
    the public, from every suspicion of avarice or covetousness. That temple of Vesta, which is
    close at hand, warns you to keep it in your minds.]</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="48"><p>That great Lucius Metellus, the Pontifex
    Maximus, who, when that temple was on fire threw himself into the middle of the flames, and
    saved from the fire that image of Minerva, which, as if it were a pledge of our safety and of
    the empire, is guarded by the protection of Vesta;—would that that great man could be among us,
    though but for a short time; he, forsooth, would save from the flames this man, his descendant,
    as he before saved from that other conflagration that heavenly pledge of our safety. I am moved
    by the thought that the gods should be so little propitious to a priest, that even though they
    were saved by him, they do not preserve his race which was recommended by him to their
    protection.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="49"><p> But as for you, O Marcus Scaurus, I see you, I do not merely think of you; nor,
    indeed, is it without great distress and grief of mind that I do call you to mind when I behold
    the mournful appearance of your son. 
   <milestone unit="para"/>And I wish that, as during the whole of this cause you have been constantly present before my
    eyes, you would, in like manner, now present yourself to the minds of these our judges, and
    plant yourself deeply in all their thoughts. If your appearance, I call [the gods to witness,
    could come to life again, (for we have never seen any one equal to you in wisdom, and dignity,
    and firmness, and all other virtues,) it would have such weight with every one, that whoever
    beheld it] even if by chance he did not recognise it would still pronounce it to be one of the
    chief men in the state. </p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="50"><p>
   <milestone unit="para"/>How, then, can I now address you? As a man? But you are no longer among us. As a deceased
    person? But you live and flourish; but you are present to the minds of all this court,—you are
    visible to their eyes; your godlike soul had nothing mortal about it, nor was anything belonging
    to you which could die, except your body. Whatever way, therefore, [it is proper for you to be
    addressed, be present to us, I entreat you, and terrify, by your mere countenance,—by the bare
    sight of yourself; the emptiness and impudence of those most worthless and mendacious witnesses.
    Be present to us, and bring to your fellow-citizens the light of your counsel, to the authority
    of which they never repented deferring, and so prevent them from dishonouring your race with
    ignominy and disaster, and from crushing by their sentence your own son, who is no degenerate
    heir of his father's name.]</p></div>
