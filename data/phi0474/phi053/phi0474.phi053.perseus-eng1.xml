<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There is an ancient belief, handed down to us
even from mythical times and firmly established by
the general agreement of the Roman people and of all
nations, that divination of some kind exists among
men; this the Greeks call <foreign lang="greek">mantikh/</foreign>&mdash;that is, the
foresight and knowledge of future events. A really
splendid and helpful thing it is&mdash;if only such a faculty
exists&mdash;since by its means men may approach very
near to the power of gods. And, just as we Romans
have done many other things better than the Greeks,
so have we excelled them in giving to this most
extraordinary gift a name, which we have derived
from <hi rend="italics">divi,</hi> a word meaning <quote>gods,</quote> whereas, according to Plato's interpretation, they have derived it
from <hi rend="italics">furor,</hi> a word meaning <quote>frenzy.</quote><note><hi rend="italics">Phaedrus</hi> 244 c <foreign lang="greek">mantikh/</foreign>=<foreign lang="greek">manikh/</foreign> from <foreign lang="greek">mani/a</foreign> (<hi rend="italics">furor</hi>).</note></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Now I am aware of no people, however refined and
learned or however savage and ignorant, which does
not think that signs are given of future events,
and that certain persons can recognize those signs
and foretell events before they occur. First of all&mdash;to seek authority from the most distant sources&mdash;the
Assyrians, on account of the vast plains inhabited by
them, and because of the open and unobstructed
view of the heavens presented to them on every

<pb id="p.225"/>

side, took observations of the paths and movements
of the stars, and, having made note of them,
transmitted to posterity what significance they
had for each person. And in that same nation
the Chaldeans&mdash;a name which they derived not
from their art but their race<note>Cicero adds this because <hi rend="italics">Chaldaei</hi> had come to be used
=<quote>astrologers.</quote> They were the ruling class among the
Babylonians.</note> &mdash;have, it is thought,
by means of long-continued observation of the constellations, perfected a science which enables them
to foretell what any man's lot will be and for what
fate he was born.</p>
<p>The same art is believed to have been acquired
also by the Egyptians through a remote past extending over almost countless ages. Moreover, the
Cilicians, Pisidians, and their neighbours, the Pamphylians&mdash;nations which I once governed&mdash;think
that the future is declared by the songs and flights
of birds, which they regard as most infallible signs.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And, indeed, what colony did Greece ever send
into Aeolia, Ionia, Asia, Sicily, or Italy without
consulting the Pythian or Dodonian oracle, or that
of Jupiter Hammon? Or what war did she ever
undertake without first seeking the counsel of the
gods?</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>Nor is it only one single mode of divination
that has been employed in public and in private.
For, to say nothing of other nations, how many
our own people have embraced! In the first place,
according to tradition, Romulus, the father of this
City, not only founded it in obedience to the auspices,
but was himself a most skilful augur. Next, the
other Roman kings employed augurs; and, again,
after the expulsion of the kings, no public business
was ever transacted at home or abroad without first
taking the auspices. Furthermore, since our fore-

<pb id="p.227"/>

fathers believed that the soothsayers'<note>The <hi rend="italics">haruspex</hi> divines by the inspection of entrails.</note> art had
great efficacy in seeking for omens and advice,<note>From the gods.</note> as
well as in cases where prodigies were to be interpreted and their effects averted, they gradually
introduced that art in its entirety from Etruria,
lest it should appear that any kind of divination had
been disregarded by them.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And since they thought that the human mind,
when in an irrational and unconscious state, and
moving by its own free and untrammelled impulse,
was inspired in two ways, the one by frenzy and the
other by dreams, and since they believed that the
divination of frenzy was contained chiefly in the
Sibylline verses, they decreed that ten<note>This number was changed to fifteen in the time of Sulla.</note> men should
be chosen from the State to interpret those verses. In
this same category also were the frenzied prophecies
of soothsayers and seers, which our ancestors frequently thought worthy of belief&mdash;like the prophecies
of Cornelius Culleolus, during the Octavian War.<note>The Octavian War occurred in 87 B.C., between Octavius
and Sulla on the one side and Cinna and Marius on the other.</note> 
Nor, indeed, were the more significant dreams,
if they seemed to concern the administration of
public affairs, disregarded by our Supreme Council.
Why, even within my own memory, Lucius Julius,
who was consul with Publius Rutilius, by a vote of
the Senate rebuilt the temple of Juno, the Saviour,<note>This was in 105 B.C. when Cicero was one year old.</note> 
in accordance with a dream of Caecilia, daughter
of Balearicus.<note>Q. Caecilius Metellus Balearicus, consul 123 B.C.</note> </p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>Now my opinion is that, in sanctioning
such usages, the ancients were influenced more
by actual results than convinced by reason.<note>Cicero approved of the practice of divination, especially
of augury, from reasons of political expediency, not because
he thought it had any prophetic value; <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> ii. 33. 70.</note> However certain very subtle arguments to prove the
trustworthiness of divination have been gathered
by philosophers. Of these&mdash;to mention the most
ancient&mdash;Xenophanes of Colophon, while asserting

<pb id="p.229"/>

the existence of gods, was the only one who repudiated divination in its entirety; but all the others,
with the exception of Epicurus, who babbled about
the nature of the gods, approved of divination, though
not in the same degree. For example, Socrates
and all of the Socratic School, and Zeno and his
followers, continued in the faith of the ancient
philosophers and in agreement with the Old Academy
and with the Peripatetics. Their predecessor, Pythagoras, who even wished to be considered an
augur himself, gave the weight of his great name
to the same practice; and that eminent author,
Democritus, in many passages, strongly affirmed his
belief in a presentiment of things to come. Moreover,
Dicaearchus, the Peripatetic, though he accepted
divination by dreams and frenzy, cast away all
other kinds; and my intimate friend, Cratippus,
whom I consider the peer of the greatest of the
Peripatetics, also gave credence to the same kinds of
divination but rejected the rest.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The Stoics, on the other hand (for Zeno in his
writings had, as it were, scattered certain seed which
Cleanthes had fertilized somewhat), defended nearly
every sort of divination. Then came Chrysippus,
a man of the keenest intellect, who exhaustively
discussed the whole theory of divination in two books,
and, besides, wrote one book on oracles and another
on dreams. And following him, his pupil, Diogenes of
Babylon, published one book, Antipater two, and my
friend, Posidonius, five. But Panaetius, the teacher
of Posidonius, a pupil, too, of Antipater, and, even
a pillar of the Stoic school, wandered off from the
Stoics, and, though he dared not say that there
was no efficacy in divination, yet he did say that he

<pb id="p.231"/>

was in doubt. Then, since the Stoics&mdash;much against
their will I grant you&mdash;permitted this famous Stoic
to doubt on one point will they not grant to us
Academicians the right to do the same on all other
points, especially since that about which Panaetius
is not clear is clearer than the light of day to the
other members of the Stoic school? <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>At any rate,
this praiseworthy tendency of the Academy to doubt
has been approved by the solemn judgement of a
most eminent philosopher.<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> Panaetius.</note> </p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>Accordingly, since I, too, am in doubt as to
the proper judgement to be rendered in regard to
divination because of the many pointed and exhaustive arguments urged by Carneades against the
Stoic view, and since I am afraid of giving a too
hasty assent to a proposition which may turn out
either false or insufficiently established, I have
determined carefully and persistently to compare
argument with argument just as I did in my three
books <hi rend="italics">On the Nature of the Gods.</hi> For a hasty acceptance of an erroneous opinion is discreditable in any
case, and especially so in an inquiry as to how
much weight should be given to auspices, to sacred
rites, and to religious observances; for we run the
risk of committing a crime against the gods if we
disregard them, or of becoming involved in old
women's superstition if we approve them.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>This subject has been discussed by me frequently on other occasions, but with somewhat more
than ordinary care when my brother Quintus and
I were together recently at my Tusculan villa. For
the sake of a stroll we had gone to the Lyceum,<note>Cicero had two gymnasia at Tusculum: the Lyceum,
so called from the place in which Aristotle taught at Athens,
the other, the Academia, named from the place where
Plato lectured. <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Cic. <hi rend="italics">Tusc.</hi> ii. 3.</note> 
which is the name of my upper gymnasium, when
Quintus remarked:</p>

<pb id="p.233"/>

<p><quote>I have just finished a careful reading of the
third book of your treatise, <hi rend="italics">On the Nature of the Gods,</hi>
containing Cotta's discussion, which, though it has
shaken my views of religion, has not overthrown
them entirely.</quote></p>
<p><quote>Very good,</quote> said I; <quote>for Cotta's argument is
intended rather to refute the arguments of the
Stoics than to destroy man's faith in religion.</quote></p>
<p>Quintus then replied: <quote>Cotta<note>Gaius Aurelius Cotta, consul 75 B.C., an eminent orator,
and Q. Lucilius Balbus were two of the disputants in <hi rend="italics">The
Nature of the Gods,</hi> the former as an Academician and the
latter as a Stoic.</note> says the very
same thing, and says it repeatedly, in order, as I
think, not to appear to violate the commonly accepted
canons of belief; yet it seems to me that, in his zeal
to confute the Stoics, he utterly demolishes the
gods. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>However, I am really at no loss for a reply
to his reasoning; for in the second book Lucilius
has made an adequate defence of religion and his
argument, as you yourself state at the end of the
third book,<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Cic. <hi rend="italics">N.D.</hi> iii. 40. 95 <quote>haec cum essent dicta, ita
discessimus, ut Velleio Cottae disputatio verior, mihi Balbi
ad veritatis similitudinem videretur esse propensior.</quote></note> seemed to you nearer to the truth than
Cotta's. But there is a question<note>This question, however, is briefly discussed in <hi rend="italics">De nat
d.</hi> ii. 3&ndash;5.</note> which you passed
over in those books because, no doubt, you thought
it more expedient to inquire into it in a separate
discussion: I refer to divination, which is the foreseeing and foretelling of events considered as happening by chance. Now let us see, if you will, what
efficacy it has and what its nature is. My own
opinion is that, if the kinds of divination which we
have inherited from our forefathers and now practise
are trustworthy, then there are gods and, conversely,
if there are gods then there are men who have the
power of divination.</quote></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/><quote>Why, my dear Quintus,</quote> said I, <quote>you are
defending the very citadel of the Stoics in asserting
the interdependence of these two propositions: 'if
there is divination there are gods,' and,' if there are

<pb id="p.235"/>

gods there is divination.'<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Cic. <hi rend="italics">N.D.</hi> ii. 12.</note> But neither is granted
as readily as you think. For it is possible that nature
gives signs of future events without the intervention of
a god, and it may be that there are gods without their
having conferred any power of divination upon men.</quote></p>
<p>To this he replied: <quote>I, at any rate, find sufficient
proof to satisfy me of the existence of gods and of
their concern in human affairs in my conviction that
there are some kinds of divination which are clear
and manifest. With your permission I will set forth
my views on this subject, provided you are at leisure
and have nothing else which you think should be
preferred to such a discussion.</quote></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/><quote>Really, my dear Quintus,</quote> said I, <quote>I always
have time for philosophy. Moreover, since there is
nothing else at this time that I can do with pleasure,<note>Cicero here refers to the deplorable condition of Roman
politics and his exclusion from the courts and from any
leading part in the government.</note> 
I am all the more eager to hear what you think
about divination.</quote></p>
<p><quote>There is, I assure you,</quote> said he, "nothing new
or original in my views; for those which I adopt
are not only very old, but they are endorsed by the
consent of all peoples and nations. There are two
kinds of divination: the first is dependent on art,
the other on nature. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Now&mdash;to mention those almost
entirely dependent on art&mdash;what nation or what
state disregards the prophecies of soothsayers, or
of interpreters of prodigies and lightnings, or of
augurs, or of astrologers, or of oracles, or&mdash;to mention
the two kinds which are classed as natural means of
divination&mdash;the forewarnings of dreams, or of frenzy?<note><hi rend="italics">Vaticinatio</hi> is employed here and elsewhere in this work to mean the prophecies of those in a frenzy or under
the influence of great mental excitement.</note> 
Of these methods of divining it behoves us, I think,
to examine the results rather than the causes. For

<pb id="p.237"/>

there is a certain natural power, which now, through
long-continued observation of signs and now, through
some divine excitement and inspiration, makes prophetic announcement of the future.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>"Therefore let Carneades cease to press the
question, which Panaetius also used to urge, whether
Jove had ordered the crow to croak on the left
side and the raven on the right. Such signs as
these have been observed for an unlimited time,
and the results have been checked and recorded.
Moreover, there is nothing which length of time
cannot accomplish and attain when aided by
memory to receive and records to preserve. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>We
may wonder at the variety of herbs that have
been observed by physicians, of roots that are good
for the bites of wild beasts, for eye affections, and
for wounds, and though reason has never explained
their force and nature, yet through their usefulness
they have won approval for the medical art and for
their discoverer.</p>
<p>"But come, let us consider instances, which
although outside the category of divination, yet
resemble it very closely<note>The following verses and those in &sect;&sect; 14, 15 are from
Cicero's translation of the <hi rend="italics">Diosemeia</hi> of Aratus.</note> 

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l>The heaving sea oft warns of coming storms,</l>
<l>When suddenly its depths begin to swell;</l>
<l>And hoary rocks, o'erspread with snowy brine,</l>
<l>To the sea, in boding tones, attempt reply;</l>
<l>Or when from lofty mountain-peak upsprings</l>
<l>A shrilly whistling wind, which stronger grows</l>
<l>With each repulse by hedge of circling cliffs.</l></quote></p>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>"Your book, <hi rend="italics">Prognostics,</hi> is full of such
warning signs, but who can fathom their causes?
And yet I see that the Stoic Bo&euml;thus has attempted
to do so and has succeeded to the extent of explaining

<pb id="p.239"/>

the phenomena of sea and sky. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>But who can give a
satisfactory reason why the following things occur?

<quote rend="blockquote">

<l>Does the nightingale<note><hi rend="italics">Acredula</hi> (Cicero's translation of <foreign lang="greek">o)lolugw/n</foreign> of Aratus, 216) is used nowhere else in Latin except in this passage
and its meaning is uncertain. The rendering <quote>nightingale</quote> accords with the sense, whereas <quote>owl,</quote> the translation of Meyer, Hottinger, and K&uuml;hner, does not. Others
understand it to mean <quote>tree-frog,</quote> <quote>dove,</quote> etc.</note> pour from its breast predictions of evil;</l>
<l>Then does it threaten and hurl from its throat its incessant complaining.</l>
<l>Often the dark-hued crow, while restlessly roaming the seashore,</l>
<l>Plunges its crest in the flood, as its neck encounters the billows.</l></quote></p>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>"Hardly ever do we see such signs deceive
us and yet we do not see why it is so.

<quote rend="blockquote">

Who could suppose that frogs had this foresight?
And yet they do have by nature some faculty of
premonition, clear enough of itself, but too dark
for human comprehension.

<quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>Nor do I ever inquire why this tree alone blooms
three times, or why it makes the appearance of its
blossoms accord with the proper time for ploughing.
I am content with my knowledge that it does,
although I may not know why. Therefore, as
regards all kinds of divination I will give the same
answer that I gave in the cases just mentioned.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>"I see the purgative effect of the scammony

name from its discoverer who learned of it in a dream
&mdash;I see their power and that is enough; why they
have it I do not know. Thus as to the cause of those
premonitory signs of winds and rains already mentioned I am not quite clear, but their force and effect
I recognize, understand, and vouch for. Likewise as
to the cleft or thread in the entrails: I accept their
meaning; I do not know their cause. And life is
full of individuals in just the same situation that I
am in, for nearly everybody employs entrails in
divining. Again: is it possible for us to doubt the
prophetic value of lightning? Have we not many
instances of its marvels? and is not the following
one especially remarkable? When the statue of
Summanus which stood on the top of the temple of
Jupiter Optimus Maximus&mdash;his statue was then made
of clay&mdash;was struck by a thunderbolt and its head
could not be found anywhere, the soothsayers
declared that it had been hurled into the Tiber;

had pointed out.</p>

these things so happen, or by what rules they may
be understood? I confess that I do not know,
but that they do so fall out I assert that you yourself see. ' Mere accidents,' you say. Now, really,
is that so? Can anything be an 'accident' which

It is possible for paints flung at random on a canvas to

an accidental scattering of pigments could produce
the beautiful portrait of Venus of Cos<note>This was a painting by Apelles and one of the greatest

I grant that the figure may have borne some resemblance to the god, but assuredly the resemblance
was not such that you could ascribe the work to a

what art&mdash;and by art I mean the kind that is dependent on conjecture and deduction&mdash;what art, I say,
does not have the same fault? Surely the practice of
medicine is an art, yet how many mistakes it makes!
And pilots&mdash;do they not make mistakes at times?
For example, when the armies of the Greeks and
the captains of their mighty fleet set sail from Troy,

Then, did the fact that so many illustrious captains
and kings suffered shipwreck deprive navigation of
its right to be called an art? And is military science
of no effect because a general of the highest renown
recently lost his army and took to flight?<note>Referring to Pompey's defeat by Caesar at Pharsalus,
48 B.C.</note> Again,
is statecraft devoid of method or skill because
political mistakes were made many times by Gnaeus
Pompey, occasionally by Marcus Cato, and once
or twice even by yourself? So it is with the responses of soothsayers, and, indeed, with every sort
of divination whose deductions are merely probable;
for divination of that kind depends on inference and
beyond inference it cannot go. <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>It sometimes misleads perhaps, but none the less in most cases it
guides us to the truth. For this same conjectural
divination is the product of boundless eternity and
within that period it has grown into an art through
the repeated observation and recording of almost
countless instances in which the same results have
been preceded by the same signs.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>"Indeed how trustworthy were the auspices
taken when you were augur!<note>Cicero was elected to the college and became a colleague
of Pompey and Hortensius in 53 B.C. Quintus proceeds
now to contrast the state of augury in 53&ndash;63 B.C. with that
of the time of the dialogue, 44.</note> At the present
time&mdash;pray pardon me for saying so&mdash;Roman augurs
neglect auspices, although the Cilicians, Pamphylians,
Pisidians, and Lycians hold them in high esteem.
I need not remind you of that most famous and
worthy man, our guest-friend, King Deiotarus, who
never undertook any enterprise without first taking
the auspices. On one occasion after he had set
out on a journey for which he had made careful
plans beforehand, he returned home because of the
warning given him by the flight of an eagle. The
room in which he would have been staying, had he
continued on his road, collapsed the very next

<pb id="p.255"/>

night. <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>This is why, as he told me himself, he had
time and again abandoned a journey even though
he might have been travelling for many days. By
the way, that was a very noble utterance of his
which he made after Caesar had deprived him of his
tetrarchy and kingdom,<note>Deiotarus was tetrarch of Gallograecia and king of
Lesser Armenia; <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> ii. 37. 78; <hi rend="italics">Bell. Alex.</hi> 67.</note> and had forced him to pay
an indemnity too. 'Notwithstanding what has
happened,' said he,' I do not regret that the auspices
favoured my joining Pompey. By so doing I enlisted
my military power in defence of senatorial authority,
Roman liberty, and the supremacy of the empire.
The birds, at whose instance I followed the course
of duty and of honour, counselled well, for I value
my good name more than riches.' His conception
of augury, it seems to me, is the correct one.</p>
<p>"For with us magistrates make use of auspices,
but they are 'forced auspices,'<note>In such cases the chickens were so fed that the sign
desired must be given; <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> ii. chaps. 34 and 35.</note> since the sacred
chickens in eating the dough pellets thrown must
let some fall from their beaks. <milestone unit="section" n="28"/>But, according to
the writings of you augurs, a <hi rend="italics">tripudium</hi> results if
any of the food should fall to the ground, and what
I spoke of as a 'forced augury' your fraternity
calls a <hi rend="italics">tripudium solistimum.</hi><note>When the chickens ate so eagerly that some of the food
fell to ground and struck it&mdash;that was a good omen. See
ii. chaps. 34 and 35 where <hi rend="italics">terripudium</hi> is explained as
=<hi rend="italics">terripavium</hi> (from <hi rend="italics">terra</hi> and <hi rend="italics">pavire)</hi> and <hi rend="italics">solistimum</hi> has
apparently almost the same meaning. Quintus seems to
complain that this was not a true method of divination,
as the result was inevitable.</note> And so through the
indifference of the college, as Cato the Wise laments,
many auguries and auspices have been entirely
abandoned and lost.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>"In ancient times scarcely any matter out
of the ordinary was undertaken, even in private life,
without first consulting the auspices, clear proof
of which is given even at the present time by our
custom of having ' nuptial auspices,'<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Val. Max. ii. 1; Juv. <hi rend="italics">Sat.</hi> x. 336; Suet. <hi rend="italics">Claud.</hi>
ch. 26.</note> though they
have lost their former religious significance and only

<pb id="p.257"/>

preserve the name. For just as to-day on important
occasions we make use of entrails in divining&mdash;
though even they are employed to a less extent than
formerly&mdash;so in the past resort was usually had to
divination by means of birds. And thus it is that by
failing to seek out the unpropitious signs we run
into awful disasters. <milestone unit="section" n="29"/>For example, Publius Claudius,
son of Appius Caecus,<note>In the first Punic War 249 B.C.; <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> Cic. <hi rend="italics">De nat. d.</hi> ii,
3. 7; Polyb. i. 54.</note> and his colleague Lucius
Junius, lost very large fleets by going to sea when
the auguries were adverse. The same fate befell
Agamemnon; for, after the Greeks had begun to

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Raise aloft their frequent clamours, showing scorn of augur's art,</l>
<l>Noise prevailed and not the omen: he then bade the ships depart.</l></quote> <bibl>Probably from the <title>Dulorestes</title> of Pacuvius.</bibl></cit></quote></p>

<p>"But why cite such ancient instances? We see
what happened to Marcus Crassus<note>Triumvir with Caesar and Pompey, killed in the Parthian War, 53 B.C. See ii. 84.</note> when he ignored
the announcement of unfavourable omens. It was
on the charge of having on this occasion falsified
the auspices that Gaius Ateius, an honourable man
and a distinguished citizen, was, on insufficient
evidence, stigmatized by the then censor Appius,
who was your associate in the augural college,
and an able one too, as I have often heard you
say. I grant you that in pursuing the course he
did Appius was within his rights as a censor, if, in
his judgement, Ateius had announced a fraudulent
augury. But he showed no capacity whatever as
an augur in holding Ateius responsible for that
awful disaster which befell the Roman people. Had
this been the cause then the fault would not have
been in Ateius, who made the announcement that
the augury was unfavourable, but in Crassus, who
disobeyed it; for the issue proved that the announce-

<pb id="p.259"/>

ment was true, as this same augur and censor admits.
But even if the augury had been false it could not
have been the cause of the disaster; for unfavourable auguries&mdash;and the same may be said of auspices,
omens, and all other signs&mdash;are not the causes of
what follows: they merely foretell what will occur
unless precautions are taken. <milestone unit="section" n="30"/>Therefore Ateius, by
his announcement, did not create the cause of the
disaster; but having observed the sign he simply
advised Crassus what the result would be if the
warning was ignored. It follows, then, that the
announcement by Ateius of the unfavourable
augury had no effect; or if it did, as Appius thinks,
then the sin is not in him who gave the warning,
but in him who disregarded it.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>"And whence, pray, did you augurs derive
that staff, which is the most conspicuous mark of
your priestly office? It is the very one, indeed,
with which Romulus marked out<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> marked out with his staff a certain quarter (<hi rend="italics">templum</hi>)
where he would take his augury. In Livy i. 6 Romulus
takes the Palatine as his <hi rend="italics">templum,</hi> Remus the Aventine;
but usually <hi rend="italics">templum</hi>=a quarter in the sky.</note> the quarter for
taking observations when he founded the city.
Now this staff is a crooked wand, slightly curved at
the top, and, because of its resemblance to a trumpet,
derives its name from the Latin word meaning
'the trumpet with which the battle-charge is sounded.'
It was placed in the temple of the Salii on the
Palatine hill and, though the temple was burned,
the staff was found uninjured.<note>This temple was burned 390 B.C. by the Gauls when they
sacked the city, and everything in the temple, except this
staff, was burned. <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Val. Max. i. 1; Livy v. 41; Plut.
<hi rend="italics">Camil.</hi> 32.</note> <milestone unit="section" n="31"/>What ancient
chronicler fails to mention the fact that in the reign
of Tarquinius Priscus, long after the time of Romulus,
a quartering of the heavens was made with this
staff by Attus Navius? Because of poverty Attus
was a swineherd in his youth. As the story goes, he,
having lost one of his hogs, made a vow that if he
recovered it he would make an offering to the god

<pb id="p.261"/>

of the largest bunch of grapes in his vineyard
Accordingly, after he had found the hog, he took
his stand, we are told, in the middle of the vineyard,
with his face to the south and divided the vineyard
into four parts. When the birds had shown three
of these parts to be unfavourable, he subdivided the
fourth and last part and then found, as we see it
recorded, a bunch of grapes of marvellous size.</p>
<p>"This occurrence having been noised abroad, all
his neighbours began to consult him about their
own affairs and thus greatly enhanced his name
and fame. <milestone unit="section" n="32"/>The consequence was that King Priscus
summoned him to his presence. The king, wishing
to make trial of his skill as an augur, said to him:
'I am thinking of something; tell me whether
it can be done or not.' Attus, having taken the
auspices, replied that it could be done. Thereupon Tarquin said that what he had been thinking
of was the possibility of cutting a whetstone in two
with a razor, and ordered the trial to be made. So
the stone was brought into the comitium, and, while
the king and his people looked on, it was cut in two
with a razor. The result was that Tarquin employed
him as his augur, and the people consulted him about
their private concerns. <milestone unit="section" n="33"/>Moreover, according to
tradition, the whetstone and razor were buried in
the comitium and a stone curbing placed over them.</p>
<p>"Let us declare this story wholly false; let us
burn the chronicles that contain it; let us call it a

human affairs. But look at this: does not the story
about Tiberius Gracchus found in your own writings<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Cic. <hi rend="italics">De nat. d.</hi> ii. 4.</note>

since you have recorded it. Besides, Tiberius
Gracchus, who was himself an augur, confirmed the
authority of auspices by confessing his error; and
the soothsayers, too, greatly enhanced the reputation of their calling, when brought into the Senate
immediately after the election, by declaring
that the election supervisor had acted without
authority.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="34"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>"I agree, therefore, with those who have
said that there are two kinds of divination: one,
which is allied with art; the other, which is devoid
of art. Those diviners employ art, who, having
learned the known by observation, seek the unknown
by deduction. On the other hand those do without
art who, unaided by reason or deduction or by signs
which have been observed and recorded, forecast
the future while under the influence of mental
excitement, or of some free and unrestrained
emotion. This condition often occurs to men while
dreaming and sometimes to persons who prophesy
while in a frenzy&mdash;like Bacis of Boeotia, Epimenides
of Crete and the Sibyl of Erythraea.<note>This Sibyl was Herophile, who finally went to Cumae.</note> In this latter
class must be placed oracles&mdash;not oracles given by
means of' equalized lots'<note>What is meant by <hi rend="italics">aequatis sortibus</hi> is not known.</note> &mdash;but those uttered under
the impulse of divine inspiration; although divination by lot is not in itself to be despised, if it has
the sanction of antiquity, as in the case of those
lots which, according to tradition, sprang out of the

<pb id="p.265"/>

earth<note>These were small oak tablets which were in the temple
of Fortuna at Praeneste (ii. 41. 86), and had words engraved
on them.</note> ; for in spite of everything, I am inclined to
think that they may, under the power of God, be
so drawn as to give an appropriate response. Men
capable of correctly interpreting all these signs of
the future seem to approach very near to the divine
spirit of the gods whose wills they interpret, just as
scholars<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Plato, <hi rend="italics">Ion</hi> 533 <hi rend="italics">seq.</hi> where the rhapsodist Ion claims
a <foreign lang="greek">qei/a du/namis</foreign> in interpreting Homer.</note> do when they interpret the poets.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="35"/>"What sort of cleverness is it, then, that would
attempt by sophistry to overthrow facts that antiquity
has established? I fail&mdash;you tell me&mdash;to discover
their cause. That, perhaps, is one of Nature's
hidden secrets. God has not willed me to know
the cause, but only that I should use the means
which he has given. Therefore, I will use them and
I will not allow myself to be persuaded that the
whole Etruscan nation has gone stark mad on the
subject of entrails, or that these same people are
in error about lightnings, or that they are false
interpreters of portents; for many a time the rumblings and roarings and quakings of the earth have
given to our republic and to other states certain
forewarnings of subsequent disaster. <milestone unit="section" n="36"/>Why, then,
when here recently a mule (which is an animal
ordinarily sterile by nature) brought forth a foal,<note>For another instance see Herod. iii. 151&ndash;153.</note> 
need anyone have scoffed because the soothsayers
from that occurrence prophesied a progeny of countless evils to the state?</p>
<p>"What, pray, do you say of that well-known
incident of Tiberius Gracchus, the son of Publius?
He was censor and consul twice; besides that he
was a most competent augur, a wise man and a preeminent citizen. Yet he, according to the account
left us by his son Gaius, having caught two snakes
in his home, called in the soothsayers to consult

<pb id="p.267"/>

them. They advised him that if he let the male
snake go his wife must die in a short time; and if
he released the female snake his own death must
soon occur. Thinking it more fitting that a speedy
death should overtake him rather than his young
wife, who was the daughter of Publius Africanus,
he released the female snake and died within a
few days. <milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>Let us laugh at the soothsayers,
brand them as frauds and impostors and scorn their
calling, even though a very wise man, Tiberius
Gracchus, and the results and circumstances of
his death have given proof of its trustworthiness;
let us scorn the Babylonians, too, and those astrologers who, from the top of Mount Caucasus, observe
the celestial signs and with the aid of mathematics
follow the courses of the stars; let us, I say, convict
of folly, falsehood, and shamelessness the men whose
records, as they themselves assert, cover a period
of four hundred and seventy thousand years;<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Diodorus Sic. <hi rend="italics">Bibl.</hi> ii. p. 118 (473,000); Lac

and let us pronounce them liars, utterly indifferent
to the opinion of succeeding generations. <milestone unit="section" n="37"/>Come,
let us admit that the barbarians are all base deceivers, but are the Greek historians liars too?</p>
<p>"Speaking now of natural divination, everybody
knows the oracular responses which the Pythian
Apollo gave to Croesus, to the Athenians, Spartans,
Tegeans, Argives, and Corinthians. Chrysippus has
collected a vast number of these responses, attested
in every instance by abundant proof. But I pass
them by as you know them well. I will urge only
this much, however, in defence: the oracle at
Delphi never would have been so much frequented.
so famous, and so crowded with offerings from peoples
and kings of every land, if all ages had not tested

<pb id="p.269"/>

the truth of its prophecies. For a long time now
that has not been the case. <milestone unit="section" n="38"/>Therefore, as at present
its glory has waned because it is no longer noted
for the truth of its prophecies, so formerly it would
not have enjoyed so exalted a reputation if it had
not been trustworthy in the highest degree. Possibly, too, those subterraneous exhalations which
used to kindle the soul of the Pythian priestess with
divine inspiration have gradually vanished in the
long lapse of time; just as within our own knowledge some rivers have dried up and disappeared,
while others, by winding and twisting, have changed
their course into other channels. But explain the
decadence of the oracle as you wish, since it offers
a wide field for discussion, provided you grant what
cannot be denied without distorting the entire
record of history, that the oracle at Delphi made
true prophecies for many hundreds of years.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="39"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>"But let us leave oracles and come to
dreams. In his treatise on this subject Chrysippus,
just as Antipater does, has assembled a mass of
trivial dreams which he explains according to Antiphon's rules of interpretation. The work, I admit,
displays the acumen of its author, but it would
have been better if he had cited illustrations of a
more serious type. Now, Philistus, who was a
learned and painstaking man and a contemporary
of the times of which he writes, gives us the following
story of the mother of Dionysius, the tyrant of
Syracuse: while she was with child and was carrying this same Dionysius in her womb, she dreamed
that she had been delivered of an infant satyr.
When she referred this dream to the interpreters of
portents, who in Sicily were called ' Galeotae,' they

<pb id="p.271"/>

replied, so Philistus relates, that she would bring
forth a son who would be very eminent in Greece
and would enjoy a long and prosperous career.</p>

foreign instances. Heraclides Ponticus, a man of
learning, and both a pupil and a disciple of Plato's,
relates a dream of the mother of Phalaris. She
fell asleep and dreamed that, while looking at the
consecrated images of the gods set up in her house,
she saw the statue of Mercury pouring blood from
a bowl which it held in its right hand and that the
blood, as it touched the ground, welled up and
completely filled the house. The truth of the dream
was subsequently established by the inhuman cruelty
of her son.</p>
<p>"Why need I bring forth from Dinon's Persian
annals the dreams of that famous prince, Cyrus,
and their interpretations by the magi? But take
this instance: Once upon a time Cyrus dreamed
that the sun was at his feet. Three times, so Dinon
writes, he vainly tried to grasp it and each time it
turned away, escaped him, and finally disappeared.
He was told by the magi, who are classed as wise and
learned men among the Persians, that his grasping
for the sun three times portended that he would reign
for thirty years.<note>This is the length of his reign as usually given, but some
give it as thirty-one years. <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Herod. i. 214; Sulpic. Sev,

<pb id="p.277"/>

The fate of Hercules is mine. For when this mortal
frame is burned the soul will find the light.' When
Alexander directed him to speak if he wished to
say anything to him, he answered: 'Thank you,
nothing, except that I shall see you very soon.
So it turned out, for Alexander died in Babylon a
few days later. I am getting slightly away from
dreams, but I shall return to them in a moment.
Everybody knows that on the same night in which
Olympias was delivered of Alexander the temple
of Diana at Ephesus was burned, and that the magi
began to cry out as the day was breaking: 'Asia's
deadly curse was born last night.' But enough of

writes that Hannibal wished to carry off a golden
column from Juno's temple at Lacinium, but since
he was in doubt whether it was solid or plated, he
bored into it. Finding it solid he decided to take
it away. But at night Juno came to him in a vision
and warned him not to do so, threatening that if
he did she would cause the loss of his good eye.
That clever man did not neglect the warning. Moreover out of the gold filings he ordered an image of
a calf to be made and placed on top of the column.
<milestone unit="section" n="49"/>Another story of Hannibal is found in the history
written in Greek by Silenus, whom Coelius follows,
and who, by the way, was a very painstaking student
of Hannibal's career. After his capture of Saguntum
Hannibal dreamed that Jupiter summoned him to
a council of the gods. When he arrived Jupiter
ordered him to carry the war into Italy, and gave
him one of the divine council as a guide whom he
employed when he began the march with his army.

<pb id="p.279"/>

This guide cautioned Hannibal not to look back
But, carried away by curiosity, he could refrain
no longer and looked back. Then he saw a horrible
beast of enormous size, enveloped with snakes, and
wherever it went it overthrew every tree and shrub
and every house. In his amazement Hannibal
asked what the monster was. The god replied
that it was the desolation of Italy and ordered him
to press right on and not to worry about what
happened behind him and in the rear.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="50"/>"We read in a history by Agathocles that Hamilcar, the Carthaginian, during his siege of Syracuse
heard a voice in his sleep telling him that he would
dine the next day in Syracuse. At daybreak the
following day a serious conflict broke out in his
camp between the troops of the Carthaginians and
their allies, the Siculi. When the Syracusans saw
this they made a sudden assault on the camp and
carried Hamilcar off alive. Thus the event verified
the dream.</p>
<p>"History is full of such instances, and so is everyday life. <milestone unit="section" n="51"/>And yet let me cite another: the famous
Publius Decius, son of Quintus, and the first of
that family to become consul, was military tribune
in the consulship<note>343 B.C.</note> of Marcus Valerius and Aulus
Cornelius while our army was being hard pressed
by the Samnites. When, because of his rushing
too boldly into the dangers of battle, he was
advised to be more cautious, he replied, according
to the annals, 'I dreamed that by dying in the
midst of the enemy I should win immortal fame.'
And though he was unharmed at that time and
extricated the army from its difficulties, yet
three years later, when consul, he devoted himself

<pb id="p.281"/>

to death<note>For the ceremony of devotion see Livy viii. 9.</note> and rushed full-armed against the battle
line of the Latins. By this act of his the Latins
were overcome and destroyed; and so glorious was
his death that his son sought the same fate. <milestone unit="section" n="52"/>But
let us come now, if you please, to the dreams of
philosophers.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>"We read in Plato that Socrates, while
in prison, said in a conversation with his friend Crito:
'I am to die in three days; for in a dream I saw
a woman of rare beauty, who called me by name and
quoted this verse from Homer:<note><hi rend="italics">Iliad</hi> ix. 363, where Achilles says <foreign lang="greek">h(/mati/ ken trita/tw| *fqi/hn e)ribwlon i(koi/mhn.</foreign> Phthia, in Thessaly, was his home,

at end. To Socrates Phthia implied his heavenly home.</note> 

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l>'Gladly on Phthia's shore the third day's dawn shall behold thee.'</l></quote>

And history informs us that his death occurred as
he had foretold. That disciple of Socrates, Xenophon&mdash;and what a man he was!&mdash;records<note>Xen. <hi rend="italics">Anab.</hi> iii. 1. 11; iv. 3. 8.</note> the dreams
he had during his campaign with Cyrus the Younger,
and their remarkable fulfilment. <milestone unit="section" n="53"/>Shall we say that
Xenophon is either a liar or a madman?</p>
<p>"And Aristotle, who was endowed with a matchless and almost godlike intellect,&mdash;is he in error, or
is he trying to lead others into error in the following
account of his friend, Eudemus<note>His work <hi rend="italics">Eudemos,</hi> or <foreign lang="greek">peri\ yuxh=s,</foreign> is lost. <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Plut.
<hi rend="italics">Dion,</hi> 22.</note> the Cyprian?
Eudemus, while on his way to Macedonia, reached
Pherae, then a very famous city of Thessaly, but
groaning under the cruel sway of the tyrant, Alexander.<note>He was killed by his brothers-in-law about 350 B.C.
<hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Xen. <hi rend="italics">Hellen.</hi> vi. 4. 35.</note> There he became so violently ill that the
physicians despaired of his recovery. While sick
he had a dream in which a youth of striking beauty
told him that he would speedily get well; that the

<pb id="p.283"/>

despot Alexander would die in a few days, and that
he himself would return home five years later. And
so, indeed, the first two prophecies, as Aristotle
writes, were immediately fulfilled by the recovery
of Eudemus and by the death of the tyrant at the
hands of his wife's brothers. But at the end of
five years, when, in reliance upon the dream, he
hoped to return to Cyprus from Sicily, he was killed
in battle before Syracuse. Accordingly the dream
was interpreted to mean that when his soul left
the body it then had returned home.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="54"/>"To the testimony of philosophers let us add that
of a most learned man and truly divine poet,
Sophocles. A heavy gold dish having been stolen
from the temple of Hercules, the god himself
appeared to Sophocles in a dream and told who had
committed the theft. But Sophocles ignored the
dream a first and second time. When it came again
and again, he went up to the Areopagus and laid
the matter before the judges who ordered the man
named by Sophocles to be arrested. The defendant
after examination confessed his crime and brought
back the dish. This is the reason why that temple
is called 'the temple of Hercules the Informer.'</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="55"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>"But why am I dwelling on illustrations
from Greek sources when&mdash;though I can't explain it
&mdash;those from our own history please me more?
Now here is a dream which is mentioned by all our
historians, by the Fabii and the Gellii and, most
recently, by Coelius: During the Latin War when
the Great Votive Games were being celebrated for
the first time the city was suddenly called to arms
and the games were interrupted. Later it was
determined to repeat them, but before they began,

<pb id="p.285"/>

and while the people were taking their seats, a
slave bearing a yoke was led about the circus and
beaten with rods. After that a Roman rustic had
a dream in which someone appeared to him and
said that he disapproved of the leader<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the slave just referred to. The games were opened
by beating him round the arena. The name of the rustic
was Tib. Atinius, Livy ii. 36; Val. Max. i. 7. 4.</note> of the games
and ordered this statement to be reported to the
Senate. But the rustic dared not do as he was bid
The order was repeated by the spectre with a
warning not to put his power to the test. Not
even then did the rustic dare obey. After that his
son died and the same vision was repeated the third
time. Thereupon he became ill and told his friends
of his dream. On their advice he was carried to
the Senate-house on a litter and, having related his
dream to the Senate, his health was restored and
he walked home unaided. And so, the tradition
is, the Senate gave credence to the dream and had
the games repeated.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="56"/>"According to this same Coelius, Gaius Gracchus
told many persons that his brother Tiberius came
to him in a dream when he was a candidate for the
quaestorship and said: 'However much you may
try to defer your fate, nevertheless you must die
the same death that I did.' This happened before
Gaius was tribune of the people, and Coelius writes
that he himself heard it from Gaius who had repeated
it to many others. Can you find anything better
authenticated than this dream?</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>"And who, pray, can make light of the
two following dreams which are so often recounted
by Stoic writers? The first one is about Simonides,
who once saw the dead body of some unknown
man lying exposed and buried it. Later, when he
had it in mind to go on board a ship he was warned

<pb id="p.287"/>

in a vision by the person to whom he had given
burial not to do so and that if he did he would
perish in a shipwreck. Therefore he turned back
and all the others who sailed were lost.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="57"/>"The second dream is very well known and is to
this effect: Two friends from Arcadia who were
taking a journey together came to Megara, and one
traveller put up at an inn and the second went
to the home of a friend. After they had eaten
supper and retired, the second traveller, in the dead
of the night, dreamed that his companion was imploring him to come to his aid, as the innkeeper
was planning to kill him. Greatly frightened at
first by the dream he arose, and later, regaining his
composure, decided that there was nothing to worry
about and went back to bed. When he had gone
to sleep the same person appeared to him and said:
'Since you would not help me when I was alive, I
beg that you will not allow my dead body to remain
unburied. I have been killed by the innkeeper,
who has thrown my body into a cart and covered it
with dung. I pray you to be at the city gate in
the morning before the cart leaves the town.'
Thoroughly convinced by the second dream he met
the cart-driver at the gate in the morning, and,
when he asked what he had in the cart, the driver
fled in terror. The Arcadian then removed his
friend's dead body from the cart, made complaint
of the crime to the authorities, and the innkeeper
was punished. <milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>What stronger proof of a
divinely inspired dream than this can be given?</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="58"/>"But why go on seeking illustrations from
ancient history? I had a dream which I have
often related to you, and you one which you have

<pb id="p.289"/>

often told to me. When I was governor of Asia<note>In 61 B.C.; <hi rend="italics">cf. Ad Att.</hi> i. 15 <hi rend="italics">Asiae Quinto obtigisse audisti.</hi>
Quintus had been <hi rend="italics">praetor</hi> (not <hi rend="italics">consul</hi>) in 62.</note> 
I dreamed that I saw you on horseback riding toward
the bank of some large river, when you suddenly
plunged forward, fell into the stream, and wholly
disappeared from sight. I was greatly alarmed
and trembled with fear. But in a moment you
reappeared mounted on the same horse, and with
a cheerful countenance ascended the opposite bank
where we met and embraced each other. The
meaning of the dream was readily explained to me
by experts in Asia who from it predicted those
events which subsequently occurred.<note>Referring to the banishment of Cicero in 58 B.C. at the
instigation of Clodius, and his triumphal recall in 57 B.C.</note> </p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="59"/>"I come now to your dream. I heard it, of
course, from you, but more frequently from our
Sallustius.<note>M. Cicero's freedman who followed him into banishnent.</note> In the course of your banishment, which
was glorious for us but disastrous to the State, you
stopped for the night at a certain country-house
in the plain of Atina. After lying awake most of
the night, finally, about daybreak, you fell into a
very profound sleep. And though your journey was
pressing, yet Sallustius gave instructions to maintain
quiet and would not permit you to be disturbed.
But you awoke about the second hour and related
your dream to him. In it you seemed to be wandering sadly about in solitary places when Gaius
Marius, with his fasces wreathed in laurel,<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> as a token of victory.</note> asked
you why you were sad, and you replied that you had
been driven from your country by violence. He
then bade you be of good cheer, took you by the right
hand, and delivered you to the nearest lictor to be
conducted to his memorial temple,<note>This was the temple erected by Marius to Jupiter to
commemorate his victory over the Cimbri, 101 B.C. The Senate sat in this temple when the act for Cicero's recall
was passed.</note> saying that there
you should find safety. Sallustius thereupon, as he

<pb id="p.291"/>

relates, cried out, 'a speedy and a glorious return
awaits you.' He further states that you too seemed
delighted at the dream. Immediately thereafter it
was reported to me that as soon as you heard that
it was in Marius' temple that the glorious decree
of the Senate for your recall had been enacted on
motion of the consul, a most worthy and most
eminent man,<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> Publius Lentulus; <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> Cic. <hi rend="italics">In Pison.</hi> ch. 15; <hi rend="italics">Pro Sest</hi> 55, 63, 69; <hi rend="italics">Ad fam.</hi> i. 9; <hi rend="italics">Red. in senat.</hi> 4. 9.</note> and that the decree had been greeted
by unprecedented shouts of approval in a densely
crowded theatre, you said that no stronger proof
could be given of a divinely inspired dream than this.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="60"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>"'Ah,' it is objected, 'but many dreams
are untrustworthy.' Rather, perhaps, their meaning
is hidden from us. But grant that some are untrustworthy, why do we declaim against those that
are trustworthy? The fact is the latter would
be much more frequent if we went to our rest in
proper condition. But when we are burdened with
food and drink our dreams are troubled and confused.
Observe what Socrates says in Plato's <hi rend="italics">Republic:</hi><note>Plato, <hi rend="italics">De rep.</hi> ix. p. 571.</note> </p>
<p>"'When a man goes to sleep, having the thinking
and reasoning portion of his soul languid and inert,
but having that other portion, which has in it a
certain brutishness and wild savagery, immoderately gorged with drink and food, then does that
latter portion leap up and hurl itself about in sleep
without check. In such a case every vision presented to the mind is so devoid of thought and
reason that the sleeper dreams that he is committing
incest with his mother, or that he is having unlawful
commerce indiscriminately with gods and men, and
frequently too, with beasts; or even that he is
killing someone and staining his hands with impious
bloodshed; and that he is doing many vile and

<pb id="p.293"/>

hideous things recklessly and without shame. <milestone unit="section" n="61"/>But,
on the other hand, when the man, whose habits of
living and of eating are wholesome and temperate,
surrenders himself to sleep, having the thinking
and reasoning portion of his soul eager and erect,
and satisfied by a feast of noble thoughts, and
having that portion which feeds on carnal pleasures
neither utterly exhausted by abstinence nor cloyed
by over-indulgence&mdash;for, as a rule, the edge of
thought is dulled whether nature is starved or
overfed&mdash;and, when such a man, in addition, has
that third portion of the soul, in which the fire of
anger burns, quieted and subdued&mdash;thus having the
two irrational portions under complete control&mdash;then will the thinking and reasoning portion of his
soul shine forth and show itself keen and strong
for dreaming and then will his dreams be peaceful
and worthy of trust.' I have reproduced Plato's
very words.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="62"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>"Then shall we listen to Epicurus rather
than to Plato? As for Carneades, in his ardour for
controversy he asserts now this and now that.
' But,' you retort, 'Epicurus says what he thinks.'
But he thinks nothing that is ever well reasoned,
or worthy of a philosopher.<note>Adopting Hottinger's interpretation: <hi rend="italics">nihil subtilius
cogitatum, nihil philosopho dignum.</hi></note> Will you, then, put
this man before Plato or Socrates, who though
they gave no reason, would yet prevail over these
petty philosophers by the mere weight of their
name? Now Plato's advice to us is to set out
for the land of dreams with bodies so prepared
that no error or confusion may assail the soul. For
this reason, it is thought, the Pythagoreans were
forbidden to indulge in beans<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Tertull. <hi rend="italics">De anima,</hi> ch. 48; Plut. <hi rend="italics">Sympos.</hi> 9. 10;
Pliny, <hi rend="italics">H.N.</hi> xviii. 12.</note> ; for that food produces great flatulence and induces a condition at war

<pb id="p.295"/>

with a soul in search of truth. <milestone unit="section" n="63"/>When, therefore, the
soul has been withdrawn by sleep from contact with
sensual ties, then does it recall the past, comprehend
the present, and foresee the future. For though
the sleeping body then lies as if it were dead, yet
the soul is alive and strong, and will be much more
so after death when it is wholly free of the body.
Hence its power to divine is much enhanced by the
approach of death. For example, those in the grasp
of a serious and fatal sickness realize the fact that
death impends; and so, visions of dead men generally appear to them and then their desire for fame
is strongest; while those who have lived otherwise
than as they should, feel, at such a time, the keenest
sorrow for their sins.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="64"/>"Moreover, proof of the power of dying men to
prophesy is also given by Posidonius in his well-known account of a certain Rhodian, who, when
on his death-bed, named six men of equal age
and foretold which of them would die first, which
second, and so on. Now Posidonius holds the
view that there are three ways in which men dream
as the result of divine impulse: first, the soul is
clairvoyant of itself because of its kinship with
the gods; second, the air is full of immortal
souls, already clearly stamped, as it were, with
the marks of truth; and third, the gods in person
converse with men when they are asleep. And,
as I said just now, it is when death is at hand
that men most readily discern signs of the future.
<milestone unit="section" n="65"/>This is illustrated by the story which I related
about Callanus and by Homer's account of Hector,
who, as he was dying, prophesied the early death of
Achilles.<note><hi rend="italics">Iliad,</hi> xxii. 358.</note> </p>

<pb id="p.297"/>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>"It is clear that, in our ordinary speech,
we should not have made such frequent use of the
word <hi rend="italics">praesagire,</hi> meaning ' to sense in advance, or
to presage,' if the power of presaging had been
wholly non-existent. An illustration of its use is
seen in the following well-known line from Plautus<note><hi rend="italics">Aulular.</hi> ii. 2. 1.</note> :

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l>My soul presaged as I left home that my leaving was in vain.</l></quote>

Now <hi rend="italics">sagire</hi> means 'to have a keen perception.'
Accordingly certain old women are called <hi rend="italics">sagae,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> witches.</note> 
because they are assumed to know a great deal,
and dogs are said to be 'sagacious.' And so one
who has knowledge of a thing before it happens is
said to 'presage,' that is, to perceive the future in
advance.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="66"/>"Therefore the human soul has an inherent power
of presaging or of foreknowing infused into it from
without, and made a part of it by the will of God.
If that power is abnormally developed, it is called
'frenzy' or 'inspiration,' which occurs when the
soul withdraws itself from the body and is violently
stimulated by a divine impulse, as in the following
instance, where Hecuba says to Cassandra<note>This quotation and the two succeeding are probably
from the <hi rend="italics">Hecuba</hi> of Accius, or from the <hi rend="italics">Alexander</hi> of
Ennius. <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 50. 114.</note> :

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l>But why those flaming eyes, that sudden rage?</l>
<l>And whither fled that sober modesty,</l>
<l>Till now so maidenly and yet so wise?'</l></quote>

and Cassandra answers:

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l>O mother, noblest of thy noble sex!</l>
<l>I have been sent to utter prophecies:</l>
<l>Against my will Apollo drives me mad</l>
<l>To revelation make of future ills.</l>

What a tender and pathetic poem, and how suitable
to her character! though it is not altogether relevant,
I admit. <milestone unit="section" n="67"/>However, the point which I wish to press,
that true prophecies are made during frenzy, has
found expression in the following lines:

<quote rend="blockquote">

It is not Cassandra who next speaks, but a god in

on myths drawn from tragic poets. But you yourself are my authority for an instance of the same
nature, and yet it is not fiction but a real occurrence.
Gaius Coponius, a man of unusual capacity and
learning, came to you at Dyrrachium<note>During the civil war between Caesar and Pompey,
and just before the battle of Pharsalus (Aug. 9, 48 B.C.).</note> while he,
as praetor, was in command of the Rhodian fleet,
and told you of a prediction made by a certain oarsman from one of the Rhodian quinqueremes. The
prediction was that in less than thirty days Greece
would be bathed in blood; Dyrrachium would be
pillaged; its defenders would flee to their ships and,
as they fled, would see behind them the unhappy
spectacle of a great conflagration; but the Rhodian

<note><hi rend="italics">Exitium examen</hi> = <hi rend="italics">turbam malorum,</hi> Hottinger; <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> Cic.
<hi rend="italics">Orat.</hi> 46.</note> 

<pb id="p.301"/>

fleet would have a quick passage home. This story
gave you some concern, and it caused very great alarm
to those cultured men, Marcus Varro and Marcus
Cato, who were at Dyrrachium at the time. In
fact, a few days later Labienus reached Dyrrachium
in flight from Pharsalus, with the news of the loss
of the army. The rest of the prophecy was soon
fulfilled. <milestone unit="section" n="69"/>For the granaries were pillaged and their
contents scattered and strewn all about the streets
and alleys. You and your companions, in great
alarm, suddenly embarked, and as you looked back
at night towards the town you saw the flames of the
merchant ships, which the soldiers (not wishing to
follow) had set on fire. Finally, when your party
had been deserted by the Rhodian fleet you realized
that the prophecy had been fulfilled.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="70"/>"As briefly as I could, I have discussed divination
by means of dreams and frenzy, which, as I said,<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> ii. 18. 34.</note> 
are devoid of art. Both depend on the same reasoning, which is that habitually employed by our friend
Cratippus: 'The human soul is in some degree
derived and drawn from a source exterior to itself.
Hence we understand that outside the human soul
there is a divine soul from which the human soul is
sprung. Moreover, that portion of the human soul
which is endowed with sensation, motion, and carnal
desire is inseparable from bodily influence; while
that portion which thinks and reasons is most
vigorous when it is most distant from the body.'
<milestone unit="section" n="71"/>And so, after giving examples of true prophecies
through frenzy and dreams, Cratippus usually concludes his argument in this way:</p>
<p>"'Though without eyes it is impossible to perform
the act and function of sight, and though the eyes

<pb id="p.303"/>

sometimes cannot perform their appointed function,
yet when a person has even once so employed his
eyes as to see things as they are, he has a realization of what correct vision is. Likewise, therefore,
although without the power of divination it is impossible for the act and function of divining to exist,
and though one with that power may sometimes be
mistaken and may make erroneous prophecies, yet
it is enough to establish the existence of divination
that a single event has been so clearly foretold as
to exclude the hypothesis of chance. But there are
many such instances; therefore, the existence of
divination must be conceded.'</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="72"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>"But those methods of divination which
are dependent on conjecture, or on deductions from
events previously observed and recorded, are, as I
have said before,<note>See 6. 12.</note> not natural, but artificial, and
include the inspection of entrails, augury, and the
interpretation of dreams. These are disapproved of
by the Peripatetics and defended by the Stoics.
Some are based upon records and usage, as is
evident from the Etruscan books on divination by
means of inspection of entrails and by means of
thunder and lightning, and as is also evident from
the books of your augural college; while others are
dependent on conjecture made suddenly and on the
spur of the moment. An instance of the latter
kind is that of Calchas in Homer, prophesying the
number of years of the Trojan War from the number
of sparrows.<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Homer's <hi rend="italics">Il.</hi> ii. 301&ndash;329; and below ii. 30. 63, where
the verses from Homer are quoted.</note> We find another illustration of conjectural divination in the history of Sulla in an
occurrence which you witnessed. While he was
offering sacrifices in front of his head-quarters in the
Nolan district<note>Nola is in Campania and still bears the same name.
This campaign was in 91&ndash;88 B.C.</note> a snake suddenly came out from

<pb id="p.305"/>

beneath the altar. The soothsayer, Gaius Postumius,
begged Sulla to proceed with his march at once.
Sulla did so and captured the strongly fortified
camp of the Samnites which lay in front of the town
of Nola.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="73"/>"Still another instance of conjectural divination
occurred in the case of Dionysius, a little while
before lie began to reign. He was travelling through
the Leontine district, and led his horse down into a
river. The horse was engulfed in a whirlpool and
disappeared. Dionysius did his utmost to extricate
him but in vain and, so Philistus writes, went away
greatly troubled. When he had gone on a short
distance he heard a whinny, looked back and, to his
joy, saw his horse eagerly following and with a
swarm of bees in its mane. The sequel of this
portent was that Dionysius began to reign within
a few days.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="74"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>"Again: what a warning was given to
the Spartans just before the disastrous battle of
Leuctra,<note>Leuctra was a small town in Boeotia, memorable for
the victory won there in 371 B.C. by the Thebans under
Epaminondas over the Spartans.</note> when the armour clanked in the temple
of Hercules and his statue dripped with sweat!
But at the same time, according to Callisthenes, the
folding doors of Hercules' temple at Thebes, though
closed with bars, suddenly opened of their own accord,
and the armour which had been fastened on the
temple walls, was found on the floor. And, at the
same time, at Lebadia, in Boeotia, while divine
honours were being paid to Trophonius,<note>The oracle of Zeus Trophonius was located in a cave
in Lebadia and was much resorted to. <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Aristoph.
<hi rend="italics">Nubes</hi> 508; Athenaeus, 614 A.</note> the cocks
in the neighbourhood began to crow vigorously and
did not leave off. Thereupon the Boeotian augurs
declared that the victory belonged to the Thebans,
because it was the habit of cocks to keep silence
when conquered and to crow when victorious.</p>

<pb id="p.307"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="75"/>"The Spartans received many warnings given at
that time of their impending defeat at Leuctra.
For example, a crown of wild, prickly herbs suddenly
appeared on the head of the statue erected at
Delphi in honour of Lysander, the most eminent
of the Spartans. Furthermore, the Spartans had
set up some golden stars in the temple of Castor
and Pollux at Delphi to commemorate the glorious
victory<note>At Aegospotami 405 B.C.</note> of Lysander over the Athenians, because,
it was said, those gods were seen accompanying the
Spartan fleet in that battle. Now, just before the
battle of Leuctra these divine symbols&mdash;that is,
the golden stars at Delphi, already referred to&mdash;
fell down and were never seen again. <milestone unit="section" n="76"/>But the most
significant warning received by the Spartans was
this: they sent to consult the oracle of Jupiter at
Dodona as to the chances of victory. After their
messengers had duly set up the vessel in which were
the lots, an ape, kept by the king of Molossia for
his amusement, disarranged the lots and everything
else used in consulting the oracle, and scattered them
in all directions. Then, so we are told, the priestess
who had charge of the oracle said that the Spartans
must think of safety and not of victory.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="77"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>"Again, did not Gaius Flaminius<note>Gaius Flaminius Nepos was defeated and slain 217 B.C.,
by Hannibal at Lake Trasimenus with the loss of 15,000
troops. <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Livy xxi. 57, 63.</note> by his
neglect of premonitory signs in his second consulship in the Second Punic War cause great disaster
to the State? For, after a review of his army, he
had moved his camp and was marching towards
Arretium to meet Hannibal, when his horse, for
no apparent reason, suddenly fell with him just in
front of the statue of Jupiter Stator. Although the
soothsayers considered this a divine warning not to
join battle, he did not so regard it. Again, after the

<pb id="p.309"/>

auspices by means of the <hi rend="italics">tripudium</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Cf. i.</hi> 15. 28, and ii. 34. 72.</note> had been taken
the keeper of the sacred chickens advised the postponement of battle. Flaminius then asked,' Suppose
the chickens should never eat, what would you
advise in that case?' 'You should remain in camp,'
was the reply. 'Fine auspices indeed!' said
Flaminius, 'for they counsel action when chickens'
crops are empty and inaction when chickens' crops
are filled.' So he ordered the standards to be
plucked up and the army to follow him. Then, when
the standard-bearer of the first company could not
loosen his standard, several soldiers came to his
assistance, but to no purpose. This fact was reported
to Flaminius, and he, with his accustomed obstinacy,
ignored it. The consequence was that within three
hours his army was cut to pieces and he himself
was slain. <milestone unit="section" n="78"/>Coelius has added the further notable
fact that, at the very time this disastrous battle
was going on, earthquakes of such violence occurred
in Liguria, in Gaul, on several islands, and in every
part of Italy, that a large number of towns were
destroyed, landslips took place in many regions,
the earth sank, rivers flowed upstream, and the sea
invaded their channels.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>"Trustworthy conjectures in divining
are made by experts. For instance, when Midas,
the famous king of Phrygia, was a child, ants filled
his mouth with grains of wheat as he slept. It was
predicted that he would be a very wealthy man; and
so it turned out. Again, while Plato was an infant,
asleep in his cradle, bees settled on his lips and this
was interpreted to mean that he would have a rare
sweetness of speech. Hence in his infancy his future
eloquence was foreseen. <milestone unit="section" n="79"/>And what about your

<pb id="p.311"/>

beloved and charming friend Roscius<note>The famous actor.</note> ? Did he lie
or did the whole of Lanuvium lie for him in telling
the following incident: In his cradle days, while he
was being reared in Solonium, a plain in the Lanuvian
district, his nurse suddenly awoke during the night
and by the light of a lamp observed the child asleep
with a snake coiled about him. She was greatly
frightened at the sight and gave an alarm. His
father referred the occurrence to the soothsayers,
who replied that the boy would attain unrivalled
eminence and glory. Indeed, Pasiteles has engraved
the scene in silver and our friend Archias has
described it in verse.</p>
<p>"Then what do we expect? Do we wait for
the immortal gods to converse with us in the forum,
on the street, and in our homes? While they do
not, of course, present themselves in person, they
do diffuse their power far and wide&mdash;sometimes
enclosing it in caverns of the earth and sometimes
imparting it to human beings. The Pythian priestess
at Delphi was inspired by the power of the earth<note>The divine afflatus was supposed to be connected with
an exhalation (<hi rend="italics">spiritus</hi>) from a chasm.</note> 
and the Sibyl by that of nature. Why need you
marvel at this? Do we not see how the soils of
the earth vary in kind? Some are deadly, like that
about Lake Ampsanctus<note>Lake Ampsanctus was in Samnium and reputed to be an
entrance to the infernal regions. <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Virgil, <hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> vii. 563.</note> in the country of the Hirpini and that of Plutonia in Asia, both of which I
have seen. Even in the same neighbourhood, some
parts are salubrious and some are not; some produce
men of keen wit, others produce fools. These
diverse effects are all the result of differences in
climate and differences in the earth's exhalations.
<milestone unit="section" n="80"/>It often happens, too, that the soul is violently
stirred by the sight of some object, or by the deep
tones of a voice, or by singing. Frequently anxiety

<pb id="p.313"/>

or fear will have that effect, as it did in the case
of Hesione, who

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>"And poetic inspiration also proves
that there is a divine power within the human soul.
Democritus says that no one can be a great poet
without being in a state of frenzy, and Plato says
the same thing. Let Plato call it 'frenzy' if he
will, provided he praises it as it was praised in his

one who invaded Macedonia and perished there in 278 B.C.</note> and to his Gallic troops after
he had made an impious attack on the temple of

Brennus:

<pb id="p.315"/>

of foresight and of prophecy. But, for my part, I am
inclined to think that such a power is not to be attributed either to a diseased stomach or to a disordered
brain. On the contrary, it is the healthy soul and
not the sickly body that has the power of divination.
<milestone unit="section" n="82"/>The Stoics, for example, establish the existence of
divination by the following process of reasoning:</p>
<p>"'If there are gods and they do not make clear
to man in advance what the future will be, then
they do not love man; or, they themselves do not
know what the future will be; or, they think that
it is of no advantage to man to know what it will
be; or, they think it inconsistent with their dignity
to give man forewarnings of the future; or, finally,
they, though gods, cannot give intelligible signs of
coming events. But it is not true that the gods
do not love us, for they are the friends and benefactors of the human race; nor is it true that they
do not know their own decrees and their own plans;
nor is it true that it is of no advantage to us
to know what is going to happen, since we should
be more prudent if we knew nor is it true that the
gods think it inconsistent with their dignity to give
forecasts, since there is no more excellent quality
than kindness; nor is it true that they have not
the power to know the future; <milestone unit="section" n="83"/>therefore it is not
true that there are gods and yet that they do not
give us signs of the future; but there are gods,
therefore they give us such signs; and if they give
such signs, it is not true that they give us no
means to understand those signs&mdash;otherwise their
signs would be useless; and if they give us the
means, it is not true that there is no divination;
therefore there is divination.'</p>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="84"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>"Chrysippus, Diogenes, and Antipater
employ the same reasoning. Then what ground is
there to doubt the absolute truth of my position?
For I have on my side reason, facts, peoples, and
races, both Greek and barbarian, our own ancestors,
the unvarying belief of all ages, the greatest philosophers, the poets, the wisest men, the builders of
cities, and the founders of republics. Are we not
satisfied with the unanimous judgement of men,
and do we wait for beasts to give their testimony
too? <milestone unit="section" n="85"/>The truth is that no other argument of any
sort is advanced to show the futility of the various
kinds of divination which I have mentioned except
the fact that it is difficult to give the cause or reason
of every kind of divination. You ask, 'Why is it
that the soothsayer, when he finds a cleft in the
lung of the victim, even though the other vitals are
sound, stops the execution of an undertaking and
defers it to another day?' 'Why does an augur
think it a favourable omen when a raven flies to
the right, or a crow to the left?' 'Why does an
astrologer consider that the moon's conjunction with
the planets Jupiter and Venus at the birth of children
is a favourable omen, and its conjunction with Saturn
or Mars unfavourable?' Again, 'Why does God
warn us when we are asleep and fail to do so when
we are awake?' Finally, 'Why is it that mad
Cassandra foresees coming events and wise Priam
cannot do the same?'</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="86"/>"You ask why everything happens. You have
a perfect right to ask, but that is not the point at
issue now. The question is, Does it happen, or does
it not? For example, if I were to say that the magnet
attracted iron and drew it to itself, and I could not

<pb id="p.319"/>

tell you why, then I suppose you would utterly
deny that the magnet had any such power. At least
that is the course you pursue in regard to the
existence of the power of divination, although it is
established by our own experience and that of
others, by our reading and by the traditions of our
forefathers. Why, even before the dawn of philosophy, which is a recent discovery, the average man
had no doubt about divination, and, since its development, no philosopher of any sort of reputation has
had any different view. <milestone unit="section" n="87"/>I have already cited Pythagoras, Democritus, and Socrates and, of the ancients,
I have excluded no one except Xenophanes. To
them I have added the Old Academy, the Peripatetics; and the Stoics. The only dissenter is
Epicurus. But why wonder at that? for is his
opinion of divination any more discreditable than
his view that there is no such thing as a disinterested
virtue?</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>"But is there a man anywhere who is uninfluenced by clear and unimpeachable records
signed and sealed by the hand of Time? For
example, Homer writes that Calchas was by far
the best augur among the Greeks and that he commanded the Greek fleet before Troy. His command
of the fleet I suppose was due to his skill as an augur
and not to his skill in seamanship. <milestone unit="section" n="88"/>Amphilochus
and Mopsus were kings of Argos, but they were
augurs too, and they founded Greek cities on
the coasts of Cilicia. And even before them were
Amphiaraus and Tiresias. They were no lowly and
unknown men, nor were they like the persons
described by Ennius,

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l>Who, for their own gain, uphold opinions that are false,</l></quote>

<pb id="p.321"/>

but they were eminent men of the noblest
type and foretold the future by means of augural
signs. In speaking of Tiresias, even when in the
infernal regions, Homer says that he alone was
wise, that the rest were mere wandering shadows.<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Homer, <hi rend="italics">Od.</hi> x. 492.</note> 
As for Amphiaraus, his reputation in Greece was
such that he was honoured as a god, and oracular
responses were sought in the place where he was
buried.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="89"/>"Furthermore, did not Priam, the Asiatic king,
have a son, Helenus, and a daughter, Cassandra,
who prophesied, the first by means of auguries and
the other when under a heaven-inspired excitement
and exaltation of soul? In the same class, as we
read in the records of our forefathers, were those
famous Marcian brothers,<note>Mentioned by Servius in <hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi> vi. 70 and 72 as having
their oracles preserved along with the Sibylline books.</note> men of noble birth. And
does not Homer relate that Polyidus of Corinth<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Homer, <hi rend="italics">Il.</hi> xiii. 663.</note> 
not only made many predictions to others, but
that he also foretold the death of his own son, who
was setting out for Troy? As a general rule among
the ancients the men who ruled the state had
control likewise of augury, for they considered
divining, as well as wisdom, becoming to a king.
Proof of this is afforded by our State wherein the
kings were augurs; and, later, private citizens
endowed with the same priestly office ruled the
republic by the authority of religion.<note>The priestly functions of the <quote>king</quote> were afterwards
exercised by a <hi rend="italics">rex sacrorum.</hi></note> </p>

knew one of them myself, Divitiacus, the Aeduan,
your guest and eulogist. He claimed to have that
knowledge of nature which the Greeks call ' physiologia,' and he used to make predictions, sometimes

<pb id="p.323"/>

by means of augury and sometimes by means of
conjecture. Among the Persians the augurs and
diviners are the magi, who assemble regularly in a
sacred place for practice and consultation, just as
formerly you augurs used to do on the Nones.
<milestone unit="section" n="91"/>Indeed, no one can become king of the Persians
until he has learned the theory and the practice of
the magi. Moreover, you may see whole families
and tribes devoted to this art. For example, Telmessus in Caria is a city noted for its cultivation of
the soothsayer's art, and there is also Elis in Peloponnesus, which has permanently set aside two families
as soothsayers, the Iamidae and the Clutidae,<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Herod. ix. 33.</note> who
are distinguished for superior skill in their art. In
Syria the Chaldeans are pre-eminent for their knowledge of astronomy and for their quickness of mind.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="92"/>"Again, the Etrurians are very skilful in observing thunderbolts, in interpreting their meaning and
that of every sign and portent. That is why, in
the days of our forefathers, it was wisely decreed
by the Senate, when its power was in full vigour,
that, of the sons of the chief men, six should
be handed over to each of the Etruscan tribes<note>Val. Max. i. I says that ten (not six) were handed over.
Editors differ as to whether the youths set apart were Roman
or Etruscan. See Moser, <hi rend="italics">De div.</hi> p. 106, note; Wissowa,

for the study of divination, in order that so important a profession should not, on account of the
poverty of its members, be withdrawn from the influence of religion, and converted into a means of
mercenary gain. On the other hand the Phrygians,
Pisidians, Cilicians, and Arabians rely chiefly on the
signs conveyed by the flights of birds, and the
Umbrians, according to tradition, used to do the same.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="93"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>"Now, for my part, I believe that the
character of the country determined the kind
of divination which its inhabitants adopted. For

<pb id="p.325"/>

example, the Egyptians and Babylonians, who live
on the level surface of open plains, with no hills to
obstruct a view of the sky, have devoted their attention wholly to astrology. But the Etruscans, being
in their nature of a very ardent religious temperament and accustomed to the frequent sacrifice of
victims, have given their chief attention to the study
of entrails. And as on account of the density of
the atmosphere signs from heaven were common
among them, and furthermore since that atmospheric condition caused many phenomena both of
earth and sky and also certain prodigies that occur
in the conception and birth of men and cattle&mdash;for
these reasons the Etruscans have become very proficient in the interpretation of portents. Indeed,
the inherent force of these means of divination, as
you like to observe,<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Cic. <hi rend="italics">N.D.</hi> ii. 3. 7, which the present passage almost
repeats.</note> is clearly shown by the very
words so aptly chosen by our ancestors to describe
them. Because they 'make manifest' (<hi rend="italics">ostendunt</hi>),
'portend ' (<hi rend="italics">portendunt</hi>), ' intimate ' (<hi rend="italics">monstrant</hi>),'predict ' (<hi rend="italics">praedicunt</hi>),they are called ' manifestations,'
' portents,' ' intimations,' and 'prodigies.' <milestone unit="section" n="94"/>But the
Arabians, Phrygians, and Cilicians, being chiefly
engaged in the rearing of cattle, are constantly
wandering over the plains and mountains in winter
and summer and, on that account, have found it
quite easy to study the songs and flights of birds.
The same is true of the Pisidians and of our fellowcountrymen, the Umbrians. While the Carians,
and especially the Telmessians, already mentioned,
because they live in a country with a very rich and
prolific soil, whose fertility produces many abnormal
growths, have turned their attention to the study
of prodigies.</p>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="95"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>"But who fails to observe that auspices
and all other kinds of divination flourish best in the
best regulated states? And what king or people
has there ever been who did not employ divination? I do not mean in time of peace only, but
much more even in time of war, when the strife
and struggle for safety is hardest. Passing by our
own countrymen, who do nothing in war without
examining entrails and nothing in peace without
taking the auspices, let us look at the practice of
foreign nations The Athenians, for instance, in
every public assembly always had present certain
priestly diviners, whom they call <hi rend="italics">manteis.</hi> The
Spartans assigned an augur to their kings as a
judicial adviser, and they also enacted that an augur
should be present in their Council of Elders, which
is the name of their Senate. In matters of grave
concern they always consulted the oracle at Delphi,
or that of Jupiter Hammon or that of Dodona.
<milestone unit="section" n="96"/>Lycurgus himself, who once governed the Spartan
state, established his laws by authority of Apollo's
Delphic oracle, and Lysander, who wished to repeal
them, was prevented from doing so by the religious
scruples of the people. Moreover, the Spartan
rulers, not content with their deliberations when
awake, used to sleep in a shrine of Pasipha&euml; which
is situated in a field near the city, in order to dream
there, because they believed that oracles received
in repose were true.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="97"/>"I now return to instances at home. How many
times the Senate has ordered the decemvirs to
consult the Sibylline books! How often in matters
of grave concern it has obeyed the responses of the
soothsayers! Take the following examples: When

wars and deadly revolutions, the responses of the
soothsayers were in agreement with the Sibylline
verses.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="98"/>"And what of those other instances? As when,
for example, the statue of Apollo at Cumae and
that of Victory at Capua dripped with sweat; when
that unlucky prodigy, the hermaphrodite, was born;
when the river Atratus<note>Nothing is known of this river.</note> ran with blood; when
there were showers frequently of stone, sometimes
of blood, occasionally of earth and even of milk;
and finally, when lightning struck the statue of the
Centaur on the Capitoline hill, the gates and some
people on the Aventine and the temples of Castor
and Pollux at Tusculum and of Piety at Rome&mdash;
in each of these cases did not the soothsayers give
prophetic responses which were afterwards fulfilled? And were not these same prophecies found
in the Sibylline books?</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="99"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>"In recent times, during the Marsian
war,<note>91&ndash;89 B.C.</note> the temple of Juno Sospita was restored
because of a dream of Caecilia, the daughter of

with blood, the heavens opened, voices from unknown

which we find in our annals? During the Veientian

certain nobleman of Veii deserted to us and said
that, according to the prophecies of the Veientian
books, their city could not be taken while the lake
was at flood, and that if its waters were permitted
to overflow and take their own course to the sea
the result would be disastrous to the Roman people;
on the other hand, if the waters were drained off
in such a way that they did not reach the sea the
result would be to our advantage. In consequence
of this announcement our forefathers dug that
marvellous canal to drain off the waters from the
Alban lake.<note>For an account of how this irrigation project was begun
<hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Camillus,</hi> ch. 3. ff.</note> Later when the Veientians had grown
weary of war and had sent ambassadors to the
Senate to treat for peace, one of them is reported
to have said that the deserter had not dared to
tell the whole of the prophecy contained in the
Veientian books, for those books, he said, also foretold the early capture of Rome by the Gauls. And
this, as we know, did occur six years after the fall
of Veii.</p>

<pb id="p.333"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="101"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>"Again, we are told that fauns have often
been heard in battle and that during turbulent
times truly prophetic messages have been sent from
mysterious places. Out of many instances of this
class I shall give only two, but they are very striking.
Not long before the capture of the city by the Gauls,
a voice, issuing from Vesta's sacred grove, which
slopes from the foot of the Palatine Hill to the New
Road, was heard to say, 'the walls and gates must
be repaired; unless this is done the city will be
taken.'<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi>Livy v. 32 and 50.</note> Neglect of this warning, while it was
possible to heed it, was atoned for after the supreme
disaster had occurred; for, adjoining the grove, an
altar, which is now to be seen enclosed with a
hedge, was dedicated to Aius the Speaker. The
other illustration has been reported by many
writers. At the time of the earthquake a voice
came from Juno's temple on the citadel commanding that an expiatory sacrifice be made of a pregnant
sow. From this fact the goddess was called Juno
the Adviser. Are we, then, lightly to regard these
warnings which the gods have sent and our forefathers adjudged to be trustworthy?</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="102"/>"Nor is it only to the voices of the gods that the
Pythagoreans have paid regard but also to the
utterances of men which they term 'omens.' Our
ancestors, too, considered such 'omens' worthy of
respect, and for that reason, before entering upon
any business enterprise, used to say, ' May the issue
be prosperous, propitious, lucky, and successful.' At
public celebrations of religious rites they gave the
command, 'Guard your tongues'; and in issuing
the order for the Latin festival the customary injunction was, ' Let the people refrain from strife

<pb id="p.335"/>

and quarrelling.' So too, when the sacred ceremony
of purification was held by one starting on an
expedition to found a colony, or when the commander-in-chief was reviewing his army, or the censor was
taking his census, it was the rule to choose men
with names of good omen to lead the victims.
Furthermore, the consuls in making a levy of troops
take pains to see that the first soldier enlisted is one
with a lucky name. <milestone unit="section" n="103"/>You, of course, are aware that
you, both as consul at home and later as commander
in the field, employed the same precaution with
the most scrupulous care. In the case, too, of the
prerogative tribe or century, our forefathers determined that it should be the 'omen' of a proper
election.<note><hi rend="italics"> Cf. Pro Murena</hi> 18. 38 <hi rend="italics">omen praerogativae.</hi> <quote>The

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/>"Now let me give some well-known
examples of omens: When Lucius Paulus was
consul the second time, and had been chosen to wage
war against King Perses, upon returning home
on the evening of the day on which he had been
appointed, he noticed, as he kissed his little
daughter Tertia (at that time a very small child), that
she was rather sad. 'What is the matter, Tertia,
my dear? Why are you sad?' 'Oh! father,
Persa is dead.' Paulus clasped the child in a closer
embrace and said, 'Daughter, I accept that as an
omen.' Now ' Persa' was the name of a little dog
that had died. <milestone unit="section" n="104"/>I heard Lucius Flaccus,<note>Probably L. Valerius Flaccus, praetor 63 B.C., and defended for embezzlement by Cicero in 60.</note> the high
priest of Mars, relate the following story: Metellus'
daughter, Caecilia, who was desirous of arranging a
marriage for her sister's daughter, went, according
to the ancient custom, to a small chapel to receive
an omen. A long time passed while the maiden
stood and Caecilia was seated on a chair without

<pb id="p.337"/>

any word being spoken. Finally, the former grew
weary and said to her aunt: 'Let me sit awhile
on your chair.' ' Certainly, my child,' said Caecilia,
'you may have my place.' And this was an omen
of what came to pass, for in a short time Caecilia
died and the girl married her aunt's husband. I
realize perfectly well that the foregoing omens
may be lightly regarded and even be laughed at,
but to make light of signs sent by the gods is
nothing less than to disbelieve in the existence of
the gods.</p>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="109"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="49"/>"But let us bring the discussion back to
the point from which it wandered. Assume that I
can give no reason for any of the instances of divination which I have mentioned and that I can do no
more than show that they did occur, is that not a
sufficient answer to Epicurus and to Carneades?
And what does it matter if, as between artificial
and natural divination, the explanation of the former
is easy and of the latter is somewhat hard? For
the results of those artificial means of divination,
by means of entrails, lightnings, portents, and
astrology, have been the subject of observation for
a long period of time. But in every field of inquiry
great length of time employed in continued observation begets an extraordinary fund of knowledge,
which may be acquired even without the intervention
or inspiration of the gods, since repeated observa-

<pb id="p.343"/>

tion makes it clear what effect follows any given
cause, and what sign precedes any given event.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="110"/>"The second division of divination, as I said
before,<note>i. 18. 34.</note> is the natural; and it, according to the exact
teaching of physics, must be ascribed to divine
Nature, from which, as the wisest philosophers maintain, our souls have been drawn and poured forth.
And since the universe is wholly filled with the
Eternal Intelligence and the Divine Mind, it must
be that human souls are influenced by their contact
with divine souls. But when men are awake their
souls, as a rule, are subject to the demands of
everyday life and are withdrawn from divine association because they are hampered by the chains
of the flesh.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="111"/>"However, there is a certain class of men, though
small in number, who withdraw themselves from
carnal influences and are wholly possessed by an
ardent concern for the contemplation of things
divine. Some of these men make predictions, not
as the result of direct heavenly inspiration, but by
the use of their own reason. For example, by means
of natural law, they foretell certain events, such as
a flood, or the future destruction of heaven and
earth by fire Others, who are engaged in public
life, like Solon of Athens,<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Diog. Laert. i. 48; Val. Max. v. 3. 3.</note> as history describes him,
discover the rise of tyranny long in advance. Such
men we may call 'foresighted'&mdash;that is, 'able to
foresee the future'; but we can no more apply the
term 'divine' to them than we can apply it to
Thales of Miletus, who, as the story goes, in order
to confound his critics and thereby show that even
a philosopher, if he sees fit, can make money, bought
up the entire olive crop in the district of Miletus

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="50"/>"There are many things foreseen by physicians,
pilots, and also by farmers, but I do not call the predictions of any of them divination. I do not even
call that a case of divination when Anaximander,
the natural philosopher, warned the Spartans to
leave the city and their homes and to sleep in the
fields under arms, because an earthquake was at
hand. Then the whole city fell down in ruins and
the extremity of Mount Taygetus was torn away
like the stern of a ship in a storm. Not even Pherecydes, the famous teacher of Pythagoras, will be
considered a prophet rather than a natural philosopher, because he predicted an earthquake from
the appearance of some water drawn from an
unfailing well.<note>The appearance of the water indicated the internal
disturbance. <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Pliny, <hi rend="italics">Hist. Nat.</hi> ii. 83.</note> </p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="113"/>"In fact, the human soul never divines naturally,
except when it is so unrestrained and free that it
has absolutely no association with the body, as
happens in the case of frenzy and of dreams. Hence
both these kinds of divination have been sanctioned
by Dicaearchus and also, as I said, by our friend
Cratippus. Let us grant that these two methods
(because they originate in nature) take the highest
rank in divination; but we will not concede that
they are the only kind. But if, on the other hand,
Dicaearchus and Cratippus believe that there is
nothing in observation, they hold a doctrine destructive of the foundation on which many things in every-

<pb id="p.347"/>

day life depend. However, since these men make
us some concession&mdash;and that not a small one&mdash;in
granting us divination by frenzy and dreams, I see
no cause for any great war with them, especially in
view of the fact that there are some philosophers
who do not accept any sort of divination whatever.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="114"/>"Those then, whose souls, spurning their bodies,
take wings and fly abroad&mdash;inflamed and aroused
by a sort of passion&mdash;these men, I say, certainly see
the things which they foretell in their prophecies.
Such souls do not cling to the body and are kindled
by many different influences. For example, some
are aroused by certain vocal tones, as by Phrygian
songs, many by groves and forests, and many others
by rivers and seas. I believe, too, that there were
certain subterranean vapours which had the effect
of inspiring persons to utter oracles.<note>In i. 50. 114, after <hi rend="italics">commovent</hi> and before <hi rend="italics">quorum,</hi>

which Giese and Moser approved, though they did not make
it in their texts.</note> In all these
cases the frenzied soul sees the future long in
advance, as Cassandra did in the following instance:

<milestone unit="section" n="115"/>Likewise Marcius and Publicius,<note>Publicius is mentioned again in ii. 55. 113. Nothing

utterances of Apollo were expressed in the same
form.</p>

<pb id="p.349"/>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="51"/>"Such is the rationale of prophecy by means
of frenzy, and that of dreams is not much unlike it.
For the revelations made to seers when awake are
made to us in sleep. While we sleep and the body
lies as if dead, the soul is at its best, because it is
then freed from the influence of the physical senses
and from the worldly cares that weigh it down.
And since the soul has lived from all eternity and
has had converse with numberless other souls, it
sees everything that exists in nature, provided that
moderation and restraint have been used in eating
and in drinking, so that the soul is in a condition
to watch while the body sleeps. Such is the explanation of divination by dreams.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="116"/>"At this point it is pertinent to mention Antiphon's<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 20. 39.</note> well-known theory of the interpretation of
dreams. His view is that the interpreters of dreams
depend upon technical skill and not upon inspiration. He has the same view as to the interpretation
of oracles and of frenzied utterances; for they all
have their interpreters, just as poets have their
commentators. Now it is clear that divine nature
would have done a vain thing if she had merely
created iron, copper, silver, and gold and had not
shown us how to reach the veins in which those
metals lie; the gift of field crops and orchard fruits
would have been useless to the human race without
a knowledge of how to cultivate them and prepare
them for food; and building material would be of
no service without the carpenter's art to convert
it into lumber. So it is with everything that the
gods have given for the advantage of mankind,
there has been joined some art whereby that advantage may be turned to account. The same is true

<pb id="p.351"/>

of dreams, prophecies, and oracles: since many of
them were obscure and doubtful, resort was had to
the skill of professional interpreters.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="117"/>"Now there is a great problem as to how prophets
and dreamers can see things, which, at the time,
have no actual existence anywhere. But that
question would be solved quite readily if we were to
investigate certain other questions which demand
consideration first. For the theory in regard to the
nature of the gods, so clearly developed in the second
book of your work on that subject, includes this
whole question. If we maintain that theory we
shall establish the very point which I am trying
to make: namely, 'that there are gods; that
they rule the universe by their foresight; and
that they direct the affairs of men&mdash;not merely of
men in the mass, but of each individual.' If
we succeed in holding that position&mdash;and for my
part I think it impregnable&mdash;then surely it must
follow that the gods give to men signs of coming
events.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="118"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="52"/>"But it seems necessary to settle the principle on which these signs depend. For, according
to the Stoic doctrine, the gods are not directly
responsible for every fissure in the liver or for every
song of a bird; since, manifestly, that would not
be seemly or proper in a god and furthermore is
impossible. But, in the beginning, the universe was
so created that certain results would be preceded
by certain signs, which are given sometimes by
entrails and by birds, sometimes by lightnings, by
portents, and by stars, sometimes by dreams, and
sometimes by utterances of persons in a frenzy.
And these signs do not often deceive the persons

<pb id="p.353"/>

who observe them properly. If prophecies, based
on erroneous deductions and interpretations, turn
out to be false, the fault is not chargeable to the
signs but to the lack of skill in the interpreters.</p>
<p>"Assuming the proposition to be conceded that
there is a divine power which pervades the lives of
men, it is not hard to understand the principle
directing those premonitory signs which we see
come to pass. For it may be that the choice of a
sacrificial victim is guided by an intelligent force,
which is diffused throughout the universe; or, it
may be that at the moment when the sacrifice is
offered, a change in the vitals occurs and something
is added or taken away; for many things are added
to, changed, or diminished in an instant of time.
<milestone unit="section" n="119"/>Conclusive proof of this fact, sufficient to put it
beyond the possibility of doubt, is afforded by
incidents which happened just before Caesar's
death. While he was offering sacrifices on the day
when he sat for the first time on a golden throne
and first appeared in public in a purple robe, no
heart was found in the vitals of the votive ox.<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Pliny, <hi rend="italics">Hist. Nat.</hi> xi. 71; Val. Max. i. 6. 13; Plut.
<hi rend="italics">Caes.</hi></note> 
Now do you think it possible for any animal that
has blood to exist without a heart? Caesar was
unmoved by this occurrence, even though Spurinna<note>Spurinna was the soothsayer who warned Caesar to
beware of the Ides of March. <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Suet. <hi rend="italics">lul. Caes.</hi> 81.</note> 
warned him to beware lest thought and life should
fail him&mdash;both of which, he said, proceeded from
the heart. On the following day there was no head
to the liver of the sacrifice. These portents were
sent by the immortal gods to Caesar that he might
foresee his death, not that he might prevent it.
Therefore, when those organs, without which the
victim could not have lived, are found wanting in
the vitals, we should understand that the absent

<pb id="p.355"/>

organs disappeared at the very moment of immolation.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="120"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="53"/>"The Divine Will accomplishes like results
in the case of birds, and causes those known as
<hi rend="italics">alites,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Alites</hi> were birds, like the eagle, hawk, and osprey,
that gave omens by their flight; <hi rend="italics">oscines</hi> were birds, like
the raven, crow, and owl, that gave omens by their voices.
<hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Festus, p. 193.</note> which give omens by their flight, to fly
hither and thither and disappear now here and now
there, and causes those known as <hi rend="italics">oscines,</hi> which give
omens by their cries, to sing now on the left and
now on the right. For if every animal moves its
body forward, sideways, or backward at will, it
bends, twists, extends, and contracts its members
as it pleases, and performs these various motions
almost mechanically; how much easier it is for such
results to be accomplished by a god, whose divine
will all things obey! <milestone unit="section" n="121"/>The same power sends us signs,
of which history has preserved numerous examples.
We find the following ones recorded: when just
before sunrise the moon was eclipsed in the sign of
Leo, this indicated that Darius and the Persians
would be overcome in battle by the Macedonians
under Alexander, and that Darius would die. Again,
when a girl was born with two heads, this foretold
sedition among the people and seduction and adultery
in the home. When a woman dreamed that she
had been delivered of a lion, this signified that the
country in which she had the dream would be conquered by foreign nations.</p>
<p>"Another instance of a similiar kind is related by
Herodotus:<note>Herod. i. 85.</note> Croesus's son, when an infant, spoke,
and this prodigy foretold the utter overthrow of
his father's family and kingdom. What history has
failed to record the fact that while Servius Tullius
slept his head burst into flame?<note><hi rend="italics"> Cf.</hi> Flor. i. 6. 1; Livy i. 39. 1; Pliny, <hi rend="italics">Hist. Nat.</hi> ii.
110; xxxvi. 27.</note> Therefore, just as a
man has clear and trustworthy dreams, provided he

<pb id="p.357"/>

goes to sleep, not only with his mind prepared by
noble thoughts, but also with every precaution
taken to induce repose; so, too, he, when awake,
is better prepared to interpret truly the messages
of entrails, stars, birds, and all other signs, provided
his soul is pure and undefiled.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="122"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="54"/>"It is this purity of soul, no doubt, that
explains that famous utterance which history attributes to Socrates and which his disciples in their
books often represent him as repeating: 'There
is some divine influence'&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">daimo/nion,</foreign> he called it&mdash;
'which I always obey, though it never urges me on,
but often holds me back.' And it was the same
Socrates&mdash;and what better authority can we quote?
&mdash;who was consulted by Xenophon<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Xen. <hi rend="italics">Anab.</hi> iii. 1. 4.</note> as to whether
he should join Cyrus. Socrates, after stating what
seemed to him the best thing to do, remarked:
' But my opinion is only that of a man. In matters
of doubt and perplexity I advise that Apollo's oracle
be consulted.' This oracle was always consulted by
the Athenians in regard to the more serious public
questions.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="123"/>"It is also related of Socrates that one day he
saw his friend Crito with a bandage on his eye.
'What's the matter, Crito?' he inquired. 'As I
was walking in the country the branch of a tree,
which had been bent, was released and struck me
in the eye.' ' Of course,' said Socrates, ' for, after
I had had divine warning, as usual, and tried to
call you back, you did not heed.' It is also related
of him that after the unfortunate battle was fought
at Delium under command of Laches, he was fleeing
in company with his commander, when they came
to a place where three roads met. Upon his refusal

<pb id="p.359"/>

to take the road that the others had chosen he was
asked the reason and replied: 'The god prevents
me.' Those who fled by the other road fell in with
the enemy's cavalry. Antipater has gathered a
mass of remarkable premonitions received by
Socrates, but I shall pass them by, for you know
them and it is useless for me to recount them. <milestone unit="section" n="124"/>However, the following utterance<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Plato, <hi rend="italics">Apol.</hi> ch. 31.</note> of that philosopher,
made after he had been wickedly condemned to
death, is a noble one&mdash;I might almost call it' divine ':
'I am very content to die,' he said; 'for neither
when I left my home nor when I mounted the platform to plead my cause, did the god give any sign,
and this he always does when some evil threatens
me.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="55"/>"And so my opinion is that the power of
divination exists, notwithstanding the fact that those
who prophesy by means of art and conjecture
are oftentimes mistaken. I believe that, just as
men may make mistakes in other callings, so they
may in this. It may happen that a sign of doubtful
meaning is assumed to be certain or, possibly, either
a sign was itself unobserved or one that annulled
an observed sign may have gone unnoticed. But,
in order to establish the proposition for which I
contend it is enough for me to find, not many,
but even a few instances of divinely inspired prevision and prophecy. <milestone unit="section" n="125"/>Nay, if even one such instance
is found and the agreement between the prediction
and the thing predicted is so close as to exclude
every semblance of chance or of accident, I should
not hesitate to say in such a case, that divination
undoubtedly exists and that everybody should admit
its existence.</p>

<pb id="p.361"/>

<p>"Wherefore, it seems to me that we must do as
Posidonius does and trace the vital principle of
divination in its entirety to three sources: first, to
God, whose connexion with the subject has been
sufficiently discussed; secondly to Fate; and lastly,
to Nature. Reason compels us to admit that all
things happen by Fate. Now by Fate I mean the
same that the Greeks call <foreign lang="greek">ei(marme/nh,</foreign> that is, an
orderly succession of causes wherein cause is linked
to cause and each cause of itself produces an effect.
That is an immortal truth having its source in all
eternity. Therefore nothing has happened which
was not bound to happen, and, likewise, nothing is
going to happen which will not find in nature every
efficient cause of its happening. <milestone unit="section" n="126"/>Consequently, we
know that Fate is that which is called, not ignorantly,
but scientifically, 'the eternal cause of things, the
wherefore of things past, of things present, and
of things to come.' Hence it is that it may be
known by observation what effect will in most
instances follow any cause, even if it is not known
in all; for it would be too much to say that it is
known in every case. And it is probable that these
causes of coming events are perceived by those
who see them during frenzy or in sleep.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="127"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="56"/>"Moreover, since, as will be shown elsewhere,<note>The genuineness of the words, <hi rend="italics">id quod . . . ostendetur,</hi>
is doubted because (1) in the extant portions of Cicero's
work on Fate the opposite of the position here contended
for is taken; and (2) they indicate that Marcus, forgetting
for the moment that Quintus is talking, imagines that he
himself is the speaker. However, the MSS. support the
reading adopted.</note> 
all things happen by Fate, if there were a man whose
soul could discern the links that join each cause
with every other cause, then surely he would never
be mistaken in any prediction he might make. For
he who knows the causes of future events necessarily
knows what every future event will be. But since
such knowledge is possible only to a god, it is left
to man to presage the future by means of certain

<pb id="p.363"/>

signs which indicate what will follow them. Things
which are to be do not suddenly spring into existence, but the evolution of time is like the unwinding
of a cable: it creates nothing new and only unfolds
each event in its order. This connexion between
cause and effect is obvious to two classes of diviners:
those who are endowed with natural divination and
those who know the course of events by the observation of signs. They may not discern the causes
themselves, yet they do discern the signs and
tokens of those causes. The careful study and
recollection of those signs, aided by the records of
former times, has evolved that sort of divination,
known as artificial, which is divination by means of
entrails, lightnings, portents, and celestial phenomena.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="128"/>"Therefore it is not strange that diviners have
a presentiment of things that exist nowhere in the
material world: for all things ' are,' though, from
the standpoint of' time,' they are not present. As in
seeds there inheres the germ of those things which
the seeds produce, so in causes are stored the future
events whose coming is foreseen by reason or conjecture, or is discerned by the soul when inspired by
frenzy, or when it is set free by sleep. Persons
familiar with the rising, setting, and revolutions of
the sun, moon, and other celestial bodies, can tell long
in advance where any one of these bodies will be at
a given time. And the same thing may be said of
men who, for a long period of time, have studied and
noted the course of facts and the connexion of events,
for they always know what the future will be; or, if
that is putting it too strongly, they know in a majority
of cases; or, if that will not be conceded either, then,
surely, they sometimes know what the future will be.

<pb id="p.365"/>

These and a few other arguments of the same kind
for the existence of divination are derived from Fate.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="129"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="57"/>"Moreover, divination finds another and a
positive support in nature, which teaches us how
great is the power of the soul when it is divorced
from the bodily senses, as it is especially in sleep, '
and in times of frenzy or inspiration. For, as the
souls of the gods, without the intervention of eyes
or ears or tongue, understand each other and
what each one thinks (hence men, even when
they offer silent prayers and vows, have no doubt
that the gods understand them), so the souls of
men, when released by sleep from bodily chains,
or when stirred by inspiration and delivered up
to their own impulses, see things that they cannot
see when they are mingled with the body. <milestone unit="section" n="130"/>And
while it is difficult, perhaps, to apply this principle
of nature to explain that kind of divination which
we call artificial, yet Posidonius, who digs into the
question as deep as one can, thinks that nature gives
certain signs of future events. Thus Heraclides
of Pontus records that it is the custom of the
people of Ceos, once each year, to make a careful
observation of the rising of the Dog-star and from
such observation to conjecture whether the ensuing
year will be healthy or pestilential. For if the star
rises dim and, as it were enveloped in a fog, this
indicates a thick and heavy atmosphere, which will
give off very unwholesome vapours; but if the star
appears clear and brilliant, this is a sign that the
atmosphere is light and pure and, as a consequence,
will be conducive to good health.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="131"/>"Again, Democritus expresses the opinion that
the ancients acted wisely in providing for the

<pb id="p.367"/>

inspection of the entrails of sacrifices; because, as
he thinks, the colour and general condition of the
entrails are prophetic sometimes of health and
sometimes of sickness and sometimes also of whether
the fields will be barren or productive. Now, if it
is known by observation and experience that these
means of divination have their source in nature, it
must be that the observations made and records
kept for a long period of time have added much
to our knowledge of this subject. Hence, that
natural philosopher introduced by Pacuvius into his
play of <hi rend="italics">Chryses,</hi> seems to show very scanty apprehension of the laws of nature when he speaks as
follows:

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l>The men who know the speech of birds and more</l>

of the intelligence.</note> than their own&mdash;</l>
<l>'Twere best to hear, I think, and not to heed.</l></quote>

I do not know why this poet makes such a statement
when only a few lines further on he says clearly
enough:

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l>Whate'er the power may be, it animates,</l>
<l>Creates, gives form, increase, and nourishment</l>
<l>To everything; of everything the sire,</l>

Since all things have one and the same and that a
common home, and since the human soul has always
been and will always be, why, then, should it not be
able to understand what effect will follow any cause,
and what sign will precede any event?</p>
<p><quote>This,</quote> said Quintus, <quote>is all that I had to say

<div1 type="book" n="2"><head>Book II</head>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After serious and long continued reflection as
to how I might do good to as many people as possible
and thereby prevent any interruption of my service
to the State, no better plan occurred to me than
to conduct my fellow-citizens in the ways of the
noblest learning&mdash;and this, I believe, I have already
accomplished through my numerous books. For
example, in my work entitled <hi rend="italics">Hortensius,</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> August. <hi rend="italics">Confess.</hi> iii. 4. 7 <hi rend="italics">ille vero liber</hi> (Hortensius)
<hi rend="italics">mutavit affectum meum et ad te ipsum, Domine, mutavit</hi>
<hi rend="italics">preces meas et vota ac desideria mea fecit alia.</hi></note> I appealed
as earnestly as I could for the study of philosophy.
And in my <hi rend="italics">Academics,</hi> in four volumes, I set forth
the philosophic system which I thought least arrogant, and at the same time most consistent and
refined. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And, since the foundation of philosophy
rests on the distinction between good and evil,
I exhaustively treated that subject in five volumes<note><hi rend="italics">Definibus bonorum et malorum.</hi></note> 
and in such a way that the conflicting views of the
different philosophers might be known. Next, and
in the same number of volumes, came the <hi rend="italics">Tusculan</hi>
<hi rend="italics">Disputations,</hi> which made plain the means most
essential to a happy life. For the first volume
treats of indifference to death, the second of enduring
pain, the third of the alleviation of sorrow, the fourth
of other spiritual disturbances; and the fifth embraces a topic which sheds the brightest light on the
entire field of philosophy since it teaches that virtue
is sufficient of itself for the attainment of happiness.</p>

<pb id="p.373"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>After publishing the works mentioned I finished
three volumes <hi rend="italics">On the Nature of the Gods,</hi> which
contain a discussion of every question under that
head. With a view of simplifying and extending
the latter treatise I started to write the present
volume <hi rend="italics">On Divination,</hi> to which I plan to add a
work on <hi rend="italics">Fate;</hi> when that is done every phase of
this particular branch of philosophy will be sufficiently discussed. To this list of works must be
added the six volumes which I wrote while holding
the helm of state, entitled <hi rend="italics">On the Republic</hi>&mdash;a weighty
subject, appropriate for philosophic discussion, and
one which has been most elaborately treated by
Plato, Aristotle, Theophrastus, and the entire Peripatetic school. What need is there to say anything
of my treatise <hi rend="italics">On Consolation</hi>? For it is the source
of very great comfort to me and will, I think, be of
much help to others. I have also recently thrown
in that book <hi rend="italics">On Old Age,</hi> which I sent my friend
Atticus; and, since it is by philosophy that a man
is made virtuous and strong, my <hi rend="italics">Cato</hi><note>The lost <hi rend="italics">Laus Catonis,</hi> to which Caesar wrote a reply;
<hi rend="italics">cf. Ad Att.</hi> xii. 40.</note> is especially
worthy of a place among the foregoing books.
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Inasmuch as Aristotle and Theophrastus, too, both
of whom were celebrated for their keenness of
intellect and particularly for their copiousness of
speech, have joined rhetoric with philosophy, it
seems proper also to put my rhetorical books in
the same category; hence we shall include the
three volumes <hi rend="italics">On Oratory,</hi> the fourth entitled
<hi rend="italics">Brutus,</hi> and the fifth called <hi rend="italics">The Orator.</hi></p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>I have named the philosophic works so far
written: to the completion of the remaining books
of this series I was hastening with so much ardour
that if some most grievous cause<note>Cicero refers to the chaotic condition of public affairs
following the death of Caesar.</note> had not inter-

<pb id="p.375"/>

vened there would not now be any phase of philosophy which I had failed to elucidate and make
easily accessible in the Latin tongue. For what
greater or better service can I render to the common
wealth than to instruct and train the youth&mdash;
especially in view of the fact that our young men
have gone so far astray because of the present
moral laxity that the utmost effort will be needed
to hold them in check and direct them in the right
way? <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Of course, I have no assurance&mdash;it could
not even be expected&mdash;that they will all turn to
these studies. Would that a few may! Though
few, their activity may yet have a wide influence in
the state. In fact, I am receiving some reward for my
labour even from men advanced in years; for they
are finding comfort in my books, and by their ardour
in reading are raising my eagerness for writing to a
higher pitch every day. Their number, too, I learn,
is far greater than I had expected. Furthermore, it
would redound to the fame and glory of the Roman
people to be made independent of Greek writers in
the study of philosophy, <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>and this result I shall certainly
bring about if my present plans are accomplished.</p>
<p>The cause of my becoming an expounder of
philosophy sprang from the grave condition of the
State during the period of the Civil War, when,
being unable to protect the Republic, as had been
my custom, and finding it impossible to remain
inactive, I could find nothing else that I preferred
to do that was worthy of me. Therefore my countrymen will pardon me&mdash;rather they will thank
me&mdash;because, when the State was in the power
of one man, I refused to hide myself, to quit
my place, or to be cast down; I did not bear

<pb id="p.377"/>

myself like one enraged at the man or at the
times; and, further, I neither so fawned upon
nor admired another's fortune as to repent me of
my own.</p>
<p>For one thing in particular I had learned from
Plato<note>Plato, <hi rend="italics">Rep.</hi> viii. 2. 545.</note> and from philosophy, that certain revolutions
in government are to be expected; so that states
are now under a monarchy, now under a democracy,
and now under a tyranny. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>When the last-named
fate had befallen my country, and I had been
debarred from my former activities, I began to
cultivate anew these present studies that by their
means, rather than by any other, I might relieve
my mind of its worries and at the same time serve
my fellow-countrymen as best I could under the
circumstances. Accordingly, it was in my books
that I made my senatorial speeches and my forensic
harangues; for I thought that I had permanently
exchanged politics for philosophy. Now, however,
since I have begun to be consulted again about
public affairs, my time must be devoted to the State,
or, rather, my undivided thought and care must be
fixed upon it; and only so much time can be given
to philosophy as will not be needed in the discharge
of my duty to the commonwealth. But more of
this at another time; now let us return to the discussion with which we started.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>After my brother Quintus had delivered his
views on divination, as set out in the preceding
volume, and we had walked as much as we wished,
we took our seats in the library in my <quote>Lyceum,</quote>
and I remarked:</p>
<p>"Really, my dear Quintus, you have defended

<pb id="p.379"/>

the Stoic doctrine with accuracy and like a Stoic.
But the thing that delights me most is the fact
that you illustrated your argument with many
incidents taken from Roman sources-incidents, too,
of a distinguished and noble type. I must now
reply to what you said, but I must do so with great
diffidence and with many misgivings, and in such
a way as to affirm nothing and question everything.<note>This was the characteristic mental attitude in which the
disciples of the New Academy approached every question.</note> 
For if I should assume anything that I said to be
certain I should myself be playing the diviner while
saying that no such thing as divination exists!</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>"I am impressed with the force of the questions
with which Carneades used to begin his discussions:
' What are the things within the scope of divination?
Are they things that are perceived by the senses? But
those are things that we see, hear, taste, smell, and
touch. Is there, then, in such objects some quality
that we can better perceive with the aid of prophecy
and inspiration than we can with the aid of the
senses alone? And is there any diviner, anywhere,
who, if blind, like Tiresias, could tell the difference
between white and black? Or, who, if deaf, could
distinguish between different voices and different
tones? Now you must admit that divination is not
applicable in any case where knowledge is gained
through the senses.</p>
<p>"Nor is there any need of divination even in
matters within the domain of science and of art.
For, when people are sick, we, as a general rule,
do not summon a prophet or a seer, but we call in
a physician. Again, persons who want to learn to
play on the harp or on the flute take lessons, not
from a soothsayer, but from a musician. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>The same
rule applies in literature and in other departments

<pb id="p.381"/>

of learning. And do you really believe that those
who are credited with powers of divining, can, for
that reason, tell whether the sun is larger than the
earth, and whether it is as big as it seems to be?
Or whether the moon shines by its own light or by
that of the sun? Or do you think that they understand the motions of the sun and moon and of the
five stars, which are called' planets '? Your reputed
diviners do not claim that they can answer any of
these questions; nor will they profess to tell whether
geometrical figures are correctly drawn or not, for
that is the business of mathematicians, not of seers.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>"Now let us consider matters within the
purview of philosophy: When the question is as to
what is morally right, or morally wrong, or as to
what is neither the one nor the other, do we usually
have our doubts resolved by diviners? In fact,
do we often consult them in such a case? Certainly
not, for problems of this kind belong to philosophers.
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>Again, where the question is one of duty: who ever
consults a soothsayer as to how he should demean
himself towards his parents, his brothers, or his
friends? or as to how he should use his wealth,
his office, or his power? Such matters are usually
referred to sages, not to diviners.</p>
<p>"Furthermore, can any of the questions of dialectic or of physics be solved by divination? For
example, is there one world, or are there many
worlds? What are the primary elements from
which all things are derived? Such problems belong
to the science of physics. Again, suppose one should
wish to know how to resolve the 'liar' fallacy,<note>The form of this fallacy best known was this: <quote>Epimenides calls the Cretans liars, but he is himself a Cretan;
does he then lie or tell the truth?</quote> <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Cic. <hi rend="italics">Acad.</hi> ii. 29.

which the Greeks call '<foreign lang="greek">yeudo/menon;</foreign>' or how to meet
the 'heap' fallacy, known in Greek as <hi rend="italics">sorites</hi> (which,

<pb id="p.383"/>

if a Latin equivalent were needed, could be represented by the word <hi rend="italics">acervalis,</hi> but none is needed;
for, just as the word 'philosophy' and many other
words are of Greek origin and are in general use
as Latin words, so it is with <hi rend="italics">sorites</hi>),<note>The original form of this fallacy began with the question
<quote>Does one grain make a heap?</quote> The answer was <quote>no.</quote>
One grain after another was added until there were, say,
<hi rend="italics">n</hi> grains, when it would be admitted that <hi rend="italics">n</hi> + 1 grains made
a heap. Hence the difference between <hi rend="italics">n</hi> + 1 and n grains,
or one grain, made a heap, which was contrary to the first
answer. <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Reid's <hi rend="italics">A cad.</hi> ii. 16. 49 note.</note> &mdash;in both these
cases the logician, and not the diviner, would speak.</p>
<p>"Assume, next, that the inquiry is as to the best
form of government, or as to what laws or what
customs are beneficial and what are harmful, will
you call soothsayers out of Etruria to settle the
question, or will you accept the decision of men of
eminence chosen for their knowledge of statecraft?
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>But if there is no place for divination in things perceived by the senses, or in those included among
the arts, or in those discussed by philosophers, or
in those which have to do with government, I see
absolutely no need for it anywhere. For either it
ought to be of use in every case, or, at least, some
department in which it may be employed should be
found. But divination is not of use in every case,
as my reasoning has shown; nor can any field or
subject matter be found over which it may exercise
control. <milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>Therefore I am inclined to think that
there is no such thing as divination. There is a
much-quoted Greek verse to this effect:

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l>The best diviner I maintain to be</l>
<l>The man who guesses or conjectures best.<note>From Euripides and quoted in Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">De orac.</hi>

Now do you think that a prophet will 'conjecture'
better whether a storm is at hand than a pilot?
or that he will by 'conjecture' make a more accurate diagnosis than a physician, or conduct a war with
more skill than a general?</p>

<pb id="p.385"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>"But I observed, Quintus, that you prudently
withdrew divination from conjectures based upon
skill and experience in public affairs, from those
drawn from the use of the senses and from those
made by persons in their own callings.<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 49. 111 <hi rend="italics">seq.</hi></note> I observed,
also, that you defined divination to be 'the foreknowledge and foretelling of things which happen
by chance.'<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi>i. 5. 9.</note> In the first place, that is a contradiction of what you have admitted. For the foreknowledge possessed by a physician, a pilot, and a
general is of 'things which happen by chance.'
Then can any soothsayer, augur, prophet, or dreamer
conjecture better than a physician, a pilot, or a
general that an invalid will come safely out of his
sickness, or that a ship will escape from danger, or
that an army will avoid an ambuscade?</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>"And you went on to say that even the foreknowledge of impending storms and rains by means
of certain signs was not divination, and, in that
connexion, you quoted a number of verses from my
translation of Aratus. Yet such coincidences' happen
by chance,' for though they happen frequently they
do not happen always. What, then, is this thing
you call divination&mdash;this 'foreknowledge of things
that happen by chance '&mdash;and where is it employed?
You think that 'whatever can be foreknown by
means of science, reason, experience, or conjecture
is to be referred, not to diviners, but to experts.'
It follows, therefore, that divination of' things that
happen by chance' is possible only of things which
cannot be foreseen by means of skill or wisdom.
Hence, if someone had declared many years in
advance that the famous Marcus Marcellus, who
was consul three times, would perish in a shipwreck,

<pb id="p.387"/>

this, by your definition, undoubtedly would have
been a case of divination, since that calamity could
not have been foreseen by means of any other skill or
by wisdom. That is why you say that divination is the
foreknowledge of such things as depend upon chance.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>"Can there, then, be any foreknowledge of
things for whose happening no reason exists? For
we do not apply the words 'chance,' 'luck,' 'accident,' or 'casualty' except to an event which has
so occurred or happened that it either might not
have occurred at all, or might have occurred in
any other way. How, then, is it possible to foresee
and to predict an event that happens at random,
as the result of blind accident, or of unstable chance?
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>By the use of reason the physician foresees the
progress of a disease, the general anticipates the
enemy's plans and the pilot forecasts the approach
of bad weather. And yet even those who base
their conclusions on accurate reasoning are often
mistaken: for example, when the farmer sees his
olive-tree in bloom he expects also, and not unreasonably, to see it bear fruit, but occasionally he is
disappointed. If then mistakes are made by those
who make no forecasts not based upon some reasonable and probable conjecture, what must we think of
the conjectures of men who foretell the future by
means of entrails, birds, portents, oracles, or dreams?
I am not ready yet to take up one by one the various
kinds of divination and show that the cleft in the
liver, the croak of a raven, the flight of an eagle,
the fall of a star, the utterances of persons in a
frenzy, lots, and dreams have no prophetic value
whatever; I shall discuss each of them in its turn&mdash;
now I am discussing the subject as a whole.</p>

<pb id="p.389"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="17"/>"How can anything be foreseen that has no
cause and no distinguishing mark of its coming?
Eclipses of the sun and also of the moon are predicted for many years in advance by men who
employ mathematics in studying the courses and
movements of the heavenly bodies; and the unvarying laws of nature will bring their predictions
to pass. Because of the perfectly regular movements of the moon the astronomers calculate when
it will be opposite the sun and in the earth's shadow
&mdash;which is 'the cone of night '<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Pliny, <hi rend="italics">N.H.</hi> ii. 7 <hi rend="italics">manifestum est . . . neque aliud
esse noctem, quam terrae umbram; figuram autem similem
metae, ac turbini inverso.</hi></note> &mdash;and when,
necessarily, it will become invisible. For the same
reason they know when the moon will be directly
between the earth and the sun and thus will hide
the light of the sun from our eyes. They know in
what sign each planet will be at any given time
and at what time each day any constellation will
rise and set. You see the course of reasoning
followed in arriving at these predictions.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="18"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>"But what course of reasoning is followed
by men who predict the finding of a treasure or
the inheritance of an estate? On what law of nature
do such prophecies depend? But, on the other hand,
if the prophecies just mentioned and others of the
same class are controlled by some natural and
immutable law such as regulates the movements of
the stars, pray, can we conceive of anything happening by accident, or chance? Surely nothing is
so at variance with reason and stability as chance.
Hence it seems to me that it is not in the power
even of God himself to know what event is going
to happen accidentally and by chance. For if He
knows, then the event is certain to happen; but
if it is certain to happen, chance does not exist.

<pb id="p.391"/>

And yet chance does exist, therefore there is no
foreknowledge of things that happen by chance.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="19"/>"But if you deny the existence of chance and
assert that the course of everything present or
future has been inevitably determined from all
eternity, then you must change your definition of
divination, which you said was 'the foreknowledge
of things that happen by chance.' For if nothing
can happen, nothing befall, nothing come to pass,
except what has been determined from all eternity as
bound to happen at a fixed time, how can there be
such a thing as chance? And if there is no such
thing as chance, what room is there for that divination, which you termed 'a foreknowledge of things
that happen by chance'? And you were inconsistent enough, too, to say that everything that is
or will be is controlled by Fate!<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 55. 125.</note> Why, the very
word ' Fate ' is full of superstition and old women's
credulity, and yet the Stoics have much to say of
this Fate of yours. A discussion on Fate<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> in the <hi rend="italics">De fato.</hi></note> is reserved
for another occasion; at present I shall speak of
it only in so far as it is necessary.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="20"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>"Of what advantage to me is divination if
everything is ruled by Fate? On that hypothesis
what the diviner predicts is bound to happen. Hence
I do not know what to make of the fact that an
eagle recalled our intimate friend Deiotarus from
his journey<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 8. 20.</note> ; for if he had not turned back he must
have been sleeping in the room when it was destroyed
the following night, and, therefore, have been
crushed in the ruins. And yet, if Fate had willed
it, he would not have escaped that calamity; and
<hi rend="italics">vice versa.</hi> Hence, I repeat, what is the good of
divination? Or what is it that lots, entrails, or any

<pb id="p.393"/>

other means of prophecy warn me to avoid? For,
if it was the will of Fate that the Roman fleets in
the First Punic War should perish&mdash;the one by
shipwreck and the other at the hands of the Carthaginians&mdash;they would have perished just the same
even if the sacred chickens had made a <hi rend="italics">tripudium</hi>
<hi rend="italics">solistimum</hi> in the consulship of Lucius Junius and
Publius Claudius!<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 16. 29.</note> On the other hand, if obedience
to the auspices would have prevented the destruction of the fleets, then they did not perish in accordance with Fate. But you insist that all things happen
by Fate; therefore there is no such thing as divination.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="21"/>"Again, if it was the will of Fate that the Roman
army should perish at Lake Trasimenus in the
Second Punic War, could that result have been
avoided if the consul Flaminius had obeyed the signs
and the auspices which forbade his joining battle?<note><hi rend="italics">f. i. </hi>05. 77.</note> 
Assuredly not. Therefore, either the army did not
perish by the will of Fate, or, if it did (and you are
certainly bound as a Stoic to say that it did), the
same result would have happened even if the
auspices had been obeyed; for the decrees of Fate
are unchangeable. Then what becomes of that
vaunted divination of you Stoics? For if all things
happen by Fate, it does us no good to be warned
to be on our guard, since that which is to happen,
will happen regardless of what we do. But if that
which is to be can be turned aside, there is no such
thing as Fate; so, too, there is no such thing as
divination&mdash;since divination deals with things that
are going to happen. But nothing is ' certain to
happen' which there is some means of dealing
with<note><hi rend="italics">Procuratio</hi> is a technical term for using means, by
sacrifice or otherwise, to avert some evil omen or portent.</note> so as to prevent its happening.</p>

<pb id="p.395"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="22"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>"And further, for my part, I think that a
knowledge of the future would be a disadvantage.
Consider, for example, what Priam's life would have
been if he had known from youth what dire events
his old age held in store for him! But let us leave
the era of myths and come to events nearer home.
In my work <hi rend="italics">On Consolation</hi> I have collected instances
of very grievous deaths that befell some of the most
illustrious men of our commonwealth. Passing by
men of earlier day, let us take Marcus Crassus.
What advantage, pray, do you think it would have
been to him, when he was at the very summit of
power and wealth, to know that he was destined to
perish beyond the Euphrates in shame and dishonour,
after his son had been killed and his own army
had been destroyed? Or do you think that Gnaeus
Pompey would have found joy in his three consulships, in his three triumphs, and in the fame of his
transcendent deeds, if he had known that he would
be slain in an Egyptian desert, after he had lost
his army, and that following his death those grave
events would occur of which I cannot speak without
tears?</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="23"/>"Or what do we think of Caesar? Had he foreseen that in the Senate, chosen in most part by
himself, in Pompey's hall,<note>Built by Pompey and used as a meeting-place for the
Senate.</note> aye, before Pompey's
very statue, and in the presence of many of his own
centurions, he would be put to death by most noble
citizens, some of whom owed all that they had to
him, and that he would fall to so low an estate that
no friend&mdash;no, not even a slave&mdash;would approach
his dead body, in what agony of soul would he have
spent his life!</p>
<p>"Of a surety, then, ignorance of future ills is more

<pb id="p.397"/>

profitable than the knowledge of them. <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>For, assuming that men knew the future it cannot in any
wise be said&mdash;certainly not by the Stoics&mdash;that
Pompey would not have taken up arms, that Crassus
would not have crossed the Euphrates, or that Caesar
would not have embarked upon the civil war. If
so, then, the deaths that befell these men were
not determined by Fate. But you will have it
that everything happens by Fate; consequently,
knowledge of the future would have done these
men no good. In reality it would have entirely
deprived the earlier portion of their lives of enjoyment; for how could they have been happy in
reflecting what their ends would be? And so,
however the Stoics turn and twist, all their shrewdness must come to naught. For, if a thing that is
going to happen, may happen in one way or another,
indifferently, chance is predominant; but things that
happen by chance cannot be certain. But if it is
certain what is going to befall me in reference to
any matter and on every occasion, how do the soothsayers help me by saying that the greatest misfortunes await me?</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="25"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>"To the last point the Stoics make the rejoinder that 'every evil which is going to befall us
is made lighter by means of religious rites.' But
if nothing happens except in accordance with Fate,
no evil can be made lighter by means of religious
rites. Homer shows his appreciation of this fact
when he represents Jupiter as complaining because
he could not snatch his son Sarpedon from death<note><hi rend="italics">Il.</hi> xvi. 433.</note> 
when Fate forbade. The same thought is expressed
in the following verses translated from a Greek
poet<note>It is not known from whom this line is taken. The
same thought is often found. <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Aesch. <hi rend="italics">Prom. 527;</hi>

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l>That which has been decreed by Fate to be</l>

The whole idea of Fate in every detail is justly, as I
think, the subject of derision even in Atellan farces,<note>The <hi rend="italics">Fabulae Atellanae</hi> originated in Atella, a town
between Capua and Naples. They are often called <hi rend="italics">Osci</hi>

but in a discussion as serious as ours joking is out of
place. So then let us sum up our argument: If it is
impossible to foresee things that happen by chance
because they are uncertain, there is no such thing as
divination; if, on the contrary, they can be foreseen
because they are preordained by Fate, still there
is no such thing as divination, which, by your definition, deals with 'things that happen by chance.'
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/>But this introductory part of my discussion has been
mere skirmishing with light infantry; now let me
come to close quarters and see if I cannot drive in
both wings of your argument.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>"You divided divination into two kinds, one
artificial and the other natural.<note>That which has been decreed by Fate to be
Almighty Jove himself cannot prevent.</note> 'The artificial,' you
said, 'consists in part of conjecture and in part of
long-continued observation; while the natural is that
which the soul has seized, or, rather, has obtained,
from a source outside itself&mdash;that is, from God,
whence all human souls have been drawn off,
received, or poured out.' Under the head of artificial divination you placed predictions made from
the inspection of entrails, those made from lightnings and portents, those made by augurs, and
by persons who depend entirely upon premonitory
signs. Under the same head you included practically every method of prophecy in which conjecture
was employed. <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>Natural divination, on the other
hand, according to your view, is the result&mdash;'the
effusion,' as it were&mdash;of mental excitement, or it
is the prophetic power which the soul has during

<pb id="p.401"/>

sleep while free from bodily sensation and worldly
cares. Moreover, you derived every form of divination from three sources&mdash;God, Fate, and Nature.<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 55. 125.</note> 
And although you could not give a reason for any
kind of divination, still you carried on the war by
marshalling an astonishing array of examples from
fiction.<note><hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> i. 21. 42, 43, 44, etc.</note> Of such a course I wish to say emphatically
that it is not becoming in a philosopher to introduce
testimony which may be either true by accident, or
false and fabricated through malice. You ought to
have employed arguments and reason to show that
all your propositions were true and you ought not
to have resorted to so-called occurrences&mdash;certainly
not to such occurrences as are unworthy of belief.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="28"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>"In discussing separately the various methods
of divination, I shall begin with soothsaying, which,
according to my deliberate judgement, should be
cultivated from reasons of political expediency and
in order that we may have a state religion. But
we are alone and for that reason we may, without
causing ill-will, make an earnest inquiry into the
truth of soothsaying&mdash;certainly I can do so, since
in most things my philosophy is that of doubt.<note>Cicero was a disciple of the New Academy and as such
reserved the right to question any proposition without
giving adherence to any. <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 4. 7.</note> 
In the first place, then, if you please, let us make
an inspection' of entrails! Now can anybody be
induced to believe that the things said to be predicted by means of entrails were learned by the soothsayers through 'long-continued observation'? How
long, pray, did the observations last? How could
the observations have continued for a long time?
How did the soothsayers manage to agree among
themselves what part of the entrails was unfavourable, and what part favourable; or what cleft in
the liver indicated danger and what promised some

<pb id="p.403"/>

advantage? Are the soothsayers of Etruria, Elis,
Egypt, and of Carthage in accord on these matters?
Apart from such an agreement being impossible in
fact, it is impossible even to imagine; and, moreover, we see some nations interpreting entrails in one
way and some in another; hence there is no uniformity of practice.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="29"/>"Surely if entrails have any prophetic force,
necessarily that force either is in accord with the
laws of nature, or is fashioned in some way by the
will and power of the gods. But between that divine
system of nature whose great and glorious laws pervade all space and regulate all motion what possible
connexion can there be with&mdash;I shall not say the gall
of a chicken, whose entrails, some men assert, give
very clear indications of the future, but&mdash;the liver,
heart, and lungs of a sacrificial ox? And what
natural quality is there in the entrails which enables
them to indicate the future?</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="30"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>"Nevertheless Democritus jests rather
prettily for a natural philosopher&mdash;and there is no
more arrogant class&mdash;when he says:

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l>No one regards the things before his feet,</l>
<l>But views with care the regions of the sky.<note>This is the third of three verses quoted by Cicero from

And yet Democritus gives his approval to divination
by means of entrails only to the extent of believing
that their condition and colour indicate whether hay
and other crops will be abundant or the reverse,
and he even thinks that the entrails give signs of
future health or sickness. O happy mortal! He
never failed to have his joke&mdash;that is absolutely
certain. But was he so amused with petty trifles
as to fail to see that his theory would be plausible
only on the assumption that the entrails of all cattle

<pb id="p.405"/>

changed to the same colour and condition at the
same time? But if at the same instant the liver
of one ox is smooth and full and that of another is
rough and shrunken, what inference can be drawn
from 'the condition and colour of the entrails'?</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="31"/>"Equally amusing is your story about Pherecydes,
who, after looking at some water just drawn from a
well, foretold an earthquake.<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 50. 112.</note> It would be presumptuous enough, I think, for natural philosophers
to attempt to explain the cause of an earthquake
after it had happened; but can they actually tell,
from looking at fresh water, that an earthquake
is going to happen? Such nonsense is often heard
in the schools, but one does not have to believe
everything one hears. <milestone unit="section" n="32"/>But grant that these absurdities of
Democritus are true&mdash;when do we ever
consult entrails to learn about crops or health, or
when have we acquired information on these partiticulars from a soothsayer after he had made an
inspection of entrails? The soothsayers warn us of
dangers by fire and flood and sometimes they prophesy the inheritance, sometimes the loss, of money;
they discuss the favourable and the unfavourable
cleft; they view the head of the liver with the
utmost care from every side. If, perchance, the
liver's head should be wanting they regard it as the
most unpropitious sign that could have happened.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="33"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>"Such signs, as I have shown before,
certainly could not come within your classification
of the kinds of divination 'dependent on observation.' Therefore they are not the result of immemorial usage, but they are the inventions of art&mdash;
if there can be any art in the occult. But what
relationship have they with the laws of nature?

<pb id="p.407"/>

Assuming that all the works of nature are firmly
bound together in a harmonious whole (which, I
observe, is the view of the natural philosophers and
especially of those men<note>Cicero has in mind, among others, Xenophanes of
Colophon. <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Cic. <hi rend="italics">Acad.</hi> ii. 37. 118.</note> who maintain that the
universe is a unit), what connexion can there be
between the universe and the finding of a treasure?
For instance, if the entrails foretell an increase in
my fortune and they do so in accordance with some
law of nature, then, in the first place, there is some
relationship between them and the universe, and
in the second place, my financial gain is regulated
by the laws of nature. Are not the natural philosophers ashamed to utter such nonsense? And yet
a certain contact between the different parts of
nature may be admitted and I concede it. The
Stoics have collected much evidence to prove it.
They claim, for example, that the livers of mice
become larger in winter; that the dry pennyroyal<note>See valuable discussion by Pease in his <hi rend="italics">De div.</hi> ii. 33,34.</note> 
blooms the very day of the winter solstice, and that
its seed-pods become inflated and burst and the seeds
enclosed therein are sent in various directions;
that at times when certain strings of the lyre are
struck others sound; that it is the habit of oysters
and of all shell-fish to grow with the growth of the
moon and to become smaller as it wanes; and that
trees are considered easiest to cut down in winter
and in the dark of the moon, because they are then
free from sap.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="34"/>"There is no need to go on and mention the
seas and straits with their tides, whose ebb and flow
are governed by the motion of the moon. Innumerable instances of the same kind may be given
to prove that some natural connexion does exist
between objects apparently unrelated. Concede

<pb id="p.409"/>

that it does exist; it does not contravene the point
I make, that no sort of a cleft in a liver is prophetic
of financial gain. What natural tie, or what
'symphony,' so to speak, or association, or what' sympathy,' as the Greeks term it, can there be between
a cleft in a liver and a petty addition to my purse?
Or what relationship between my miserable money-getting, on the one hand, and heaven, earth, and the
laws of nature on the other?</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>"However, I will concede even this if you
wish, though it will greatly weaken my case to admit
that there is any connexion between nature and
the condition of the entrails; <milestone unit="section" n="35"/>yet, suppose the concession made, how is it brought about that the man
in search of favourable signs will find a sacrifice
suited to his purpose? I thought the question
insoluble. But what a fine solution is offered! I
am not ashamed of you&mdash;I am actually astonished
at your memory; but I am ashamed of Chrysippus,
Antipater, and Posidonius who say exactly what you
said: ' The choice of the sacrificial victim is directed
by the sentient and divine power which pervades the
entire universe.</p>
<p>"But even more absurd is that other pronouncement of theirs which you adopted: ' At the moment
of sacrifice a change in the entrails takes place; something is added or something taken away; for all
things are obedient to the Divine Will.' <milestone unit="section" n="36"/>Upon my
word, no old woman is credulous enough now to
believe such stuff! Do you believe that the same
bullock, if chosen by one man, will have a liver
without a head, and if chosen by another will have
a liver with a head? And is it possible that this
sudden going or coming of the liver's head occurs

<pb id="p.411"/>

so that the entrails may adapt themselves to the situation of the person who offers the sacrifice? Do you
Stoics fail to see in choosing the victim it is almost
like a throw of the dice, especially as facts prove it?
For when the entrails of the first victim have been
without a head, which is the most fatal of all signs,
it often happens that the sacrifice of the next victim
is altogether favourable. Pray what became of the
warnings of the first set of entrails? And how was
the favour of the gods so completely and so suddenly
gained?</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>"But, you say, 'Once, when Caesar was
offering a sacrifice, there was no heart in the entrails
of the sacrificial bull;<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 52. 119.</note> and, since it would have
been impossible for the victim to live without a
heart, the heart must have disappeared at the
moment of immolation.' <milestone unit="section" n="37"/>How does it happen that
you understand the one fact, that the bull could
not have lived without a heart and do not realize
the other, that the heart could not suddenly have
vanished I know not where? As for me, possibly
I do not know what vital function the heart performs; if I do I suspect that the bull's heart, as the
result of a disease, became much wasted and shrunken
and lost its resemblance to a heart. But, assuming
that only a little while before the heart was in the
sacrificial bull, why do you think it suddenly disappeared at the very moment of immolation?
Don't you think, rather, that the bull lost his heart
when he saw that Caesar in his purple robe had
lost his head?<note>Cicero plays on the common use of <hi rend="italics">cor</hi> as= intelligence;
<hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> Caesar's remark on a like occasion (Suet. <hi rend="italics">Iul. Caesar</hi>

<p>"Upon my word you Stoics surrender the very
city of philosophy while defending its outworks!
For, by your insistence on the truth of soothsaying,

<pb id="p.413"/>

you utterly overthrow physiology. There is a head
to the liver and a heart in the entrails, presto! they
will vanish the very second you have sprinkled
them with meal and wine! Aye, some god will
snatch them away! Some invisible power will
destroy them or eat them up! Then the creation
and destruction of all things are not due to nature,
and there are some things which spring from nothing
or suddenly become nothing. Was any such statement ever made by any natural philosopher? 'It
is made,' you say, 'by soothsayers.' Then do you
think that soothsayers are worthier of belief than
natural philosophers?</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="38"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>"Again, when sacrifices are offered to
more than one god at the same time, how does it
happen that the auspices are favourable in one case
and unfavourable in another? Is it not strange
fickleness in the gods to threaten disaster in the
first set of entrails and to promise a blessing in the
next? Or is there such discord among the gods&mdash;
often even among those who are nearest of kin&mdash;
that the entrails of the sacrifice you offer to Apollo,
for example, are favourable and of those you offer
at the same time to Diana are unfavourable? When
victims for the sacrifice are brought up at haphazard
it is perfectly clear that the character of entrails
that you will receive will depend on the victim
chance may bring. Oh! but someone will say,
'The choice itself is a matter of divine guidance,
just as in the case of lots the drawing is directed by
the gods!' I shall speak of lots presently; although
you really do not strengthen the cause of sacrifices
by comparing them to lots; but you do weaken
the cause of lots by comparing them with sacrifices.

<pb id="p.415"/>

<milestone unit="section" n="39"/>When I send a slave to Aequimaelium to bring me
a lamb for a sacrifice and he brings me the lamb
which has entrails suited to the exigencies of my
particular case, it was not chance, I suppose, but a
god that led the slave to that particular lamb! If
you say that in this case too chance is, as it were,
a sort of lot in accordance with the divine will, then
I am sorry that our Stoic friends have given the Epicureans so great an opportunity for laughter, for
you know how much fun they make of statements
like that.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="40"/>"And they can laugh with the better grace
because Epicurus, to make the gods ridiculous, represents them as transparent, with the winds blowing
through them, and living between two worlds<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> in the <hi rend="italics">intermundia,</hi> <foreign lang="greek">metako/smia,</foreign> where they were
safe when a world fell to pieces.</note> (as
if between our two groves<note>The depression between the two peaks of the Capitoline
Hill was called <hi rend="italics">Asylum</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Inter Duos Lucos.</hi> According to
tradition it was there that Romulus established his asylum
or place of refuge for criminals. The groves were originally
on the summits. See Platner, <hi rend="italics">Topography and Monuments</hi>
<hi rend="italics">of Ancient Rome,</hi> p. 305.</note> ) from fear of the downfall. He further says that the gods have limbs
just as we have, but make no use of them. Hence,
while he takes a roundabout way to destroy the
gods, he does not hesitate to take a short road to
destroy divination. At any rate Epicurus is consistent, but the Stoics are not; for his god, who has
no concern for himself or for anybody else, cannot
impart divination to men. And neither can your
Stoic god impart divination, although he rules the
world and plans for the good of mankind. <milestone unit="section" n="41"/>Why
then do you Stoics involve yourselves in these
sophistries, which you can never explain? Members
of your school, when they are more hurried than
usual, generally give us this syllogism: 'If there
are gods, there is divination; but there are gods,
therefore there is divination.' A more logical one
would be this: 'There is no divination, therefore
there are no gods.' Observe how rashly they

<pb id="p.417"/>

commit themselves to the proposition, 'if there is
no divination, there are no gods.' I say 'rashly,'
for it is evident that divination has been destroyed
and yet we must hold on to the gods.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="42"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>"In demolishing divination by means of
entrails we have utterly demolished the soothsayer's
art; for the same fate awaits divination by means
of lightnings and portents. According to your view,
long-continued observation is employed in the case
of lightnings, and reason and conjecture are generally
employed in the case of portents. But what is it
that has been observed in the case of lightnings?
The Etruscans divided the sky into sixteen parts.
Of course it was easy enough for them to double
the four parts into which we divide it and then
double that total and tell from which one of those
divisions a bolt of lightning had come. In the first
place, what difference does its location make? and,
in the second place, what does it foretell? It is
perfectly evident that, out of the wonder and fear
excited in primitive man by lightning and thunderbolts, sprang his belief that those phenomena were
caused by omnipotent Jove. And so we find it
recorded in our augural annals: 'When Jove
thunders or lightens it is impious to hold an election.'
<milestone unit="section" n="43"/>This was ordained, perhaps, from reasons of political
expediency; for our ancestors wished to have some
excuse for not holding elections sometimes. And
so lightning is an unfavourable sign only in case of
an election; in all other cases we consider it the
best of auspices, if it appears on the left side. But I
shall speak of auspices in another connexion&mdash;now
I am going to discuss lightnings.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>"There is, then, no statement less worthy

<pb id="p.419"/>

of a natural philosopher than that anything can be
foretold with a certainty by uncertain signs. Of
course I do not think you are credulous enough to
believe that Jove's thunderbolt was made on Mount
Aetna by the Cyclopes. <milestone unit="section" n="44"/>For if he had but one bolt
his hurling it so often would be strange Nor would
he be able to give men so many advices by thunderbolts as to what they should or should not do. But
the Stoics account for the thunderbolt thus: 'When
the cold exhalations from the earth begin to circulate they become winds; when these winds enter a
cloud they begin to break-up and scatter its thinnest
portions; if they do this very rapidly and with great
violence, thunder and lightning are thereby produced.
Again, when clouds collide their heat is forcibly
driven out and the thunderbolt is the result.' Realizing, then, that these phenomena are due to natural
causes, and happen without regularity and at no
certain time, shall we look to them for signs of future
events? It is passing strange, if Jupiter warns us
by means of thunderbolts, that he sends so many
to no purpose! <milestone unit="section" n="45"/>What, for example, is his object
in hurling them into the middle of the sea? or, as
he so often does, on to the tops of lofty mountains?
Why, pray, does he waste them in solitary deserts?
And why does he fling them on the shores of peoples
who do not take any notice of them?</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>"Oh! but you say, 'the head was found in
the Tiber.'<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 10. 16.</note> As if I contended that your soothsayers were devoid of art! My contention is that
there is no divination. By dividing the heavens in
the manner already indicated<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> ii. 18. 42.</note> and by noting what
happened in each division the soothsayers learn
whence the thunderbolt comes and whither it goes,

<pb id="p.421"/>

but no method can show that the thunderbolt has
any prophetic value. However, you array those
verses of mine against me:

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l>For high-thundering Jove, as he stood on starry Olympus,</l>
<l>Hurtled his blows at the temples and monuments raised in his honour,</l>
<l>And on the Capitol's site unloosed the bolts of his lightning.</l></quote></p>

<p>'Then,' the poem goes on to say, 'the statue of
Natta, the images of the gods and the piece representing Romulus and Remus, with their wolf-nurse,
were struck by a thunderbolt and fell to the ground.
The prophecies made by the soothsayers from these
events were fulfilled to the letter.' <milestone unit="section" n="46"/>Besides, you
quote me as authority for the remarkable fact that,
at the very time when proof of the conspiracy was
being presented to the Senate, the statue of Jupiter,
which had been contracted for two years before, was
being erected on the Capitol.</p>
<p>"'Will you then '&mdash;for thus you pleaded with
me&mdash;' will you then persuade yourself to take sides
against me in this discussion, in the face of your
own writings and of your own practice? ' You are
my brother and on that account I shrink from recrimination.<note>Orelli interprets thus: <hi rend="italics">eo vereor dicere, te vel desipere,

in this matter? Is it the nature of the subject?
Or is it my insistence on finding out the truth?
And so I waive your charge of my inconsistency&mdash;
I am asking <hi rend="italics">you</hi> for an explanation of the entire
subject of soothsaying. But you betook yourself to
a strange place of refuge. You knew that you
would be in straits when I asked your reason for
each kind of divination, and, hence, you had much

<pb id="p.423"/>

to say to this effect: 'Since I see what divination
does I do not ask the reason or the cause why it
does it. The question is, what does it do? not,
why does it do it? ' As if I would grant either that
divination accomplished anything, or that it was
permissible for a philosopher not to ask why anything happened! <milestone unit="section" n="47"/>It was in that same connexion
that you brought forth my <hi rend="italics">Prognostics</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 8. 13.</note> and some
samples of herbs&mdash;the scammony and aristolochia<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 10. 16.</note> 
root&mdash;saying that you could see their virtue and
effect but did not know the cause.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>"But your illustrations are not pertinent
at all. For example, the causes of meteorological
phenomena have been investigated by Bo&euml;thus<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 8. 13.</note> the
Stoic, whom you mentioned, and by our friend
Posidonius; and even if the causes are not discovered by them, yet the phenomena themselves
are capable of observation and study. But what
opportunity was there for long-continued observation
in the case where Natta's statue and the brazen
tablets of laws were struck by lightning?<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 12. 19.</note> 'The
Nattas,' you say, 'were of the Pinarian gens<note>The Pinarian gens was one of the most ancient patrician
families at Rome.</note> and
of noble birth, therefore danger was to be expected
from the nobility.' So clever of Jupiter to devise
such a means to warn us of danger! 'The statue of
the infant Romulus,' you observe, ' was struck by a
thunderbolt; hence danger was thereby predicted
to the city which he founded.' How wise of Jupiter
to use signs in conveying information to us! Again,
you say, 'Jupiter's statue was being set up at the
very time the conspiracy was being exposed.'<note>i. 12. 21.</note> You,
of course, prefer to attribute this coincidence to a
divine decree rather than to chance. The man to
whom Cotta and Torquatus let the contract for the

<pb id="p.425"/>

statue did not, I presume, delay the completion of
his work either from lack of energy or from lack
of funds, but his hand was stayed till the appointed
hour by the immortal gods!</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="48"/>"I am not a hopeless sceptic on the subject of
such warnings really being sent by the gods; however, I do not know that they are and I want to
learn the actual facts from you. Again, when
certain other events occurred as they had been
foretold by diviners and I attributed the coincidence
to chance, you talked a long time about chance.
You said, for example, 'For the Venus-throw to
result from one cast of the four dice might be due
to chance; but if a hundred Venus-throws resulted
from one hundred casts this could not be due to
chance.'<note>i. 13. 23.</note> In the first place I do not know why it
could not; but I do not contest the point, for you
are full of the same sort of examples&mdash;like that
about the scattering of the paints and that one
about the hog's snout,<note>i. 13. 23.</note> and you had very many
other examples besides. You also mentioned that
myth from Carneades about the head of Pan<note>i. 13. 23.</note> &mdash;as if
the likeness could not have been the result of chance!
and as if every block of marble did not necessarily
have within it heads worthy of Praxiteles! For his
masterpieces were made by chipping away the
marble, not by adding anything to it; and when,
after much chipping, the lineaments of a face were
reached, one then realized that the work now
polished and complete had always been inside the
block. <milestone unit="section" n="49"/>Therefore, it is possible that some such
figure as Carneades described did spontaneously
appear in the Chian quarries. On the other hand,
the story may be untrue. Again, you have often

<pb id="p.427"/>

noticed clouds take the form of a lion or a hippocentaur. Therefore it is possible for chance to
imitate reality, and this you just now denied.<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 13. 23 <hi rend="italics">ad fin.</hi></note> </p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>"But since entrails and lightnings have
been sufficiently discussed it remains for us to
examine portents, if we are to treat soothsaying in
its entirety. You spoke of a mule bearing a colt.<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i 18. 36.</note> 
Such an event excites wonder because it seldom
occurs; but if it had been impossible it would not
have occurred. And it may be urged with effect
against all portents that the impossible never has
happened and that the possible need not excite any
wonder. Now, in case of some new occurrence,
ignorance of its cause is what excites our wonder;
whereas, the same ignorance as to things of frequent
occurrence does not. For the man who marvels that
a mule has foaled does not understand how a mare
foals and is ignorant of animal parturition in general.
What he sees frequently causes him no astonishment
even though he does not know how it happened. If
something happens which he never saw before he
considers it a portent. Then, which is the portent&mdash;
the mule's conception or its parturition? <milestone unit="section" n="50"/>The conception, it may be, is contrary to the usual course
of nature, but the parturition follows as a necessary
sequel of conception.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>"It seems useless to say more about
soothsaying. However, let us examine its origin
and thus we shall very readily determine its value.
The tradition is that, once upon a time, in the district
of Tarquinii, while a field was being ploughed, the
ploughshare went deeper than usual and a certain
Tages suddenly sprang forth and spoke to the
ploughman. Now this Tages, according to the

<pb id="p.429"/>

Etruscan annals, is said to have had the appearance
of a boy, but the wisdom of a seer. Astounded and
much frightened at the sight, the rustic raised a
great cry; a crowd gathered and, indeed, in a short
time, the whole of Etruria assembled at the spot.
Tages<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Ovid, <hi rend="italics">Met.</hi> xv. 553.</note> then spoke at length to his numerous hearers,
who received with eagerness all that he had to say,
and committed it to writing. His whole address
was devoted to an exposition of the science of soothsaying. Later, as new facts were learned and tested
by reference to the principles imparted by Tages,
they were added to the original fund of knowledge.</p>
<p>"This is the story as we get it from the Etruscans
themselves and as their records preserve it, and
this, in their own opinion, is the origin of their art.
<milestone unit="section" n="51"/>Now do we need a Carneades or an Epicurus to
refute such nonsense? Who in the world is stupid
enough to believe that anybody ever ploughed up
&mdash;which shall I say&mdash;a god or a man? If a god,
why did he, contrary to his nature, hide himself in
the ground to be uncovered and brought to the
light of day by a plough? Could not this so-called
god have delivered this art to mankind from a more
exalted station? But if this fellow Tages was a
man, pray, how could he have lived covered with
earth? Finally, where had he himself learned the
things he taught others? But really in spending
so much time in refuting such stuff I am more absurd
than the very people who believe it.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>"But indeed, that was quite a clever
remark which Cato made many years ago: 'I
wonder,' said he, 'that a soothsayer doesn't laugh
when he sees another soothsayer.' <milestone unit="section" n="52"/>For how many
things predicted by them really come true? If any

<pb id="p.431"/>

do come true, then what reason can be advanced
why the agreement of the event with the prophecy
was not due to chance? While Hannibal was in
exile at the court of King Prusias he advised the
king to go to war, but the king replied, 'I do not
dare, because the entrails forbid.' ' And do you,' said
Hannibal, 'put more reliance in pieces of ox-meat
than you do in a veteran commander?' Again,
when Caesar himself was warned by a most eminent
soothsayer not to cross over to Africa before the
winter solstice, did he not cross? If he had not done
so all the forces opposed to him would have effected
a junction. Why need I give instances&mdash;and, in
fact, I could give countless ones&mdash;where the prophecies of soothsayers either were without result or
the issue was directly the reverse of the prophecy?
<milestone unit="section" n="53"/>Ye gods, how many times they were mistaken in
the late civil war! What oracular messages the
soothsayers sent from Rome to our Pompeian party
then in Greece! What assurances they gave to
Pompey! For he placed great reliance in divination
by means of entrails and portents. I have no wish to call
these instances to mind, and indeed it is unnecessary
&mdash;especially to you, since you had personal knowledge
of them. Still, you are aware that the result was
nearly always contrary to the prophecy. But enough
on this point: let us now come to portents.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="54"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>"You have cited many instances of portents from the verses which I wrote during my consulship<note>i. 11. 17&ndash;21.</note> ; you adduced many others which occurred
prior to the Marsian War<note>i. 44. 99.</note> and which are included in
Sisenna's compilation, and you mentioned a great
number which are recorded by Callisthenes and
which preceded the unfortunate battle of the

<pb id="p.433"/>

Spartans at Leuctra.<note>i. 34. 74.</note> I shall, of course, speak of
each of these instances separately, in so far as they
require notice; but I must first discuss portents
generally. Now, what is the nature of these intimations, or of this advance-information, as it were,
sent out by the gods to apprise us of coming disasters?
In the first place, why do immortal gods see fit to
give us warnings which we can't understand without
the aid of interpreters? In the next place, why do
they warn us of things which we cannot avoid? Why,
even a mortal, if he has a proper sense of duty, does
not warn his friends of imminent disasters which
can in no way be escaped. Physicians, for example,
although they know many times that their patients
are going to die of a present disease, yet never tell
them so; for a forewarning of an evil is justified
only when to the warning is joined a means of escape.
<milestone unit="section" n="55"/>How, then, did portents or their interpreters help
the Spartans of long ago, or our Pompeian friends
in more recent times? If these signs you speak of
are to be considered as sent by the gods, why were
they so obscure? For, if we had the right to know
what was going to happen, it should have been stated
to us clearly: or, if the gods did not wish us to know,
they should not have told us&mdash;even in riddles.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>"Now every sort of conjecture&mdash;and
divination depends on conjecture&mdash;is often applied
by the wit of man to many different and even contradictory uses. As in judicial causes the prosecutor
draws one inference and the lawyer for the defendant
another from the same set of facts, and yet the
inferences of both are plausible; so, in all investigations in which it is customary to employ conjecture,
ambiguity is found. Moreover, in the case of things

<pb id="p.435"/>

that happen now by chance now in the usual course
of nature (sometimes too mistakes are caused by
taking appearance for reality), it is the height of
folly to hold the gods as the direct agents and not
to inquire into the causes of such things.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="56"/>"You believe that the Boeotian bards at Lebadia
foretold victory for the Thebans from the crowing of
cocks; for cocks, you say, are wont to be silent when
defeated and to crow when victorious.<note>i. 34. 74.</note> Do you
really believe that Jupiter would have employed
chickens to convey such a message to so great a
state? And is it true that these fowls are not accustomed to crow except when they are victorious
But at that time they did crow and they had not
been victorious. ' Oh! that was a <quote>portent,</quote> 'you
say. A fine portent indeed! you talk as if a fish
and not a cock had done the crowing! But come;
is there any time, day or night, when they are not
liable to crow? And if the pleasant sensation&mdash;or
'joy' if you will&mdash;which comes from victory causes
them to crow, then, possibly, joy springing from some
other source may have the same effect. <milestone unit="section" n="57"/>By the
way, Democritus gives a very good explanation of
why cocks crow before day. 'Their food,' he says,
' after it has been digested, is expelled from the craw
and is distributed over the entire body. By the
time that process is completed they have had sleep
enough and begin to crow.' And then, 'in the
silence of the night,' as Ennius says, ' they indulge
their russet throats in song and beat their flapping
wings.' In view, then, of the fact that this creature
is prone to crow of its own volition at any time,
and may be made to crow either by nature or by
chance, how did it ever occur to Callisthenes to say

<pb id="p.437"/>

that the gods conveyed prophecies to men by the
crowing of cocks?</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="58"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>"'Reports,' you say, 'were made to the
Senate that there was a shower of blood, that the
river Atratus actually flowed with blood and that
the statues of the gods dripped with sweat. ' You
do not think for a moment that Thales, Anaxagoras,
or any other natural philosopher would have believed
such reports? Sweat and blood you may be sure
do not come except from animate bodies. An effect
strikingly like blood is produced by the admixture
of water with certain kinds of soil; and the moisture
which forms on the outside of objects, as we see it
on our plastered walls when the south wind blows,
seems to resemble sweat. Such occurrences, which
in time of war appear to the timid to be most frequent
and most real, are scarcely noticed in times of peace.
Moreover, in periods of fear and of danger stories
of portents are not only more readily believed, but
they are invented with greater impunity. <milestone unit="section" n="59"/>But are
we simple and thoughtless enough to think it a
portent for mice to gnaw something, when gnawing
is their one business in life? 'But,' you say, ' the
fact that just before the Marsian War mice gnawed
the shields at Lanuvium was pronounced by the
soothsayers to be a very direful portent.'<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 44. 99.</note> As if it
mattered a whit whether mice, which are gnawing

tales of portents, whether of animal or of human
birth? Not to be too verbose, all portents have one
and the same explanation and it is this: whatever
comes into existence, of whatever kind, must needs
find its cause in nature; and hence, even though it
may be contrary to experience, it cannot be contrary to nature. Therefore, explore the cause, if
you can, of every strange thing that excites your
astonishment. If you do not' find the cause be
assured, nevertheless, that nothing could have
happened without a cause, and employ the principles
of natural philosophy to banish the fear which the
novelty of the apparition may have occasioned.
Then no earthquake or opening of the heavens, no
showers of stones or blood, no shooting stars, or
comets, will fill you with alarm.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="61"/>"If I were to ask Chrysippus the causes of all
the phenomena just mentioned, that distinguished
writer on divination would never say that they
happened by chance, but he would find an explanation for each of them in the laws of nature. For he
would say: ' Nothing can happen without a cause;
nothing actually happens that cannot happen; if
that has happened which could have happened, then
it should not be considered a portent; therefore
there are no such things as portents.' Now if a
thing is to be considered a portent because it is
seldom seen, then a wise man is a portent; for,
as I think, it oftener happens that a mule brings
forth a colt than that nature produces a sage. Chrysippus, in this connexion, gives the following
syllogism: 'That which could not have happened
never did happen; and that which could have

<pb id="p.441"/>

happened is no portent; therefore, in any view,
there is no such thing as a portent.' <milestone unit="section" n="62"/>This is illustrated by the story of a clever response made by a
certain diviner and interpreter of portents. A man referred to him for interpretation as a portent the fact
that a snake was seen at his house, coiled about a beam.
' That was not a portent,' said the diviner; ' it would
have been if the beam had been wrapped around the
snake.' By this answer he said plainly enough: ' Nothing that can happen is to be considered a portent.'</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>"You refer to a letter, written by Gaius
Gracchus to Marcus Pomponius, stating that Tiberius
Gracchus, father of Gaius, caught two snakes in his
house and called together the soothsayers.<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 18. 36.</note> And
why a conference about snakes rather than about
lizards or mice? You answer, 'Because we see
lizards and mice every day; snakes we do not.' As
if it makes any difference how often a thing happens
if it can happen at all! And yet what surprises me
is this: If the release of the female snake was to
be fatal to Tiberius Gracchus and that of the male
was to be the death of Cornelia, why in the world
did he let either snake escape? For Gaius in his
letter does not state that the soothsayers expressed
any opinion as to the result if neither snake had
been released. 'Be that as it may,' you reply,
'death overtook Gracchus.' That is granted, but
his death was caused by some very serious illness
and not by the release of the snake. Besides, soothsayers are not so unlucky that their predictions
never come true&mdash;even by accident!</p>

deduce years rather than months or days from the

his prophecy on little sparrows which are not abnormal

&mdash;that the dragon was turned to stone? Finally,
what is there about a sparrow to suggest 'years'?
In connexion with your story of the snake which
appeared to Sulla when he was offering sacrifices,<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 33. 72.</note> 
I recall two facts: first, that when Sulla offered
sacrifices, as he was about to begin his march against
the enemy, a snake came out from under the altar;
and, second, that the glorious victory won by him
that day was due not to the soothsayer's art, but to
the skill of the general.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="66"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>"There is nothing remarkable about the
so-called portents of the kind just mentioned; but
after they have happened they are brought within
the field of prophecy by some interpretation. Take,
for example, your stories of the grains of wheat
heaped into the mouth of Midas when a boy,<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 36. 78.</note> and of
the bees which settled on the lips of Plato,<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 36. 78.</note> when he
was a child&mdash;they are more remarkable as guesses
than as real prophecies. Besides, the incidents may
have been fictitious; if not, then the fulfilment of
the prophecy may have been accidental. As to that
incident about Roscius it may, of course, be untrue
that a snake coiled itself around him;<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 36. 79.</note> but it is not
so surprising that a snake was in his cradle&mdash;especially in Solonium where snakes are attracted in
large numbers by the heat of the fireplaces. As to
your statement that the soothsayers prophesied a
career of unrivalled brilliancy for Roscius, it is a
strange thing to me that the immortal gods foretold

<pb id="p.447"/>

the glory of a future actor and did not foretell that
of Africanus!</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="67"/>"And you have even collected the portent-stories
connected with Flaminius:<note><hi rend="italics">Cf</hi>. i. 35. 77.</note> 'His horse,' you say,
'stumbled and fell with him.' That is very strange,
isn't it? And, 'The standard of the first company
could not be pulled up.' Perhaps the standard bearer had planted it stoutly and pulled it up timidly.
What is astonishing in the fact that the horse of
Dionysius<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 33. 73.</note> came up out of the river, or that it had
bees in its mane? And yet, because Dionysius
began to reign a short time later&mdash;which was a mere
coincidence&mdash;the event referred to is considered a
portent! 'The arms sounded,' you say, 'in the
temple of Hercules in Sparta; the folding-doors
of the same god at Thebes, though securely barred,
opened of their own accord, and the shields hanging
upon the walls of that temple fell to the ground.'<note><hi rend="italics">Cf</hi>. i. 34. 74.</note> 
Now since none of these things could have happened
without some exterior force, why should we say that
they were brought about by divine agency rather
than by chance?</p>

And do you think the crown of herbs appeared
before their seeds were formed? Besides, the wild
herbs, in my opinion, came from seeds brought by
birds and were not planted by human agency.
Again, imagination can make anything on top of a
head look like a crown. 'At the same time,' you
say, ' the golden stars in the temple of Castor and
Pollux at Delphi fell down and were nowhere to
be found.'<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 34. 75.</note> That appears to me to have been the

'if Lake Albanus overflowed and emptied into the
sea, Rome would fall, but if held in check Veii would
fall.' Well, it turned out that the water from the
lake was drawn off&mdash;but it was drawn off through
irrigation ditches&mdash;not to save the Capitol and the
city, but to improve the farming lands. ' And, not
long after this occurred, a voice was heard,' you say,
'warning the people to take steps to prevent the
capture of Rome by the Gauls. Therefore an altar
was erected on the <hi rend="italics">Nova Via</hi> in honour of Aius the
Speaker.' But why? Did your' Aius the Speaker,'
before anybody knew who he was, both speak and
talk and from that fact receive his name? And
after he had secured a seat, an altar, and a name did
he become mute? Your Juno Moneta<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 45. 101.</note> may likewise be dismissed with a question: What did she
ever admonish us about except the pregnant sow?</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="70"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>"Enough has been said of portents;
auspices remain and so do lots&mdash;I mean ' lots' that
are drawn, and not those uttered by prophets, and
more correctly styled ' oracles.' I shall speak of
oracles when I get to natural divination. In addition
I must discuss the Chaldeans. But first let us consider auspices. 'To argue against auspices is a
hard thing,' you say, 'for an augur to do.' Yes, for
a Marsian, perhaps; but very easy for a Roman.

<pb id="p.451"/>

For we Roman augurs are not the sort who foretell
the future by observing the flights of birds and other
signs. And yet, I admit that Romulus, who founded
the city by the direction of auspices, believed that
augury was an art useful in seeing things to come&mdash;
for the ancients had erroneous views on many subjects. But we see that the art has undergone a
change, due to experience, education, or the long
lapse of time. However, out of respect for the
opinion of the masses and because of the great
service to the State we maintain the augural practices, discipline, religious rites and laws, as well as
the authority of the augural college.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="71"/>"In my opinion the consuls, Publius Claudius and
Lucius Junius, who set sail contrary to the auspices,
were deserving of capital punishment; for they should
have respected the established religion and should
not have treated the customs of their forefathers
with such shameless disdain. Therefore it was a
just retribution that the former was condemned by
a vote of the people and that the latter took his own
life. ' Flaminius,' you say,' did not obey the auspices,
therefore he perished with his army.' But a year
later Paulus did obey them; and did he not lose his
army and his life in the battle of Cannae? Granting
that there are auspices (as there are not), certainly
those which we ordinarily employ&mdash;whether by the
<hi rend="italics">tripudium</hi> or by the observation of the heavens&mdash;
are not auspices in any sense, but are the mere
ghosts of auspices.<note>Cicero now proceeds to illustrate his point by giving
the empty formulae used by the magistrates in taking the
auspices. He represents himself as the celebrant and
addresses his assistant, the augur, as <quote>Quintus Fabius</quote>&mdash;
the name of any free man you please and as indefinite and
impersonal as <quote>John Doe,</quote> or <quote>Richard Roe.</quote></note> </p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>"'Quintus Fabius, I wish you to assist
me at the auspices.' He answers, ' I will.' (In our
forefathers' time the magistrates on such occasions
used to call in some expert person to take the

<pb id="p.453"/>

auspices&mdash;but in these days anyone will do. But
one must be an expert to know what constitutes ' silence,' for by that term we mean 'free
of every augural defect.' <milestone unit="section" n="72"/>To understand that
belongs to a perfect augur.) After the celebrant<note><quote>The celebrant</quote> is here intended to translate <hi rend="italics">is, qui</hi>
<hi rend="italics">auspicatur, i.e.</hi> the magistrate who directs and presides
at the taking of the auspices; while <hi rend="italics">qui in auspicium
adhibetur</hi> is the expert (the augur, the assistant), who actually
takes the auspices.</note> 
has said to his assistant, 'Tell me when silence
appears to exist,' the latter, without looking up or
about him, immediately replies, 'Silence appears to
exist.' Then the celebrant says, 'Tell me when the
chickens begin to eat.' 'They are eating now,' is
the answer. But what are these birds they are
talking about, and where are they? Someone
replies,' It's poultry. It's in a cage and the person
who brought it is called <quote>a poulterer,</quote> because of
his business.' These, then, are the messengers of
Jove! What difference does it make whether they
eat or not? None, so far as the auspices are concerned. But, because of the fact that, while they
eat, some food must necessarily fall from their
mouths and strike upon the ground (<hi rend="italics">terram pavire</hi>),&mdash;
this at first was called <hi rend="italics">terripavium,</hi> and later, <hi rend="italics">terripudium;</hi> now it is called <hi rend="italics">tripudium</hi>&mdash;therefore, when
a crumb of food falls from a chicken's mouth a
<hi rend="italics">tripudium solistimum</hi> is announced to the celebrant.<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 15. 28.</note> </p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="73"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>"Then, how can there be anything divine
about an auspice so forced and so extorted? That
such a practice did not prevail with the augurs
of ancient times is proven by an old ruling of our
college which says,' Any bird may make a <hi rend="italics">tripudium.'</hi>
There might be an auspice if the bird were free to
show itself outside its cage. In that case it might
be called 'the interpreter and satellite of Jove.'<note><hi rend="italics"> Cf.</hi> i. 47. 106; Horn. <hi rend="italics">Od.</hi> xv. 525.</note> 
But now, when shut up inside a cage and tortured
by hunger, if it seizes greedily upon its morsel of

<pb id="p.455"/>

pottage and something falls from its mouth, do you
consider that is an auspice? Or do you believe that
this was the way in which Romulus used to take
the auspices? <milestone unit="section" n="74"/>Again, do you not think that formerly
it was the habit of the celebrants themselves to
make observation of the heavens? Now they order
the poulterer, and he gives responses!<note>Apparently Cicero ridicules the idea of a <quote>poulterer</quote>
and not the <quote>celebrant</quote> taking the auspices.</note> We regard
lightning on the left as a most favourable omen
for everything except for an election, and this exception was made, no doubt, from reasons of political
expediency so that the rulers of the State would be
the judges of the regularity of an election, whether
held to pass judgements in criminal cases, or to enact
laws, or to elect magistrates.</p>
<p>"'The consuls, Scipio and Figulus,' you say,
'resigned their office when the augurs rendered a
decision based on a letter written by Tiberius
Gracchus, to the effect that those consuls had not
been elected according to augural law.' Who denies
that augury is an art? What I deny is the existence
of divination. But you say: ' Soothsayers have the
power of divination'; and you mention the fact
that, on account of the unexpected death of the
person who had suddenly fallen while bringing in
the report of the vote of the prerogative century,
Tiberius Gracchus introduced the soothsayers into
the Senate and they declared that 'the president'
had violated augural law.<note>See this incident more fully described in Cic. <hi rend="italics">N.D.</hi> ii.
chap. 4.; <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> i. 17. 33. The prerogative century&mdash;or the
one which voted first at the election&mdash;had its <hi rend="italics">rogator,</hi> or
president, who collected the votes; and the entire assembly,
made up of all the electors voting by centuries, had its
<hi rend="italics">rogator,</hi> usually the consul who received the reports of the
subordinate presidents.</note> <milestone unit="section" n="75"/>Now, in the first place,
do not understand that by 'the president' they
meant the president of the prerogative century, for
he was dead; and, moreover, they could have told
that by conjecture without the use of divination;
or, in the second place, perhaps, they said so by
accident which is in no wise to be left out of account

<pb id="p.457"/>

in cases of this kind. For what could the Etruscan
soothsayers have known, either as to whether the
<hi rend="italics">tabernaculum</hi> had been properly placed, or as to
whether the regulations pertaining to the <hi rend="italics">pomerium</hi><note>As to <hi rend="italics">tabernaculum</hi> and <hi rend="italics">pomerium</hi> see i. 17. 33 and note
</note> 
had been observed? For my part, I agree with
Gaius Marcellus, rather than with Appius Claudius
&mdash;both of whom were my colleagues&mdash;and I think
that, although in the beginning augural law was
established from a belief in divination, yet later it
was maintained and preserved from considerations
of political expediency. <milestone unit="section" n="76"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>But we shall
discuss the latter point at greater length in other
discourses; let us dismiss it for the present.</p>
<p>"Now let us examine augury as practised among
foreign nations, whose methods are not so artificial
as they are superstitious. They employ almost
all kinds of birds, we only a few; they regard
some signs as favourable, we, others. Deiotarus
used to question me a great deal about our system
of augury, and I him about that of his country.
Ye gods! how much they differed! So much that
in some cases they were directly the reverse of each
other. He employed auspices constantly, we never
do except when the duty of doing so is imposed by
a vote of the people. Our ancestors would not
undertake any military enterprise without consulting the auspices; but now, for many years, our
wars have been conducted by pro-consuls and propraetors, who do not have the right to take auspices.
<milestone unit="section" n="77"/>Therefore they have no <hi rend="italics">tripudium</hi> and they cross
rivers without first taking the auspices. What, then,
has become of divining by means of birds? It is
not used by those who conduct our wars, for they
have not the right of auspices. Since it has been

<pb id="p.459"/>

withdrawn from use in the field I suppose it is
reserved for city use only!</p>
<p>"As to divination <hi rend="italics">ex acuminibus, </hi><note>This is supposed to be a divining by means of electrical

military, it was wholly ignored by that famous man,
Marcus Marcellus, who was consul five times and,
besides, was a commander-in-chief, as well as a
very fine augur. In fact, he used to say that, if
he wished to execute some man&oelig;uvre which he
did not want interfered with by the auspices, he
would travel in a closed litter.<note>So that he would not see any unpropitious signs.</note> His method is of
a kind with the advice which we augurs give, that
the draught-cattle be ordered to be unyoked so as to
prevent a <hi rend="italics">iuge auspicium.</hi><note>This occurred when two draught cattle while yoked
together dunged at the same time.</note> <milestone unit="section" n="78"/>What else does a refusal
to be warned by Jove accomplish except either to
prevent an auspice from occurring, or, if it occurs,
to prevent it from being seen?</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>"Your story about Deiotarus<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 15.26-27.</note> is utterly
absurd: ' He did not regret the auspices given him
as he was setting out to join Pompey. They caused
him to continue in the path of loyalty and friendship
to the Roman people and to perform his duty; for
he valued his reputation and glory more than
kingdom and riches.' I dare say; but that has
nothing to do with auspices. For the crow could
not tell Deiotarus that he was doing right in preparing to defend the liberty of the Roman people.
He ought to have realized that of himself, and in
fact he did. <milestone unit="section" n="79"/>Birds indicate that results will be unfavourable or favourable. In my view of the case
Deiotarus employed the auspices of virtue, and
virtue bids us not to look to fortune until the claims
of honour are discharged. However, if the birds
indicated that the issue would be favourable to
Deiotarus they certainly deceived him. He fled

<pb id="p.461"/>

from the battle with Pompey&mdash;a serious situation!
He separated from Pompey&mdash;an occasion of sorrow!
He beheld Caesar at once his enemy and his guest
&mdash;what could have been more distressing than that?
Caesar wrested from him the tetrarchy over the
Trocmi and conferred it upon some obscure sycophant of his own from Pergamus; deprived him of
Armenia, a gift from the Senate; accepted a most
lavish hospitality at the hands of his royal host
and left him utterly despoiled. But I wander too
far: I must return to the point at issue. If we
examine this matter from the standpoint of the
results&mdash;and that was the question submitted to
the determination of the birds&mdash;the issue was in
no sense favourable to Deiotarus; but if we examine
it from the standpoint of duty, he sought information
on that score not from the auspices, but from his
own conscience.</p>

many matters? What wonder, then, if in auspices
and in every kind of divination weak minds should
adopt the superstitious practices which you have
mentioned and should be unable to discern the
truth? <milestone unit="section" n="82"/>Moreover, there is no uniformity, and no
consistent and constant agreement between augurs.
Ennius, speaking with reference to the Roman
system of augury, said:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>Then on the left, from out a cloudless sky,</l>
<l>Jove's thunder rolled its goodly omen forth.</l></quote> <bibl>From the <hi rend="italics">Annales,</hi> ii. 5.</bibl></cit></quote>

But Homer's Ajax<note><hi rend="italics"> Cf. Iliad,</hi> ix. 236. Cicero's memory again deceives
him, the reference being to Ulysses.</note> in complaining to Achilles of
some ferocious deed or other of the Trojans, speaks
in this wise:

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l>For their success Jove thunders on the right.</l></quote>

<pb id="p.465"/>

So we regard signs on the left as best&mdash;Greeks and
barbarians, those on the right. And yet I am aware
that we call favourable signs <hi rend="italics">sinistra,</hi> or 'left-hand'
signs, even though they may be on the right.<note>In taking the auspices Roman augurs faced the south,
Greek augurs faced the north, and hence the left of the
Roman observer would be the right of the Greek. Put some
right-hand signs were favourable to the Romans&mdash;e.g. the
croaking of a crow; <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> i. 7. 12.</note> Undoubtedly our ancestors in choosing the left side
and foreign nations the right were both influenced
by what experience had shown them was the
more favourable quarter in most cases. <milestone unit="section" n="83"/>What a
conflict this is! In view, then, of the differences
between different nations in the responses, in the
manner in which observations are made and in
the kinds of birds and signs employed, need I
assert that divination is compounded of a little
error, a little superstition, and a good deal of
fraud?</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>"And to these superstitions you have actually
joined omens! For example: ' Aemilia told Paulus
that Persa was dead and her father accepted this
as an omen.'<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 46. 103.</note> ' Caecilia said that she surrendered
her seat to her sister's daughter.' Then you go
on and speak of the order of <hi rend="italics">silence,</hi> <hi rend="italics">favete linguis</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 45. 102.</note> 
and the 'prerogative,' or omen of the elections.<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 45. 103.</note> 
This is indeed turning the artillery of one's eloquence
and learning against oneself! For while on the
watch for these 'oracles' of yours could you be so
free and calm of mind that you would have reason
and not superstition to guide your course? Now, if a
person in the course of his own business or conversation should make some remark, and a word spoken
by him happened to apply to what you were doing
or thinking, do you really believe that such an
accident should cause you either fear or joy? <milestone unit="section" n="84"/>When
Marcus Crassus was embarking his army at Brundisium <note>When he was starting on his fatal expedition against
the Parthians.</note> 
a man who was selling Caunian figs at the

Let us say, if you will, that this was a warning to
Crassus to bid him 'Beware of going,' and that if
he had obeyed the omen he would not have perished.
But if we are going to accept chance utterances of
this kind as omens, we had better look out when
we stumble, or break a shoe-string, or sneeze!</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>"Lots and the Chaldean astrologers remain
to be discussed before we come to prophets and to
dreams. <milestone unit="section" n="85"/>And pray what is the need, do you think,
to talk about the casting of lots? It is much like
playing at morra, dice, or knuckle-bones, in which
recklessness and luck prevail rather than reflection
and judgement. The whole scheme of divination by
lots was fraudulently contrived from mercenary
motives, or as a means of encouraging superstition
and error. But let us follow the method used in
the discussion of soothsaying and consider the
traditional origin of the most famous lots. According
to the annals of Praeneste Numerius Suffustius, who
was a distinguished man of noble birth, was admonished by dreams, often repeated, and finally even
by threats, to split open a flint rock which was lying
in a designated place. Frightened by the visions
and disregarding the jeers of his fellow-townsmen
he set about doing as he had been directed. And
so when he had broken open the stone, the lots
sprang forth carved on oak, in ancient characters.
The site where the stone was found is religiously
guarded to this day. It is hard by the statue of
the infant Jupiter, who is represented as sitting
with Juno in the lap of Fortune and reaching for her
breast, and it is held in the highest reverence by
mothers.</p>

<pb id="p.469"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="86"/>"There is a tradition that, concurrently with the
finding of the lots and in the spot where the temple
of Fortune now stands, honey flowed from an olive-tree. Now the soothsayers, who had declared that
those lots would enjoy an unrivalled reputation,
gave orders that a chest should be made from the
tree and the lots placed in the chest. At the present
time the lots are taken from their receptacle if
Fortune directs.<note>If the statue of the goddess gives a sign by a nod or
otherwise.</note> What reliance, pray, can you put
in these lots, which at Fortune's nod are shuffled
and drawn by the hand of a child? And how did
they ever get in that rock? Who cut down the oak-tree? and who fashioned and carved the lots?
Oh! but somebody says, ' God can bring anything
to pass.' If so, then I wish he had made the Stoics
wise, so that they would not be so pitiably and
distressingly superstitious and so prone to believe
everything they hear! This sort of divining, however, has now been discarded by general usage.
The beauty and age of the temple still preserve
the name of the lots of Praeneste&mdash;that is, among
the common people, <milestone unit="section" n="87"/>for no magistrate and no man
of any reputation ever consults them; but in all
other places lots have gone entirely out of use.
And this explains the remark which, according to
Clitomachus, Carneades used to make that he had
at no other place seen Fortune more fortunate than
at Praeneste.<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the reputation of the lots at Praeneste lasted longer
than elsewhere.</note> Then let us dismiss this branch of
divination.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>"Let us come to Chaldean manifestations.
In discussing them Plato's pupil, Eudoxus, whom
the best scholars consider easily the first in astronomy, has left the following opinion in writing:
'No reliance whatever is to be placed in Chaldean

<pb id="p.471"/>

astrologers when they profess to forecast a man's
future from the position of the stars on the day of
his birth.' <milestone unit="section" n="88"/>Panaetius, too, who was the only one
of the Stoics to reject the prophecies of astrologers,<note>The word <hi rend="italics">astrologus</hi>=<quote>student of the stars,</quote> can mean
either <quote>astronomer</quote> or <quote>astrologer.</quote></note> 
mentions Anchialus and Cassander as the greatest
astronomers of his day and states that they did not
employ their art as a means of divining, though they
were eminent in all other branches of astronomy.
Scylax of Halicarnassus, an intimate friend of Panaetius, and an eminent astronomer, besides being
the head of the government in his own city, utterly
repudiated the Chaldean method of foretelling the
future.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="89"/>"But let us dismiss our witnesses and employ
reasoning. Those men who defend the natal-day
prophecies of the Chaldeans, argue in this way:
' In the starry belt which the Greeks call the Zodiac
there is a certain force of such a nature that every
part of that belt affects and changes the heavens in a
different way, according to the stars that are in
this or in an adjoining locality at a given time.
This force is variously affected by those stars which
are called 'planets' or 'wandering' stars. But
when they have come into that sign of the Zodiac
under which someone is born, or into a sign having
some connexion or accord with the natal sign, they
form what is called a 'triangle' or 'square.'<note>See Moser, <hi rend="italics">Div., ad loc.,</hi> note on <quote>triangle</quote> and
<quote>square</quote>; <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> Sext. Empir. <hi rend="italics">Adv. mathem.</hi> v. 39.</note> Now
since, through the procession and retrogression of
the stars, the great variety and change of the
seasons and of temperature take place, and since
the power of the sun produces such results as are
before our eyes, they believe that it is not merely
probable, but certain, that just as the temperature
of the air is regulated by this celestial force, so also

<pb id="p.473"/>

children at their birth are influenced in soul and
body and by this force their minds, manners, disposition, physical condition, career in life and
destinies are determined.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="90"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>"What inconceivable madness! For it
is not enough to call an opinion 'foolishness'
when it is utterly devoid of reason. However,
Diogenes the Stoic makes some concession to the
Chaldeans. He says that they have the power of
prophecy to the extent of being able to tell the
disposition of any child and the calling for which he
is best fitted. All their other claims of prophetic
powers he absolutely denies. He says, for example,
that twins are alike in appearance, but that they are
generally unlike in career and in fortune. Procles
and Eurysthenes, kings of the Lacedaemonians,
were twin brothers. <milestone unit="section" n="91"/>But they did not live the same
number of years, for the life of Procles was shorter
by a year than that of his brother and his deeds were
far more glorious. But for my part I say that
even this concession which our excellent friend
Diogenes makes to the Chaldeans in a sort of collusive way,<note><hi rend="italics">Praevaricatio</hi> is used of an advocate who acts in collision
with the opposite side.</note> is in itself unintelligible. For the Chaldeans, according to their own statements, believe
that a person's destiny is affected by the condition
of the moon at the time of his birth, and hence they
make and record their observations of the stars
which appear to be in conjunction with the moon
on his birthday. As a result, in forming their
judgements, they depend on the sense of sight, which
is the least trustworthy of the senses, whereas they
should employ reason and intelligence. For the
science of mathematics, which the Chaldeans ought
to know, teaches us how close the moon comes to

<pb id="p.475"/>

the earth, which indeed it almost touches; how far
it is from Mercury, the nearest star; how much
further yet it is from Venus; and what a great
interval separates it from the sun, which is supposed
to give it light. The three remaining distances are
beyond computation: from the Sun to Mars, from
Mars to Jupiter, from Jupiter to Saturn. Then
there is the distance from Saturn to the limits of
heaven&mdash;the ultimate bounds of space. <milestone unit="section" n="92"/>In view,
therefore, of these almost limitless distances, what
influence can the planets exercise upon the moon,
or rather, upon the earth?</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>"Again, when the Chaldeans say, as they
are bound to do, that all persons born anywhere in
the habitable earth under the same horoscope, are
alike and must have the same fate, is it not evident
that these would-be interpreters of the sky are of
a class who are utterly ignorant of the nature of
the sky? For the earth is, as it were, divided in
half and our view limited by those circles which the
Greeks call <foreign lang="greek">o(ri/zontes,</foreign> and which we may in all
accuracy term <hi rend="italics">finientes</hi> or <hi rend="italics">horizons.</hi> Now these
horizons vary without limit according to the position
of the spectator. Hence, of necessity, the rising
and setting of the stars will not occur at the same
time for all persons. <milestone unit="section" n="93"/>But if this stellar force affects
the heavens now in one way and now in another,
how is it possible for this force to operate alike on
all persons who are born at the same time, in view
of the fact that they are born under vastly different
skies? In those places in which we live the Dogstar rises after the solstice,<note>The summer solstice, on June 22nd.</note> in fact, several days
later. But among the Troglodytes, we read, it sets
before the solstice. Hence if we should now admit

<pb id="p.477"/>

that some stellar influence affects persons who are
born upon the earth, then it must be conceded that
all persons born at the same time may have different
natures owing to the differences in their horoscopes.
This is a conclusion by no means agreeable to the
astrologers; for they insist that all persons born at
the same time, regardless of the place of birth, are
born to the same fate.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="94"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>"But what utter madness in these astrologers, in considering the effect of the vast movements and changes in the heavens, to assume that
wind and rain and weather anywhere have no effect
at birth! In neighbouring places conditions in these
respects are so different that frequently, for instance,
we have one state of weather at Tusculum and
another at Rome. This is especially noticeable to
mariners who often observe extreme changes of
weather take place while they are rounding the
capes. Therefore, in view of the fact that the
heavens are now serene and now disturbed by
storms, is it the part of a reasonable man to say that
this fact has no natal influence&mdash;and of course it has
not&mdash;and then assert that a natal influence is exerted
by some subtle, imperceptible, well-nigh inconceivable force which is due to the condition of the
sky, which condition, in turn, is due to the action of
the moon and stars?</p>
<p>"Again, is it no small error of judgement that
the Chaldeans fail to realize the effect of the
parental seed which is an essential element in
the process of generation? For, surely, no one
fails to see that the appearance and habits, and
generally, the carriage and gestures of children
are derived from their parents. This would not be

<pb id="p.479"/>

the case if the characteristics of children were determined, not by the natural power of heredity, but by
the phases of the moon and by the condition of the
sky. <milestone unit="section" n="95"/>And, again, the fact that men who were born
at the very same instant, are unlike in character,
career, and in destiny, makes it very clear that the
time of birth has nothing to do in determining man's
course in life. That is, unless perchance we are to
believe that nobody else was conceived and born
at the very same time that Africanus was. For
was there ever anyone like him?</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="96"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/>"Furthermore, is it not a well-known and
undoubted fact that many persons who were born
with certain natural defects have been restored
completely by Nature herself, after she had resumed
her sway, or by surgery or by medicine? For
example, some, who were so tongue-tied that they
could not speak, have had their tongues set free by
a cut from the surgeon's knife. Many more have
corrected a natural defect by intelligent exertion.
Derosthenes is an instance: according to the
account given by Phalereus, he was unable to pronounce the Greek letter <hi rend="italics">rho</hi> but by repeated
effort learned to articulate it perfectly. But if such
defects had been engendered and implanted by a
star nothing could have changed them. Do not
unlike places produce unlike men? It would be an
easy matter to sketch rapidly in passing the differences in mind and body which distinguish the
Indians from the Persians and the Ethiopians from
the Syrians&mdash;differences so striking and so pronounced as to be incredible. <milestone unit="section" n="97"/>Hence it is evident
that one's birth is more affected by local environment
than by the condition of the moon. Of course, the

<pb id="p.481"/>

statement quoted by you that the Babylonians for
470,000 years<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 19. 36.</note> had taken the horoscope of every child
and had tested it by the results, is untrue; for if this
had been their habit they would not have abandoned
it. Moreover we find no writer who says that the
practice exists or who knows that it ever did exist.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="47"/>"You observe that I am not repeating
the arguments of Carneades, but those of Panaetius,
the head of the Stoic school. But now on my own
initiative I put the following questions: Did all the
Romans who fell at Cannae have the same horoscope? Yet all had one and the same end. Were
all the men eminent for intellect and genius born
under the same star? Was there ever a day when
countless numbers were not born? <milestone unit="section" n="98"/>And yet there
never was another Homer. Again: if it matters
under what aspect of the sky or combination of
the stars every animate being is born, then necessarily the same conditions affect inanimate things
also: can any statement be more ridiculous
than that? Be that as it may, our good friend
Lucius Tarutius of Firmum, who was steeped in
Chaldaic lore, made a calculation, based on the
assumption that our city's birthday was on the
Feast of Pales<note>Celebrated on April 21. Pales was the tutelary god
of shepherds.</note> (at which time tradition says it was
founded by Romulus), and from that calculation
Tarutius even went so far as to assert that Rome
was born when the moon was in the sign of Libra
and from that fact unhesitatingly prophesied her
destiny. <milestone unit="section" n="99"/>What stupendous power delusion has!
And was the city's natal day also subject to the
influence of the moon and stars? Assume, if you
will, that it matters in the case of a child under
what arrangement of the heavenly bodies it draws

<pb id="p.483"/>

its first breath, does it also follow that the stars
could have had any influence over the bricks
and cement of which the city was built? But why
say more against a theory which every day's experience refutes? I recall a multitude of prophecies
which the Chaldeans made to Pompey, to Crassus
and even to Caesar himself (now lately deceased),
to the effect that no one of them would die except
in old age, at home and in great glory. Hence it
would seem very strange to me should anyone,
especially at this time, believe in men whose predictions he sees disproved every day by actual
results.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="100"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="48"/><quote>There remain the two kinds of divination which we are said to derive from nature and

<p><quote>Delighted, I assure you,</quote> said he, <quote>for I am in
entire accord with the views which you have so far
expressed. To be quite frank, your argument has
merely strengthened the opinion which I already
had, for my own reasoning had convinced me that
the Stoic view of divination smacked too much of
superstition. I was more impressed by the reasoning of the Peripatetics, of Dicaearchus, of ancient
times, and of Cratippus,<note>At the time of the dialogue, 45 B.C., Cratippus was
lecturing in Athens and had as one of his pupils Marcus,
the only son of Marcus Cicero.</note> who still flourishes. According to their opinion there is within the human soul
some sort of power&mdash;' oracular,' I might call it&mdash;by
which the future is foreseen when the soul is inspired
by a divine frenzy, or when it is released by sleep
and is free to move at will. I should like very much
to learn your views of these two classes of divination
and by what arguments you disprove them.</quote></p>

<pb id="p.485"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="101"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="49"/>After this statement had been made by
Quintus, I began again, making a new start, so to
speak:</p>
<p>"I am well aware, my dear Quintus, that, while
you have always felt a doubt about all other kinds
of divination, you approve of the two you just mentioned&mdash;divination by frenzy and divination by
dreams, both of which, it is thought, flow from a
soul set free. Let me, then, state my opinion of
these two kinds of divination. But, first, let me
examine that syllogism<note>Cf. i. 38. 82.</note> of the Stoics and of our
friend Cratippus and see how sound it is. You
stated the syllogism of Chrysippus, Diogenes, and
Antipater<note>All leading Stoics and defenders of divination. <hi rend="italics">Cf</hi>
i. 3. 6.</note> in this way:</p>
<p>"'If there are gods and they do not make clear
to man in advance what the future will be, then
they do not love man, or they themselves do not
know what the future will be; or they think that
it is of no advantage to man to know what the
future will be; or they think it inconsistent with
their dignity to give to man forewarnings of the
future; or they, though gods, cannot give signs
of coming events. <milestone unit="section" n="102"/>But it is not true that the gods
do not love us (for they are the friends and benefactors of the human race); nor is it true that they
do not know what they themselves have determined
and planned; nor is it true that it is of no advantage
to us to know what is going to happen (for man
would be more prudent if he knew); nor is it true
that the gods think it inconsistent with their dignity
to give forecasts of the future (for there is no more
excellent quality than kindness); nor is it true that
they have not the power to know the future; therefore, it is not true that there are gods and yet that

<pb id="p.487"/>

they do not give us signs of the future; but there
are gods; therefore they give us such signs; and
it is not true, if they give us such signs, that
they give us no means of understanding those signs,
otherwise their signs would be useless; nor, if they
give us the means, is it true that there is no divination: therefore divination exists.'</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="103"/>"What keen-witted men! With how very few
words they think the business dispatched! But to
establish their syllogism they take propositions for
granted which are not conceded at all; yet a chain
of reasoning, to be valid, should proceed from premises which are not doubtful to the conclusion
which is in dispute.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="50"/>"Pray observe the neat way in which Epicurus
(whom you Stoics usually call a blundering idiot)
proves that what we term ' the universe' is infinite.
'That,' said he, 'which is finite has an end.' Who
would deny that? Again, 'That which has an end
is seen from some point outside itself.' That, too,
must be granted. 'But the universe is not seen
from without itself.' We cannot question that
proposition either. 'Therefore, since it has no end
the universe must be infinite.' <milestone unit="section" n="104"/>You see how Epicurus proceeds from admitted premises to the proposition to be established. But this you Stoic
logicians do not do; for you not only do not assume
premises which everybody concedes, but you even
assume premises which, if granted, do not tend in
the least to establish what you wish to prove. For
you start with this assumption: ' If there are gods
they are kindly disposed towards men.' Now who
will grant you that? Epicurus? But he says that
the gods do not trouble a whit about themselves or

<pb id="p.489"/>

about anybody else. Is it our own Ennius? But
he says with general approval and applause<note>In his <hi rend="italics">Telamon.</hi> The succeeding line is quoted in Cic.
<hi rend="italics">N.D.</hi> iii. 32. 79 <hi rend="italics">nam si curent, bene bonis sit, male malis;

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l>I always said that there were gods on high,</l>
<l>And this I never will neglect to say;</l>
<l>But my opinion is they do not care</l>
<l>What destiny befalls the human race.</l></quote>

To be sure he proceeds to give the reason for his
opinion in succeeding lines, but there is no need
to repeat them. Enough has been shown to make
it clear that your Stoic friends assume as certain
what is the subject of doubt and discussion.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="105"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="51"/>"But the syllogism goes on to say: 'The
gods are not ignorant of anything, for all things were
ordained by them.' But what a heavy attack is
made on this very point by scholars who deny that
such and such things were ordained by the immortal
gods! ' But it is to our interest to know what is going
to happen.' Yet Dicaearchus has written a large
volume to prove that it is better not to know than
to know the future. They say further: ' It is not
inconsistent with the dignity of gods to give knowledge of the future.' But entirely consistent, I
presume, for them to peer into every man's house
to see what he needs! 'It is not true that the
gods cannot know the future.' <milestone unit="section" n="106"/>But their ability
to know is denied by those who maintain that it is
not certain what the future will be. Now don't
you see what doubtful premises they assume to be
certain and take for granted? Next they hurl this
dialectical dart: 'Therefore it is not true both that
there are gods and yet that they do not give signs
of the future.' And of course they think that the
matter is now settled. Then they make another
assumption: 'But there are gods.' Even that is

<pb id="p.491"/>

not conceded by everybody. 'Therefore they give
signs of the future.' Not necessarily so: for they
may not give us signs of the future and still be gods.</p>
<p>'Nor is it true that, if they give such signs, they give
no means of interpreting those signs.' But it may
be that they have the means and yet do not impart
them to man; for why would they impart them to
the Etruscans rather than to the Romans? Again,
the Stoics say: ' If the gods do impart the means,
that is divination.' Grant that they do (which is
absurd), what is the good if we do not understand?
Their conclusion is: ' Therefore there is divination.'
Suppose that is their conclusion, still they have not
proved it; for, as they themselves have taught us,
the truth cannot be proved from false premises.
Hence their entire argument falls to the ground.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="107"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="52"/>"Now let us come to the argument of
that most worthy gentleman, our intimate friend,
Cratippus:<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 32. 71.</note> </p>
<p>"'Though without eyes,' he says,' it is impossible
to perform the act and function of sight, and though
the eyes sometimes cannot perform their appointed
function, yet when a person has once so employed
his eyes as to see things as they are, he has a realization of what correct vision is. Likewise, too, although
without the power of divination it is impossible for
the act and function of divining to exist, and though
one with that power may be mistaken and may make
erroneous prophecies, yet to establish the existence
of divination it is enough that a single event has
been so clearly foretold as to exclude the hypothesis
of chance. But there are many such instances; therefore the existence of divination must be conceded.'</p>
<p>"Delightfully and briefly put; but after he has

<pb id="p.493"/>

twice made gratuitous assumptions, even though
he has found us quite generous in making concessions, yet his further assumption cannot possibly be
conceded. <milestone unit="section" n="108"/>He says in substance, 'If the eyes are
sometimes at fault, yet, because they have sometimes seen correctly, the power of sight resides
within them; likewise if a person has once foreseen
something by means of divination, yet even when
he errs in his predictions, he must be held to have
the power of divination.'</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="53"/>"Pray point out, my dear Cratippus, the
similarity in these propositions of yours. I confess
that it is not apparent to me. For the eyes in seeing
correctly employ a sense conferred by nature; while
the soul, if it ever has a true vision of the future,
whether by vaticination or by dreams, relies upon
luck or chance. This you must admit unless, perchance, you think that those who consider dreams as
dreams and nothing more, are going to concede that
the fulfilment of any dream was ever due to anything
but luck. While we may grant your two major
premises,&mdash;these the Greeks call <foreign lang="greek">lh/mmata,</foreign> but we
prefer to call them by their Latin equivalent <hi rend="italics">sumptiones</hi>&mdash;yet we will not grant your minor premise&mdash;
which the Greeks call <foreign lang="greek">pro/slhyis.</foreign></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="109"/>"Cratippus states his minor premise thus: 'But
there are countless instances of prophecies being fulfilled without the intervention of luck.' On the contrary, I say there isn't even one. Observe how keen
the controversy grows! Now that the minor premise
is denied the conclusion fails. But he retorts: ' You
are unreasonable not to grant it, it is so evident.'
Why 'evident'? 'Because many prophecies come
true.' And what of the fact that many more don't

<pb id="p.495"/>

come true? Does not this very uncertainty, which
is characteristic of luck, demonstrate that their fulfilment is accounted for by luck and not by any law
of nature? Furthermore, my dear Cratippus&mdash;for
my controversy is with you&mdash;if that argument of
yours is sound, don't you see that it is equally available in behalf of the means of divination practised by
soothsayers, augurs, Chaldeans and by interpreters
of lightnings, portents, and lots? For each of these
classes will furnish you with at least one instance of
a prophecy that came to pass. Therefore either they
too are all means of divining&mdash;and this you very
properly deny&mdash;or, if they are not, then, so far as I
can see, the two classes which you permit to remain
are not means of divining. Hence the same reasoning
employed by you to establish the two kinds which
you accept may be used to establish the others which
you reject.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="110"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="54"/>"But what weight is to be given to that
frenzy of yours, which you term ' divine' and which
enables the crazy man to see what the wise man does
not see, and invests the man who has lost human
intelligence with the intelligence of gods? We
Romans venerate the verses of the Sibyl who is said
to have uttered them while in a frenzy. Recently
there was a rumour, which was believed at the time,
but turned out to be false, that one of the interpreters<note>Lucius Cotta, one of the <hi rend="italics">quindecimviri</hi> who had charge
of the verses. This story is told by Suetonius in his <hi rend="italics">lul.</hi>
<hi rend="italics">Caesar,</hi> ch. 79. It was said that according to the Sibylline verses the Parthians could only be conquered by a
king and therefore that Caesar should be called king.
Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Caesar,</hi> ch. 60 and 64.</note> of those verses was going to declare in the
Senate that, for our safety, the man whom we had as
king in fact should be made king also in name. If
this is in the books, to what man and to what time
does it refer? For it was clever in the author to take
care that whatever happened should appear foretold
because all reference to persons or time had been

<pb id="p.497"/>

omitted. <milestone unit="section" n="111"/>He also employed a maze of obscurity so
that the same verses might be adapted to different
situations at different times. Moreover, that this
poem is not the work of frenzy is quite evident
from the quality of its composition (for it exhibits
artistic care rather than emotional excitement), and
is especially evident from the fact that it is written
in what are termed 'acrostics,' wherein the initial
letters of each verse taken in order convey a meaning;
as, for example, in some of Ennius's verses, the initial
letters form the words, <hi rend="italics">Quintus Ennius Fecit,</hi> that is,
' Quintus Ennius wrote it.' That surely is the work
of concentrated thought and not of a frenzied brain.
<milestone unit="section" n="112"/>And in the Sibylline books, throughout the entire
work, each prophecy is embellished with an acrostic,
so that the initial letters of each of the lines give the
subject of that particular prophecy. Such a work
comes from a writer who is not frenzied, who is painstaking, not crazy. Therefore let us keep the Sibyl
under lock and key so that in accordance with the
ordinances of our forefathers her books may not even
be read without permission of the Senate and may be
more effective in banishing rather than encouraging
superstitious ideas. And let us plead with the priests
to bring forth from those books anything rather than
a king, whom henceforth neither gods nor men will
suffer to exist in Rome.</p>

Chrysippus filled a whole volume with your oracles<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 3. 6, i. 19. 37, i. 50. 115.</note> ;
of these some, as I think, were false; some came true
by chance, as happens very often even in ordinary
speech; some were so intricate and obscure that
their interpreter needs an interpreter and the oracles
themselves must be referred back to the oracle; and
some so equivocal that they require a dialectician to
construe them. For example, when the following
oracular response was made to Asia's richest king:

<quote rend="blockquote">

<l>He will a mighty kingdom overthrow,</l><note>In Greek <foreign lang="greek">*kroi=sos *(/alun diaba\s mega/lhn a)rxh\n katalu/sei.</foreign></note> </quote>

Croesus thought that he would overthrow his enemy's
kingdom, whereas he overthrew his own. <milestone unit="section" n="116"/>But in
either event the oracle would have been true.
Besides, why need I believe that this oracle was ever
given to Croesus? or why should I consider Herodotus<note>Herodotus gives the substance of this story in i. 53.</note> more truthful than Ennius? and was the
former less able to invent stories about Croesus than
Ennius was about Pyrrhus? For instance, nobody
believes Ennius when he says that Apollo's oracle
gave the following response to Pyrrhus:

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>O son of Aeacus, my prediction is</l>
<l>That you the Roman army will defeat.</l></quote> <bibl>From the <hi rend="italics">Annales</hi> of Ennius.</bibl></cit></quote>

In the first place Apollo never spoke in Latin;
second, that oracle is unknown to the Greeks; third, in
the days of Pyrrhus Apollo had already ceased making

<pb id="p.503"/>

verses, and, finally, although <quote>the sons of Aeacus
have ever been,</quote> as Ennius says,

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l part="F">a stolid race,</l>

still Pyrrhus would have had sense enough to see
that the equivocal line&mdash;<quote>You the Roman army will
defeat</quote>&mdash;was no more favourable to him than to
the Romans. As for that equivocal response which
deceived Croesus, it might have deceived&mdash;Chrysippus, for example; but the one made to Pyrrhus
wouldn't have fooled&mdash;even Epicurus!</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="117"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="57"/>"However, the main question is this:
Why are Delphic oracles (of which I have just given
you examples) not uttered at the present time and
have not been for a long time? And why are they
regarded with the utmost contempt? When pressed
at this point their apologists affirm that 'the long
flight of time has gradually dissipated the virtue of
the place whence came those subterranean exhalations which inspired the Pythian priestess to utter
oracles.' One might think that they are talking
about wine or brine which do evaporate. But the
question is about the virtue of a place&mdash;a virtue which
you call not only 'natural' but even 'divine,'&mdash;pray
how did it evaporate? 'By length of time,' you
say. But what length of time could destroy a
divine power? And what is as divine as a subterranean exhalation that inspires the soul with power
to foresee the future&mdash;a power such that it not only
sees things a long time before they happen, but
actually foretells them in rhythmic verse? When
did the virtue disappear? <hi rend="italics">Was</hi> it after men began
to be less credulous?</p>

<pb id="p.505"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="118"/>"By the way, Demosthenes, who lived nearly three
hundred years ago, used to say even then that the
Pythian priestess 'philippized,<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Dem. 287. 1; Aeschin. 72. 14.</note> in other words,
that she was Philip's ally. By this expression he
meant to infer that she had been bribed by Philip.
Hence we may conclude that in other instances the
Delphic oracles were not entirely free of guile. But,
for some inexplicable cause, those superstitious and
half-cracked philosophers of yours would rather
appear absurd than anything else in the world. You
Stoics, instead of rejecting these incredible tales,
prefer to believe that a power had gradually faded
into nothingness, whereas if it ever had existed it
certainly would be eternal.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="119"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="58"/>"There is a like error in regard to dreams.
How far-fetched is the argument in their defence!
'Our souls' (according to the view of your school)
' are divine and are derived from an external source;
the universe is filled with a multitude of harmonious
souls; therefore, because of its divinity and its
contact with other souls, the human soul during sleep
foresees what is to come.' But Zeno thinks that sleep
is nothing more than a contraction&mdash;a slipping and
a collapse, as it were&mdash;of the human soul. Then
Pythagoras and Plato, who are most respectable
authorities, bid us, if we would have trustworthy
dreams, to prepare for sleep by following a prescribed course in conduct and in eating. The Pythagoreans make a point of prohibiting the use of
beans, as if thereby the soul and not the belly was
filled with wind! Somehow or other no statement
is too absurd for some philosophers to make.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="120"/>"Then shall we believe that the souls of sleepers
while dreaming are spontaneously moved? or, as

<pb id="p.507"/>

Democritus thinks, that they are impelled to action
by phantoms from without<note><hi rend="italics"> Visiones,</hi> the equivalent of <hi rend="italics">spectra, simulacra,</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ei)/dwla,</foreign>
phantoms from without which burst upon the mind through
the body. <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Cic. <hi rend="italics">Acad.</hi> ii. 15.</note> ? Whether the one
theory or the other be correct, the fact remains that
men in sleep assume many false apparitions to be
true. Likewise, to men who are sailing, stationary
objects on shore seem to be moving; and also,
sometimes in looking at a lamp, by some sort of
optical illusion we see two flames instead of one.
Why need I mention how many non-existent things
are seen by men who are drunk or crazy? And if
we are to put no trust in such apparitions of the
waking man I do not understand why we should put
any trust in dreams. Of course you may argue, if
you will, about these tricks of vision as you would
about dreams, and say, for example, that when
stationary objects appear to be in motion, it foretells
an earthquake or a sudden flight; and when the
lamp's flame appears to be double it portends that
insurrection and rebellion are afoot!</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="121"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="59"/>"By applying conjecture to the countless
delusions of drunk or crazy men we may sometimes
deduce what appears to be a real prophecy; for who,
if he shoots at a mark all day long, will not occasionally hit it? We sleep every night and there is
scarcely ever a night when we do not dream; then
do we wonder that our dreams come true sometimes?
Nothing is so uncertain as a cast of dice and yet there
is no one who plays often who does not sometimes
make a Venus-throw and occasionally twice or thrice in
succession. Then are we, like fools, to prefer to say
that it happened by the direction of Venus rather
than by chance? And if we are to put no trust in
false visions at other times I do not see what especial
virtue there is in sleep to entitle its false visions to

<pb id="p.509"/>

be taken as true. <milestone unit="section" n="122"/>On the other hand if nature had
intended that sleepers should do what they dreamed,
persons on going to bed would always have to be
tied, otherwise they would commit more follies in
their dreams than any madman ever did.</p>
<p>"And if, because of their unreality, we are to
have no faith in the visions of the insane, I do not
understand why we place any confidence in dreams,
which are far more confused. Is it because the insane
do not tell their delusions to interpreters of visions
while dreamers do? I ask you this: suppose I wished
to read, write, or sing, or to play on the lute, or to
solve some problem in geometry, physics, or logic,
must I wait for a dream, or must I depend upon
the peculiar knowledge which each of these several
arts or sciences requires and without which none of
them can be utilized or mastered? No; and not even
if I wanted to sail a ship, would I pilot it as I might
have dreamed I should; for the punishment would
be immediate. <milestone unit="section" n="123"/>What would be the sense in the sick
seeking relief from an interpreter of dreams rather
than from a physician? Or do you think that
Aesculapius and Serapis <note>With the temples of these gods were connected dream-oracles by means of which remedies were prescribed for
the sick.</note> have the power to prescribe a cure for our bodily ills through the medium
of a dream and that Neptune cannot aid pilots
through the same means? or think you that though
Minerva<note>='<foreign lang="greek">*)aqh/nh *(ugi/eia.</foreign></note> will prescribe physic in a dream without
the aid of a physician, yet that the Muses will not
employ dreams to impart a knowledge of reading,
writing, and of other arts? If knowledge of a
remedy for disease were conveyed by means of
dreams, knowledge of the arts just mentioned would
also be given by dreams. But since knowledge of
these arts is not so conveyed neither is the knowledge

<pb id="p.511"/>

of medicine. The theory that the medical art was
imparted by means of dreams having been disproved,
the basis of a belief in dreams is utterly destroyed.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="124"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="60"/>"But, though the conclusion just stated is
obvious, let us now look deeper into the question.
Surely you must assume, either that there is a
Divine Power which, in planning for our good, gives
us information by means of dreams; or that, because
of some natural connexion and association&mdash;the
Greeks call it <foreign lang="greek">sumpa/qeia</foreign>&mdash;interpreters of dreams
know what sort of a dream is required to fit any
situation and what sort of a result will follow any
dream; or that neither of these suppositions is true,
but that the usual result or consequence of every
dream is known by a consistent system of rules
based on long-continued observation. In the first
place, then, it must be understood that there is no
divine power which creates dreams. And indeed it
is perfectly clear that none of the visions seen in
dreams have their origin in the will of the gods;
for the gods, for our sakes, would so interpose
that we might be able to foresee the future.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="125"/>"But how often, pray, do you find anyone
who pays any attention to dreams or who understands or remembers them? On the other hand,
how many treat them with disdain, and regard a
belief in them as the superstition of a weak and
effeminate mind! Moreover, why does God, in
planning for the good of the human race, convey
his warnings by means of dreams which men consider
unworthy not only of worrying about, but even of
remembering? For it is impossible that God does
not know how people generally regard dreams;
and to do anything needlessly and without a cause

<pb id="p.513"/>

is unworthy of a god and is inconsistent even with
the habits of right-thinking men. And hence, if
most dreams are unnoticed and disregarded, either
God is ignorant of that fact, or he does a vain thing
in conveying information by means of dreams; but
neither supposition accords with the nature of a
god, therefore, it must be admitted that God conveys no information by means of dreams.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="126"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="61"/>"I also ask, if God gives us these visions as
forewarnings, why does he not give them to us when
we are awake rather than when we are asleep?
For, whether our souls in sleep are impelled by some
external and foreign force; or whether they are self-moved; or whether there is some other cause why,
during sleep, we imagine ourselves seeing or hearing,
or doing certain things&mdash;whatever the cause, it
would apply just as well when we are awake. If
the gods did send us warnings in our sleep and for
our good they would do the same for us when we are
awake, especially since, as Chrysippus says in replying to the Academicians, appearances seen when we
are awake are much more distinct and trustworthy
than those seen in dreams. It would, therefore,
have been more in keeping with the beneficence of
gods, in consulting for our good, to send us clear
visions in our waking moments rather than unintelligible ones in our dreams. But since that is not the case,
dreams ought not to be held divine. <milestone unit="section" n="127"/>And, further,
what is the need of a method which, instead of being
direct, is so circuitous and roundabout that we have to
employ men to interpret our dreams? And if it be true
that God consults for our advantage he would say:
'Do this,' 'Don't do that,' and not give us visions
when we are awake rather than when we are asleep.</p>

<pb id="p.515"/>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="62"/>"And further, would anybody dare to say
that all dreams are true? ' Some dreams are true,'
says Ennius, ' but not necessarily all.' Pray how do
you distinguish between the two? What mark have
the false and what the true? And if God sends
the true, whence come the false? Surely if God
sends the false ones too what is more untrustworthy
than God? Besides what is more stupid than to
excite the souls of mortals with false and lying
visions? But if true visions are divine while the
false and meaningless ones are from nature, what
sort of caprice decided that God made the one and
nature made the other, rather than that God made
them all, which your school denies, or that nature
made them all? Since you deny that God made
them all you must admit that nature made them
all. <milestone unit="seciton" n="128"/>By 'nature,' in this connexion, I mean that
force because of which the soul can never be
stationary<note><hi rend="italics">Insistens</hi>= <hi rend="italics">etiamsi insistit a cogitationis opera,</hi> Giese.</note> and free from motion and activity.
And when, because of the weariness of the body,
the soul can use neither the limbs nor the senses,
it lapses into varied and untrustworthy visions,
which emanate from what Aristotle<note>Aristot. <foreign lang="greek">peri\ e)nupni/wn</foreign> ch. 3.</note> terms 'the
clinging remnants of the soul's waking acts and
thoughts.' These 'remnants,' when aroused, sometimes produce strange types of dreams. Now if
some of these dreams are true and others false, I
should like very much to know by what mark they
may be distinguished. If there is none, why should
we listen to your interpreters? But if there is one,
I am eager for them to tell me what it is, but they
will grow confused when I ask and will not answer.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="129"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="63"/>"The question now arises as to which is
the more probable: do the immortal gods, who are

<pb id="p.517"/>

of surpassing excellence in all things, constantly
flit about, not only the beds, but even the lowly
pallets of mortals, wherever they may be, and when
they find someone snoring, throw at him dark and
twisted visions, which scare him from his sleep and
which he carries in the morning to a dream-expert
to unravel? or does nature bring it to pass that
the ever-active soul sees in sleep phantoms of
what it saw when the body was awake? Which is
more consonant with philosophy: to explain these
apparitions by the superstitious theories of fortune-telling hags, or by an explanation based on natural
causes? But even if it were possible to draw trustworthy inferences from dreams, it could not be done
by those who profess to have that power; for their
fraternity is composed of the most shallow and the
most ignorant of men. Yet your Stoics assert that
no one can be a diviner unless he is a ' wise man.'</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="130"/>"Chrysippus, indeed, defines divination in these
words: 'The power to see, understand, and explain premonitory signs given to men by the gods.' 'Its duty,'
he goes on to say, 'is to know in advance the disposition of the gods towards men, the manner in which
that disposition is shown and by what means the gods
may be propitiated and their threatened ills averted.'
And this same philosopher defines the interpretation
of dreams thus: ' It is the power to understand and
explain the visions sent by the gods to men in sleep.'
Then, if that be true, will just ordinary shrewdness
meet these requirements, or rather is there not need
of surpassing intelligence and absolutely perfect
learning? But I have never seen such a man.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="131"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="64"/>"Therefore, even if I granted your contention as to the existence of divination&mdash;and this I will

<pb id="p.519"/>

never do&mdash;still, you must realize that it would be
impossible for us to find a diviner. Then what do
the gods mean by sending us in our dreams visions
which we cannot understand ourselves and which
we cannot find anybody to interpret for us? If
the gods send us these unintelligible and inexplicable
dream-messages they are acting as Carthaginians
and Spaniards would if they were to address our

by dark and enigmatic dreams? Surely the gods
ought to want us to understand the advice they
give us for our good. 'Oh!' but you retort,' Are

<p><milestone unit="section" n="134"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="65"/>"A diviner was consulted by a man who
had dreamed that he saw an egg hanging from the
bed-cords of the bed in his sleeping-room&mdash;the story
is from Chrysippus <hi rend="italics">On Dreams</hi>&mdash;and the diviner
answered, 'A treasure is buried under your bed.'
The man dug, found a quantity of gold surrounded
with silver and sent the diviner as much of the silver
as he thought fit. The diviner then inquired, 'Do
I get none of the yolk? ' For, in his view, the yolk
meant gold, the white of the egg, silver. Now, did
no one else ever dream of an egg? If so, then
why did this fellow, whoever he was, alone find a
treasure by dreaming of an egg? What a lot of
poor devils there are, deserving of divine assistance,
who never were instructed by a dream how to find a
treasure! Furthermore, why was this man given so
obscure an intimation as that contained in the fancied
resemblance between an egg and a treasure, instead of
being as plainly directed as Simonides<note><hi rend="italics">Cf</hi> i. 27. 56.</note> was when
he was bidden not to go on board the ship? <milestone unit="section" n="135"/>My conclusion is that obscure messages by means of dreams
are utterly inconsistent with the dignity of gods.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="66"/>"Let us now consider dreams that are
clear and direct, like the dream of the man who was
killed by the innkeeper at Megara;<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 27. 57.</note> or like that of
Simonides who was warned by the man he had
buried not to sail; and also like Alexander's
dream, which, to my surprise, my dear Quintus,
you passed by without notice: Alexander's intimate
friend, Ptolemaeus, had been struck in battle by a

<pb id="p.523"/>

poisoned arrow and was at the point of death from his
wound and suffering the most excruciating agony.
Alexander, while sitting by the bedside of his
friend, fell fast asleep. Thereupon, so the story goes,
he dreamed that the pet serpent of his mother
Olympias appeared to him carrying a root in its
mouth and, at the same time, gave him the name of a
place close by where it said the root grew. This
root, the serpent told him, was of such great virtue
that it would effect the speedy cure of Ptolemaeus.
As soon as Alexander awoke he related his dream to
his friends and men were sent to find the root. It is
said that when the root was found it worked the cure
not only of Ptolemaeus, but also of many soldiers who
had been wounded by the same kind of arrow.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="136"/>"You, too, have drawn on history for dreams, a
number of which you told. You spoke, for example,
of the dreams of the mother of Phalaris, <note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 23. 46.</note> of Cyrus the
Elder,<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.i.</hi> 23.46.</note> of the mother of Dionysius,<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.i.</hi> 20.39.</note> of the Carthaginians Hamilcar<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 24. 50.</note> and Hannibal,<note><hi rend="italics">Cf. i.</hi> 24.48,49.</note> and of Publius
Decius.<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.i</hi>24.51.</note> You mentioned that much-spoken-of dream
about the slave who opened the votive games,<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.i.</hi> 26. 55</note> also
the dream of Gaius Gracchus<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 26. 56.</note> and the recent one of
Caecilia,<note><hi rend="italics">Cf. i.</hi> 44. 99</note> the daughter of Balearicus. But these are
other people's dreams<note>So Moser, Giese, and K&uuml;hner explain <hi rend="italics">haec externa.</hi></note> and hence we know nothing
about them and some of them are fabrications
perhaps. For who stands sponsor for them? And
what have we to say of our own dreams? Of your
dream of me and of my horse emerging from the
river and appearing on the bank?<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> i. 28. 58.</note> and of my dream
of Marius, attended by his laurelled fasces, ordering
me to be conducted to his monument?<note><hi rend="italics">Cf</hi> i. 28. 59.</note> </p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="67"/>"All dreams, my dear Quintus, have one
explanation and, in heaven's name, let us see that it

<pb id="p.525"/>

is not set at naught by superstition and perversity.
<milestone unit="section" n="137"/>Now what Marius do you think it was I saw? His
'likeness' or 'phantom,'<note>One of the <foreign lang="greek">ei)/dwla,</foreign> <hi rend="italics">simulacra,</hi> given off according to
the atomic philosophers by all bodies and by their impact
causing sight.</note> I suppose&mdash;at least that
is what Democritus thinks. Whence did the
'phantom' come? He would have it that
'phantoms ' emanate from material bodies and from
actual forms. Then, it was the body of Marius from
which my ' phantom' came? ' No,' says Democritus,
' but from his body that was.' So that 'phantom' of
Marius was pursuing me to the plains of Atina?
' Oh, but the universe is full of <quote>phantoms</quote>; no
picture of anything can be formed in the mind except
as the result of the impact of <quote>phantoms.</quote> <milestone unit="section" n="138"/>'Then
are these 'phantoms' of yours so obedient to our
beck and call that they come the instant we summon
them? And is this true even of the 'phantoms'
of things that do not exist? For what is there so
unreal and unheard of that we cannot form a mental
picture of it? We even shape things which we
have never seen&mdash;as the sites of towns and the
faces of men. <milestone unit="section" n="139"/>Then, by your theory, when I think
of the walls of Babylon or of the face of Homer, some
'phantom' of what I have in mind 'strikes upon
my brain'! Hence it is possible for us to know
everything we wish to know, since there is nothing
of which we cannot think. Therefore no 'phantoms
from the outside steal in upon our souls in sleep; nor
do 'phantoms ' stream forth at all. In fact I never
knew anybody who could say nothing with more
ponderous gravity than Democritus.</p>
<p>"The soul is of such a force and nature that,
when we are awake, it is active, not because of
any extraneous impulse, but because of its own inherent power of self-motion and a certain incredible

<pb id="p.527"/>

swiftness.<note>This same view (which is also expressed in Cic. <hi rend="italics">C.M.</hi>
21. 78, <hi rend="italics">Tusc.</hi> i. 43), was held by the ancient philosophers
generally.</note> When the soul is supported by the bodily
members and by the five senses its powers of perception, thought, and apprehension are more trustworthy. But when these physical aids are removed
and the body is inert in sleep, the soul then moves
of itself. And so, in that state, visions flit about
it, actions occur and it seems to hear and say many
things. <milestone unit="section" n="140"/>When the soul itself is weakened and
relaxed many such sights and sounds, you may
be sure, are seen and heard in all manner of
confusion and diversity. Then especially do the
'remnants' of our waking thoughts and deeds move
and stir within the soul. For example, in the time
of my banishment Marius was often in my mind as
I recalled with what great fortitude and courage he
had borne his own heavy misfortunes, and this I
think is the reason why I dreamed about him.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="68"/>"As for your dream, it occurred while
you were thinking and worrying about me<note>During Cicero's banishment.</note> and
then you had the vision of me as I suddenly arose
from the river. For in the souls of us both were
'traces of our waking thoughts,' but with some
added features, of course: as, for example, my
dreaming of Marius's monument and your dreaming
that the horse on which I rode sank with me and
then reappeared. <milestone unit="section" n="141"/>But do you suppose that there
ever would have been any old woman crazy enough
to believe in dreams, if by some lucky accident or
chance they had not come true sometimes? But
let us consider Alexander's dream of the talking
serpent. The story may be true and it may be
wholly false. In either case it is no miracle; for
he did not hear the serpent speak, but thought he
heard it and, strangest thing of all, he thought it

<pb id="p.529"/>

spoke while it held the root in its mouth! But
nothing seems strange to a man when he is dreaming.
Now, if Alexander ever had such a vivid and trustworthy dream as this, I want to ask why he never had
another one like it and why other men have not
had many of the same kind? As for me, except for
that dream about Marius, I really never had one that
I can recall. Think then how many nights in my long
life I have spent in vain! <milestone unit="section" n="142"/>Moreover, at the present
time, owing to the interruption of my public labours,
I have ceased my nocturnal studies, and (contrary
to my former practice) I have added afternoon naps.
Yet despite all this time spent in sleep I have not received a single prophecy in a dream, certainly not one
about the great events<note>The turmoil and chaos which followed Caesar's death.</note> now going on. Indeed, I never
seem to be dreaming more than when I see the magistrates in the forum and the Senate in its chamber.<note>Because they were mere shadows, without real authority.</note> </p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="69"/>"Coming now to the second branch of
the present topic, is there some such natural connecting link,<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> between dreams and things seen in dreams.</note> which, as I said before,<note><hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> ii. 14. 34.</note> the Greeks
call<foreign lang="greek">sumpa/qeia,</foreign>that the finding of a treasure must
be deduced from dreaming of an egg? Of course
physicians, from certain symptoms, know the
incipiency and progress of a disease; and it is
claimed that from some kinds of dreams they
even can gather certain indications as to a
patient's health, as whether the internal humours
of the body are excessive or deficient. But
what natural bond of union is there between
dreams, on the one hand, and treasures, legacies,
public office, victory and many other things of the
same kind, on the other? <milestone unit="section" n="143"/>A person, it is said,
while dreaming of coition, ejected gravel. In
this case I can see a relation between the dream and

<pb id="p.531"/>

the result; for the vision presented to the sleeper
was such as to make it clear that what happened was
due to natural causes and not to the delusion.<note>The translation adopts the interpretation of Hottinger,
<hi rend="italics">De div.</hi> p. 541. What is implied is that the dream was the
effect and not the cause <hi rend="italics">eiectionis calculorum.</hi></note> 
But by what law of nature did Simonides receive
that vision which forbade him to sail? or what was
the connexion between the laws of nature and the
dream of Alcibiades in which, according to history,
shortly before his death, he seemed to be enveloped
in the cloak of his mistress? Later, when his body
had been cast out and was lying unburied and
universally neglected, his mistress covered it with
her mantle. Then do you say that this dream was
united by some natural tie with the fate that befell
Alcibiades, or did chance cause both the apparition
and the subsequent event?</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="144"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="70"/>"Furthermore, is it not a fact that the
conjectures of the interpreters of dreams give
evidence of their authors' sagacity rather than afford
any proof of a relation between dreams and the laws
of nature? For example, a runner, who was planning to set out for the Olympic games, dreamed
that he was riding in a chariot drawn by four horses.
In the morning he went to consult an interpreter,
who said to him, 'You will win, for that is implied
in the speed and strength of horses.' Later the
runner went to Antipho, who said, 'You are bound
to lose, for do you not see that four ran ahead of
you? And behold another runner!&mdash;for the books of
Chrysippus and Antipater are full of such dreams&mdash;but to return to the runner: he reported to an
interpreter that he had dreamed of having been
changed into an eagle. The interpreter said to
him, 'You are the victor, for no bird flies faster
than the eagle.' This runner also consulted Antipho.

<pb id="p.533"/>

'Simpleton,' said the latter, 'don't you see that you
are beaten? For that bird is always pursuing and
driving other birds before it and itself is always last.'</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="145"/>"A married woman who was desirous of a child
and was in doubt whether she was pregnant or not,
dreamed that her womb had been sealed. She
referred the dream to an interpreter. He told
her that since her womb was sealed conception was
impossible. But another interpreter said, 'You are
pregnant, for it is not customary to seal that which
is empty.' Then what is the dream-interpreter's art
other than a means of using one's wits to deceive?
And those incidents which I have given and the
numberless ones collected by the Stoics prove nothing
whatever except the shrewdness of men who employ
slight analogies in order to draw now one inference
and now another. There are certain indications
from the condition of the pulse and breath and from
many other symptoms in sickness by means of which
physicians foretell the course of a disease. When pilots
see cuttle-fish leaping or dolphins betaking themselves
to a haven they believe that a storm is at hand. In
such cases signs are given which are traceable to
natural causes and explicable by reason, but that is far
from true of the dreams spoken of a little while ago.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="146"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="71"/>"In our consideration of dreams we come
now to the remaining point<note><hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> of the three mentioned in ii. 60. 124.</note> left for discussion, which
is your contention that 'by long-continued observation of dreams and by recording the results an art
has been evolved.' Really? Then, it is possible,
I suppose, to ' observe ' dreams? If so, how? For
they are of infinite variety and there is no imaginable thing too absurd, too involved, or too abnormal
for us to dream about it. How, then, is it possible

<pb id="p.535"/>

for us either to remember this countless and ever-changing mass of visions or to observe and record
the subsequent results? Astronomers have recorded
the movements of the planets and thereby have
discovered an orderly course of the stars, not
thought of before. But tell me, if you can, what
is the orderly course of dreams and what is the
harmonious relation between them and subsequent
events? And by what means can the true be
distinguished from the false, in view of the fact
that the same dreams have certain consequences
for one person and different consequences for
another and seeing also that even for the same
individual the same dream is not always followed
by the same result? As a rule we do not believe a
liar even when he tells the truth, but, to my surprise,
if one dream turns out to be true, your Stoics
do not withdraw their belief in the prophetic value of
that one though it is only one out of many; rather,
from the character of the one true dream, they establish the character of countless others that are false.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="147"/>"Therefore, if God is not the creator of dreams;
if there is no connexion between them and the laws
of nature; and finally, if, by means of observation
no art of divining can be found in them, it follows
that absolutely no reliance can be placed in dreams.
This becomes especially evident when we consider
that those who have the dreams deduce no prophecies
from them; that those who interpret them depend
upon conjecture and not upon nature; that in the
course of the almost countless ages, chance has
worked more miracles through all other agencies
than through the agency of dreams; and, finally,
that nothing is more uncertain than conjecture,

<pb id="p.537"/>

which may be led not only into varying, but sometimes even into contradictory, conclusions.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="148"/><milestone unit="chapter" n="72"/>"Then let dreams, as a means of divination, be rejected along with the rest. Speaking
frankly, superstition, which is widespread among
the nations, has taken advantage of human weakness
to cast its spell over the mind of almost every man.
This same view was stated in my treatise <hi rend="italics">On the</hi>
<hi rend="italics">Nature of the Gods;</hi> and to prove the correctness of
that view has been the chief aim of the present
discussion. For I thought that I should be rendering a great service both to myself and to my countrymen if I could tear this superstition up by the roots.
But I want it distinctly understood that the destruction of superstition does not mean the destruction
of religion. For I consider it the part of wisdom
to preserve the institutions of our forefathers by
retaining their sacred rites and ceremonies. Furthermore, the celestial order and the beauty of the
universe compel me to confess that there is some
excellent and eternal Being, who deserves the
respect and homage of men.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="149"/>"Wherefore, just as it is a duty to extend
the influence of true religion, which is closely
associated with the knowledge of nature, so it is a
duty to weed out every root of superstition. For
superstition is ever at your heels to urge you on;
it follows you at every turn. -It is with you when
you listen to a prophet, or an omen; when you
offer sacrifices or watch the flight of birds; when
you consult an astrologer or a soothsayer; when
it thunders or lightens or there is a bolt from on
high; or when some so-called prodigy is born or is
made. And since necessarily some of these signs

<pb id="p.539"/>

are nearly always being given, no one who believes
in them can ever remain in a tranquil state of mind.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="150"/><quote>Sleep is regarded as a refuge from every toil
and care; but it is actually made the fruitful source
of worry and fear. In fact dreams would be less
regarded on their own account and would be
viewed with greater indifference had they not been
taken under the guardianship of philosophers&mdash;not
philosophers of the meaner sort, but those of the
keenest wit, competent to see what follows logically
and what does not&mdash;men who are considered well-nigh perfect and infallible. Indeed, if their arrogance
had not been resisted by Carneades, it is probable
that by this time they would have been adjudged the
only philosophers. While most of my war of words
has been with these men, it is not because I hold
them in especial contempt, but on the contrary, it
is because they seem to me to defend their own views
with the greatest acuteness and skill. Moreover,
it is characteristic of the Academy to put forward
no conclusions of its own, but to approve those
which seem to approach nearest to the truth; to
compare arguments; to draw forth all that may
be said in behalf of any opinion; and, without
asserting any authority of its own, to leave the
judgement of the inquirer wholly free. That same
method, which by the way we inherited from Socrates,
I shall, if agreeable to you, my dear Quintus, follow
as often as possible in our future discussions.</quote></p>
