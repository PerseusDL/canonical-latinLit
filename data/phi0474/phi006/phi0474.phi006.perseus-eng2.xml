					<head>THE FRAGMENTS WHICH REMAIN OF THE SPEECH OF M. T. CICERO ON BEHALF OF MARCUS TULLIUS.</head>
					  <div type="commentary" resp="ed">
						<note anchored="true">This Oration is in a very imperfect and corrupt state. It is only lately
       that even what we have of it has been discovered in the North of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. It has been edited with great care by C. Beier, who has, however, gone
       rather beyond the province of an editor in filling up lacunae of several lines at a time to
       complete what he considers must have been Cicero's meaning. Those additions of his I have
       generally thought it better to omit from the translation, as they rest on no authority, and
       as this work professes only to be a translation of Cicero himself.</note>
					
						<head>THE ARGUMENT.</head>
						<p>Marcus Tullius had a farm, and a man of the name of Publius Fabius had bought another farm
       bordering on it. On the farm of Tullius there was a large field which Fabius coveted greatly,
       and as he could not obtain it by bargain, or by any legal process, (though he does seem to
       have tried this latter expedient,) he arms a gang of slaves, and sends them to take
       possession of the land, they murder Tullius's slaves, and demolish and burn the villa which
       he had there. After all this, Tullius prosecutes Fabius for the damage done. So that, as it
       seems, this speech ought rather to be called a speech against Publius Fabius than a speech on
       behalf of Marcus Tullius. </p></div>
				
					<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1" resp="perseus">
					<p>Formerly, O judges, I had determined to conduct this cause in a different manner, thinking
      that our adversaries would deny that their household was implicated in such a violent and
      atrocious murder. Accordingly, I came with a mind free from care and anxiety, because I was
      aware that I could easily prove that by witnesses. But now, when it has been confessed, not
      only by that most honourable man, Lucius Quinctius, 
      <add>but when Publius Fabius himself has not hesitated to admit the facts which are the
       subject of this trial, I come forward to plead this cause in quite a different manner from
       that in which I was originally prepared to argue it. For then</add> my anxiety was to be able
      to prove what I asserted had been done. Now all my speech is to be directed to this point, to
      prevent our adversaries from being in a better position, merely because they have admitted
      what they could not possibly deny though they greatly wished to do so. 
					</p></div> <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2" resp="perseus">
				  <p>Therefore, as matters stood at first your decision was more difficult, but my
      defence was easy. For I originally rested my whole case on the evidence; 
      <add>now I rest it on the confession of my adversary; and to oppose his audacity in acts of
       violence, his impudence in a court of justice, may fairly be considered as the task of your
       power, not of my abilities.—</add> For what is easier than to decide on the case of
      a man who confesses the fact? But it is difficult for me to speak with sufficient force of
      that which cannot be by language made out worse than it is in reality, and cannot be made more
      plain by my speech than it is by the confession of the parties actually concerned.
				  </p></div><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3" resp="perseus">
					<p><milestone unit="para"/>As, therefore, on account of the reasons which I have stated, my system of defence must be
      changed, <add>I must also forget for a little time, in the case of Publius Fabius, that lenity of mine
       which I practiced at the previous trial, when I restrained myself from using any arguments
       which might have the appearance of attacking him, so much that I seemed to be defending his
       reputation</add> with no less care than the cause of Marcus Tullius. Now, since Quinctius has
      thought it not foreign to the subject to introduce so many statements, false for the most part
      and most wickedly invented, concerning the life and habits and character of Marcus Tullius,
      Fabius must pardon me for many reasons, if I do not now appear to spare his character so much,
      or to show the same regard for it now as I did previously.
					</p>
				  </div><milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4" resp="perseus">
				  <p><add>At the former trial I kept all my stings sheathed; but
       since, in that same previous trial,</add> he thought it a part of his duty to show no
      forbearance whatever to his adversary, how ought I to act, I, a Tullius for another Tullius, a
      man kindred to me in disposition not less than in name? And it seems to me, O judges, that I
      have more need to feel anxious as to whether my conduct will be approved in having said
      nothing against him before, than blamed for the reply I now make to him. 
				  </p></div><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5" resp="perseus">
				  <p> But I both did at that time what I ought to have done, and I shall do now
      what I am forced to do. For when it was a dispute about money matters, because we said that
      Marcus Tullius had sustained damage, it appeared foreign to my character to say anything of
      the reputation of Quintus Fabius; not because the case did not open the door to such
      statements. What is my conduct then? Although the cause does require it, still, unless when he
      absolutely compels me against my will, I am not inclined to condescend to speak ill of him.
      Now that I am speaking under compulsion, if I say anything strong, still I will do even that
      with decency and moderation, and only in such a way that, as he could not consider me hostile
      to him at the former trial, so he may now know that I am a faithful and trustworthy friend to
      Marcus Tullius.

	   <p><milestone unit="para"/>One thing, O Lucius Quinctius, I should wish to obtain from you, which, although I desire
      because it is useful for me, still I request of you because it is reasonable and
      just,—that you would regulate the time that you take to yourself for speaking, so as
      to leave the judges some time for coming to a decision. For the time before, there was no end
      to your speech in his defence; night alone set bounds to your oration. Now, if you please, do
      not do the same; this I beg of you. Nor do I beg it on this account, because I think it
      desirable for me that you should pass over some topics, or that you should fail to state them
      with sufficient elegance, and at sufficient length; but because I do think it enough for you
      to state each fact only once. And if you do that, I have no fear that the whole day will be
      taken up in talking.
     	</p></div><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7" resp="perseus">
					<p><milestone unit="para"/>The subject of this trial which comes before you, O judges, is, What is the pecuniary amount
      of the damage inflicted on Marcus Tullius by the malice of the household of Quintus Fabius, by
      men armed and banded together in a violent manner. Those damages we have taxed; the valuation
      is yours; the decision given is that the amends shall be fourfold.

   <milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8" resp="perseus">
      <p>As all laws and all legal proceedings which seem at all harsh and severe have originated in
      the dishonesty and injustice of wicked men, so this form of procedure also has been
      established within these few years on account of the evil habits and excessive licentiousness
      of men. For when many families were said to be wandering armed about the distant fields and
      pasture lands, and to be committing murders, and as that fact appeared to concern not merely
      the estates of individuals, but the main interests of the republic, Marcus Lucullus, who often
      presided as judge with the greatest equity and wisdom, first planned this tribunal, and had
      regard to this object, that all men should so restrain their households that they should not
      only not go about armed to inflict damage on any one, but, even if they were attacked, should
      defend themselves by law, rather than by arms; </p></div>
				 <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9" resp="perseus"><p> and though he
      knew that the Aquilian law <note anchored="true">The <foreign xml:lang="lat">Lex Aquilia</foreign>
       provided for the damages which any one was to pay to the owner, in the case of his having
       unlawfully killed any slave or quadruped. Actions under this law were limited to damage done
       by actual contact, though the subject of them was extended afterwards. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Vide</foreign> Smith, Dict. Ant. p. 313, in voc. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Damni injuria
        Actio</foreign>.</note>about damage existed, still he thought, that, as in the time of our
      ancestors both men's estates and their desires were less, and as their families, not being
      very numerous, were restrained by fear of important consequences, it very seldom happened that
      a man would be killed, and it was thought a nefarious and unprecedented atrocity; and
      therefore, that there was at that time no need of a system of judicial procedure with
      reference to bodies of men collected in a violent manner and armed; (for he thought that if
      any one established a law or a tribunal for matters which were not usual, he seemed not so
      much to forbid them as to put people in mind of them.) </p>

				  <p>In these times, when after a long civil war our manners
      had so far degenerated that men used arms with less scruple, he thought it necessary to
      establish a system of judicial procedure, with reference to the whole of a man's household, in
      the formula, “Which was said to have been done by the household,” and to
      assign judges, </p></div>

				      <p>in order that the matter might be decided as speedily as possible; and to affix

      Men must decide themselves when they could lawfully take arms, collect a band, and put men to
      death. When an action was assigned, this alone was to be the point at issue,
      “whether it appeared that damage had been inflicted by the malice of the household,
      by men collected and armed acting in a violent manner,” and the word
      “unjustly” was not to be added; he thought that he had put an end to the
      audacity of wicked men when he had left them no hope of being able to make any defence.

					<p><milestone unit="para"/>Marcus Tullius had a farm, inherited from his father, in the territory of 
					  <placeName key="tgn,6005942">Thurium</placeName>, O judges, which he was never sorry to have, till he
      got a neighbor who preferred extending the boundaries of his estate by arms, to defending them
      by law. For Publius Fabius lately purchased a farm of Caius Claudius, a senator,—a
      farm bordering on that of Marcus Tullius,—dear enough, for nearly half as much again
      (though in a wretched state of cultivation, and with all the buildings burnt down) as Claudius
      himself had given for it when it was in a good and highly ornamented condition, though he had
      paid an extravagant price for it. <gap reason="lost"/>
      </p></div>
				 <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15" resp="perseus"><p>I will add this also, which is very important to the
      matter. When the commander-in-chief died, though he wished to invest a sum of money, got I
      know not how, in a farm, he did not so invest it, but he squandered it. 
      <add>I do not very greatly wonder that, hampered as he was by his own folly, he wished to
       extricate himself how he could. But this I cannot marvel at sufficiently, this I am indignant
       at, that he strives</add> to remedy his own folly at the expense of his neighbours, and that
      he endeavoured to pacify his own ill-temper by the injury of Tullius. </p></div>
				   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16" resp="perseus"><p>
				     <milestone unit="para"/>There is in that farm a field of two hundred acres, which is called the Popilian field, O
      judges, which had always belonged to Marcus Tullius, and which even his father had possessed. <add>That new neighbour of his, full of wicked hope, and the more confident because Marcus
       Tullius was away, began to wish for this field, as it appeared to him</add> to lie very
      conveniently for him, and to be a convenient addition to his own farm. And at first, because
      he repented of the whole business and of his purchase, he advertised the farm for sale. But he
      had had a partner in the purchase, Cnaeus Acerronius a most excellent man. <add>He was at
        <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, when on a sudden messengers came to Marcus
       Tullius from his villa, to say that Publius Fabius had advertised that neighbouring farm of

       lately purchased.</add>

       might point out the boundaries to purchasers in their presence. But he</add>
      <gap reason="lost"/> refused to do this. He pointed out the boundaries to Acerronius while they
      were absent; but still he did not give them up this Popilian field. Acerronius excused himself
      from the whole business as well as he could, <add>and as soon as he could; and he immediately revoked any agreement which he had with

      slightly scorched. Fabius in the meantime brings on the farm picked men of great courage and
      strength, and prepares arms such as were suitable and fit for each of them; so that any one
      might see that those men were equipped, not for any farming work, but for battle and murder.

      they wandered about everywhere armed; they occupied all the fields and roads in an hostile
      manner, so that they seemed not obscurely but evidently to be aware of what business they were
      equipped for. In the meantime Tullius came to <placeName key="tgn,6005942">Thurium</placeName>. Then that worthy father of a family, that noble Asiaticus, that new
      farmer and grazier, while he was walking in the farm, notices in this very Popilian field a
      moderate-sized building, and a slave of Marcus Tullius, named Philinus. </p></div><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20" resp="perseus"><p>“What business have you,” says he, “in my

      there at the time) to go with him to Tullius. They go. Tullius was at the villa. Fabius says
      that either he will bring an action against Tullius, or that Tullius must bring one against
      him. Tullius answers that he will bring one, and that he will exchange securities with Fabius

      the praetor, would be at an end. For no one can decide that, if the household were not present
      at a transaction, in that transaction the household itself committed damage with men armed, in
      a violent manner. Therefore, because that could be done, and done easily too, on that account
      it was not thought sufficient for investigation to be made as to what the household itself had

      addition of the words “by malice” the cause of both plaintiff and
      defendant is made more comprehensive. For whichever point he can prove, whether that the
      household itself did him the damage, or that it was done by the contrivance and assistance of

      Marcus Tullius,” what would you have to say? Nothing, I suppose; for you confess

      which you are using, you must inevitably be convicted; unless we think that a man is brought
      before the court who has formed a plan, but that one who has actually done an action is not;
      since a design may be supposed to exist without any act being done, but an act cannot exist
      without a design. Or, because the act is such that it could not be done without a secret
      design, without the aid of the darkness of night, without violence, without injury to another,
      without arms, without murder, without wickedness, is it on that account to be decided to have
      been done without malice? Or, will you suppose that the pleading has been rendered more

      by which they would be caught and detected, not only since they have done the things
      themselves which they admit having done, but even if they had done them by the agency of

      that with malice. They take arms: they do that with malice. They choose a time suitable for
      laying an ambush and for concealing their design: they do that with malice. They break open
      the house with violence: in the violence itself there is malice. They murder men, they
      demolish buildings: it is not possible for a man to be murdered intentionally, or for damage
      to be done to another intentionally, without malice. Therefore, if every part of the business
