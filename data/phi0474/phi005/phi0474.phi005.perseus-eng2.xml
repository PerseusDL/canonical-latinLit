            <div type="commentary" resp="editor">
              <head>The Argument</head>
              <p>After the last oration it was decided that Cicero was to conduct the prosecution
                against Verres; accordingly, a hundred and ten days were allowed to him to prepare
                the evidence, with which object he went himself to <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName> to examine witnesses, and to collect facts in support of his
                charges, taking with him his cousin Lucius Cicero as an assistant, and in this
                journey, contrary to all precedent, he bore his own expenses, resolving to put the
                island to no charge on his account. At <placeName key="tgn,7014561"
                  >Syracuse</placeName> the praetor, Metellus, endeavoured to obstruct him in his
                inquiries, but the magistrates received him with great respect, and, declaring to
                him that all that they had previously done in favour of Verres (for they had erected
                a gilt statue of him, and had sent a testimonial of his good conduct and kind
                government of them to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>) had been
                extorted from them by intrigue and terror, they delivered into his hands authentic
                accounts of many injuries their city had received from Verres, and they revoked by a
                formal decree the public praises which they had given him. <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003897">Messana</placeName>, however, continued firm in its engagements
                to Verres, and denied Cicero all the honours to which he was entitled. When he
                finished his investigations, apprehending that he might be waylaid by the
                contrivance of Verres, he returned by sea to <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
                  >Rome</placeName>, where he found intrigues carrying on to protract the affair as
                much as possible, in order to delay the decision of it till the year following, when
                Hortensius and Metellus were to be the consuls, and the brother of Metellus was to
                be praetor, by whose united authority the prosecution might be stifled: and it was
                now so late in the year that there was not time to bring the trial to an end, if the
                ordinary couse of proceeding was to be adhered to. But Cicero, determined to bring
                on the decision while Glabrio continued to be praetor, abandoned his idea of making
                a long speech, and of taking up time in dilating on and enforcing the different
                counts of the indictment, and resolved to do nothing more than produce his
                witnesses, and offer them to examination; and this novel method of conducting the
                case, together with the powerful evidence produced, which he could not invalidate,
                so confounded Hortensius, that he could find nothing to say in his client's defence,
                who in despair went of his own accord into banishment.</p>
              <p>The object of Cicero in this oration is to show that it is out of sheer necessity
                that he does this, and that he is driven to such a proceeding by the intrigues of
                the opposite party. He therefore exhorts the judges not to be intimidated or cajoled
                into a dishonest decision, and threatens the opposite party with punishmet for
                endeavouring to corrupt the judges.</p>

              <p>That which was above all things to be desired, O judges, and which above all things
                was calculated to have the greatest influence towards allaying the unpopularity of
                your order, and putting an end to the discredit into which your judicial decisions
                have fallen, appears to have been thrown in your way, and given to you not by any
                human contrivance, but almost by the interposition of the gods, at a most important
                crisis of the republic. For an opinion has now become established, pernicious to us,
                and pernicious to the republic, which has been the common talk of every one, not
                only at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, but among foreign nations
                also,—that in the courts of law as they exist at present, no wealthy man, however
                guilty he may be, can possibly be convicted.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2" resp="perseus">
              <p> Now at this time of peril to your order and to your tribunals, when men are ready
                to attempt by harangues, and by the proposal of new laws, to increase the existing
                unpopularity of the senate, Caius Verres is brought to trial as a criminal, a man
                condemned in the opinion of every one by his life and actions, but acquitted by the
                enormousness of his wealth according to his own hope and boast. I, O judges, have
                undertaken this cause as prosecutor with the greatest good wishes and expectation on
                the part of the Roman people, not in order to increase the unpopularity of the
                senate, but to relieve it from the discredit which I share with it. For I have
                brought before you a man, by acting justly in whose case you have an opportunity of
                retrieving the lost credit of your judicial proceedings, of regaining your credit
                with the Roman people, and of giving satisfaction to foreign nations; a man, the
                embezzler of the public funds, the petty tyrant of <placeName key="tgn,1000004"
                  >Asia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002611">Pamphylia</placeName>, the
                robber who deprived the city of its rights, the disgrace and ruin of the province of

            <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3" resp="perseus">
              <p> And if you come to a decision about this man with severity and a due regard to
                your oaths, that authority which ought to remain in you will cling to you still; but
                if that man's vast riches shall break down the sanctity and honesty of the courts of
                justice, at least I shall achieve this, that it shall be plain that it was rather
                honest judgment that was wanting to the republic, than a criminal to the judges, or
                an accuser to the criminal. <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone unit="Para"
                /> I, indeed, that I may confess to you the truth about myself, O judges, though
                many snares were laid for me by Caius Verres, both by land and sea, which I partly
                avoided by my own vigilance, and partly warded off by the zeal and kindness of my
                friends, yet I never seemed to be incurring so much danger, and I never was in such
                a state of great apprehension, as I am now in this very court of law.</p>

            <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4" resp="perseus">
              <p>Nor does the expectation which people have formed of my conduct of this
                prosecution, nor this concourse of so vast a multitude as is here assembled,
                influence me (though indeed I am greatly agitated by these circumstances) so much as
                his nefarious plots which he is endeavouring to lay at one and the same time against
                me, against you, against Marcus Gabrio the praetor, and against the allies, against
                foreign nations, against the senate, and even against the very name of senator;
                whose favourite saying it is that they have got to fear who have stolen only as much
                as is enough for themselves, but that he has stolen so much that it may easily be
                plenty for many; that nothing is so holy that it cannot be corrupted, or so strongly
                fortified that it cannot be stormed by money.</p>

            <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5" resp="perseus">
              <p>But if he were as secret in acting as he is audacious in attempting, perhaps in
                some particular he might some time or other have escaped our notice. But it happens
                very fortunately that to his incredible audacity there is joined a most unexampled
                folly. For as he was unconcealed in committing his robberies of money, so in his
                hope of corrupting the judges he has made his intentions and endeavours visible to
                every one. He says that once only in his life has he felt fear: at the time when he
                was first impeached as a criminal by me; because he was only lately arrived from his
                province, and was branded with unpopularity and infamy, not modern but ancient and
                of long standing; and, besides that, the time was unlucky, being very ill-suited for
                corrupting the judges.</p>

            <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6" resp="perseus">
              <p>Therefore, when I had demanded a very short time to prosecute my inquiries in
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, he found a man to ask for two
                days less to make investigations in <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>;
                  <note anchored="true">It is not certainly known what Cicero refers to here.</note>
                not with any real intention of doing the same with his diligence and industry, that
                I have accomplished by my labour, and daily and nightly investigations. For the
                Achaean inquisitor never even arrived at <placeName key="perseus,Brundusium"
                  >Brundusium</placeName>. I in fifty days so traveled over the whole of <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> that I examined into the records and injuries
                of all the tribes and of all private individuals, so that it was easily visible to
                every one, that he had been seeking out a man not really for the purpose of bringing
                the defendant whom he accused to trial, but merely to occupy the time which ought to
                belong to me.</p>

                and crimes not only in your ears, but in the very eyes of all men. He sees that many
                senators are witnesses of his audacity, he sees that many Roman knights are so too,
                and many citizens, and many of the allies besides to whom he has done unmistakable
                injuries. He sees also that very numerous and very important deputations have come
                here at the same time from most friendly cities, armed with the public authority and

                greedy of money, since he now finds that there is such protection in money, and that
                he has bought (what was the hardest thing of all) the very time of his trial, in
                order to be able to buy everything else more easily; so that, as he could not by any

                bribery; and when this was noticed and perceived, the Roman people took care with
                the most earnest goodwill that I should not be deprived of my honour through the

                people greatly moved by; that I thought that foreign nations would send ambassadors
                to the Roman people to procure the abrogation of the law, and of all trials, about
                extortion; for if there were no trials, they think that each man would only plunder
                them of as much as he would think sufficient for himself and his children; but now,
                because there are trials of that sort, every one carries off as much as it will take
                to satisfy himself, his patrons, his advocates, the praetor, and the judges; and
                that this is an enormous sum; that they may be able to satisfy the cupidity of one
                most avaricious man, but are quite unable to incur the expense of his most guilty
                victory over the laws.</p>

                allies of the Roman people are unwilling that trials for extortion should take
                place, which were instituted by our ancestors for the sake of the allies. Would that
                man ever have had a favourable hope of his own safety, if he had not conceived in
                his mind a bad opinion of you? on which account, he ought, if possible, to be still

                demanding that in words, it seemed to be asking for that, but in reality it was
                asking for tribunes which it could trust. And this did not escape the notice of
                Quintus Catulus, a most sagacious and honourable man, who, when Cnaeus Pompeius, a
                most gallant and illustrious man, made a motion about the tribunitian power, and
                when he was asked his opinion, begin his speech in this manner, speaking with the
                greatest authority, “that the conscript fathers presided over the courts of justice
                badly and wickedly; but if in deciding judicial trials they had been willing to
                satisfy the expectations of the Roman people, men would not so greatly regret the

                people as consul elect, mentioned (what seemed above all things to be watched for)
                that he would restore the power of the tribunes, a great shout was raised at his
                words, and a grateful murmur pervaded the assembly. And when he had said also in the
                same assembly “that the provinces were depopulated and tyrannised over, that the
                courts of justice were become base and wicked, and that he desired to provide for

                he was willing to leave these orations as a specimen of his abilities that way, and
                as a pattern of a just and diligent impeachment of a corrupt magistrate. But
                Hortensius had been so confounded by the novelty of Cicero's mode of conducting the
                prosecution, and by the strength of the case brought against his client, that he was
                quite unable to make any defence, and Verres went into voluntary exile. </p>
              <p>In the beginning of this oration Cicero imagines Verres to be present, and to be
                prepared to make his defence, but before he proceeds to the main subjects of the
                prosecution, which occupy the last four orations he devotes this one to an
                examination of his previous character and conduct as a public man, as quaestor, as

                would not again present himself in court; And this idea had not got about merely
                because he had deliberately determined and resolved not to appear, but because no

                after having been convicted of such nefarious crimes, and by so many witnesses, to

              <p> For neither can there be any greater safety for the republic imagined at this
                time, than for the Roman people to understand that, if all unworthy judges are
                carefully rejected by the accusers, the allies, the laws, and the republic can be
                thoroughly defended by a bench of judges chosen from the senators; nor can any such
                injury to the fortunes of all happen, as for all regard for truth, for integrity,

                doing to be acting not more for the benefit of my own reputation than of yours. For
                I have come forward to diminish the unpopularity of the courts of justice, and to
                remove the reproaches which are levelled at them; in order that, when this cause has
                been decided according to the wish of the Roman people, the authority of the courts
                of justice may appear to have been re-established in some degree by my diligence;
                and in order that this matter may be so decided that an end may be put at length to

                in this cause. For the criminal is most guilty. And if he be condemned, men will
                cease to say that money is all powerful with the present tribunal; but if he be
                acquitted we shall cease to be able to make any objection to transferring the
                tribunal to another body. Although that fellow has not in reality any hope, nor the
                Roman people any fear of his acquittal, there are some men who do marvel at his
                singular impudence in being present, in replying to the accusations brought against
                him; but to me even this does not appear marvellous in comparison with his other
                actions of audacity and madness. For he has done many impious and nefarious actions
                both against gods and men; by the punishment for which crimes he is now disquieted
                and driven out of his mind and out of his senses. </p>

                existed of similar renown and dignity. And this credit that fellow says that he

                not mistaken: for in the comitia for my election, when that man was employing
                boundless bribery against me, the Roman people decided that his money, which had no

                were summoned to this place, and sat in judgment on this criminal, who was so
                hostile to your order, who was so desirous of a new constitution, of a new tribunal

                no longer exist; that the second day took away from his friends, not only all hope
                of victory, but even all inclination to make any defence; that the third day
                prostrated the man so entirely, that, pretending to be sick, he took counsel, not
                what reply he could make, but how he could avoid making any; and after that, on the
                subsequent days, he was so oppressed and overwhelmed by these accusations, by these
                witnesses, both from the city and from the provinces, that when these days of the
                games intervened, no one thought that he had procured an adjournment, but they

                carry away this conviction from the previous pleading, that if all the wickednesses,
                thefts, and enormities of all who have ever been condemned before were brought
                together into one place, they could scarcely be likened or compared to but a small

              <p> Judges, consider and deliberate what becomes your fame, your reputation, and the
                common safety? Your eminence prevents your being able to make any mistake without
                the greatest injury and danger to the republic. For the Roman people cannot hope
                that there are any other men in the senate who can judge uprightly, if you cannot.
                It is inevitable that, when it has learnt to despair of the whole order, it should
                look for another class of men and another system of judicial proceedings. If this
                seems to you at all a trifling matter, because you think the being judges a grave
                and inconvenient burden, you ought to be aware, in the first place, that it makes a
                difference whether you throw off that burden yourselves, of your own accord, or
                whether the power of sitting as judges is taken away from you because you have been
                unable to convince the Roman people of your good faith and scrupulous honesty. In
                the second place, consider this also, with what great danger we shall come before
                those judges whom the Roman people, by reason of its hatred to you, has willed shall
                judge concerning you. </p>

                practice of openly saying that they are willing for that man, whom they know to be a
                most infamous one, to be acquitted for this one reason,—that then the honour or the
                judgment-seat may be taken from the senate with ignominy and disgrace. It is not my
                fear for your good faith, O judges, which has urged me to lay these considerations
                before you at some length, but the new hopes which those men are entertaining; for
                when those hopes had brought Verres suddenly back from the gates of the city to this
                court, some men suspected that his intention had not been changed so suddenly

                Caius Verres is circumvented because the prosecutor will not speak as long as he is

                make it less easy for him to be condemned? For if the cause be understood, many men

                has either been instituted for my sake rather than for yours, or, at all events, not
                more for your sake than for mine. For if to speak twice be an advantage, certainly
                it is an advantage which is common to both If there is a necessity that he who has
                spoken last should be refuted, then it is for the sake of the prosecutor that the he
                has been established that there should be a second discussion. But, as I imagine,
                Glaucia first proposed the law that the defendant might have an adjournment; before
                that time the decision might either be given at once, or the judges might take time
                to consider. Which law, then, do you think the mildest? I think that ancient one, by
                which a man might either be acquitted quickly, or condemned after deliberation. I
                restore you that law of Acilius, according to which many men who have only been
                accused once, whose cause has only been pleaded once, in whose case witnesses have
                only been heard once, have been condemned on charges by no means so clearly proved,
                nor so flagitious as those on which you are convicted. Think that you are pleading
                your cause, not according to that severe law, but according to that most merciful
                one. I will accuse you; you shall reply. Having produced my witnesses, I will lay
                the whole matter before the bench in such a way, that even if the law gave them a
                power of adjournment, yet they shall think it discreditable to themselves not to

                been investigated but superficially? Are we keeping back anything, O Hortensius, a
                trick which we have often seen practiced in pleading? Who ever attends much to the

                of Halesa, named Dio, who, when a great inheritance had come to his son from a
                relation while Sacerdos was praetor, had at the time no trouble nor dispute about
                it. Verres, as soon as he arrived in the province, immediately wrote letters from
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003897">Messana</placeName>; he summoned Dio before him, he
                procured false witnesses from among his own friends to say that that inheritance had

                the result was, namely, that Dio paid a million of <foreign xml:lang="la"
                  >sesterces</foreign>, in order to prevail in a cause of most undeniable justice,
                besides that Verres had his herds of mares driven away, and all his plate and
                embroidered vestments carried off. But neither while I was so relating these things,
                nor while you were denying them, would our speeches be of any great importance. At

                have galled in all that was owing to him, to have sold farms; when the accounts of
                respectable men were produced, when they who had supplied Dio with money said that
                they had heard at the time that the money was taken on purpose to be given to

                For at that time all men were so uniformly disposed in the same manner, that this
                credit of eminent virtue and incorruptibility appears to belong, not only to those
                men, but also to those times. Publius Servilius, a most illustrious man, who has
                performed the noblest exploits, is present. He will deliver his opinion on your
                conduct. He, by his power, had forces; his wisdom and his valour took <placeName

                embellished in every possible manner. I am bringing forward recent example of a most
                distinguished man. For Servilius, as a general of the Roman people, took <placeName

              <p> The things which you carried off from the holiest temples with wickedness, and
                like a robber, we cannot see, except in your own houses, or in those of your
                friends. The statues and decorations which Publius Servilius brought away from the
                cities of our enemies, taken by his courage and valour, according to the laws of war
                and his own rights as commander-in-chief, he brought home for the Roman people; he
                carried them in his triumph, and took care that a description of them should be
                engraved on public tablets and hid up in the treasury. You may learn from public
                documents the industry of that most honourable man. Read—“The accounts delivered by
                Publius Servilius.” You see not only the number of the statues, but the size, the
                figure, and the condition of each one among them accurately described in writing.
                Certainly, the delight arising from virtue and from victory is much greater than
                that pleasure which is derived from licentiousness and covetousness. I say that
                Servilius took much more care to have the booty of the Roman people noted and
                described, than you took to have your plunder catalogued. </p>

              <p> You will say that your statues and paintings were also an ornament to the city and
                forum of the Roman people. I recollect: I, together with the Roman people, saw the
                forum and place for holding the assemblies adorned with embellishments, in
                appearance indeed magnificent, but to one's senses and thoughts bitter and
                melancholy. I saw everything glittering with your thefts, with the plunder of the
                provinces, with the spoils of our allies and friends. At which time, O judges, that

                been taken from their temples. And so also, when they recognised the other statues
                and ornaments, they wept, as they beheld the different pieces of their property in
                different place. And from all those men we then used to hear discourses of this
                sort:—“That it was impossible for any one to doubt of the ruin of our allies and
                friends, when men saw in the forum of the Roman people, in which formerly those men
                used to be accused and condemned who had done any injury to the allies, those things
                now openly placed which had been wickedly seized and taken away from the allies.”

                some men have not kept them from the beginning, but after some time have made them
                up; there is a way of accounting for this too. But this is unprecedented and absurd
                which this man gave us for an answer, when we demanded his account of him: “That he

                used to find out all these things for him wherever he went, with wonderful address.
                He brings him the following news,—that there was a man of the name of Philodamus, in
                birth, in rank, in wealth, and in reputation by far the first man among the citizens
                of <placeName key="tgn,7002579">Lampsacus</placeName>; that his daughter, who was
                living with her father because she had not yet got a husband, was a woman of
                extraordinary beauty, but was also considered exceedingly modest and virtuous. The

                only not seen himself, but which even he from whom he heard of it had not seen
                himself, that he said he should like to go to Philodamus immediately. Janitor, his
                host, who suspected nothing, being afraid that he must have given him some offence
                himself, endeavoured with all his might to detain him. Verres, as he could not find
                any pretext for leaving his host's house began to pave his way for his meditated
                violence by other steps. He says that Rubrius, his most loved friend, his assistant
                in all such matters, and the partner of his counsels, is lodged with but little
                comfort. He orders him to be conducted to the house of Philodamus. </p>

                misfortune was at that moment being contrived for him and for his children, still he
                comes to him,—represents to him that that is not his office,—that when it was his
                turn to receive guests, he was accustomed to receive the praetors and consuls
                themselves, and not the attendants of lieutenants. Verres, as he was hurried on by
                that one desire alone, disregarded all his demands and allegations, and ordered
                Rubrius to be introduced by force into the house of a man who had a right to refuse

                Philodamus, when he could not preserve his rights, studied at least to preserve his

                friendly towards our people, did not like to appear to have received even this
                fellow Rubrius into his house unwillingly; he prepares a banquet magnificently and
                luxuriously, being, as he was, among the richest of all his fellow citizens; he begs
                Rubrius to invite whoever were agreeable to himself; to leave, if he pleased, just
                room for himself alone. He even sends his own son, a most excellent youth, out to
                one of his relations to supper. </p>

                and an invitation is given to drink in the Greek fashion. The host encourages them;
                they demand wine in larger goblets; the banquet proceeds with the conversation and
                joy of every one. When the business appeared to Rubrius to have got warm enough, “I
                would know of you, O Philodamus,” says he, “why you do not bid your daughter to be
                invited in hither to us?” The man, who was both a most dignified man, and of mature
                age, and a parent, was amazed at the speech of the rascal. Rubrius began to urge it.
                Then he, in order to give some answer, said that it was not the custom of the Greeks
                for women to sit down at the banquets of men. On this some one else from some other
                part of the room cried out, “But this is not to be borne; let the women be
                summoned.” And immediately Rubrius orders his slaves to shut the door, and to stand

                them disregard him and defend his daughter, and orders some one to run out and bear
                the news to his son of this overpowering domestic misfortune. Meantime an uproar

                every one fights for his own safety. At last Philodamus has a quantity of boiling
                water thrown over him by Rubrius himself. When the news of this is brought to the
                son, half dead with alarm he instantly hastens home to bring aid to save the life of
                his father and the modesty of his sister. All the citizens of <placeName

                heard of it, because both the worth of Philodamus and the enormity of the injury
                excited them, assembled by night at his house. At this time Cornelius, the lictor of
                Verres, who had been placed with his slaves by Rubrius, as if on guard, for the
                purpose of carrying off the woman, is slain; some of the slaves are wounded; Rubrius
                himself is wounded in the crowd. Verres, when he saw such an uproar excited by his
                own cupidity, began to wish to escape some way or other if he could. </p>

                you have shown yourself in the towns and cities of our friends, not as a lieutenant
                of the Roman people, but as a lustful and inhuman tyrant—when among foreign nations
                you have injured the reputation of our dominion and our name by your infamy and your
                crimes—when you have with difficulty saved yourself from the sword of the friends of
                the Roman people, and escaped from the fire of its allies, do you think you will
                find an asylum here? You are mistaken—they allowed you to escape alive that you

                accused were not punished? Then the decision of Nero will do you but little good.
                Recite the letters which he sent to Nero. [The letter of Caius Verres to Nero is

                defend the name and rights of a lieutenant? Will you say that that was settled by

                you?—how does the conviction of Philodamus? Though you, a lieutenant, had been
                besieged, and when, as you yourself write to Nero, a notorious injury had been done
                to the Roman people, and to the common cause of all lieutenants, you did not
                prosecute. You said that you intended to prosecute at some other time When was that

                transacted through his instrumentality, while he levied on the cities corn, hides,
                hair-cloth, sacks, but did not receive the goods but exacted money instead of

                at three millions of <foreign xml:lang="la">sesterces</foreign>. And all these
                things even if they were done with the consent of Dolabella, were yet all

                ascertained the numerous robberies and iniquities of that man, he acted skillfully
                and warily. He showed him a huge volume full of his exploits; he got from the fellow

                  discrepancy between the accounts of Verres and that of Dolabella, the fault was
                  necessarily in the accounts of Verres; especially as Dolabella had been justly
                  convicted of extortion and malversation already. Undoubtedly Cicero produced

                  it was enacted, that no person who should be included in the census, after the

                  heir. Cicero does not state that the <foreign xml:lang="la">Lex</foreign> fixed
                  the census at any sum; but it appears from other writers that a woman could not be
                  made <foreign xml:lang="la">haeres</foreign> by any person who was rated in the
                  census at a hundred thousand <foreign xml:lang="la">sesterces</foreign>. The Lex

                  his property as he pleased by will, the purpose of the law would be frustrated and
                  further, the “not being included in the census” (<foreign xml:lang="la">neque
                    census esset</foreign>) seems rather vague. Another provision of the law,
                  mentioned by Cicero, forbade a person who was <foreign xml:lang="la"

                why does not the edict have its birth also on the first of January? Or, is it the
                case that no one can advance forward by his edict into the year when another man is
                to be praetor, but that he may retire back into the year when another man has been
                praetor? And if you had published this edict for the sake of right, and not for the
                sake of one man, you would have composed it more carefully. </p>

                ever apprehensive even of any one publishing such an edict. For after your

                that person who would have had the best right to be the heir, if the deceased had
                died intestate. Why this is the most righteous principle it is easy to show; but in

                and given security, he then proceeded to try an action for his inheritance. This is
                the law which, as I imagine, both our ancestors and we ourselves have always been

                “According to the edict of the city praetor,—if any doubt arises about an

                ought to be the possessor? Therefore, because he is in possession, you do not remove
                him from the possession. If he were not in possession, you would not give him
                possession. For you nowhere say so; nor do you embrace anything else in your edict

                among them his own freedman. He had had a brother, Aulus Trebonius, a proscribed
                man. As he wished to make provision for him, he put down in his will, that his heirs

                settled with the woman, he should order her to take possession. Lucius Gellius
                defended the cause of Ligur. He showed that his edict ought not to prevail with
                respect to those inheritances which had accrued to the heirs before his praetorship;
                that, if this edict had existed at that time, perhaps Ligur would not have entered
                upon the inheritance at all. This just demand, and the highest authority of
                influential men, was beaten down by money. </p>

              <p> Ligur came to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>; he did not doubt
                that, if he himself had seen Verres, he should have been able to move the man by the
                justice of his cause and by his own influence. He went to him to his house; he
                explains the whole business; he points out to him how long ago it was that the
                inheritance had come to him and, as it was easy for an able man to do in a most just
                cause, he said many things which might have influenced any one. At last he began to
                entreat him not to despise his influence and scorn his authority to such an extent
                as to inflict such an injury upon him. The fellow began to accuse Ligur of being so
                assiduous and so attentive in a business which was adventitious, and only belonging
                to him by way of inheritance. He said that he ought to have a regard for him also;
                that he required a great deal himself; that the dogs whom he kept about him required
                a great deal. I cannot recount those things to you more plainly than you have heard
                Ligur himself relate them in his evidence. </p>

                and audacity; vices which appear to meet in any one else rather than in him. Quintus
                Tadius has said something of the same sort, a most intimate friend of the father of
                Verres, and not unconnected with his mother, either in family or in name. He has

                been handed over to him by his ward, which might be exacted from him. When he said,

                that all the statues and presents were in their places, that the temple itself was

                unless you like to try the pillars by a plumb-line.” The man, utterly ignorant of
                everything, asks what is the meaning of the expression, “by a plumb-line.” They tell
                him that there is hardly any pillar which is exactly perpendicular when tried by a
                plumb-line. “By my truth,” says he, “that is what we must do; let the pillars be

                for himself to receive the temple on such terms, lest he should be hereafter

                in that way, and that such an examination has no right to be made. Verres orders
                Rabonius to be quiet, and at the same time holds out to him some hopes of a

                in his office, not to endeavour to deprive
                  <persName><surname>Junius</surname></persName> his ward of his father's fortune by
                the greatest injustice. Verres, who had already in hope and belief devoured that

                any advertisement or notice of the day,) at a most unfavourable time—at the very
                time of the Roman games, and while the forum is decorated for them. Therefore
                Rabonius gives notice to the guardians that he renounces the settlement to which he
                had come. However, the guardians come at the appointed time; Junius, the uncle of
                the youth, bids. Verres began to change colour: his countenance, his speech, his
                resolution failed him. He begins to consider what he was to do. If the contract was
                taken by the minor, if the affair slipped through the fingers of the purchaser whom
                he himself had provided, he would get no plunder. Therefore He contrives—what?
                Nothing very cleverly, nothing of which any one could say, “it was a rascally trick,

                adopted by every consul, and censor, and praetor, and quaestor, that that bidder
                shall have the preference to whom the property belongs, and at whose risk the
                property is sold? He excludes that bidder alone to whom alone, I was nearly saying,
                the power of taking the contract ought to have been offered. “For why,”—so the youth
                might say—“should any one aspire to my money against my will! What does he come
                forward for? The contract is let out for a work which is to be done and paid for out
                of my money. I say that it is I who am going to put the place in repair, the
                inspection of it afterwards will belong to you who let out the contract. You have
                taken sufficient security for the interests of the people with bonds and sureties;
                and if you do not think sufficient security has been taken, will you as praetor send
                whomsoever you please to take possession of my property, and not permit me to come
                forward in defence of my own fortune?” </p>

              <p> It is worth while to consider the words of the contract itself. You will say that

                “Cnaeus Domitius, Lucius Metellus, Lucius Cassius, Cnaeus Servilius have added....”
                Caius Verres wants something of the same sort. Read. What has he added? “Admit not
                as a partner in this work any one who has taken a contract from Lucius Marcius and
                Marcus Perperna the censors; give him no snare in it; and let him not contract for
                it.” Why so? Is it that the work may not be faulty? But the inspection afterwards
                belonged to you. Lest he should not have capital enough? But sufficient security had
                been taken for the people's interest in bonds and sureties, and more security still

                took a little labour of artisans at low wages, and there was the hire of the crane.
                Do you think it was less work to make one entirely new pillar without any old stone,

                friends to apply to me; he easily gets what he wishes for; Verres did not know what
                he was to do. By not having entered it in his accounts, he thought he should be able

                transaction. Although, what could be more plain than it now is, even without the

                had fixed, and also because men did not choose to put themselves in the power of a
                man who, if they took the contract, thought that his plunder was torn from his
                hands. For why need we discuss the point where the money went to? He himself has
                showed us. First of all, when Decimus Brutus contended eagerly against him, who paid

                own money; and as he could not resist him, though he had given out the job, and
                taken securities for its execution, he returned him a hundred and ten thousand. Now
                if this had been another man's money, he clearly could not have done so. In the
                second place, the money was paid to Cornificius, whom he cannot deny to have been
                his secretary. Lastly, the accounts of Rabonius himself cry out loudly that the

                for many, and those the greatest, reasons:—First, because of all foreign nations
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> was the first who joined herself
                to the friendship and alliance of the Roman people. She was the first to be called a
                province; and the provinces are a great ornament to the empire. She was the first
                who taught our ancestors how glorious a thing it was to rule over foreign nations.
                She alone has displayed such good faith and such good will towards the Roman people,
                that the states of that island which have once come into our alliance have never
                revolted afterwards, but many of them, and those the most illustrious of them, have
                remained firm to our friendship for ever.</p>

                fortified by art, but was protected also by its natural advantages—by the character
                of the ground about it, and by the sea—he not only allowed it to remain without any
                diminution of its strength, but he left it so highly adorned, as to be at the same
                time a monument of his victory, of his clemency, and of his moderation; when men saw
                both what he had subdued, and whom he had spared, and what he had left behind him.
                He thought that <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> was entitled to have

                she could produce was not so much raised among the Sicilians as stored up in our own

                we stood in need of? When did she ever refuse anything which was exacted of her?
                Therefore that illustrious Marcus Cato the wise called <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName> a storehouse of provisions for our republic—the nurse of the

                storehouse of provisions to us, but was also an old and well-filled treasury left us

                clothed, armed, and fed our most numerous armies, without any expense at all to

                province with which they are connected, faithful and productive to which they may
                easily make excursions, where they may be welcome to engage in traffic; citizens,

                some she retains, as they take a fancy to turn farmers, or graziers, or traders in
                her land, or even to pitch in it their habitations and their homes. And this is no
                trifling advantage to the Roman people, that so vast a number of Roman citizens

                might be twice secured by the same family. Afterwards, too, they experienced that
                terrible government of Marcus Antonius. For they had had these principles handed
                down to them from their ancestors, that the kindnesses of the Roman people to the

                made the demand. A fellow of the name of Naevius Turpo is the claimant, a spy and

                been condemned in the praetorship of Caius Sacerdos for many wickednesses. For the
                cause was such that the very praetor himself when he was seeking for an accuser,
                could not find one a little more respectable than this fellow. Verres acquits his
                man of any forfeiture to Venus, but condemns him to pay forfeit to himself. He
                preferred, forsooth, to have men do wrong rather than gods;—he preferred himself to
                extort from Dio what was contrary to law, rather than to let Venus take anything

              <p>Listen now to a no less shamelessly false accusation in a case where a smaller sum

                whose will, if anything were done wrongly in any point, there was to be a forfeiture

                asserted in this case, or only put out as a feeler? For to me it is quite a new
                light. Verres set up the accusers; Verres summoned the brother to appear before him;
                Verres heard the cause; Verres gave sentence. A vast sum was paid; they who paid it
                gained the cause; and you argue in defence “that money was not paid to Verres.” I
                can help you; my witnesses too say the same thing; they say they paid it to

                Volcatius, if he had come on his own account, one half-farthing? Let him come now,

                contrary to law; and I deny that you have ever accounted for one farthing of that
                money; but when money was paid for your decrees, for your orders, for your

                whose oppression it was extorted.</p>

                even now those who say this do not appear to me to be defending Verres so much as

                to the laws of the Sicilians in such uses, and then to the practices this man
                established. <milestone n="13" unit="chapter"/><milestone unit="Para"/> The
                Sicilians have this law,—that if a citizen of any town has a dispute with a
                fellow-citizen, he is to decide it in his own town, according to the laws there
                existing; if a Sicilian has a dispute with a Sicilian of a different city, in that
                case the praetor is to assign judges of that dispute, according to the law of
                Publius Rupilius, which be enacted by the advice of ten commissioners appointed to
                consider the subject, and which the Sicilians call the Rupilian law. If an
                individual makes a claim in a community, or a community on an individual, the senate
                of some third city is assigned to furnish the judges, as the citizens of the cities
                interested in the litigation are rejected as judges in such a case. If a Roman
                citizen makes a claim on a Sicilian, a Sicilian judge is assigned; if a Sicilian
                makes a claim on a Roman citizen, a Roman citizen is assigned as judge: in all other
                matters judges are appointed selected from the body of Roman citizens dwelling in
                the place. In law-suits between the farmers and the tax collectors, trials are
                regulated by the law about corn, which they call <foreign xml:lang="la">Lex

              <p> All these rights were not only thrown into disorder while that man was praetor,
                but indeed were openly taken away from both the Sicilians and from the Roman
                citizens. First of all, their own laws with reference to one another were
                disregarded. If a citizen had a dispute with another citizen, he either assigned any
                one as judge whom it was convenient to himself to assign, crier, soothsayer, or his
                own physician; or if a tribunal was established by the laws, and the parties had
                come before one of their fellow-citizens as the judge, that citizen was not allowed
                to decide without control. For, listen to the edict issued by this man, by which
                edict he brought every tribunal under his own authority: “If any one had given a
                wrong decision, he would examine into the matter himself; when he had examined, he
                would punish.” And when he did that, no one doubted that when the judge thought that
                some one else was doing to sit in judgment on his decision, and that he should be at
                the risk of his life in the matter, he would consider the inclination of the man who
                he expected would presently be judging in a matter affecting his down existence as a
                citizen. </p>

              <p> Judges selected from the Roman settlers there were none; none even of the traders
                in the cities were proposed as judges. The crowd of judges which I am speaking of
                was the retinue, not of Quintus Scaevola, (who, however, did not make practice of
                appointing judges from among his own followers,) but of Caius Verres. And what sort
                of a retinue do you suppose it was when such a man as he was its chief? You see
                announced in the edict, “If the senate gives an erroneous decision....” I will prove
                that, if at any time a bench of judges was taken from the senate, that also gave its
                decisions, through compulsion, on his part, contrary to their own opinions. There
                never was any selection of the judges by lot, according to the Rupilian law, except
                when he had no interest whatever in the case. The tribunals established in the case
                of many disputes by the <foreign xml:lang="la">Lex Hieronica</foreign> were all
                abolished by a single edict; no judges were appointed selected from the settlers or
                from the traders. What great power he had you see; now learn how he exercised it.

                In the mean time the day had arrived, on which he had announced in his edict that,

                assigned till thirty days after the action was commenced. The thirty days had not
                yet elapsed; Heraclius hoped that, if he could avoid having them appointed that day,

                to Verres before another appointment could take place. </p>

                Heraclius demanded, on the other hand, that judges should be appointed according to
                the provisions of the Rupilian law; and that no departure should be made from the

                thought that the condemnation of an absent man, especially in a matter involving so
                large a sum of money, would be a far more odious measure than if he had appeared in

                because the judges had not been appointed in accordance with the provisions of the
                Rupilian law, they saw that the affair would appear much more base and more

                law) Heraclius to be summoned, and those who had brought the action against him; he
                says that he is going to appoint the judges by lot, according to the Rupilian law.
                That which Heraclius the day before could not obtain from him, though he begged and
                entreated it of him with many tears, occurred to him the next day of his own accord,

                distance to look for some one, (in which case he would not have been able to prove
                it,) but he took one of his nearest relations, a sort of second son, <note

                having stolen the money. He declared that he would make him refund it; and he, after
                he heard that, had a proper regard for his dignity, for his age, and for his noble
                birth. He addressed the senate on the subject; he declared to them that he had
                nothing to do with the business Of Verres he said what all saw to be true, and he
                said it plainly enough. Therefore, the Syracusans afterwards erected him a statue;

                because the claim made against him had actually nothing in it about which a doubt
                could be raised. Afterwards when he thought of Heraclius, and recollected the

                out that his decree had been attempted to be influenced by bribes, because they
                could do nothing against Epicrates according to law, even if he were present,—to

                than the other, because Epicrates had actually never had any action brought against
                him at all,) he gave them all his paternal property and fortune. For he showed that
                if any one made a demand of any thing from an absent person, he would hear the
                cause, though without any precedent for so doing. The men of Bidis appear—they claim

                Rupilian law. The adversaries did not dare to say anything against this; no escape

                to take possession of all his property, and to keep it for themselves. Besides the
                five hundred thousand <foreign xml:lang="la">sesterces</foreign> which the

                Epicrates, and that against Heraclius. In the property of both of them there was

                friendship, and their relationship. From that time he began to solicit the cities

              <p> But why should I seek out every separate transaction and cause in the trials which
                took place on capital charges? Out of many, which are all nearly alike, I will
                select those which seem to go beyond all the others in rascality. There was a man of
                Halicya, named Sopater, among the first men of his state for riches and high
                character. He, having been accused by his enemies before Caius Sacerdos the praetor,
                on a capital charge, was easily acquitted. The same enemies again accused this same
                Sopater on the same charge before Caius Verres when he had come as successor to
                Sacerdos. The matter appeared trifling to Sopater, both because he was innocent, and
                because he thought that Verres would never dare to overturn the decision of
                Sacerdos. The defendant is cited to appear. The cause is heard at <placeName
                  key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>. Those changes are brought forward by
                the accusers which had been already previously extinguished, not only by the

                was nothing in the cause which seemed possible to be feared, or even to be doubted
                about at all. In the meantime that same Timarchides, that fellow's attendant and
                freedman, who is, as you have learnt by many witnesses at the former hearing, his
                agent and manager in all affairs of this sort, comes to Sopater, and advised him not
                to trust too much to the decision of Sacerdos and the justice of his cause; he tells
                him that his accusers and enemies have thoughts of giving money to the praetor, but
                that the praetor would rather take it to acquit; and at the same time, that he had
                rather, if it were possible, not rescind a decision of his predecessor. Sopater, as
                this happened to him quite suddenly and unexpectedly, was greatly perplexed, and had
                no answer ready to make to Timarchides, except that he would consider what he had

                fear or any anxiety. No crime had been committed; the matter had been decided;
                Verres had received the money. Who could doubt how it would turn out? The matter is
                not summed up that day; the court breaks up; Timarchides comes a second time to
                Sopater. He says that his accusers were promising a much larger sum to the praetor
                than what he had given, and that if he were wise he would consider what he had best
                do. The man, though he was a Sicilian, and a defendant—that is to say, though he had
                little chance of obtaining justice—and was in an unfortunate position, still would
                not bear with or listen to Timarchides any longer. Do, said he, whatever you please;

                and so much the more, because Verres, however he might conduct himself on the trial,
                still had with him on the bench some honourable men of the Syracusan community, who
                had also been on the bench with Sacerdos when this same Sopater had been acquitted.
                They considered that it was absolutely impossible for the same men, who had formerly
                acquitted Sopater, to condemn him now on the same charge, supported by the same
                witnesses. And so with this one hope they came before the court. </p>

                namely, on the number and dignity of the bench of judges, and on the fact of their
                being, as I have said before, the same men who had before acquitted Sopater of the

                attend to a private cause in which he was judge. Petilius refused, because Verres
                himself was detaining his friends whom he had wished to have with him on the bench.
                He, liberal man, said that he did not wish to detain any of the men who preferred
                being with Petilius. And so they all go; for the rest also prevail upon him not to

                those men were present, whom he had got rid of for the time, Sopater would be
                acquitted; but if he condemned an unfortunate and innocent man, (while he himself,
                the praetor, was without any colleagues, and the defendant without any counsel or
                patron,) and rescinded the decision of Caius Sacerdos, he thought that he should not
                be able to withstand the unpopularity of such an act. So he was quite in a fever
                with perplexity. He turned himself every way, not only as to his mind, but also as
                to his body; so that all who were present could plainly see that fear and
                covetousness were contending together in his heart. There was a great crowd of
                people present, there was profound silence, and eager expectation which way his
                covetousness was going to find vent. His attendant Timarchides was constantly

                He orders the witnesses to be summoned instantly. One or two of them give their

                adjourned the private cause on which he was engaged, might return to the bench with
                the rest, jumps down in haste from his seat; he condemned an innocent man, one who
                had been acquitted by Caius Sacerdos, without hearing him in his defence, by the
                joint sentence of a secretary, a physician, and a soothsayer.</p>

                to many by his eminent virtue and his illustrious birth, and now known to all men by
                his own misfortune and the unexampled injuries he has received from that man. Verres
                having often enjoyed his hospitality, and having not only stayed often with him at

                everything which could in any uncommon degree delight the mind or eyes of any one.
                In truth, Sthenius from his youth had collected such things as these with more than

                for beauty. Scipio as he thought it a thing worthy of the Roman people, that, after

                far from their ancient town. They thought that they were recovering the fortune and

                town and of the river. There was also a statue of the poet Stesichorus, aged,

                coveted to a degree of madness. There is also, which I had almost passed over, a
                certain she-goat made, as even we who are skilled in these matters can judge, with
                wonderful skill and beauty. These, and other works of art, Scipio had not thrown
                away like a fool, in order that an intelligent man like Verres might have an
                opportunity of carrying them away, but he had restored them to the people of
                Thermae; not that he himself had not gardens, or a suburban villa, or some place or
                other where he could put them; but, if he had taken them home, they would not long
                have been called Scipio's, but theirs to whom they had come by his death. Now they

                same Agathinus, of whom Verres had heard. So he preferred migrating to the
                son-in-law of Agathinus. Only one night elapsed before he became so intimate with
                Dorotheus, that, as one might say, they had everything in common. He paid as great
                attention to Agathinus as if he had been some connection or relation of his own. He
                appeared even to despise that statue of Himera, because the figure and features of
                his hostess delighted him much more.</p>

              <p> Therefore he began to instigate the men to create some danger for Sthenius, and to
                invent some accusation against him. They said they had nothing to allege against
                him. On this he openly declared to them, and promised to them that they might prove
                whatever they pleased against Sthenius if they only laid the information before him.
                So they do not delay. They immediately bring Sthenius before him; they say that the
                public documents have been tampered with by him. Sthenius demands, that as his own
                fellow-citizens are prosecuting him on a charge of tampering with the public
                documents, and as there is a right of action on such a charge according to the laws

                Publius Rupilius had afterwards, in obedience to a degree of the senate, given laws
                to the Sicilinus, acting with the advice of ten commissioners, according to which

                Sthenius in his absence of a capital charge, he was ready to take the charge.” And
                immediately he began to instigate Agathinus, his new relation and host, to apply
                himself to such a cause, and to accuse him. But he said loudly, in the hearing of
                every one, that he would not do so, and that he was not so far an enemy to Sthenius

                praetor, was present in the senate, and with tears begged all the senators to spare
                his son, but he had not much success. For the inclination of the senate for the
                proposal of the consuls was extreme. Therefore opinions were delivered to this
                effect; “that as Sthenius had been proceeded against in his absence, it seemed good
                to the senate that no trial should take place in the case of an absent man; and if

                and Quintus Mucius, requested laws from our senate, as they had disputes among
                themselves about the elections into their senate. The senate, by a very honourable
                decree, voted that Caius Claudius Pulcher, the son of Appius the praetor, should
                give them laws to regulate their elections into their senate. Caius Claudius, taking
                as his counselors all the Marcelli who were then alive, with their advice gave laws
                to the men of Halesa in which he laid down many rules about the age of the men who
                might be elected; that no one might be under thirty years of age; about trade,—that
                no one engaged in it might be elected; about their income, and about all other

                say that cannot possibly be done, according to the reverence due to their sacred
                laws; they say it would be impious. He orders the law to be read to him. It is read.
                In it was written, “that as many lots were to be thrown into the urn as there were
                names returned; that he whose name was drawn was to have the priesthood.” He then,

                there then anything necessary except that three lots should be put in, and one drawn
                out?” “Nothing.” He orders three lots to be put in, on all of which was written the

              <p>At Cephalaedium there is a regular month, in which the pontifex is bound to be
                appointed. A man of the name of Artemo, surnamed Climachias, was desirous of that
                honour a man of sufficient riches to be sure, and of noble family; but he could not
                possibly have been appointed if a man of the name of Herodotus had been present. For

                Herodotus when he was present, (a thing which he was not anxious for, and which
                Climachias was very eager to avoid,) contrives, (I have said before, there is no one

                they sometimes make a month longer by a day or by two days. And when he heard of

                the day which, as one may say, ought to have been the thirteenth of January, became
                the first of March. And that is done in spite of the remonstrances and indignation

                of the man who kept such a fellow about him, especially in that employment and

                For, as for Verres himself, he was only a man of a covetousness ever open-mouthed,
                and ever threatening, but he had no ingenuity, no resources; so that, in whatever he

                converse with, to tamper with every one's foes, and every one's enemies; to know the
                circumstances of every trial on both sides; to ascertain men's inclinations, and
                power, and resources; where it was necessary to strike terror; where it was
                desirable to hold out hope. Every accuser, every informer, he had in his power, if
                he wished to cause trouble to any one, he did it without any difficulty. All

                exacted (for this, forsooth, was permitted by the laws) from each censor, to be paid
                down for the praetors statue. There were appointed a hundred and thirty censors.
                They gave one sum of money for the censorship contrary to the law; these thirty-nine
                thousand denarii they openly paid down for the statue, in compliance with the laws.
                First of all, what was all that money for? Secondly, why did the censors pay it to
                you for your statue? I suppose there is a regular order of censors, a college of
                them. They are a distinct class of men! Why, it is either cities in their capacity
                of communities, that confer these honours, or men according to their classes, as
                cultivators, as merchants, as shipowners. But why to censors rather than to aediles?
                Is it for any service that they have done? Therefore, will you confess that these
                things were begged of you,—for you will not dare to say they were purchased of
                you;—that you granted those magistracies to men out of favour, and not with a new to
                the interests of the republic? And when you confess this, will any one doubt that
                you incurred that unpopularity held hatred among the different tribes of that
                province, not out of ambition, nor for the sake of doing a kindness to any one, but
                with the object of procuring money?</p>

              <p>Therefore those censors did the same thing that those do in our republic, who have
                got offices by bribery; they took care to use their power so as to fill up again
                that gap in their property. The census was so taken, when you were praetor, that the
                affairs of no state whatever could be administered according to such a census. For
                they made a low return of the incomes of all the richest men, and exaggerated that
                of each poor man. And so in levying the taxes so heavy a burden was laid upon the
                common people, that even if the men themselves said nothing, the facts alone would
                discredit that census, as may easily be understood from the circumstances
                themselves. <milestone n="56" unit="chapter"/><milestone unit="Para"/> For Lucius

                the sake of prosecuting my injuries, became on a sudden after the arrival of
                Letilius not only the friend of Verres, but even his relative; because he saw that
                that census could not possibly stand, ordered that former one to be attended to
                which had been when that most gallant and upright man, Sextus Peducaeus, was
                praetor. For at that time there were censors made according to the laws, elected by
                their cities, in whose case, if they did anything wrong, punishments were appointed
                by the law. </p>

            <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="139" resp="perseus">
              <p> But when you were praetor, how could the censor either fear the law, by which he
                was not bound, since he had not been created by the law; or fear your reproof for
                having sold what he had bought of you? Let Metellus now detain my witnesses—let him
                compel others to praise him, as he has attempted in many instances; only let him do
                what he is doing. For whoever was treated by any one with such insult, with so much
                ignominy? Every fifth year a census is taken of all <placeName key="tgn,7003122"

                years had elapsed in your praetorship, a census was taken again. The next year
                Lucius Metellus forbids any mention to be made of your census; he says that censors
                must be created afresh; and in the meantime he orders the census of Peducaeus to be
                attended to. If an enemy of yours had done this to you, although the province would
                have borne it with great equanimity, still it would have seemed the severe decision
                of an enemy. A new friend, a voluntary relation did it. For he could not do
                otherwise, if he wished to retain the province in its allegiance, if he wished to
                live himself in safety in the province.</p>

                It will be spent, you will say. Let us, forsooth, wait for the recurrence of that
                regular five years. If in this interval he has not spent it then at last we will
                impeach him for embezzlement in the article of statues. He is brought before the

                thousand <foreign xml:lang="la">sesterces</foreign> have been taken on this one

                Centuripa, and had taken this money from them; there would have been no doubt, I

                which case it is exceedingly easy to form an opinion of their inclination. Did the
                Sicilians also contribute against their will? It is not probable. In truth it is
                evident that Caius Verres so conducted himself during his praetorship in <placeName

                both the Sicilians and the Romans, he considered rather his duty to our allies, than
                his ambition, which might have prompted him to gratify the citizens. And therefore I
                saw him called in an inscription at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse"
                  >Syracuse</placeName>, not only the patron of that island, but also the saviour of
                it. What a great expression is this! so great that it cannot be expressed by any
                single Latin word. He in truth is a saviour, who has given salvation. In his name
                days of festival are kept—that fine Verrean festival—not as if it was the festival
                of Marcellus, but instead of the Marcellean festival, which they abolished at his
                command. His triumphal arch is in the forum at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse"
                  >Syracuse</placeName>, on which his son stands, naked; and he himself from
                horseback looks down on the province which has been stripped bare by himself. His
                statues are in every place; which seem to show this, that he very nearly erected as
                many statues at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> as he had
                taken away from it. And even at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> we

                appear to do so according to their usual custom, rather than because of your
                deserts. When these men make a public complaint of your actions, do they not show

                against you, and have entreated me to undertake this cause, and the advocacy of
                their safety; since, though they were forbidden to come by the praetor, and hindered
                by four quaestors, they still have thought every one's threats and every danger
                insignificant, in comparison with their safety; since at the former pleading they
                gave their evidence so earnestly and so bitterly, that Hortensius said that Artemo,
                the deputy of Centuripa, end the witness authorized by the public council there, was

                his eloquence, was appointed by his fellow-citizens as their deputy in order that he

                that story about the statues, if I had not seen them myself uprooted and lying on

                they did not touch his statue which was among them in the most frequented place in
                their city. Perhaps there might seem some inconsistency in preserving the effigy and
                image of the man, when they were striving to overthrow the man himself: but still I
                saw, when I was among them, that they had a religious feeling in those matters
                handed down to them from their ancestors, and that they argued in this way;—that as
                to the statue, they regarded the period when it had been erected; but as to the man,

                Leontini, even in that miserable and desolate city, his statue in the gymnasium was
                thrown down. For why should I speak of the Syracusans, when that act was not a

                place of the whole city; before Serapis himself, in the very entrance and vestibule

                truth I might; I should relate that ten thousand of those citizens, the bravest and
                most faithful of our allies,—that every one of the whole people resolved, that there
                ought to be no monument of that man in their city. I should say this if Metellus had

              <p> I should now wish to ask of Metellus himself, whether by his power and authority
                he has at all weakened my speech? I think the very same language is still
                appropriate. For, even if the statues were ever so much thrown down, I could not
                show them to you on the ground. This only statement could I use, that so wise a city
                had decided that the statues of Caius Verres ought to be demolished. And this
                argument Metellus has not taken from me. He has even given me this additional one;
                he has enabled me to complain, if I thought fit, that authority is exercised over
                our friends and allies with so much injustice, that, even in the services they do
                people, they are not allowed to use their own unbiased judgment; he has enabled me
                to entreat you to form your conjectures, how you suppose Lucius Metellus behaved to
                me in those matters in which he was able to injure me, when he behaved with such
                palpable partiality in this one in which he could be no hindrance to me. But I am
                not angry with Metellus, nor do I wish to rob him of his excuse which he puts forth
                to every one, that he did nothing spitefully nor with any especial design.</p>

                Lucius Carpinatius, who both for the sake of his own profit, and perhaps because he
                thought it for the interest of his partners, cultivated the favour of Verres to the
                neglect of everything else. He, while he was attending the praetor about all the
                markets, and never leaving him, had got into such familiarity with, and aptitude at
                the practice of selling Verres's decrees and decisions, and managing his other
                concerns, that he was considered almost a second Timarchides. </p>

              <p> He was in one respect still more important; because he also lent money at usury to
                those who were purchasing anything of the praetor. And this usury, O judges, was
                such that even the profit from the other transactions was inferior to the gain
                obtained by it. For the money which he entered as paid to those with whom he was
                dealing, he entered also under the name of Verres's secretary, or of Timarchides, or
                even under Verres's own name, as received from them. And besides that, he lent other
                large sums belonging to Verres, of which he made no entry at all, in his own name.

                often written letters to the shareholders about his unjust actions. But Canuleius,
                who had an agency at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, in the
                harbour, had also written accounts to his shareholders of many of Verres's
                robberies, giving instances, especially, concerning things which had been exported
                from <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> without paying the
                harbour dues. But the same company was farming both the harbour dues and the taxes
                on pasture land. And thus it happened that there were many things which we could
                state and produce against Verres from the letters of that company. </p>

                by the greatest intimacy, and also by community of interests, afterwards sent
                frequent letters to his partners, speaking of his exceeding kindness, and of his
                services to their common property. And in truth, as he was used to do and to decree
                everything which Carpinatius requested him, Carpinatius also began to write still
                more flaming accounts to his shareholders, in order, if possible, utterly to efface
                the recollection of all that he had written before. But at last, when Verres was
                departing, he sent letters to them, to beg them to go out in crowds to meet him and
                to give him thanks; and to promise zealously that they would do whatever he desired
                them. And the shareholders did so, according to the old custom of farmers; not
                because they thought him deserving of any honour, but because they thought it was
                for their own interest to be thought to remember kindness, and to be grateful for
                it. They expressed their thanks to him, and said that Carpinatius had often sent
                letters to them mentioning his good offices.</p>

                the way, I made a calculation of the years that that man had been in <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>; then I inquired (what was exceedingly easy
                to discover) who during those years had been the collectors of that company,—in
                whose care the records had been. For I was aware that it was the custom of the
                collectors who kept the records, when they gave them up to the new collector, to
                retain copies of the documents themselves. And therefore I went in the first place
                to Lucius Vibius, a Roman knight, a man of the highest consideration, who, I
                ascertained, had been collector that very year about which I particularly had to
                inquire. I came upon the man unexpectedly when he was thinking of other things. I
                investigated what I could, and inquired into everything. I found only two small
                books, which had been sent by Lucius Canuleius to the shareholders from the harbour
                at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>; in which there was
                entered an account of many months, and of things exported in Verres's name without
                having paid harbour dues. These I sealed up immediately.</p>

                may seem to be, will at all events be undeniable; and by this you will be able to
                form your conjectures as to the rest. Read for me, I beg, this first book, and then
                the other. [The books of Canuleius are read.] I do not ask now whence you got those
                four hundred jars of honey, or such quantities of Maltese cloth, or fifty cushions

                these things; but, how you could want such a quantity of them, that I do ask. I say
                nothing about the honey; but what could you want with so many Maltese garments? as
                if you were going to dress all your friends' wives;—or with so many sofa cushions?

                holding the documents actually in our hands, we see on a sudden erasures of such a
                sort as to appear to be fresh wounds inflicted on papers. Immediately, having a
                suspicion of something wrong, we bent our eyes and attention on the names
                themselves. Money was entered as having been received from Caius Verrutius the son
                of Caius, in such a way that the letters had been let stand down to the second R,
                all the rest was an erasure. A second, a third, a fourth—there were a great many
                names in the same state. As the matter was plain, so also was the abominable and
                scandalous worthlessness of the accounts. We began to inquire of Carpinatius who
                that Verrutius was, with whom he had such extensive pecuniary dealings. The man
                began to hesitate, to look away, to colour. Because there is a provision made by law

                as clear and as completely proved as possible, I summon Carpinatius before the
                tribunal of Metellus and produce the accounts of the company in the forum. There is
                a great rush of people to the place; and as the partnership existing between
                Carpinatius and that praetor, and his usury, were well known, all people were

              <p> I bring the matter before Metellus; I state to him that I have seen the accounts
                of the shareholders, that in these there is a long account of one Caius Verrutius
                made up of many items, and that I saw, by a computation of the years and months,
                that this Verrutius had had no account at all with Carpinatius, either before the
                arrival of Caius Verres, or after his departure. I demand that Carpinatius shall
                give me an answer who that Verrutius is; whether he is a merchant, or a broker, or
                an agriculturist, or a grazier; whether he is in <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>, or whether he has now left it. All who were in the court

                  >Sicily</placeName> of the name of Verrutius. I began to press the man to answer
                me who he was, where he was, whence he came; why the servant of the company who made
                up the accounts always made a blunder in the name of Verrutius at the same place?

                all the world. And so I leave him in the court, dumb from fear and the consciousness

                direction by a mention of his bravery? But a man more inactive, more lazy, one who
                is more a man among women, a debauched woman among men, cannot be found.—But his
                manners are affable. Who is more obstinate more rude? more arrogant?—But still all

                with the impudence of another they might lose their own characters for virtue. For

                territory, either by conquest, or by <foreign xml:lang="la">deditio</foreign>, had
                become the property of the state. They consisted as the name denotes, of a tithe or
                tenth of the produce of the soil levied upon the cultivators (<foreign xml:lang="la"
                  >aratores</foreign>) or occupiers (<foreign xml:lang="la">possessores</foreign>)
                of the lands, which from being subject to this payment were called <foreign

                  n="Cic. Ver. 2.3.1">c. Verr. act. ii. lib. iii.</bibl>.) that Romans, on reducing
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> to a province, allowed to the old
                inhabitants a continuance of their ancient rights, and that, with some few
                exceptions, the territory of all the states was subjected, as formerly, to the
                payment of a tithe on corn, wine, oil, and the <foreign xml:lang="la">fruges

                time of paying these tithes to the <foreign xml:lang="la">decumani</foreign> should
                ‘be and continue’ as settled by the law of king Hiero (<foreign xml:lang="la">Lex
                  Hieronica</foreign>), which enacted severe penalties against any <foreign

                  <foreign xml:lang="la">decumani</foreign> who exacted more than their tenth . . .
                The name of <foreign xml:lang="la">decumani</foreign> was also applied to the
                farmers of these tributes, who purchased them from the state, and then collected
                them on their own account.” In fact “the revenues which <placeName
                  key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> derived from conquered countries, consisting
                chiefly of tolls, tithes, harbour duties, &amp;c.... were chiefly let out, or, as
                the Romans expressed it, sold by the censors in <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
                  >Rome</placeName> itself to the highest bidders, (<bibl n="Cic. Ver. 2.3.7">Cic.
                  c. Verr. ii. iii. 7.</bibl>)... The tithes raised in the province of <placeName

                oil, and garden produce, were not sold at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"

                  >Sicily</placeName> itself, according to a practice established by Hiero (<bibl

                  >33</bibl>). The persons who undertook the farming of the public revenue, of
                course, belonged to the wealthiest Romans. and down to the end of the republic, as
                well as during the earlier part of the empire, the farming of the public revenues
                was almost exclusively in the hands of the <foreign xml:lang="la">equites</foreign>,
                whence the words <foreign xml:lang="la">equites</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la"
                  >publicani</foreign> are sometimes used as synonymous, (<bibl n="Cic. Ver. 1.1.51"
                  >Cic. c. Verr. i. 51, 52</bibl>, 71.) . . . The <foreign xml:lang="la"
                  >publicani</foreign> had to give security to the state for the sum at which they
                bought one or more branches of revenue in a province; and as no one person was rich
                enough to give sufficient security, a number of <foreign xml:lang="la"
                  >equites</foreign> generally united together and formed a company (<foreign

                  <foreign xml:lang="la">corpus</foreign> ) which was recognised by the state, and
                by which they were enabled to carry on their undertakings on a large scale. The
                shares which each partner in such a company took in the business were called

              <p>Verres had broken the law which forbade a governor of a province to hold shares in
                a company which farmed the revenue; and as he had therefore a personal interest in
                increasing the taxes, he committed unexampled acts of extortion himself, and
                protected those who committed similar act. And in many other respects he had
                plundered the cultivators of the public domain, whom I have called in this
                translation “agriculturists,” not using the word “farmers,” by which word I have

                everything less uncontrolled, and he thought, too, that his way of life was remarked
                by more people than he liked. And he, fortified as he was by the protection of his
                own genius and fortune, was yet hampered by this anxiety which he had brought upon

                peace, to the republic, were so careful to defend the Sicilians and to retain them
                in their allegiance, that they not only imposed no new tax upon their lands, but did
                not even alter the law of putting up for sale the contracts of the farmers of the
                tenths, or the time or place of selling them; so that they were to put them up for
                sale at the regular time of year, at the same place, in <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>,—in short, in every respect as the law of Hiero directed; they
                permitted them still to manage their own affairs, and were not willing that their
                minds should be disturbed even by a new name to a law, much less by an actual new
                law. </p>

                only the laws of that king who was very dear to the Sicilians, but his name also
                remained in force among them. This law the Sicilians always used before Verres was
                praetor. He first dared to root up and alter the established usages of them all,
                their customs which had been handed down to them from their ancestors, the

                not according to the evidence of those who produced the will, but according to
                theirs who said that a will had been made. And I do know too that those new
                practices, first brought forward and invented by you, were a very great profit to
                you. I recollect, moreover, that you also abrogated and altered the laws of the
                censors about the keeping the public buildings in repair; so that he might not take
                the contract to whom the care of the building belonged; so that his guardians and

                is it that part where you take care of the interests of the Sicilians, and show
                regard for the miserable cultivators? For you announce in your edict, that you will
                condemn the collector in eightfold damages, if he has taken more than was due to
                him. I do not wish anything to be passed over. Read this also which he requires;

              <p> And that you may understand what sort of decisions are obtained in actions for the
                eightfold penalty, and what sort of judges those selected from that man's retinue
                are considered to be, listen to this. Do you think that any collector, when this
                licence was allowed him of taking from the cultivator whatever he claimed, ever did
                demand more than was due? Consider yourselves in your own minds, whether you think
                any one ever did so, especially when it might have happened, not solely through
                covetousness, but even though ignorance. Many must have done so. But I say that all
                extorted more, and a great deal more, than the proper tenths. Tell me of one man, in
                the whole three years of your praetorship, who was condemned in the eightfold
                penalty. Condemned, indeed! Tell me of one man who was ever prosecuted according to
                your edict. There was not, in fact, one cultivator who was able to complain that
                injustice had been done to him; not one collector who claimed one grain more as due
                to him than really was due. Far from that. Apronius seized and carried off whatever
                he chose from every one. In every district the cultivators, harassed and plundered
                as they were, were complaining, and yet no instance of a trial can be found. </p>

                man, not seek to recover the eightfold penalty, which had most unquestionably been
                incurred? What is the cause, what is the reason? That reason alone, O judges, which
                you see,—because they knew they should come off at the trial defrauded and
                ridiculed. In truth, what sort of triad must that be, when three of the profligate
                and abandoned retinue of Verres sat on the tribunal under the name of judges?—slaves
                of Verres, not inherited by him from his father, but recommended to him by his

                left him by Apronius,—that even his other property was seized; that he himself had
                been driven away with blows. Those admirable men would lay their heads together,
                they would chat to one another about revels and harlots, if they could catch any
                when leaving the praetor. The cause would seem to be properly heard: Apronius would
                have risen, full of his new dignity as a knight; not like a collector all over dirt
                and dust, but reeking with perfumes, languid with the lateness of the last night's
                drinking party, with his first motion, and with his breath he would have filled the
                whole place with the odour of wine, of perfume, and of his person. He would have
                said, what he repeatedly has said, that he had bought, not the tenths, but the
                property and fortunes of the cultivators; that he, Apronius, was not a collector,
                but a second Verres,—the absolute lord and master of those men. And when he had said
                this, those admirable men of Verres's train, the judges, would deliberate, not about
                acquitting Apronius, but they would inquire how they could condemn the cultivator
                himself to pay damages to Apronius. </p>

                eightfold penalty? Even if in truth you were to give power to the cultivator, not
                only to challenge his judges, but even to pick them out of the whole body of the
                Syracusan assembly, (a body of most eminent and honourable men,) still no one could

                same man who has announced in his edict that he will allow a trial against the
                collectors, in which they shall be liable to an eightfold penalty, had it also set
                down in his edict, that he would grant a similar trial against the cultivators, in
                which they should be liable to a fourfold penalty. Who now dares to say that this
                man was unfavourably disposed or hostile to the cultivators? How much more lenient

                that, when the money has been exacted from the cultivator, still there will be
                behind a fear of the court of justice, to prevent him from stirring himself. If you
                wish to exact money from me by process of law, remove the Sicilian magistrate. If
                you employ this violence, what need is there of a process of law? Moreover, who will

                which arise between the cultivator and the collector, he will assign judges, if
                either party wishes it. In the first place, what dispute can there be when he who
                ought to make a claim, makes a seizure instead? and when he seizes, not as much as
                is due, but as much as he chooses? and when he, whose property is seized, cannot
                possibly recover his own by a suit at law? In the second place, this dirty fellow
                wants even in this to seem cunning and wily; for he frames his edict in these
                words—“If either wishes it, I will assign judges.” How neatly does he think he is

              <p> What next? What sort of edicts are those which he issued to meet particular
                occasions, at the suggestion of Apronius? When Quintus Septitius, a most honourable
                man, and a Roman knight, resisted Apronius, and declared that he would not pay more
                than a tenth, a sudden special edict makes its appearance, that no one is to remove
                his corn from the threshing-floor before he has settled the demands of the
                collector. Septitius put up with this injustice also, and allowed his corn to be
                damaged by the rain, while remaining on the threshing-floor, when on a sudden that
                most fruitful and profitable edict comes out, that every one was to have his tenths
                delivered at the water-side before the first of August. </p>

            <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37" resp="perseus">
              <p> By this edict, it was not the Sicilians, (for he had already sufficiently crushed
                and ruined them by his previous edicts,) but all those Roman knights who had fancied
                that they could preserve their rights against Apronius, excellent men, and highly
                esteemed by other praetors, who were delivered bound hand and foot into the power of
                Apronius. For just listen and see what sort of edicts these are. “A man,” says he,
                “is not to remove his corn from the threshing-floor, unless he has settled all
                demands.” This is a sufficiently strong inducement to making unfair demands; for I
                had rather give too much, than not remove my corn from the threshing-floor at the
                proper time. But that violence does not affect Septitius, and some others like
                Septitius, who say, “I will rather not remove my corn, than submit to an
                extortionate demand.” To these then the second edict is opposed. “You must have
                delivered it by the first of August.” I will deliver it then.—“Unless you have
                settled the demands, you shall not remove it.” So the fixing of the day for
                delivering it at the waterside, compelled the man to remove his corn from the
                threshing floor. And the prohibition to remove, unless the demand were settled, made
                the settlement compulsory and not voluntary. </p>

              <p> But what follows is not only contrary to the law of Hiero, not only contrary to
                the customs of all former praetors, but even contrary to all the rights of the
                Sicilians, which they have as granted them by the senate and people of <placeName

                security to appear in any courts of justice but their own. Verres made a regulation

                which the collector might choose. So that in this way also gain might accrue to

                making false accusations against the wretched cultivators. Although that device for
                false accusation was also contrived with singular cunning, when he ordered that the
                cultivators should make a return of their acres, as to what they were sown with. And
                this had not only great power in causing most iniquitous claims to be submitted to,
                as we shall show hereafter, and that too without any advantage to the republic, but
                at the same time it gave a great handle to false accusations, which all men were

                could there be in doing that?) but still it opened a pretext for demanding a trial
                because the cultivator had not made his return in the terms of the edict. And you

                ever did before, in which he exhorts and entreats the Sicilians to plough and sow
                their land for the service of the Roman people. He begs this some time before his
                arrival, and at the same time declares that he will sell the tenths according to the
                law of Hiero; that is to say, that in the whole business of the tenths he will do
                nothing like that man. And he writes this, not from being impelled by any
                covetousness to send letters into the province before his time, but out of prudence,
                lest, if the seed-time passed, we should have not a single grain of corn in the

                And such a thing never yet took place in the instance of any one, as for a man to be
                openly accused by those people over whose property and families he had supreme
                dominion and power. So great was the effect of his injuries, that men preferred to

              <p> We have heard this for a long time, O judges. I say that there is not one of you
                who has not often heard that the collectors of the tenths were that mans partners. I
                do not think that anything else has been said against him falsely by those who think
                ill of him but this. For they are to be considered partners of a man, with whom the
                gains of a business are shared. But I say that the whole of these gains, and the
                whole of the fortunes of the cultivators, went to Verres alone. I say that Apronius,
                and those slaves of Venus, who were quite a new class of farmers first heard of in
                his praetorship! and the other collectors, were only agents of that one man's gains,

                Chiefly, I think, by this fact, that he had put forth an unjust and unprecedented
                law. For who ever attempted to change all the rights of people, and the customs of
                all men, getting great blame for so doing, except for some gain? I will proceed and
                carry this matter further. You sold the tenths according to an unjust law, in order
                to sell them for more money. Why, when the tenths were now knocked down and
                sold,—when nothing could now be added to their sum total, but much might be to your
                own gains,—why did new edicts appear, made on a sudden and to meet an emergency? For
                I say, that in your third year you issued edicts, that a collector might summon a
                man before the court anywhere he liked; that the cultivator might not remove his
                corn from the threshing-floor, before he had settled the claims of the collector;
                that they should have the tenths delivered at the water-side before the first of
                August. All these edicts, I say, you issued after the tenths had been sold. But if
                you had issued them for the sake of the republic, notice would have been given of
                them at the time of selling; because you were acting with a view to your own
                interest, you, being prompted by your love of gain and by the emergency, repaired

                danger to your position as a free man, and to your fortunes, which you were

                  key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> with many others who had been driven away by
                that man. He then contrived that the collector should assert that Nympho had not

                mentioned in the edict In the penalty of all the corn which was on his

                thought that they would not be vigorous in avenging themselves, and that you would
                treat their oppression lightly. </p>

              <p> Be it so. He adopted a false opinion about them, and a very injurious one about

                attentive to the Roman citizens; he favoured them; he was wholly devoted to securing
                their good-will and favour? He attentive to the Roman citizens? There were no men to
                whom he was more severe or more hostile. I say nothing of chains, of imprisonment,
                of scourgings, of executions. I say nothing even of that cross which he wished to be
                a witness to the Roman citizens of his humanity and benevolence to them. I say
                nothing, I say, of all this, and I put all this off to another opportunity. I am

                industry, the highest popularity. Know, O judges, that a Roman knight was kept two

                in infamy, practiced in accommodating himself to all Verres's vices and lusts; that
                he was kept and detained by the guards of Apronius two days in the forum at
                Leontini, and not released till he had agreed to submit to his terms. </p>

              <p> For why, O judges, should I speak of Quintus Lollius, a Roman knight of tried
                probity and honour? (the matter which I am going to mention is clear, notorious, and
                undoubted throughout all <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>;)—who, as
                he was a cultivator of the domain in the district of <placeName key="tgn,7003867"
                  >Aetna</placeName>, and as his farm belonged to Apronius's district as well as the
                rest, relying on the ancient authority and influence of the equestrian order,
                declared that he would not pay the collectors more than was due from him to them.
                His words are reported to Apronius. He laughed, and marveled that Lollius had heard
                nothing of Matrinius or of his other actions. He sends his slaves of Venus to the
                man. Remark this also, that a collector had officers appointed to attend him by the
                praetor; and see if this is a slight argument that he abused the name of the
                collectors to purposes of his own gain. Lollius is brought before Apronius by the
                slaves of Venus, and dragged along, at a convenient moment, when Apronius had just
                returned from the palaestra, and was lying on a couch which he had spread in the
                forum of Aetna Lollius is placed in the middle of that seemly banquet of gladiators.

                I heard them commonly talked about, if the old man had not himself told them to me
                in the most solemn manner, when he was with tears expressing his thanks to me and to
                the willingness with which I had undertaken this accusation. A Roman knight, I say,
                nearly ninety years old, is placed in the middle of Apronius's banquet, while
                Apronius in the meantime was rubbing his head and face with ointment. “What is this,
                Lollius,” says he; “cannot you behave properly, unless you are compelled by severe
                measures?” What was the man to do? should he hold his tongue, or answer him? In
                truth he, a man of that bright character, and that age, did not know what to do.
                Meantime Apronius called for supper and wine; and his slaves, who were of no better
                manners than their master, and were born of the same class and in the same rank of
                life, brought these things before the eyes of Lollius. The guests began to laugh,
                Apronius himself roared; unless, perchance, you suppose that he did not laugh in the
                midst of wine and feasting, who even now at the time of his danger and ruin cannot
                suppress his laughter. Not to detain you too long; know, O judges, that Quintus
                Lollius, under the compulsion of these insults, came into the terms and conditions
                of Apronius. </p>

                could not keep to himself his intentions respecting Verres. He, in truth, had no
                doubt that the man who, under the prompting of a mere love of justice, had already
                accused another, would be ready as an accuser for him on his arrival, when he was

                immense sum, so that when he had got his profit, he might depart. He said that he
                did not wish to have any trouble, nut that, when he had got his money, he would
                depart as soon as possible to some other city. All the Sicilians are not

                most just man, tried to strike his old terror into the wretched Agyrians; he
                threatened that he would appoint their judges out of his own retinue. The Agyrians,

                to his unpopularity and infamy, rather than accede to his conditions and terms. They
                asked what formula would be given to the judges on which to try them? He answered,
                “If it appeared that they had acted contrary to the edict,” on which formula he said
                that he should pronounce judgment. They preferred trying the question according to a
                most unjust formula, and with most profligate judges, rather than come to any
                settlement with him of their own accord. He sent Timarchides privately to them, to
                warn them, if they were wise, to settle the matter. They refused. “What, then, will

                loud, in the hearing of every one, “Whoever is condemned, shall be beaten to death
                with rods.” On this they began with tears to beg and entreat him to be allowed to

                according to the edict. Suppose he declared more was due than the land produced?
                Just so. How could that be? The magistrates were bound, according to his own edict,
                to compel the payment. Well, but the cultivators could recover. Yes, but Artemidorus
                was the judge. What next? What happened if the cultivator had given less than
                Apronius had demanded? A prosecution of the cultivator to recover a fourfold
                penalty. Before judges taken from what body? From that admirable retinue of most
                honourable men in attendance on the praetor. What more? I say that you returned less

                namely, your violation of the edict. Out of what class? Out of the same retinue.
                What will be the end of it? If you are convicted, (and what doubt can there be about
                a conviction with those judges?) you must be beaten to death with rods. When these
                are the rules, these the conditions, will there be any one so foolish as to think

                cultivator? Who does not perceive that that fellow considered as his own gain and
                plunder the property and possessions and fortunes of the cultivators? From fear of

                You order them to take the tenths; to give Apronius a compliment,—thirty-three
                thousand <foreign xml:lang="la">medimni</foreign> of wheat. What is this? One city
                is compelled by the command of the praetor to give to the Roman people out of one
                district almost food enough to support it for a month. Did you sell the tenths at a
                high price, when such a compliment was given to the collector? In truth, if you had
                inquired carefully into the proper price, then when you were selling them, they
                would rather have given ten thousand <foreign xml:lang="la">medimni</foreign> more

                afterwards. It seems a great booty. Listen to what follows, and remark it carefully,
                so as to be the less surprised that the Sicilians, being compelled by their

                Tertia was greater with him than that of Pippa, or of all the other women, and I had

              <p> But as I have said, the case of the men of <placeName key="tgn,7003867"
                  >Aetna</placeName> is clear enough, and established both by public and by private
                documents. The task allotted to my diligence is to be required of me rather in the
                district of Leontini, for this reason, because the Leontini themselves have not
                assisted me much by their public authority. Nor, in truth, while that fellow was
                praetor, did these injuries of the farmers very greatly affect them, or rather, I
                might say, they did them good. This may, perhaps, appear a marvellous or even an
                incredible thing to you, that in such general distress of the cultivators of the
                soil, the Leontini, who were the heads of the corn interest, should have been free
                from injury and calamity. This is the reason, O judges, that in the territory of
                Leontini, no one of the Leontini, with the exception of the single family of
                Mnasistratus, occupies any land. And so, O judges, you shall hear the evidence of
                Mnasistratus, a most honest and virtuous man. Do not expect to hear any others of
                the Leontini, whom not only Apronius, but whom even a tempest in their fields could
                not injure. They in truth not only suffered no inconvenience, but even in the rapine
                of Apronius they found gain and advantage. </p>

              <p> Wherefore, since the city and embassy of the Leontini has failed me on account of
                the cause which I have mentioned, I must devise a plan and contrive a way for myself
                by which I may get at the gain of Apronius, or even at his enormous and wicked
                booty. The tenths of the Leontini territory were sold in the third year of Verres's
                praetorship for thirty-six thousand <foreign xml:lang="la">medimni</foreign> of
                wheat; that is, for two hundred and twenty-six thousand <foreign xml:lang="la"
                  >modii</foreign> of wheat. A great price, O judges, a great price; and I cannot
                deny it. Therefore it is certain that there must have been a loss, or at all events
                not a great gain to the farmers. For this very often happens to men who have taken a
                contract at a high rate. </p>

                much gain and so much iniquity, that you made such immense profit by dishonest

              <p> How then, O judges, am I to arrive at this knowledge of how much profit was made?
                Not from the accounts of Apronius, for when I sought for them, I could not find
                them, and when I brought him into court, I made him deny that he kept any accounts
                at all. If he was telling lies, why did he remove them out of the way, if they were
                likely to do you no harm? If he really had kept any accounts at all, does not that
                alone prove plainly enough, that it was not his own business that he was conducting?
                For it is a quality of tenths, that they cannot be managed without many papers; for
                it is necessary to keep an account of, and to set down in books the names of all the
                cultivators, and with each name the amount of their tenth. All the cultivators made
                returns of their acres according to your command and regulation; I do not believe
                that any one made a return of a smaller quantity than he had in cultivation, when
                there were so many crosses, so many penalties, so many judges of that retinue before
                his eyes. On an acre of Leontini ground about a <foreign xml:lang="la"
                  >medimnus</foreign> of wheat is usually sown, according to the regular and
                constant allowance of seed. The land returns about eightfold on a fair average, but
                in an extraordinarily favourable season, about tenfold. And whenever that is the
                case, it then happens that the tenth is just the same quantity as was sown; that is
                to say, as many acres as are sown, so many <foreign xml:lang="la">medimni</foreign>
                are due. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="113" resp="perseus">
              <p> As this was the case, I say first of all, that the tenths of the territory of
                Leontini were sold for many more thousand <foreign xml:lang="la">medimni</foreign>
                than there were thousands of acres sown in the district of Leontini. But if it was
                impossible for them to produce more than ten <foreign xml:lang="la"
                  >medimni</foreign> on an acre, and if it was fair that a <foreign xml:lang="la"
                  >medimnus</foreign> should be paid out of each acre liable to the payment of
                tenths, when the land produced a tenfold crop, which however very seldom happened,
                what was the calculation of the farmer if indeed it was the tenths of the cultivator
                that were being sold, and no his whole property, when he bought the tenths for many
                more <foreign xml:lang="la">medimni</foreign> than there had been acres sown? In the
                Lecutini district the list and return made of acres is not more than thirty

                sold for thirty-six thousand <foreign xml:lang="la">medimni</foreign>. Did Apronius
                make a blunder, or rather was he mad? Yes, he would indeed have been mad if it had
                been lawful for the cultivators to give only what was due from them, and had not
                rather been compulsory on them to give whatever Apronius commanded. </p>

                the produce amounted to a tenfold crop, no one paid less than three tenths. And
                indeed this was begged as a favour from Apronius, that they might be allowed to
                compound at three <foreign xml:lang="la">medimni</foreign> an acre. For, as four and
                even five were exacted from many people, and as many had not only not a grain of
                corn, but not even a wisp of straw left out of all their crop and after all their

                agriculturists in the Leontini district, assembled in one place. They sent as a
                delegate to Apronius, Andron of Centuripa, a man among the first of his state for
                honour and nobility, (the same man whom now the city of Centuripa has sent to this
                trial as a deputy and as a witness,) in order that he might plead with him the cause
                of the cultivators of the soil, and beg of him not to exact of the Centuripan
                cultivators more than three <foreign xml:lang="la">medimni</foreign> for each acre.

              <p> This request was with difficulty obtained from Apronius, as a most excessive

                what was obtained, forsooth, that they might be allowed to pay three tenths instead
                of one. But if your own interest had not been at stake in the matter, O Verres, they
                would rather have entreated you not to be made to pay more than one tenth, than have
                begged of a promise not to be made to pay more than three. Now, that at the present

                thousand <foreign xml:lang="la">modii</foreign> of wheat? If you did so according to
                law, it was a fine price; if your caprice was the law, it was a low price; if you

                wished to be very liberal, he would have used a more heaped up measure, as men
                formerly used to do in the matter of the tenths, when they were sold by fair laws,
                and on fair terms. He gave the money. Where did he get it? from his corn? As if,
                while you were praetor, he had anything to sell. Something, then, must be taken from
                his principal, in order to add this pecuniary gratuity for Apronius to all the

                Unwillingly? How, then, were they compelled to do so, except by violence and
                ill-treatment? Again; that man, that most senseless man, in the selling of the
                tenths, caused additional sums to be added to every tenth. It was not much; he added
                two or three thousand <foreign xml:lang="la">sesterces</foreign>. In the three years

                fortunes of the cultivators, not for the cake of the Roman people, but with a view
                to your own gain. As if any steward, from a farm which had been used to produce ten
                thousand <foreign xml:lang="la">sesterces</foreign>, having cut down and sold the
                trees, having taken away the buildings and the stock, and having driven off all the
                cattle, sent his master twenty thousand <foreign xml:lang="la">sesterces</foreign>
                instead of ten, and made a hundred thousand more for himself. At first the master,
                not knowing the injury that had been done to him, would be glad, and be delighted
                with his steward, because he had got so much more profit out of the farm; but
                afterwards, when he heard that all those things on which the profit and cultivation
                of his farm depends have been removed and sold, he would punish his steward with the
                greatest severity, and think himself very ill used. So also, the Roman people, when
                it hears that Caius Verres has sold the tenths for more than that most innocent man,
                Caius Sacerdos, whom he succeeded, thinks that it has got a good steward and
                guardian over its lands and crops; but when it finds out that he has sold all the
                stock of the cultivators, all the resources of the revenue, and has destroyed all
                the hopes of their posterity by his avarice,—that he has devastated and drained the
                allotments and the Lands subject to tribute,—that he has made himself most enormous

              <p> By what, then, can this be made evident? Chiefly by this fact, that the land of
                the province of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> liable to the
                payment of tenths is deserted through the avarice of that man. Nor does it happen
                only that those who have remained on their lands are now cultivating a smaller
                number of acres, but also very many rich men, farmers on a large scale, and skillful
                men, have deserted large and productive farms, and abandoned their whole allotments.
                That may be very easily ascertained from the public documents of the states; because
                according to the law of Hiero the number of cultivators is every year entered in the
                books by public authority before the magistrates. Read now how many cultivators of
                the Leontine district there were when Verres took the government. Eighty-three. And
                how many made returns in his third year? Thirty-two. I see that there were fifty-one
                cultivators so entirely got rid of that they had no successors. How many cultivators
                were there of the district of Mutyca, when you arrived? Let us see from the public
                documents. A hundred and eighty-eight. How many in your third year? A hundred and
                one. That one district has to regret eighty-seven cultivators, owing to that man's
                ill-treatment, and to that extent our republic has to regret the loss of so many
                heads of families, and demands them back at his hand, since they are the real
                revenues of the Roman people. The district of Herbita had in his first year two
                hundred and fifty-seven cultivators; in his third, a hundred and twenty. From this
                region a hundred and thirty-seven heads of families have fled like banished men. The
                district of Agyrium—what men lived in that land! how honourable, how wealthy they
                were? —had two hundred and fifty cultivators in the first year of your praetorship.
                What had it in the third year? Eighty,—as you have heard the Agyrian deputies read

                I say that the cultivators have been driven away by that man's avarice: Metellus
                writes word that those who were left have been reassured by him. I say that the
                fields have been abandoned, and the allotments deserted: Metellus writes word that
                there is great penury among the cultivators. When he writes this, he shows that the
                allies and friends of the Roman people have been cast down, and driven off, and
                stripped of all their fortunes; and yet if any calamity had happened to these men by

                when it was not carelessness which delayed him from avenging it, but the
                consciousness of his wickedness and avarice that kept him in check. For the

                reputation,—one who was anxious to repel from himself all suspicion, and to deliver
                himself from infamy? <milestone n="61" unit="chapter"/><milestone unit="Para"/> He
                had been a common topic of conversation, of reproach, of abuse. A worthless and

                master had come before the courts, had come to trial; he, upright and innocent man
                that he was, had an opportunity, by punishing Apronius, of relieving himself from
                the most serious disgrace. What punishment does he devise? what penalty for
                Apronius? He compels Scandilius to pay to Apronius five thousand <foreign

                from what I then proved, that he had sold the tenths under a law quite novel, and,

              <p> You cannot by any means deny this, unless you are determined to deny everything.
                The business was transacted openly, in a full assembly, at <placeName

                you not see in what important and what evident acts you are detected. First of all,
                it is proved that that business and that booty was yours. For unless it was, why did
                you prefer that Acronius (who every one was saying was only managing your affairs in
                the matter of the tenths as your agent) should get the tenths of the Leontine
                district rather than Quintus Minucius? Secondly, that an enormous and immense profit
                was made by you. For if you would not have been influenced by thirty thousand
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">modii</foreign> of wheat, at all events Minucius would

                the slightest trouble. Thirdly, Minucius himself would never have wished to have
                them at such a price, if you had been selling the tenths according to the Law of
                Hiero; but because he saw that by your new edicts and most iniquitous resolutions he
                should get a good deal more than tenths, on that account he advanced higher. But
                Apronius had always even a good deal more permitted to him than you had announced in
                your edict. How much gain then can we suppose was made by him to whom everything was

                affecting his condition as a free citizen. The whole retinue of Metellus, grateful

                only prejudged the case of a man concerning whom he was unwilling that any previous
                decision should take place by means of judges, but even judged most severely and
                harshly respecting him. For, in the first place, if he thought that Apronius would
                be acquitted, there was no reason for his fearing any previous decision. In the
                second place, if Apronius were condemned, all men were likely to think that the
                cause of Verres was involved in his; this at all events Metellus did now decide, and
                he determined that their affairs and their causes were identical, since he
                determined that, if Apronius were condemned, it would be a prejudging of the case of
                Verres. And one fact is at the same time a proof of two things; both that the
                cultivators gave much more than they owed to Apronius because they were constrained
                by violence and fear; and also, that Apronius was transacting Verres's business in
                his own name, since Lucius Metellus determined that Apronius could not be condemned

                intolerable, that the abilities of that most excellent man, Lucius Metellus, should
                be laughed at, and despised and scorned by that runaway slave Timarchides. “If you
                have Vulteius with you, everything will be mere child's play to you.” Here
                Timarchides is greatly mistaken, in thinking either that Vulteius can be corrupted
                by money, or that Metellus is going to discharge the duties of his praetorship
                according to the will of any one man; but he is mistaken by forming his conjectures
                from his own experience. Because he saw that, through his own intervention and that
                of others, many men had been able to do whatever they pleased with Verres, without
                meeting with any difficulty, he thought that there were the same means of access to
                every one. You did very easily whatever you wanted with Verres, and found it as easy
                as child's play to do so, because you knew many of the kinds of play in which he
                indulged. “Metellus and Vulteius have been impressed with the idea that you have
                ruined the cultivators of the soil.” Who attributed the action to Apronius, when he
                had ruined any cultivator? or to Timarchides when he had taken money for assigning a
                trial, or making a decree, or giving any order, or remitting any thing? or to Sextus
                the lictor, when he, as executioner, had put an innocent man to death? No one. Every

                freedman and officer, one most intimate, and indeed connected with you and your

                being both certain, few in number, and important. It was Verres's duty according to
                a decree of the senate, and according to the law of Terentius and to the law of

                of the second tenths, the other the purchase of what was furnished in fair
                proportions by the different cities. Of corn derived from the second tenths the
                quantity would be as much as had been derived from the first tenths; of corn levied
                on the cities in this way there would be eight hundred thousand <foreign

                by a resolution of the collectors. Which way then shall I turn? Shall I leave
                unmentioned so infamous a business, a crime of such audacity and such shamelessness,
                on account of a dearth of witnesses or of documentary proofs? I will not do so, O

                accomplished man of the equestrian order, who is such a friend of and so closely
                connected with Verres, that, even if he were not an excellent man, still whatever he
                said against him would seem to have great weight; but who is so good a man that,

                believed. </p>

                such a thing,—who ever thought that such a thing could be done, as for a magistrate
                to venture to take money as interest from the farmers, though the senate had often
                assisted the farmers by remitting the interests due from them? Certainly that man

                Halesa. You will find no city more faithful to its duties, more rich in wealth, more
                influential in its authority. After that man had ordered it to furnish every year
                sixty thousand <foreign xml:lang="la">modii</foreign> of wheat, he took money for

                  >Sicily</placeName> at the time; all the money which he thus received from the
                public treasury, he kept for himself. I was amazed, O judges, when a man of the
                greatest ability, of the highest wisdom, and of the greatest influence, Aeneas of
                Halesa, first stated this to me at Halesa in the senate of Halesa; a man to whom the

                entire quantity of corn had been brought to him under the name of tenths, then he
                was accustomed to exact money from the cities, to object to the corn delivered, and

                levied, had given none, that they had paid money to Volcatus, and to Timarchides the
                clerk. I find a case of plunder of this kind, O judges, that the praetor, whose duty
                it was to buy corn, did not buy it, but sell it; and that he embezzles and
                appropriates the money which he ought to have divided among the cities. It did not
                appear to me any longer to be a theft, but a monster and a prodigy; to reject the
                corn of the cities, and to approve of his own; when he had approved of his own, then
                to put a price on that corn, to take from the cities what he had fixed, and to

                that very heap, a part of which, under the name of tenths, you had actually approved
                of? and besides, to exact money from the cities for the purchase of cow, when you
                had already received it from the treasury? Did the Terentian law enjoin you to buy
                corn from the Sicilians with the money of the Sicilians, or to buy corn from the
                Sicilians with the money of the Roman people? </p>

                given to these cities for corn, has been made profit of by that man. For you take
                fifteen <foreign xml:lang="la">sesterces</foreign> for a <foreign xml:lang="la"
                  >medimus</foreign> of wheat; for that is the value of a <foreign xml:lang="la"

                  >sesterces</foreign>; for that is the price of Sicilian corn, estimated according
                to law. What difference does it make whether you did this, or whether you did not
                reject the corn, but, after the corn was approved and accepted, detained all the
                public money, and paid none to any city whatever? when the valuation of the law is
                such that while it is tolerable to the Sicilians at other times, it ought also to be
                pleasant to them during your praetorship. For a <foreign xml:lang="la"
                  >modius</foreign> is valued by law at three <foreign xml:lang="la"
                  >sesterces</foreign>. But, while you were praetor, it was, as you boast in many
                letters to your friends, valued at two <foreign xml:lang="la">sesterces</foreign>.
                But suppose it was three <foreign xml:lang="la">sesterces</foreign>, since you
                exacted that price from the cities for every <foreign xml:lang="la"
                >modius</foreign>. When, if you had paid the Sicilians as much as the Roman people
                had ordered you to pay, it might have been most pleasing to the cultivators, you not
                only did not choose them to receive what they ought, but you even compelled them to

                corn, I never saw it, I gave the managers of the companies the power of approving of
                rejecting it; the managers extorted money from the cities but I paid to the managers

                increased the quantity of corn, and consequently the amount of the valuation. In
                truth this valuation originated, O judges, at first not in the convenience of the
                praetors or consuls, but in the advantage to the cultivators and the cities. For
                originally, no one was so impudent as to demand money when it was corn that was due;
                certainly this proceeded in the first instance from the cultivator or from the city
                which was required to furnish corn; when they had either sold the corn, or wished to
                keep it, or were not willing to carry it to that place where it was required to be
                delivered, they begged as a kindness and a favour, that they might be allowed,
                instead of the corn, to give the value of the corn. From such a commencement as
                this, and from the liberality and accommodating spirit of the magistrates the custom
                of valuations was introduced. </p>

                They adopted a custom of always requiring corn to be delivered at the most remote
                and inconvenient places, in order that, through the difficulty of carriage, the

                kindness, have granted, as a favour and as a convenience to the cities, permission
                to give money instead of corn. And so I suppose the cultivators begged of him, that,
                as they could not sell a <foreign xml:lang="la">modius</foreign> of wheat for three
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">sesterces</foreign>, they may be allowed to pay three
                  <foreign xml:lang="la">denarii</foreign> instead of each <foreign xml:lang="la"
                  >modius</foreign>. Or, since you do not dare to say this, will you take refuge in
                that assertion, that, being influenced by the difficulty of carriage, they preferred
                to give three <foreign xml:lang="la">denarii</foreign>? Of what carriage? Wishing
                not to have to carry it from what place to what place? from <placeName

                different places; I see too how many days' journey it is; I see that it is for the

                money, which he does not get out of the land—to sell his oxen, and his plough
                itself, and all his tools For you are not to think this. “The man has also
                possessions in ready money; he has also possessions inland, near the city.” For when

                quality and description of his land, what that can endure, what that can suffer,
                what that can and ought to produce. Although those men have been drained and ruined

                consider the cultivator ought to render to the republic on account of his land, and
                what charges he can support. You impose the payment of tenths on them. They endure
                that. A second tenth. You think they must be subservient to your necessities,—that

                this is what he seemed to mean by his signs and nods. Out of all the praetors of the
                Roman people then, and consuls, and generals, have you selected Marcus Antonius, and
                even the most infamous action done by him, for your imitation? And here is it
                difficult for me to say, or for the judges to think, that in that unlimited

              <p> But Sacerdos did the same. You name an upright man, and one endued with the
                greatest wisdom; but he can only be thought to have done the same thing, if he did
                it with the same intention. For the mere fact of the valuation has never been found
                fault with by me; but the equity of it depends on the advantage to, and willingness
                of the cultivator. No valuation can be found fault with, which is not only not
                disadvantageous, but which is even pleasing to the cultivator. Sacerdos, when he

                we have splendid judges, if you think them likely to show indulgence to the faults
                of others, in order the more easily to be allowed to commit faults themselves. Do we

                extorting immense sums of money with the greatest injustice will never be in any way
                chastised? But if that be the case, what can we say against that praetor who every

                on the subject of the three <foreign xml:lang="la">denarii</foreign>. What then is
                his defence? “I have done what you accuse me of; I have extorted immense sums on the

                you if you take care.” A dangerous thing for the provinces for any classes of injury
                to be established by judicial decision to a dangerous thing for our order, for the
                Roman people to think that these men, who themselves are subject to the laws, cannot
                defend the laws with strictness when they are judges. And while that man was
                praetor, O judges, there was not only no limit to his valuing corn, but there was
                none either to his demands of corn. Nor did he command that only to be supplied that
                was due, but as much as was advantageous for himself. I will put before you the sum
                total of all the corn commanded to be furnished for the granary, as collected out of
                the public documents, and the testimonies of the cities You will find, O judges,
                that man commanded the cities to supply five times as much as it was lawful for him
                to take for the granary. What can be added to this impudence, if he both valued it
                at such a price that men could not endure it, and also commanded so much more to be
                supplied than was permitted to him by the laws to require? </p>

                They were liable, indeed, to pay tenths, but they have scarcely had a tenth left for
                themselves. When money has been due to them, it has not been paid; though the senate
                intended them to supply corn for the granary according to a very equitable
                valuation, they have been compelled to sell even the tools with which they cultivate

              <p> I have already said, O judges, that even if you remove all these injuries, still
                that the occupation of cultivating land is maintained owing to the hopes and a
                certain sort of pleasure which it gives, rather than because of the profit and
                emolument arising from it. In truth every year constant labour and constant expense
                is incurred in the hope of a result which is casual and uncertain. Moreover, the
                crop does not command a high price, except in a disastrous harvest. But if there has
                been a great abundance of crops gathered, then there is cheapness in selling them.
                So that you may see that the corn must be badly sold if it is got in well, or else
                that the crop must be bad if you get a good price for it. And the whole business of
                agriculture is such, that it is regulated not by reason or by industry, but by those
                most uncertain things,—the weather and the winds. When from agriculture one tenth is
                extracted by law and on fair terms,—when a second is levied by a new regulation, on
                account of the necessity of procuring a sufficient supply for ourselves,—when,
                besides, corn is purchased every year by public authority,—and when, after all that,
                more still is ordered by magistrates and lieutenants to be supplied for the
                granary,—what, or how much is there after all this of his own crop which the

                consult your advantage and that of the Roman people rather than themselves and their
                own profit,—still, ought they also to bear these new edicts and commands of the
                praetors, and the imperiousness of Apronius, and the robberies and rapine of the
                slaves of Venus? Ought they also to supply corn which ought to be purchased of them
                without getting any payment for it? Ought they also, though they are willing to

              <head>THE ARGUMENT</head>
              <p>The subject of this oration is the manner in which Verres had plundered not only
                private individuals, but even some temples, of valuable statues, and other works of
                art. Among the instances given some of the most prominent are the plunder of Heius,
                a Messanian, of Philarchus, of Centuripa, of several other private citizens, of
                Antiochus, the king; and of the temples of Diana, Mercury, and <placeName
                  key="tgn,7010621">Ceres</placeName>. A French translator in commenting on this
                oration says, with reference to the slighting way in which Cicero speaks of the
                works of art thus stolen,—“The Romans struggled for some time against the seductive
                power of the arts of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, to which for
                many ages they were strangers. At first they really did despise them, afterwards
                they affected to despise them, but at last they were forced to bow the head beneath
                the brilliant yoke of luxury; and <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>,
                industrious, learned, and polite, subdued by the admiration which it extorted, the
                ignorant, unlettered, and rude barbarians who had conquered her by force. Faithful
                to the ancient maxims of the republic, Cicero in this oration speaks only with a
                sort of disdain of the arts and works of the most famous artists. He even pretends
                sometimes not to be too well acquainted with the names of the most celebrated
                statuaries; he often repeats, and with a kind of affectation, that he knows very
                little of painting or sculpture; and rather prides himself, as one may say, on his
                ignorance. He seems to regard a taste for art as unworthy of the Romans, and the
                finest <foreign xml:lang="fr">chefs d' oeuvre</foreign> as children's toys, fit to
                amuse the trifling and frivolous minds of the Greeks, whose name he usually
                expresses by a contemptuous diminutive, (<foreign xml:lang="la">Graeculi</foreign>,)
                but little calculated to fix the attention, or attract the esteem or wishes of a
                Roman mind. ******</p>
              <p>In general there runs through these orations a tone more calculated to render
                Verres ridiculous, than to make one feel how much there was in all his attempts
                which was odious and horrible. The orator even permitted himself some pleasantries,
                for which his taste has been, perhaps too severely, called in question. Cicero had
                no dislike to puns, and has played a good deal on the name of Verres, which means a
                boar. He was too eager to acquire the reputation of a wit. It is true that the
                person of Verres was sufficiently inviting as a subject for ridicule. He was one of
                those gross men overloaded with fat in whom the bulk of body appears to stifle all
                delicacy of moral feeling. As he had tried to carry off a statue of Hercules which
                his people could with difficulty move upon its pedestal, Cicero calls this the
                thirteenth of the labours of Hercules. And playing continually on the name of
                Verres, he compares him to the boar of Erymanthus. At another time he calls him the
                dragnet of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, because the name Verres
                has some resemblance to the word <foreign xml:lang="la">everriculum</foreign>, which
                signifies a dragnet.” </p>
              <p>Hortensius endeavoured to defend Verres from the charge of having stolen these
                statues, &amp;c. of which he admits that he had become the possessor, by contending
                that he had bought them. But it was contrary to the laws for a magistrate to
                purchase any such articles in his province; and Cicero shows also that the prices
                alleged to have been given are so wholly disproportionate to their value, that it is
                ridiculous to assert that the things had been purchased and not taken by force. </p>

                town the statues of the Muses which are now before the temple of Good Fortune, and
                the other statues which were not consecrated, did not touch this marble Cupid,

                undoubtedly was so. Also before those gods there were little altars, which might
                indicate to any one the holiness of the chapel. There were besides two brazen
                statues, of no very great size, but of marvellous beauty, in the dress and robes of
                virgins, which with uplifted hands were supporting some sacred vessels which were
                placed on their heads, after the fashion of the Athenian virgins. They were called

                whether he was in such difficulties about money matters, whether he was oppressed by
                such want, by such necessity, as to strip his private chapel, to sell his paternal
                gods. But I see that the man had no auction; that he never sold anything except the
                produce of his land; that he not only had no debts, but that he had always abundance
                of ready money. Even if all these things were contrary to what I say they were,
                still I say that he would not have sold things which had been so many years in the
                household and chapel of his ancestors. “What will you say if he was persuaded by the
                greatness of the sum given him for them?” It is not probable that a man, rich as he

                judges, what he answered when he was asked about the ship; that it had been built by
                public labour, at the public expense, and that a Mamertine senator had been
                appointed by the public authority to superintend its building. Heius in his private
                capacity flees to you for aid, O judges; he avails himself of this law, the common
                fortress of our allies, by which this tribunal is established. Although there is a
                law for recovering money which has been unjustly extorted, he says that he does not
                seem to recover any money; which though it has been taken from him, he does not so
                much care about: but he says he does demand back from you the sacred images
                belonging to his ancestors, he does demand back from you his hereditary household
                god? </p>

                this by means of slaves, that through freemen; one thing by a friend, another by an
                enemy. Whatever pleased them was sure to be lost. They whose plate was demanded had
                nothing else to hope, than that Tlepolemus and Hiero might not approve of it. </p>

              <p>I will relate to you this fact, O judges, most truly. I recollect that Pamphilus of
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>, a connection of mine by ties
                of hospitality, and a personal friend of mine, a man of the highest birth, told me,
                that when that man had taken from him, by his absolute power, an ewer made by the
                hand of Boethus, of exquisite workmanship and great weight, he went home very sad in
                truth, and greatly agitated, because a vessel of that sort, which had been left to
                him by his father and his forefathers, and which he was accustomed to use on days of
                festival, and on the arrival of ancient friends, had been taken from him. While I
                was sitting at home, said he, in great indignation, up comes one of the slaves of
                Venus; he orders me immediately to bring to the praetor some embossed goblets. I was
                greatly vexed, said he; I had two; I order them both to be taken out of the closet,
                lest any worse thing should happen, and to be brought after me to the praetor's
                house. When I got there the praetor was asleep; the Cibyratic brothers were walking
                about, and when they saw me, they said, Pamphilus, where are the cups? I show them
                with great grief;—they praise them.—I begin to complain that I shall have nothing
                left of any value at all, if my cups too were taken away. Then they, when they see
                me vexed, say, What are you willing to give us to prevent these from being taken
                from you? To make my story short, I said that I would give six hundred <foreign
                  xml:lang="la">sesterces</foreign>. Meantime the praetor summons us; he asks for
                the cups. Then they began to say to the praetor, that they had thought from what
                they had heard, that Pamphilus's cups were of some value, but that they were
                miserable things, quite unworthy of Verres's having them among his plate. He said,
                he thought so too. </p>

            <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33" resp="perseus">
              <p>So Pamphilus saved his exquisite goblets. And indeed, before I heard this, though I
                knew that it was a very trifling sort of accomplishment to understand things of that
                sort, yet I used to wonder that he had any knowledge of them at all, as I knew that
                in nothing whatever had he any qualities like a man. <milestone n="15"
                  unit="chapter"/><milestone unit="Para"/> But when I heard this, I then for the
                first time understood that that was the use of these two Cibyratic brothers; that in
                his robberies he used his own hands, but their eyes. But he was so covetous of that
                splendid reputation of being thought to be a judge of such matters, that lately,
                (just observe the man's madness,) after his case was adjourned, when he was already
                as good as condemned, and civilly dead, at the time of the games of the circus, when
                early in the morning the couches were spread in preparation for a banquet at the
                house of Lucius Sisenna, a man of the first consideration, and when the plate was
                all set out, and when, as was suited to the dignity of Lucius Sisenna, the house was
                full of honourable men, he came to the plate, and began in a leisurely way to
                examine and consider every separate piece. Some marveled at the folly of the man,
                who, while his trial was actually going on, was increasing the suspicion of that
                covetousness of which he was accused; others marveled at his insensibility, that any
                such things could come into his head, when the time for judgment in his cause was so
                near at hand, and when so many witnesses had spoken against him. But Sisenna's
                servants, who, I suppose, had heard the evidence which had been given against him,
                never took their eyes off him, and never departed out of reach of the plate. </p>

              <p>It is the part of a sagacious judge, from small circumstances to form his opinion
                of every man's covetousness or incontinence. And will any one believe that this man
                when praetor, was able to keep either his covetousness or his hands from the plate
                of the Sicilians, when, though a defendant, and a defendant within two days of
                judgment, a man in reality, and in the opinion of all men as good as already
                condemned, he could not in a large assembly restrain himself from handling and

                  >Lilybaeum</placeName>, from which I have made this digression, there is a man
                named Diocles, the son-in-law of Pamphilus, of that Pamphilus from whom the ewer was
                taken away, whose surname is Popillius. From this man he took away every article on
                his sideboard where his plate was set out. He may say, if he pleases, that he had
                bought them. In fact, in this case, by reason of the magnitude of the robbery, an
                entry of it, I imagine, has been made in the account-books. He ordered Timarchides
                to value the plate. How did he do it? At as low a price as any one ever valued any
                thing presented to an actor. Although I have been for some time acting foolishly in
                saying as much about your purchases, and in asking whether you bought the things,
                and how, and at what price you bought them, when I can settle all that by one word.
                Produce me a written list of what plate you acquired in the province of <placeName

                have your account-books and to produce them. But you say that you never kept any
                accounts of your expenses in these years. Make me out at least this one which I am
                asking for, the account of the plate, and I will not mind the rest at present. “I
                have no writings of the sort; I cannot produce any accounts.” What then is to be
                done? What do you think that these judges can do? Your house was full of most
                beautiful statues already, before your praetorship; many were placed in your villas,
                many were deposited with your friends; many were given and presented to other
                people; yet you have no accounts speaking of any single one having been bought. All
                the plate in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>has been taken away.
                There is nothing left to any one that can be called his own. A scandalous defence is
                invented, that the praetor bought all that plate; and yet that cannot be proved by
                any accounts. If you do produce any accounts, still there is no entry in them how
                you have acquired what you have got. But of these years during which you say that
                you bought the greatest number of things, you produce no accounts at all. Must you
                not inevitably be, condemned, both by the accounts which you do, and by those which

                most active and accomplished man, and of the greatest influence in his city. You
                took away, with the knowledge of every body, a very large and very beautiful table

                a ruined man, with the rope round his neck, and shared with him the property

                There is a man of <placeName key="tgn,7005730">Melita</placeName>, called Diodorus,
                who has already given evidence before you. He has been now living at <placeName

                home, and of great credit and popularity with the people among whom he has settled,
                on account of his virtue. It is reported to Verres of this man that he has some
                exceedingly fine specimens of chased work; and among them two goblets called
                Thericlean, <note anchored="true">“Thericles was a potter in the time of
                  Aristophanes, who made earthenware vessels of a peculiar black clay. In subsequent

                  were called Thericlean.”—Graevius.</note>made by the hand of mentor with the most
                exquisite skill. And when Verres heard of this, he was inflamed with such a desire,
                not only of beholding, but also of appropriating them, that he summoned Diodorus,
                and demanded them. He replied, as was natural for a man who took great pride in
                them, that he had not got them at <placeName key="tgn,7003850"
                >Lilybaeum</placeName>; that he had left them at <placeName key="tgn,7005730"

                him; he desires Diodorus to give them letters to that relation of his—the time
                appeared to him endless till he could see those pieces of plate. Diodorus, a prudent
                and careful man, who wished to keep his own property, writes to his relation to make
                answer to those men who came from Verres, that he had sent the cups to <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>a few days before. In the meantime he
                himself leaves the place. He preferred leaving his home, to staying in it and losing
                that exquisitely wrought silver work. But when Verres heard of this, he was so
                agitated that he seemed to every one to be raving, and to be beyond all question
                mad. Because he could not steal the plate himself, he said that he had been robbed
                by Diodorus of some exquisitely wrought vessels; he poured out threats against the
                absent Diodorus; he used to roar out before people; sometimes he could not restrain
                his tears. We have heard in the mythology of Eriphyla being so covetous that when
                she had seen a necklace, made, I suppose, of gold and jewels, she was so excited by
                its beauty, that she betrayed her husband for the sake of it. His covetousness was
                similar; but in one respect more violent and more senseless, because she was
                desiring a thing which she had seen, while his wishes were excited not only by his
                eyes, but even by his ears. </p>

                from all suspicion, not only of crime, but of even the slightest irregularity. But
                it soon became evident, that all this was done for the sake of his silver. Verres
                does not hesitate to order the prosecution to be instituted; and that, I imagine,
                was the first instance of his allowing an accusation to be made against an absent

                chased silver plate; and that prosecutions were instituted against them not only
                when they were present, but even in their absence. Diodorus goes to <placeName

                patrons and friends; relates the affair to every one. Earnest letters are written to
                Verres by his father, and by his friends, warning him to take care what he did, and
                what steps he took respecting Diodorus; that the matter was notorious and very
                unpopular; that he must be out of his senses; that this one charge would ruin him if
                he did not take care. At that time he considered his father, if not in the light of
                a parent, at least in that of a man. He had not yet sufficiently prepared himself
                for a trial; it was his first year in the province; he was not, as he was by the
                time of the affair of Sthenius, loaded with money. And so his frenzy was checked a
                little, not by shame, but by fear and alarm. He does not dare to condemn Diodorus;
                he takes his name out of the list of defendants while he is absent. In the meantime
                Diodorus, for nearly three years, as long as that man was praetor, was banished from

                what ground had he for declaring that he would demand his plate back again from you,
                if he had sold it to you of his own free will? Moreover, how could you avoid
                restoring it to Cnaeus Calidius; especially when he was such an intimate friend of
                Lucius Sisenna, your defender, and as you had restored their property to the other
                friends of Sisenna? </p>

              <p>Lastly, I do not suppose you will deny that by the intervention of Potamo, a friend
                of yours, you restored his plate to Lucius Cordius, an honourable man, but not more
                highly esteemed than Cnaeus Calidius; and it was he who made the cause of the rest
                more difficult to plead before you; for though you had promised many men to restore
                them their property, yet, after Cordius had stated in his evidence that you had
                restored him his, you desisted from making any more restorations, because you saw
                that you lost your plunder, and yet could not escape the evidence against you. Under
                all other praetors Cnaeus Calidius, a Roman knight, was allowed to have plate finely
                wrought; he was permitted to be able from his own stores to adorn and furnish a
                banquet handsomely, when he had invited a magistrate or any superior officer. Many
                men in power and authority have been with Cnaeus Calidius at his house; no one was
                ever found so mad as to take from him that admirable and splendid plate; no one was
                found bold enough to ask for it; no one impudent enough to beg him to sell it. </p>

                there was no other silver plate besides; namely, a large dish with figures and
                images of the gods embossed on it, a goblet which the women used for sacred
                purposes, and a censer. And all these were antique, and executed with the most
                admirable skill, so that one may suspect everything else in <placeName

                any city, immediately the Cibyratic hounds of his were slipped, to search and find
                cut everything. If they found any large vessel, any considerable work, they brought
                it to him with joy; if they could hunt out any smaller vessel of the same sort, they
                looked on those as a sort of lesser game, whether they were dishes, cups, censers,
                or anything else. What weepings of women, what lamentations do you suppose took

                which excite great and bitter indignation, especially among women, who grieve when

                and of the gods of hospitality. But yet, in accordance with what I have said before

                in the army under Lucius Lucullus? He was supping with him; the rest of the silver
                which he had set before him had no ornament on it, lest he himself should also be
                left without any ornament; but there were also two goblets, of no large size, but
                with figures on them. He, as if he had been a professional diner-out, who was not to
                go away without a present, on the spot, in the sight of all the other guests, tore
                off the figures. I do not attempt to enumerate all his exploits of this sort; it is

                every specimen of Corinthian work too, should be at once taken down from the town to
                the seaside. Archagathus went up into the town. That noble man, as one who wished to
                be loved and esteemed by his fellow citizens, was very indignant at having such an
                office imposed upon him, and did not know what to do. He announces the commands he

                to his surname. <milestone n="26" unit="chapter"/><milestone unit="Para"/> It is
                utterly impossible for me either to retain in my memory, or to embrace in my speech,
                all his exploits. I wish just to touch briefly on the different kinds of deeds, done
                by him, just as here the ring of Piso reminded me of what had otherwise entirely
                escaped my recollection. From how many honourable men do you imagine that that man
                tore the golden rings from off their fingers? He never hesitated to do so whenever
                he was pleased with either the jewels or the fashion of the ring belonging to any
                one. I am going to mention an incredible fact, but still one so notorious that I do
                not think that he himself will deny it. </p>

                a Roman citizen. But that covetousness of his is quite beyond belief. For as he

                had heard, and on other accounts suspected had many splendid things with him, had
                come into his kingdom and into his power. He sends him presents—liberal enough—for
                all domestic uses; as much wine and oil as he thought fit; and as much wheat as he
                could want, out of his tenths. After that he invites the king himself to supper. He
                decorates a couch abundantly and magnificently. He sets out the numerous, and
                beautiful silver vessels, in which he was so rich; for he had not yet made all those

                thinking that Verres was superbly provided with everything, and that he himself had
                been magnificently treated. After that, he himself invites the praetor to supper. He

                also a vessel for wine, a ladle hollowed out of one single large precious stone,

                abroad among foreign nations to the furthest corners of the earth. The kings, whom I

                candelabrum of the finest jewels, made with most extraordinary skill, in order to
                place it in the Capitol; but as they found that temple not yet finished, they could
                not place it there. Nor were they willing to display it and produce it in common, in
                order that it might seem more splendid when it was placed at its proper time in the
                shrine of the great and good <persName><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName>; and
                brighter; also, as its beauty would come fresh and untarnished before the eyes of
                men. They determined, therefore, to take it back with them into <placeName

              <p>The matter, I know not how, got to his ears. For the king had wished it kept
                entirely concealed; not because he feared or suspected anything, but because he did
                not wish many to feast their eyes on it before the Roman people. He begs the king,
                and entreats him most earnestly to send it to him; he says that he longs to look at
                it himself, and that he will not allow any one else to see it. Antiochus, being both
                of a childlike and royal disposition, suspected nothing of that man's dishonesty,
                and orders his servants to take it as secretly as possible, and well wrapped up, to
                the praetor's house. And when they brought it there, and placed it on a table,
                having taken off the coverings, Verres began to exclaim that it was a thing worthy
                of the kingdom of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, worthy of being a
                royal present, worthy of the Capitol. In truth, it was of such splendour as a thing
                must be which is made of the most brilliant and beautiful jewels; of such variety of
                pattern that the skill of the workmanship seemed to vie with the richness of the
                materials; and of such a size that it might easily be seen that it had been made not
                for the furniture of men, but for the decoration of a most noble temple. And when he
                appeared to have examined it sufficiently, the servants begin to take it up to carry
                it back again. He says that he wishes to examine it over and over again; that he is
                not half satiated with the sight of it; he orders them to depart and to leave the
                candelabrum. So they then return to Antiochus empty-handed. </p>

                it, if he will be so good. He bids the slaves come again. The king begins to think
                it strange. He sends a second time. It is not returned. He himself calls on the man;

                relationship. This town, as the state of the Segestans was at war with the
                Carthaginians on its own account and of its own accord, was formerly stormed and
                destroyed by the Carthaginians; and everything which could be any ornament to the

                exquisite skill and beauty. When transferred to <placeName key="perseus,Carthage"

                that he thought it reasonable for them to consider whether it was more advantageous
                to the Sicilians to be subject to their own princes, or to be under the dominion of
                the Roman people, when they had the same thing as a monument of the cruelty of their

                respect for their own laws and courts of justice. Then he began to entreat this
                favour of them, then to threaten them, then to try and excite their hopes, then to
                arouse their fears. They opposed to his demands the name of Africanus; they said
                that it was the gift of the Roman people; that they themselves had no right over a

                in levying corn, he imposed on the Segestans beyond all other cities, and a good
                deal more than they could bear. Besides that, he used to summon their magistrates

                to threaten every one of them separately to be the ruin of him, and to announce to
                them all in a body that he would utterly destroy their city. Therefore, at last, the
                Segestans, subdued by much ill-treatment and by great fear, resolved to obey the

                taken away, but even defend their plunderer and destroyer? The Segestans are
                present, your clients, the allies and friends of the Roman people. They inform you

                utterly effaced and extinguished the name of Publius Scipio. They entreat and pray
                you to restore the object of their worship to them, its proper credit and glory to
                your own family, so enabling them by your assistance to recover from the house of a

                protect the honour of your family renown; you can, you have every advantage which
                either fortune or nature ever gives to men. I do not wish to anticipate you in

                me. Let that proud aristocracy give up complaining that the Roman people willingly
                gives, and at all times has given, honours to new and diligent men. It is a foolish
                complaint that virtue should be of the greatest influence in that city which by its
                virtue governs all nations. Let the image of Publius Africanus be in the houses of
                other men; let heroes now dead be adorned with virtue and glory. He was such a man,
                he deserved so well of the Roman people, that he deserves to be recommended to the

                belong to me also to defend his honours with all my power, because I belong to that

                extortion at present; never mind the injuries of the Segestans; let the pedestal of
                Publius Africanus be restored; let the name of that invincible commander be engraved
                on it anew; let that most beautiful statue, which was recovered when <placeName
                  key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>was taken, be replaced. It is not I,
                the defender of the Sicilians,—it is not I, your prosecutor,—they are not the
                Segestans who demand this of you; but he who has taken on himself the defence and
                the preservation of the renown and glory of Publius Africanus. I am not afraid of
                not being able to give a good account of my performance of this duty to Publius
                Servilius the judge; who, as he has performed great exploits, and raised very many
                monuments of his good deeds, and has a natural anxiety about them, will be glad,
                forsooth, to leave them an object of care and protection not only to his own
                posterity, but to all brave men and good citizens; and not as a mark for the plunder
                of rogues. I am not afraid of its displeasing you, O Quintus Catulus, to whom the
                most superb and splendid monument in the whole world belongs, that there should be
                as many guardians of such monuments as possible, or that all good men should think
                it was a part of their duty to defend the glory of another. </p>

                wickedness, and arbitrary power of this man; who, when he first came to their city,
                in a moment, as if it were not only a becoming, but an indispensable thing to be
                done?—as if the senate had ordered it and the Roman people had sanctioned it,—in a

                it was not persevered in by him during the first period of his visit; but when he
                departed, he ordered Sopater, their chief magistrate, whose statement you have
                heard, to take it down. When he refused, he threatened him violently; and then he
                left the city. The magistrate refers the matter to the senate; there is a violent
                outcry on all sides. To make my story short, some time afterwards he comes to that
                city again. Immediately he asks about the statue. He is answered that the senate
                will not allow it to be removed; that capital punishment is threatened to any one
                who should touch it without the orders of the senate: the impiety of removing is
                also urged. Then says he, “What do you mean by talking to me of impiety? or about
                punishment? or about the senate? I will not leave you alive; you shall be scourged
                to death if the statue is not given up.” Sopater with tears reports the matter to
                the senate a second time, and relates to them the covetousness and the threats of
                Verres. The senate gives Sopater no answer, but breaks up in agitation and
                perplexity. Sopater, being summoned by the praetor's messenger, informs him of the
                state of the case, and says that it is absolutely impossible. </p>

                impudence) were done openly in the middle of the assembly, while Verres was sitting
                on his chair of office, in a lofty situation. It was the depth of winter; the
                weather, as you heard Sopater himself state, was bitterly cold; heavy rain was
                falling; when that fellow orders the lictors to throw Sopater headlong down from the
                portico on which he himself was sitting, and to strip him naked. The command was
                scarcely, out of his mouth, before you might have seen him stripped and surrounded
                by the lictors. All thought that the unhappy and innocent man was going to be
                scourged. They were mistaken. Do you think that Verres would scourge without any
                reason an ally and friend of the Roman people? He is not so wicked. All vices are
                not to be found in that man; he was never cruel. He treated the man with great
                gentleness and clemency. In the middle of the forum there are some statues of the
                Marcelli, as there are in most of the other towns of <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>; out of these he selected the statue of Caius Marcellus, whose
                services to that city and to the whole province were most recent and most important.
                On that statue he orders Sopater, a man of noble birth in his city, and at that very
                time invested with the chief magistracy, to be placed astride and bound to it. </p>

                and barbarity, till the people and the whole multitude, moved by the atrocity of his
                conduct and by pity for his victim, compelled the senate by their outcries to
                promise him that statue of Mercury. They cried out that the immortal gods themselves
                would avenge the act, and that in the meantime it was not fit that an innocent man
                should be murdered. Then the senate comes to him in a body, and promises him the
                statue. And so Sopater is taken down scarcely alive from the statue of Marcellus, to
                which he had almost become frozen. I cannot adequately accuse that man if I were to
                wish to do so; it requires not only genius, but an extraordinary amount of skill.

                night, a great assemblage of armed slaves, and a great attack on this temple by

                and guardians of the temple. And, at first, when they attempted to resist them and
                to defend the temple, they are driven back much injured with sticks and bludgeons.
                Afterwards, when the bolts were forced open, and the doors dashed in, they endeavour
                to pull down the statue and to overthrow it with levers; meantime, from the outcries
                of the keepers, a report got abroad over the whole city, that the national gods were
                being stormed, not by the unexpected invasion of enemies, or by the sudden irruption
                of pirates, but that a well armed and fully equipped band of fugitive slaves from

                news, and to seize whatever weapon chance put into his hands. So in a very short
                time men are assembled at the temple from every part of the city. Already, for more
                than an hour, numbers of men had been labouring at pulling down that statue; and all
                that time it gave no sign of being shaken in any part; while some, putting levers
                under it, were endeavouring to throw it down, and others, having bound cords to all
                its limbs, were trying to pull it towards them. On a sudden all the Agrigentines
                collect together at the place; stones are thrown in numbers; the nocturnal soldiers
                of that illustrious commander run away—but they take with them two very small
                statues, in order not to return to that robber of all holy things entirely
                empty-handed. The Sicilians are never in such distress as not to be able to say
                something facetious and neat; as they did on this occasion. And so they said that

              <p>The people of Assorum, gallant and loyal men, afterwards imitated this brave
                conduct of the Agrigentines, though they did not come of so powerful or so
                distinguished a city. There is a river called Chrysas, which flows through the
                territories of Assorum. Chrysas, among that people, is considered a god, and is
                worshipped with the greatest reverence. His temple is in the fields, near the road
                which goes from Assorum to <placeName key="tgn,7003916">Enna</placeName>. In it
                there is an image of Chrysas, exquisitely made of marble. He did not dare to beg
                that of the Assorians on account of the extraordinary sanctity of that temple; so he
                entrusts the business to Tlepolemus and Hiero. They, having prepared and armed a
                body of men, come by night; they break in the doors of the temple; the keepers of
                the temple and the guardians hear them in time. A trumpet the signal of alarm well
                known to all the neighbourhood, is sounded; men come in from the country, Tlepolemus
                is turned out and put to fight; nor was anything missed out of the temple of Chrysas
                except one very diminutive image of brass. </p>

                many, in order to come to the greater and more remarkable thefts and atrocities of
                this sort which this man has committed. In this temple that same Publius Scipio, a
                man excelling in every possible good quality, had placed breastplates and helmets of
                brass of Corinthian workmanship, and some huge ewers of a similar description, and
                wrought with the same exquisite skill, and had inscribed his own name upon them. Why

                conduct? He took away, O judges, every one of those things. He left nothing in that
                most holy temple except the traces of the religion he had trampled on, and the name

                especially in polluting those sacred things, which not only may not be touched with
                the hands, but which may not be violated even in thought. There is a shrine of
                    <persName><surname>Ceres</surname></persName>among the Catenans of the same holy
                nature as the one at home, and worshipped as the goddess is worshipped among foreign
                nations, and in almost every country in the world. In the inmost part of that shrine
                there was an extremely ancient statue of
                  <persName><surname>Ceres</surname></persName>, as to which men were not only
                ignorant of what sort it was, but even of its existence. For the entrance into that
                shrine does not belong to men, the sacred ceremonies are accustomed to be performed
                by women and virgins. Verres's slaves stole this statue by night out of that most

                been carried off. They answer that the servants of the praetor had been seen in the

                for weaving women's garments. Not far from that town, on a promontory, is an ancient
                temple of Juno, which was always considered so holy, that it was not only always
                kept inviolate and sacred in those Punic wars, which in those regions were carried
                on almost wholly by the naval forces, but even by the bands of pirates which ravage
                those seas. Moreover, it has been handed down to us by tradition, that once, when
                the fleet of King Masinissa was forced to put into these ports, the king's
                lieutenant took away some ivory teeth of an incredible size out of the temple, and
                carried them into <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, and gave them to
                Masinissa; that at first the king was delighted with the present, but afterwards,
                when he heard where they had come from, he immediately sent trustworthy men in a
                quinquereme to take those teeth back; and that there was engraved on them in Punic
                characters, “that Masinissa the king had accepted them ignorantly; but that, when he
                knew the truth, he had taken care that they should be replaced and restored.” There
                was besides an immense quantity of ivory, and many ornaments, among which were some
                ivory victories of ancient workmanship, and wrought with exquisite skill. </p>

                prosecuting according to our laws, and by this regular process? Concerning whom is
                it that you are going to give your judicial decision? The deputies from <placeName
                  key="tgn,7005730">Melita</placeName>sent by the public authority of their state,
                say that the shrine of Juno was plundered; that that man left nothing in that most
                holy temple; that that place, to which the fleets of enemies often came, where
                pirates are accustomed to winter almost every year, and which no pirate ever
                violated, no enemy ever attacked before, was so plundered by that single man, that
                nothing whatever was left in it. What, then, now are we to say of him as a
                defendant, of me as an accuser, of this tribunal? Is he proved guilty of grave
                crimes, or is he brought into this court on mere suspicion? Gods are proved to have
                been carried off, temples to have been plundered, cities to have been stripped of
                everything. And of those actions he has left himself no power of denying one, no
                plea for defending one. In every particular he is convicted by me; he is detected by
                the witnesses; he is overwhelmed by his own admissions; he is caught in the evident
                commission of guilt; and even now he remains here, and in silence recognises his own

                temple a statue of Libera. They are very colossal and very beautiful, but not
                exceedingly ancient. There was one of brass, of moderate size, but extraordinary
                workmanship, with the torches in its hands, very ancient, by far the most ancient of
                all those statues which are in that temple; that he carried off, and yet he was not

                taking them by storm. With respect to the decorations of the city, he had a regard
                to his own victory, and a regard to humanity, he thought it was due to his victory
                to transport man, things to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>which
                might be an ornament to this city, and due to humanity not utterly to strip the

                attempted to plunder the temple of Minerva. The one was unwilling to adorn gods in
                the spoil taken from gods, the other transferred the decorations of the virgin
                Minerva to the house of a prostitute. Besides this, he took away out of the same

                tyrant this man proved to the Syracusans than any of the old ones, as they, cruel as
                they were, still adorned the temples of the immortal gods, while this man took away

              <p>But now what shall I say of the folding-doors of that temple? I am afraid that
                those who have not seen these things may think that I am speaking too highly of, and
                exaggerating everything, though no one ought to suspect that I should be so
                inconsiderate as to be selling that so many men of the highest reputation,

                themselves, should be witnesses to my rashness and falsehood. I am able to prove
                this distinctly, O judges, that no more magnificent doors, none more beautifully
                wrought of gold and ivory, ever existed in an, temple. It is incredible how many
                Greeks have left written accounts of the beauty of these doors: they, perhaps, may
                admire and extol them too much; be it so, still it is more honourable for our
                republic, O judges, that our general, in a time of war, should have left those
                things which appeared to them so beautiful, than that our praetor should have
                carried them off in a time of peace. On the folding-doors were some subjects most
                minutely executed in ivory; all these he caused to be taken out; he tore off and
                took away a very tine head of the Gorgon with snakes for hair; and he showed, too,
                that he was influenced not only by admiration for the workmanship, but by a desire
                of money and gain; for he did not hesitate to take away also all the golden knobs
                from these folding-doors, which were numerous and heavy; and it was not the
                workmanship of these, but the weight which pleased him. And so he left the
                folding-doors in such state, that, though they had formerly contributed greatly to
                the ornament of the temple, they now seemed to have been made only for the purpose
                of shutting it up. </p>

                their ancestors, are to be carefully worshipped and retained by themselves; and
                secondly, because this sort of ornament, these works and specimens of art, these

                therefore by their complaints we can understand that these things appear most bitter

                that though both our allies and foreign nations have during these past years

                sudden Heraclius came to me, who was in office at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse"
                  >Syracuse</placeName>, a man of high birth, who had been priest of
                    <persName><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName>, which is the highest honour
                among the Syracusans; he requests of me and of my brother, if we have no objection,
                to go to their senate; that they were at that moment assembled in full numbers in
                the senate-house, and he said that he made this request to us to attend by command
                of the senate. </p>

            <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="138" resp="perseus">
              <p>At first we were in doubt what to do; but afterwards it soon occurred to us that we
                ought not to shun that assembly or that place. <milestone n="62" unit="chapter"
                  /><milestone unit="Para"/> Therefore we came to the senate-house; they all rise at
                our entry to do us honour. We sat down at the request of the magistrates. Diodorus
                the son of Timarchides, who was the first man in that body both in influence and in
                age, and also as it seemed to me in experience and knowledge of business, began to
                speak; and the first sentence of his speech was to this effect—That the senate and
                people of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>were grieved and
                indignant, that, though in all the other cities of <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>I had informed the senate and people of what I proposed for
                their advantage or for their safety, and though I had received from them all
                commissions, deputies, letters and evidence, yet in that city I had done nothing of
                that sort. I answered, that deputies from the Syracusans had not been present at
                  <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>in that assembly of the Sicilians
                when my assistance was entreated by the common resolution of all the deputations,
                and when the cause of the whole of <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                >Sicily</placeName>was entrusted to me; and that I could not ask that any decree
                should be passed against Caius Verres in that senate-house in which I saw a gilt
                statue of Caius Verres. </p>

            <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="139" resp="perseus">
              <p>And after I said that, such a groaning ensued at the sight and mention of the
                statue, that it appeared to have been placed in the senate-house as a monument of
                his wickednesses and not of his services. Then every one for himself, as fast as
                each could manage to speak, began to give me information of those things which I
                have just now mentioned; to tell me that the city was plundered—the temples stripped
                of their treasures—that of the inheritance of Heraclius, which he had adjudged to
                the men of the palaestra, he had taken by far the greatest share himself; and
                indeed, that they could not expect that he should care for the men of the palaestra,
                when he had taken away even the god who was the inventor of oil; that that statue
                had neither been made at the public expense, nor erected by public authority, but
                that those men who had been the sharers in the plunder of the inheritance of
                Heraclius, had had it made and placed where it was; and that those same men had been
                the deputies at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, who had been his
                assistants in dishonesty, his partners in his thefts and the witnesses of his
                debaucheries; and that therefore I ought the less to wonder if they were wanting to
                the unanimity of the deputies and to the safety of <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>. </p>

              <p>When I perceived that their indignation at that man's injuries was not only not
                less, but almost greater than that of the rest of the Sicilians, then I explained my
                own intentions to them, and my whole plan and system with reference to the whole of
                the business which I had undertaken; then I exhorted them not to be wanting to the
                common cause and the common safety, and to rescind that panegyric which they had
                voted a few days before, being compelled, a, they said, by violence and fear.
                Accordingly, O judges, the Syracusans, that man's clients and friends, do this.
                First of all, they produce to me the public documents which they had carefully
                stored up in the most sacred part of the treasury; in which they show me that
                everything, which I have said had been taken away, was entered, and even more things
                than I was able to mention. And they were entered in this way. “What had been taken
                out of the temple of Minerva .. This,... and that.” “What was missing out of the
                temple of <persName><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName>.” “What was missing out of
                the temple of Bacchus.” As each individual had had the charge of protecting and
                preserving those things, so it was entered; that each, when according to law he gave
                in his accounts, being bound to give up what he had received, had begged that he
                might be pardoned for the absence of these things and that all had accordingly been
                released from liability on that account, and that it was kept secret; all which
                documents I took care to have sealed up with the public seal and brought away. </p>

            <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="141" resp="perseus">
              <p>But concerning the public panegyric on him this explanation was given: that at
                first, when the letters arrived from Verres about the panegyric, a little while
                before my arrival, nothing had been decreed; and after that, when some of his
                friends urged them that it ought to be decreed, they were rejected with the greatest
                outcry and the bitterest reproaches; but when I was on the point of arriving, then
                he who at that time was the chief governor had commanded them to decree it, and that
                it had been decreed in such a manner that the panegyric did him more damage than it
                could have done him good. So now, judges, do you receive the truth of that matter
                from me just as it was shown to me by them. </p>

              <p>It is a custom at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, that, if
                a motion on any subject is brought before the senate, whoever wishes, gives his
                opinion on it. No one is asked by name for his sentiments; nevertheless, those are
                accustomed to speak first of their own accord, and naturally, according as they are
                superior in honour or in age; and that precedence is yielded to them by the rest;
                but, if at any time all are silent, then they are compelled to speak by lot. This
                was the custom when the motion was made respecting the panegyric of Verres. On which
                subject at first great numbers speak, in order to delay coming to any vote, and
                interpose this objection, that formerly, when they had heard that there was a
                prosecution instituted against Sextus Peducaeus, who had deserved admirably well of
                that city and of the whole province, and when, in return for his numerous and
                important services, they wished to vote a panegyric on him, they had been prohibited
                from doing so by Caius Verres; and that it would be an unjust thing, although
                Peducaeus had now no need of their praise, still not to vote that which at one time
                they had been eager to vote, before decreeing what they would only decree from
                compulsion. </p>

              <p>All shout in assent, and say approvingly that that is what ought to be done. So the
                question about Peducaeus is put to the senate. Each man gave his opinion in order,
                according as he had precedence in age and honour. You may learn this from the
                resolution itself; for the opinions delivered by the chief men are generally
                recorded. Read— [The list of speeches made on the subject of Sextus Peducaeus is
                read.] It says who were the chief supporters of the motion. The vote is carried.
                Then the question about Verres is put. Tell me, I pray, what happened. [The list of
                speeches made on the subject of Caius Verres....] Well what comes next? [As no one
                rose, and no one delivered his opinion....] What is this? [They proceed by lot.] Why
                was this? Was no one a willing praiser of your praetorship, or a willing defender of
                you from danger, especially when by being so he might have gained favour with the
                praetor? No one. Those very men who used to feast with you, your advisers and
                accomplices, did not venture to utter a word. In that very senate-house in which a
                statue of yourself and a naked statue of your son were standing, was there no one
                whom even your naked son in a province stripped naked could move to compassion? </p>

              <p>Moreover they inform me also of this, that they had passed the vote of panegyric in
                such a form that all men might see that it was not a panegyric, but rather a satire,
                to remind every one of his shameful and disastrous praetorship. For in truth it was
                drawn up in these words. “Because he had scourged no one.” From which you are to
                understand, that he had caused most noble and innocent men to be executed. “Because
                he had administered the affairs of the province with vigilance,” when all his vigils
                were well known to have been devoted to debauchery and adultery; moreover, there was
                this clause added, which the defendant could never venture to produce, and the
                accuser would never cease to dwell upon; “Because Verres had kept all pirates at a
                distance from the island of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>;” men

                  <milestone n="65" unit="chapter"/><milestone unit="Para"/> Immediately they pass a
                decree. First, “That my brother Lucius should be connected with the city by ties of
                hospitably;” because he had shown the same goodwill to the Syracusans that I had
                always felt myself. That they not only wrote at that time, but also had engraved on
                brazen tablets and presented to us. Truly very fond of you are your Syracusans whom
                you are always talking of, who think it quite a sufficient reason for forming an
                intimate connection with your accuser, that he is going to be your accuser, and that
                he has come among them for the purpose of prosecuting inquiries against you. After
                that, a decree is passed, not with any difference of opinion, but almost
                unanimously, “That the panegyric which had been decreed to Caius Verres, be
                rescinded.” </p>

            <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="146" resp="perseus">
              <p>But, when not only the vote had been come to, but when it had even been drawn up in
                due form and entered in the records, an appeal is made to the praetor. But who makes
                this appeal? Any magistrate? No. Any senator? Not even that. Any Syracusan? Far from
                it. Who, then, appeals to the praetor? The man who had been Verres's quaestor,
                Caesetius. Oh, the ridiculous business! Oh, the deserted man! O man despaired of and
                abandoned by the Sicilian magistracy! In order to prevent the Sicilians passing a
                resolution of the senate, or from obtaining their rights according to their own
                customs and their own laws, an appeal is made to the praetor, not by any friend of
                his, not by any connection, not, in short, by any Sicilian, but by his own quaestor.
                Who saw this? Who heard it? That just and wise praetor orders the senate to be
                adjourned. A great multitude flocks to me. First of all, the senators cry out that
                their rights are being taken away; that their liberty is being taken away. The
                people praise the senate and thank them. The Roman citizens do not leave me. And on
                that day I had no harder task, than with all my exertions to prevent violent hands

                rises from his seat and departs. And so we departed from the forum when it was now

                that, as for my having spoken in the Greek language to Greeks, that was a thing
                which could not be endured at all. I answered the man as I could, as I chose, and as
                I ought. Among other things, I recollect that I said that it was easy to be seen how
                great was the difference between him and the great Numidicus, the real and genuine
                Metellus. That that Metellus had refused to assist with his panegyric Lucius
                Lucullus, his sister's husband, with whom he was on the very best terms, but that he
                was procuring panegyrics from cities for a man totally unconnected with himself, by

                troublesome to me. For while he was foaming at the mouth, his eyes glaring, and he
                crying out as loud as he could that I was attacking him with violence, we came

              <p>Then I began to beg to be allowed to seal up and carry away the records. He spoke
                against me; he denied that there had been any regular resolution of the senate
                passed, since an appeal had been made to the praetor. He said that a copy of it
                ought not to be given to me. I read the act, that I was to be allowed all documents
                and records. He, like a crazy man as he was, urged that our laws had nothing to do
                with him. That intelligent praetor decided that he did not choose, as the resolution
                of the senate had no business ever to be ratified, to allow me to take a copy of it
                to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. Not to make a long story of it,
                if I had not threatened the man vigorously, if I had not read to him the provisions
                of the act passed in this case, and the penalties enacted by it, I should not have
                been allowed to have the documents. But that crazy fellow, who had declaimed against
                me most violently on behalf of Verres, when he found he did not succeed, in order I
                suppose to recover my favour, gives me a book in which all Verres's Syracusan thefts
                were set down, which I had already been informed of by, and had a list of from them.

                towards you as it has been treated by you; and among them that infamous Verrean
                festival, instituted by you, has been abolished. In truth, it was a most unseemly
                thing for honours such as belong to the gods to be paid to the man who had carried
                off the images of the gods. In truth, that conduct of the Syracusans would be
                deservedly reproached, If, when they had struck a most celebrated and solemn day of
                festival games out of their annals, because on that day <placeName

                Verres; though he had plundered the Syracusans of all which that day of disaster had
                left them. But observe the shamelessness and arrogance of the man, O judges, who not
                only instituted this disgraceful and ridiculous Verrean festival out of the money of
                Heraclius, but who also ordered the Marcellean festival to be abolished, in order
                that they might every year offer sacrifices to the man by whose means they had lost
                the sacred festivals which they had ever observed, and had lost their national
                deities, and that they might take away the festival days in honour of that family by
                whose means they had recovered all their other festivals. </p>

              <head>The Argument.</head>
              <p>This speech is divided into three divisions. First of all Cicero speaks of the
                conduct of Verres with respect to the war of the runaway slaves, which arose out of
                the relics of the war of Spartacus, which was brought to a termination just before
                the end of Verres's praetorship. In the second place he speaks of his conduct with
                respect to the pirates and banditti, who at that time infested the sea and the
                coasts of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. And in the third place he
                impeaches him on account of the punishments he had inflicted on Roman citizens. But
                this last topic takes up, comparatively speaking, but a small part of the oration,
                though it has given the title to the whole oration. In the first two divisions of
                the speech Cicero is mainly occupied in replying to Hortensius, who had highly
                extolled Verres's military conduct and valour. </p>

            <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1" resp="perseus">
              <p>I see, O judges, that it is not doubtful to any one of you that Caius Verres most
                openly plundered everything in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>,
                whether sacred or profane, whether private or public property; and that, not only
                without the slightest scruple, but without even the very least disguise, he
                practiced every possible description of robbery and plunder. But a very heightened
                and pompous defence of him is put forward in reply to me, which I must consider very
                carefully beforehand, O judges, how I am to resist. For his cause is stated in this
                way; that by his valour, and by his singular vigilance exerted at a critical and
                perilous time, the province of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> was
                preserved in safety from fugitive slaves, and from the dangers of war. </p>

            <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2" resp="perseus">
              <p>What am I to do, O judges? In what way am I to shape my accusation? which way am I
                to turn? For to all my attacks the appellation of a gallant general is opposed, as a
                wall of defence. I am acquainted with the topic;—I see how Hortensius is going to
                boast himself. He will dilate upon the dangers of the war, the critical time of the
                republic, the scarcity of able generals; and that he will entreat of you, he will
                even claim as a right belonging to himself, that you do not suffer so great a
                general to be taken from the Roman people through the evidence of the Sicilians;
                that you do not allow his glory as a general to be overclouded by accusations of
                avarice. </p>

            <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3" resp="perseus">
              <p>I cannot dissemble my alarm, O judges; I am afraid that Caius Verres, on account of
                this amazing warlike valour of his, may escape with impunity from the consequences
                of all his actions. For it occurs to me, what great influence, what exceeding
                authority, the oration of Marcus Antonius was supposed to have had at the trial of
                Marcus Aquillius; who, as he was not only skillful as an orator, but bold also, when
                he had nearly finished his speech, took hold of Marcus Aquillius and placed him in
                the sight of every one, and tore his robe away from his chest, in order that the
                Roman people and the judges might see his scars, all received in front; and at the
                same time he enlarged a good deal on that wound which he had received on his head
                from the general of the enemy; and worked up the men who were to judge in the cause
                to such a pitch, that they were greatly afraid lest the man whom fortune had saved
                from the weapons of the enemy, and who had not spared himself, should appear to have
                been saved not to receive praise from the Roman people, but to endure the cruelty of
                the judges. Now again this same plan and method of defence is to be tried by the
                opposite party. </p>

                may he the very chief man in every sort of vice and criminality; but he is a gallant
                general and a fortunate one, and he must be preserved for the critical emergencies
                of the republic.

                praise; a very honourable boast. But in what war? For we have understood that after
                that war which Marcus Aquillius finished, there has been no war of fugitive slaves

                Do you think that you are to share any of the glory of that victory with Marcus
                Crassus or Cnaeus Pompeius? I do not suppose that even this will be too great a
                stretch for your impudence, to venture to say something of that sort. You, forsooth,
                hindered any part of the forces of these slaves from passing over from <placeName

                taken, by the courage and prudence of Marcus Crassus, that most valiant man, that
                the runaways should not make boats so as to be able to cross the strait to
                  <placeName key="tgn,7003897">Messana</placeName>; an attempt from which it would
                not have been so important to have cut them off, if there were supposed to have been

                What has the proximity of the countries to do with either side of the argument in
                discussing this topic? Will you say that access was very easy to the enemy, or that
                the contagion and temptation of imitating that war was a dangerous one? Every access
                to the island was not only difficult to, but was entirely cut off from men who had
                no ships; so that it was more easy for those men, to whom you say that <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> was so near, to go to the shore of the ocean

              <p>But as for the contagious nature to that servile war, why is it spoken of by you
                more than by all the rest of the officers who were governors of the other provinces?
                Is it because before that time there had been wars of runaway slaves in <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>? But that is the very cause why that province
                is now and has been in the least danger. For ever since Marcus Aquillius left it all
                the regulations and edicts of the praetors have been to this effect, that no slave
                should ever be seen with a weapon. What I am going to mention is an old story, and
                one, probably, owing to the severity of the example, not unknown to any one of you.
                They tell a story that Lucius Domitius was praetor in <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
                  >Sicily</placeName>, and that an immense boar was brought to him; that he,
                marveling at the size of the beast, asked who had killed it. When he was told that
                it was such-an-one's shepherd, he ordered him to be summoned before him; that the
                shepherd came eagerly to the praetor, expecting praise and reward; that Domitius
                asked him how he had slain so huge a beast; that he answered “With a hunting spear;”
                and that he was instantly crucified by order of the praetor. This may, perhaps,
                appear harsh: I say nothing either way; all that I understand from the story is,
                that Domitius preferred to appear cruel in punishing, to seeming negligent in
                overlooking offences.</p>

                the servile war. For at that time <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>
                easily took care of itself, so that no war could possibly arise there. In truth, as
                no two things are so closely united as the traders are with the Sicilians, by habit,
                by interest, by reason, and by community of sentiment; and as the Sicilians have all

 What happened afterwards? What do you suppose? Perhaps you expect
                to hear of some robbery or plunder;—do not look on all occasions for the same
                things—when a man is in fear of war, what room is there for petty thefts? However,
                even if there was any opportunity for such a thing in this matter, it was
                overlooked. Perhaps he could have got some money out of Leonidas when he summoned
                him to appear. There was besides room for bargaining, (and that was an opportunity
                that he was not new to,) to get the cause adjourned; and a second chance, to get the
                slaves acquitted. But when the slaves had been condemned, what opportunity of
                plundering could there be? They must be brought up for punishment. For there were
                the witnesses who were sitting on the bench; the public records were witnesses; that
                most splendid city of <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName> was a
                witness; that most honourable and numerous assembly of Roman citizens was a witness.

                fresh circumstances having been brought to light, without any defence having been
                made, or any trial having taken place? And I will affirm that there is so much
                suspicion attached to this charge, that, without any arguments of mine, I will allow
                the judges to form their own opinion as to what a system of plundering this was, how

                money. You will find that they were all so continued in the case of this one wealthy
                man, as by their example to cause a fear of similar suffering and danger to all
                others. In the first place, there was a sudden accusation of a capital and
                detestable crime; judge what you think this worth, and how many have bought
                themselves off from such charges. In the next place, there is an accusation without
                an accuser, a sentence without any bench of judges, a condemnation without any
                defence having been made. Estimate the money to be got by all these transactions,
                and then suppose that Apollonius alone was an actual victim to these atrocities, but
                that all the rest, as many as they were, delivered themselves from these sufferings
                by money. Lastly, there were darkness, chains, imprisonment, punishment within the
                prison, seclusion from the sight of his parents and of his children, a denial of the
                free air and common light of heaven; but these things, which a man might freely give

                present at his banquets. If there were some a little modest, they used to come at
                the proper time, and avoided the light of day, and the crowd. And these banquets
                were celebrated, not with the orderly silence of the banquets of praetors and
                generals of the Roman people, nor with that modesty which is usually found at the
                entertainments of magistrates, but with the most excessive noise and licence of
                conversation sometimes even affairs proceeded to blows and fighting. For that strict
                and diligent praetor, who had never obeyed the laws of the Roman people, observed
                most carefully those rules which are laid down for drinking parties. And accordingly
                the ends of these banquets were such that men were often carried out from the feast
                as from a battle; others were left on the ground as dead; numbers lay prostrate
                without sense or feeling, so that any one who beheld the scene would have supposed
                that he was looking not on a banquet of a praetor, but on the battle of <placeName

                curve from the shore of the open sea towards the city, he pitched tents of fine
                linen curtains; thither he migrated from the praetorian palace which had belonged to
                king Hiero, and lived here so that during the whole summer no one ever saw him out
                of his tent. And to that tent no one had access unless he was either a boon
                companion, or a minister of his lust. Hither came all the women with whom he had any

                  >Rome</placeName> on any law business, who was so ill-informed of what was going
                on as not to know that all the laws of the Roman people were regulated by the will
                and pleasure of Chelidon the prostitute. The other is that, after he had left the
                city in the robe of war,—after he had pronounced the solemn vows for the success of
                his administration, and for the common welfare of the republic, he was accustomed,
                for the sake of committing adultery, to be brought back into the city, at night, in
                a litter, to a woman who, though the wife of one man, was common to all men,

              <p>What answer will you make to me now? Unless, perhaps, you say what, although it
                cannot possibly be admitted as an excuse, yet must be urged in a trial for
                extortion, that that ship was built with your own money. Dare, at least, to say this
                which is necessary. Do not be afraid, O Hortensius, of my asking how it became
                lawful for a senator to build a ship? Those are old and dead laws, as you are
                accustomed to call them, which forbid it. There was such a republic here, once, O
                judges; there was such strictness in the tribunals, that an accuser would have
                thought such a transaction worthy to be classed among the most serious crimes. For
                what did you want of a ship? when, if you were going anywhere on account of the
                state, ships were provided for you at the public expense, both to convey you, and to
                guard you? But it is not possible for you to go anywhere on your own private
                account, nor to send for articles across the sea from those countries in which it is
                not lawful for you to have any possessions, or any dealings. </p>

              <p>Then, why have you prepared anything contrary to the laws? This charge would have
                had weight in the ancient severity and dignity of the republic. Now, I not only do
                not accuse you on account of this offence, but I do not even reprove you with an
                ordinary reprimand. Lastly, did you never think that this would be discreditable to
                you? did you never think it would be ground for an accusation, or cause for
                unpopularity, to have a transport openly built for you, in a most frequented place
                in that province in which you had the supreme command? What did you suppose that
                they said who saw it? What did you suppose that they thought who heard of it? Did
                they think that you were going to take that vessel to <placeName key="tgn,1000080"
                  >Italy</placeName>, empty? that you were going to let it out as a sailing boat,

                the coast, and that you were preparing a merchant vessel for the purpose of moving
                your crops. Did you wish every man's conversation to be such as for men to say
                openly that you were preparing that ship to carry all your plunder from <placeName
                  key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, and to go to and fro for the booty which you
                had left behind? </p>

            <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47" resp="perseus">
              <p>But, however, I give up and grant the whole of this, if you say that the vessel was
                built with your money. But, O most demented of men, are you not aware that this
                ground was cut from under your feet by those very friends of yours, the Mamertines
                themselves, in the previous pleading? For Heius, the chief man of the city,—the
                chief man of that deputation which was sent to utter a panegyric on you, said that
                the ship had been built for you by the public labour of the Mamertines, and that a
                Mamertine Senator had been appointed by public authority to superintend the building
                of it. The only thing that remains is the materials. And this you yourself compelled
                the Rhegians to furnish at the public expense, as they say themselves (not that you
                can deny it), because the Mamertines have no proper materials. 
                
<milestone n="19" unit="chapter"/><milestone unit="Para"/>
 If both the materials of which the vessel is built, and if those
                who built it, were provided by your authority, not at your expense, what, then, is
                the secret thing which you say was paid for with your money? Oh! but the Mamertines
                have no enemies respecting it in their public accounts. </p>

              <p>In the first place, I can understand that it may be possible that they did not
                disburse any money out of the treasury. In fact, even the Capitol, as it was built
                in the time of our ancestors, was able to be built and completed by public
                authority, but without any public payment, workmen being pressed into the service,
                and a fair quota of work being exacted from each person respectively. In the next
                place, I see this also, (which I will prove when I produce my witnesses, from the
                accounts of the Mamertines themselves,) that a great deal of money was spent by that
                man which was entered as paid for imaginary contracts for works that never existed.
                For it is not at all strange that the Mamertines should in their accounts have shown
                a regard for that man's safety, from whom they had received the greatest benefits,
                and whom they had known to be much more friendly to them than he was to the Roman
                people. But if it is any argument that the Mamertines did not give you money,
                because they have not got it down in their accounts, let it be an argument also that
                the ship cost you nothing, because you have no entry to produce of having bought it,
                or having made a contract with any one to build it for you. </p>

                  demanded from, or hostilities declared against any foreign state. They were the
                  especial arbiters of peace, of war, and of treaties. Their number was probably
                  twenty. They were selected from the most noble families, and their office was held
                  for life. The name is of uncertain derivation—See Smith, Dict. Ant. p. 416,

                to furnish ships contrary to the provisions of the treaty. But still you, O you

                city, to furnish a ship? Will you make any one believe that, while the case of both
                the states was exactly the same, the law that you administered, and the condition in
                which you left each, was so different, without money being the cause of the

                to both treaties, compelled the Tauromenians to furnish one, and excused the
                Mamertines? Can it, then, be doubtful to any one that, while Verres was praetor,
                that merchant-vessel was a greater assistance to the Mamertines than the treaty was
                to the Tauromenians? Let the treaties be read. [The treaties of the Mamertines and

                the case itself proves,—you detracted from the majesty of the republic, you
                diminished the reinforcements of the Roman people—you diminished their resources,
                acquired by the valour and wisdom of their ancestors; you destroyed their imperial
                rights, and the terms on which the allies became such, and all recollection of the
                treaty. They who by the express words of the treaty were bound to send at their own
                expense and risk a ship properly armed and equipped with everything necessary, even
                as far as the ocean if we ordered them to do so, those men bought from you for money
                a release from the terms of the treaty, and a release from the lights of sovereignty
                which we had over them, so as to be excused from even sailing in that narrow sea

                bireme from being mentioned in it, if they could by any possibility have obtained
                such a favour from our ancestors? For when this heavy burden was imposed on the
                city, there was contained somehow or other in that treaty of alliance some badge, as
                it were, of slavery. That which then, when their services were recent, before the
                matter was finally determined, when the Roman people were in no difficulties, they

                Law. Why did you exact from them anything besides that in another class of
                contribution? What? Do those who are liable to the payment of tenths owe anything
                more than a single tenth, according to the Law of Hiero? Why have you fixed in their
                case also how much corn they were to be bound to sell to us, that being another
                description of contribution? Those who are exempt undoubtedly owe nothing. But you
                not only exacted this from them, but even by way of making them give more than they

              <p>But to return to the fleet, from which topic I have been digressing; you accepted a
                ship from the Mamertines contrary to the laws; you granted them relaxation contrary
                to the treaties; so that you behaved like a rogue twice in the case of one city, as
                you both granted indulgences which you had no right to grant, and accepted what it
                was not lawful for you to accept. You ought to have exacted a ship from them fit to
                sail against robbers, not to carry off the produce of your robberies; one which
                might have defended the province from being despoiled, not one that was to bear away
                the fresh spoils of the province. The Mamertines gave you both a city to which you
                might carry all the plunder you amassed from all quarters, and also a ship, in which
                you might take it away. That town was a receptacle for your plunder, those men were
                the witnesses to and guardians of your plunder; they supplied to you both a
                repository for your thefts, and a conveyance for them. In consequence, even when you
                had lost a fleet by your own avarice and worthlessness, you did not venture to
                require a ship of the Mamertines, at a time when our want of ships was so excessive,
                and the distress of the province so great, that, even if it had been necessary to
                beg as supplicants for a ship, they would have granted it. But all your power either
                of commanding a vessel to be furnished, or of begging for one, was crippled, not by
                the bireme supplied to the Roman people, but by that splendid merchant vessel given
                to the praetor. That was the price of your authority, of the reinforcement they were
                bound to supply, of exemption from the requirements of law, and usage, and of the

 Each city was always accustomed to give to its admiral the money
                necessary for the expense of the fleet, for provisions, for pay, and for all such
                things. The admiral did not dare to give the sailors any ground for accusing him,
                and was, besides, bound to render an account of the money to his fellow-citizens. In
                the whole business all the trouble and all the risk was his. This, I say, was the
                regular course not only in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, but in
                every province, even in the case of the pay and expense of the Latin allies, at the
                time when we were accustomed to employ their assistance. Verres was the first man,
                ever since our dominion was established, who ordered that all that money should be
                paid to him by the cities, in order that whoever he chose to appoint might have the

                executed the real captain of the pirates, he had on that account not executed him,

                long? Why, I say, while the Roman citizens who were taken in the pirate's company

                of life? </p>

                safety of the province, but might have been even profitable to himself. For in the

                indeed, I might have made no exception, but might have said that there was no man
                there at all, as there were only these two. Sometimes also his freedman Timarchides
                was admitted. But the women were all wives of citizens, of noble birth, except one
                the daughter of an actor named Isidorus, whom he, out of love, had seduced away from
                a Rhodian flute player. There was a woman called Pippa, the wife of Aeschrio the

                her, but still he had neither the power nor the courage to oppose the lust of the
                praetor; and at the same time he was bound to him by many presents and many good
                offices. But at that time Verres, though you well know how great his impudence is,

                  >Syracuse</placeName>, be quite easy in his mind at keeping her with him so many
                days on the seashore. Accordingly, he contrives a very singular plan. He gives the
                command of the fleet, which his lieutenant had had, to Cleomenes. He orders
                Cleomenes, a Syracusan, to command a fleet of the Roman people. He does this, in
                order that he might not only be absent from home all the time that he was at sea,
                but that he might be so willingly, being placed in a post of great honour and
                profit; and that he himself in the meantime, the husband being sent away to a
                distance, might have her with him,—I will not say more easily than before, for who
                ever opposed his lust? but with a rather more tranquil mind, as he had got rid of
                him, not as a husband but as a rival.—Cleomenes, a Syracusan, takes the command of a
                fleet of our allies and friends. </p>

                Verres by such an action taken away all the honour due to worth, to justice, and to

                that part of the city. For it is a place which even a very few men can defend. And
                therefore he would not entrust it to any but the most faithful men; and he had
                another reason too, because in that part of the city there is access to ships from
                the open sea. Therefore he did not think fit to entrust the keys of the place to

                spent, like him, all his days in drinking in a tent which he had pitched on the

                in the harbour of Odyssea; for that is the name of the place. But our fleet was in
                the harbour of Pachynum. But Cleomenes, because there was a garrison of troops (in
                name, if not in reality) in that place, fancied that, with the soldiers he drew from
                thence, he might make up his proper complement of sailors and rowers. The same
                system was found to nave been put in practice by that most covetous man with respect

                sailer; for, while Verres was praetor, no one had any opportunity of knowing what
                each ship could do with oars; although in order to do honour and to show favour to
                Cleomenes, there was a much smaller deficiency of rowers and soldiers in that

                strength that hunger had left them. And if Cleomenes had not run away so long
                before, there would have been some means of making resistance, for that ship was the
                only one with a deck, and was large enough to have been a bulwark to the rest, and
                if it had been engaged in battle with the pirates, it would have looked like a city

                the last ships first, and so the Haluntian vessel is taken first, which was

              <p>While all this was going on, in the meantime Cleomenes had already arrived at
                Elorum, already he had hastened on land from the ship, and had left the quadrireme
                tossing about in the surf. The rest of the captains of ships, when the

                of escaping by sea, ran their ships ashore at Elorum, and followed Cleomenes. Then
                Heracleo, the captain of the pirates, being suddenly victorious, beyond all his
                hopes, not through any valour of his own, but owing to the avarice and worthlessness
                of Verres, as soon as evening came on, ordered a most beautiful fleet belonging to

                night, the praetor was burning with the flame of the most disgraceful love, a fleet
                of the Roman people with the fire of pirates. It was a stormy night when the news of
                this terrible disaster was brought to Syracuse—men run to the praetor's house, to
                which his women had conducted him back a little while before from his splendid
                banquet, with songs and music. Cleomenes, although it was night, still does not dare
                to show himself in public. He shuts himself up in his house, but his wife was not
                there to console her husband in his misfortunes. </p>

                admitted; no one dared either to wake him if asleep, or to address him if awake. But
                now, when the affair had become known to everybody, a vast multitude was collecting
                in every part of the city; for the arrival of the pirates was not given notice of,
                as had formerly been the custom, by a fire raised on a watchtower, or a hill, but
                both the disaster that had already been sustained, and the danger that was

 When the praetor was inquired for, and when it was plain that no

                People began to talk to one another of his tent on the shore, of his flagitious
                banquets; the names of his women were called out by the crowd; men asked him openly

                understood that the praetor had removed his quarters from that place, they
                immediately, without any fear, began to penetrate to the harbour itself. When I say

                rowers, the want of food of the rest, the cowardice and desertion of Cleomenes. And
                when he heard this, he began to form this design. He had long since made up his mind
                that a prosecution would be instituted against him, long before this happened, as
                you have heard him say himself at the former pleading. He saw that if those naval

                possible for him to put Phalargus the Centuripan, one of the naval captains, to

                falsely,)—what, I say, could Cleomenes have done of any consequence, when his ships
                had been dismantled by the avarice of Verres? And they see him sitting by the side
                of the praetor, and whispering familiarly in his ear, as he was accustomed to do.
                But then it did seem a most scandalous thing to every one, that most honourable men,
                chosen by their own cities, should be put in chains and in prison, but that
                Cleomenes, on account of his partnership with him in debauchery and infamy, should
                be the praetor's most familiar friend. </p>

                no place had ever any existence. The father of one came forward, Dexis the

                yourself, at whose house you had been, whom you had called your friend. When you saw

                  >Sicily</placeName>. In that man there was courage enough, not only to attack
                Verres, for that indeed, as he saw that he was sure to die, he was aware that he
                could do without any danger; but when his death was settled, while his mother was
                sitting in his prison, night and day weeping, he wrote out the defence which his

                In it he states how many sailors he received from his city; how many Verres
                discharged, and for how much he discharged each of them; how many he had left. He
                makes similar statements with respect to the other ships and when he uttered these
                statements before you, he was scourged on the eyes. But when death was staring him
                in the face, he could easily endure pain of body; he cried out, what he has left
                also in writing, “That it was an infamous thing that the tears of an unchaste woman
                on behalf of the safety of Cleomenes should have more influence with you, than those

                prophesied of you,—“That it was not possible for Verres to efface his own crimes by
                murdering the witnesses; that he, in the shades below, should be a still more
                serious witness against him, in the opinion of sensible judges, than if he were

                be a witness to prove his avarice; but now, when he had been, put to death, he
                should be a witness of his wickedness, and audacity, and cruelty.” What follows is
                very fine,—“That, when your cause came to be tried, it would not be only the bands
                of witnesses, but the punishments inflicted on the innocent, and the furies that
                haunt the wicked, that would attend your trial; that he thought his own misfortune
                the lighter, because he had seen before now the edge of your axes, and the
                countenance and hand of Sextus your executioner, when in an assembly of Roman

                accusation in the matter of the fleet, let him defend him thus; let him leave out
                those common topics which have nothing to do with the business—that I am attributing
                to him blame which belongs to fortune; that I am imputing to him disaster as a
                crime; that I am accusing him of the loss of a fleet, when, in the uncertain risks
                of war which are common to both sides, many gallant men have often met with
                disasters both by land and sea. I am imputing to you nothing in which fortune was
                concerned; you have no pretext for bringing up the disasters of others; you have
                nothing to do with collecting instances of the misfortunes of many others. I say the
                ships were dismantled; I say the rowers and sailors were discharged; I say the rest
                had been living on the roots of wild palms; that a Sicilian was appointed to command
                a fleet of the Roman people; a Syracusan to command our allies and friends; I say
                that, all that time, and for many preceding days, you were spending your time in
                drunken revels on the sea-shore with your concubines; and I produce my informants

                object to the results of fortune being made a charge against them, are those who
                have committed themselves to her, and have encountered her perils and vicissitudes.
                But in that disaster of yours, fortune had no share at all. For men are accustomed
                to try the fortune of war, and to encounter danger in battles, not in banquets. But
                in that disaster of yours we cannot say that Mars had any share; we may say that
                Venus had. But if it is not right that the disasters of fortune should be imputed to
                you, why did you not allow her some weight in furnishing excuses and defence for

                our ancestors by accusation does not turn on any one's punishment. I do not say that
                no one ought to have been put to death; I do not say that all fear is to be removed
                from military service, severity from command, or punishment from guilt. I confess
                that there are many precedents for severe and terrible punishments inflicted not
                only on our allies, but even on our citizens and soldiers.

                 You may therefore omit all such topics as these. I prove that the
                fault was not in the naval captains, but in you. I accuse you of having discharged
                the soldiers and rowers for a bribe. The rest of the naval captains say the came.
                The confederate city of the Netians bears public testimony to the truth of this
                charge. The cities of Herbita, of Amestras, of <placeName key="tgn,7003916"

                their public testimony to the same effect. Last of all, your own witness, your own
                commander, your own host, Cleomenes, says this,—that he had landed on the coast in
                order to collect soldiers from Pachynum, where there was a garrison of troops, in
                order to put them on board the fleet; which he certainly would not have done if the
                ships had had their complement. For the system of ships when fully equipped and
                fully manned is such that you have no room, I will not say for many more, but for
                even one single man more. </p>

                blame, or that if blame must be attributable to some one, the greatest blame must be
                due to him who had the best ship, the largest crew, and the chief command; or, that
                if all were to blame, Cleomenes ought not to have been a spectator of the death and
                torture of those men. I say, besides, that in those executions, to allow of that
                traffic in tears, of that bargaining for an effective wound and a deadly blow, of

                the presence of a numerous body of inhabitants, Caius Servilius, a Roman citizen, an

                  >Panormus</placeName>, was beaten to the ground by rods and scourges before your

                  <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName> who did not see it. No one was
                in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> who did not hear of it. I assert

                asking what reason there was in the case of Servilius for this treatment, as if

                Pardon me this one error, O judges, for I will not in the rest of the cases ask for
                any reason. He had spoken rather freely of the dishonesty and worthlessness of
                Verres. And as soon as he was informed of this, he orders the man to <placeName

                instituted against him by one of the slaves of Verres. He gives security. He comes
                to <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>. Verres begins to compel him,
                though no one proceeded with any action against him, though no one made any claim on
                him, to be bound over in the sum of two thousand <foreign xml:lang="la"

                in the formula,—“If he had made any profit by robbery.”—He says that he will appoint
                judges out of his own retinue. Servilius demurs, and entreats that he may not be
                proceeded against by a capital prosecution before unjust judges, and where there is
                no prosecutor. </p>

                furiously with rods; then the lictor who was nearest to him, the man whom I have
                already often mentioned, Sextus, turning his stick round, began to beat the wretched
                man violently on the eyes. Therefore, when blood had filled his mouth and eyes, he
                fell down, and they, nevertheless, continued to beat him on the sides while lying on
                the ground, till he said at last he would give security. He, having been treated in
                this manner, was taken away from the place as dead, and, in a short time afterwards,
                he died. But that devoted servant of Venus, that man so rich in wit and politeness,
                erected a silver Cupid out of his property in the temple of Venus. And in this way

                that the name of citizenship did not avail with you even as much as to cause the

                powerful, or audacious, or ingenious in corrupting the tribunal, let them hold
                themselves ready, seeing that they will have to fight a battle with us, while the
                Roman people will be the judges of the contest. And if they know that, in the case
                of this criminal, whom the Sicilian nation has given me for my enemy, I have been
                sufficiently energetic, sufficiently persevering, and sufficiently vigilant, they
                may conceive that I shall be a much more formidable and active enemy to those men
                whose enmity I have encountered of my own accord, for the sake of the Roman people.
