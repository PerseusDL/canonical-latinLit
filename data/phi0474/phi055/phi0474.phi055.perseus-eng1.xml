<div1 type="book" n="1"><head>Book I: Moral Goodness</head>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/> My dear son Marcus, you have now been studying <note type="marg">Introduction: the importance of combining Greek and Latin studies.</note> a full year under Cratippus, and that too in
Athens, and you should be fully equipped with the
practical precepts and the principles of philosophy; so
much at least one might expect from the pre-eminence not only of your teacher but also of the city;
the former is able to enrich you with learning, the
latter to supply you with models. Nevertheless, just
as I for my own improvement have always combined
Greek and Latin studies&mdash;and I have done this not
only in the study of philosophy but also in the practice of oratory&mdash;so I recommend that you should do
the same, so that you may have equal command of
both languages. And it is in this very direction that
I have, if I mistake not, rendered a great service
to our countrymen, so that not only those who are
unacquainted with Greek literature but even the
cultured consider that they have gained much both
in oratorical power and in mental training.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/> You will, therefore, learn from the foremost of<note type="marg">Greek Philosophy and Cicero's own.</note>
present-day philosophers, and you will go on learning
as long as you wish; and your wish ought to continue
as long as you are not dissatisfied with the progress
you are making. For all that, if you will read my
philosophical books, you will be helped; my philosophy
is not very different from that of the Peripatetics (for
both they and I claim to be followers of Socrates and
Plato). As to the conclusions you may reach, I leave
that to your own judgment (for I would put no hindrance in your way), but by reading my philosophical


<pb id="p.5"/>

writings you will be sure to render your mastery of
the Latin language more complete. But I would by
no means have you think that this is said boastfully.
For there are many to whom I yield precedence in
knowledge of philosophy; but if I lay claim to the
orator's peculiar ability to speak with propriety,
clearness, elegance, I think my claim is in a measure
justified, for I have spent my life in that profession.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And therefore, my dear Cicero, I cordially recommend <note type="marg">Philosophy and oratory.</note> you to read carefully not only my orations
but also these<note>Cicero is alluding to his Republic, Tusculan Disputations,
Theories of the Supreme Good and Evil, The Nature of the
Gods, Academics, Hortensius, his essays on Friendship
(Laelius), Old Age (Cato), Fate, Divination, etc. (15 in all).</note> books of mine on philosophy, which
are now about as extensive. For while the orations
exhibit a more vigorous style, yet the unimpassioned,
restrained style of my philosophical productions is
also worth cultivating. Moreover, for the same man
to succeed in both departments, both in the forensic
style and in that of calm philosophic discussion has
not, I observe, been the good fortune of any one of the
Greeks so far, unless, perhaps, Demetrius of Phalerum
can be reckoned in that number&mdash;a clever reasoner,
indeed, and, though rather a spiritless orator, he is
yet charming, so that you can recognize in him the
disciple of Theophrastus. But let others judge how
much I have accomplished in each pursuit; I have
at least attempted both.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/> I believe, of course, that if Plato had been willing
to devote himself to forensic oratory, he could have
spoken with the greatest eloquence and power; and
that if Demosthenes had continued the studies he
pursued with Plato and had wished to expound his
views, he could have done so with elegance and
brilliancy. I feel the same way about Aristotle and
Isocrates, each of whom, engrossed in his own profession, undervalued that of the other.</p>


<pb id="p.7"/>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/> But since I have decided to write you a little<note type="marg">Statement of subject.</note>
now (and a great deal by and by), I wish, if possible,
to begin with a matter most suited at once to your
years and to my position. Although philosophy
offers many problems, both important and useful,
that have been fully and carefully discussed by
philosophers, those teachings which have been
handed down on the subject of moral duties seem
to have the widest practical application. For no
phase of life, whether public or private, whether in
business or in the home, whether one is working on
what concerns oneself alone or dealing with another,
can be without its moral duty; on the discharge
of such duties depends all that is morally right,
and on their neglect all that is morally wrong in
life.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Moreover, the subject of this inquiry is the common <note type="marg">The philosophic schools and ethical teaching.</note> property of all philosophers; for who would
presume to call himself a philosopher, if he did not
inculcate any lessons of duty? But there are some
schools that distort all notions of duty by the theories
they propose touching the supreme good and the
supreme evil. For he who posits the supreme good
as having no connection with virtue and measures it
not by a moral standard but by his own interests&mdash;
if he should be consistent and not rather at times
over-ruled by his better nature, he could value
neither friendship nor justice nor generosity; and
brave he surely cannot possibly be that counts pain
the supreme evil, nor temperate he that holds
pleasure to be the supreme good.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Although these truths are so self-evident that the<note type="marg">Reasons for choice of subject and authorities.</note>
subject does not call for discussion, still I have discussed it in another connection. If, therefore, these


<pb id="p.9"/>

schools should claim to be consistent, they could not
say anything about duty; and no fixed, invariable,
natural rules of duty can be posited except by those
who say that moral goodness is worth seeking solely
or chiefly for its own sake. Accordingly, the teaching of ethics is the peculiar right of the Stoics, the
Academicians, and the Peripatetics; for the theories
of Aristo, Pyrrho, and Erillus have been long since
rejected; and yet they would have the right to discuss duty if they had left us any power of choosing
between things, so that there might be a way of
finding out what duty is. I shall, therefore, at this
time and in this investigation follow chiefly the
Stoics, not as a translator, but, as is my custom, I
shall at my own option and discretion draw from
those sources in such measure and in such manner
as shall suit my purpose.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Since, therefore, the whole discussion is to be on
the subject of duty, I should like at the outset to
define what duty is, as, to my surprise, Panaetius has
failed to do. For every systematic development of any
subject ought to begin with a definition, so that everyone may understand what the discussion is about.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/> Every treatise on duty has two parts: one, <note type="marg">Classification of duties.</note>
dealing with the doctrine of the supreme good; the
other, with the practical rules by which daily life in all
its bearings may be regulated. The following questions are illustrative of the first part: whether all
duties are absolute; whether one duty is more important than another; and so on. But as regards
special duties for which positive rules are laid down,
though they are affected by the doctrine of the
supreme good, still the fact is not so obvious, because
they seem rather to look to the regulation of everyday <pb id="p.11"/> life; and it is these special duties that I propose
to treat at length in the following books.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And yet there is still another classification of
duties: we distinguish between <quote>mean</quote> <note>Cicero's technical terms are difficult because he has to
invent them to translate Greek that is perfectly simple:
<p><hi rend="italics">rectum</hi> is 'right,' i.e. perfect, absolute. Its opposite is
<hi rend="italics">medium,</hi> 'mean,' i.e. intermediate, falling short of the ' absolute' and occupying a middle ground; common; ordinary.</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">honestum</hi> is ' morally right'; as a noun, 'moral goodness'
(= <hi rend="italics">honestas</hi>); its opposite is <hi rend="italics">turpe,</hi> 'morally wrong.</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">honestas</hi> is 'moral rectitude,'&mdash;'moral goodness'; 'morality '; its opposite <hi rend="italics">turpitude,</hi> 'moral wrong,' ' immorality.'</p>
<p><hi rend="italics">honestus,</hi> on the other hand, is always 'honourable '; and
<hi rend="italics">honores</hi> are always ' offices of honour.'</p></note> duty, so called, and <quote>absolute</quote> duty. Absolute duty we
may, I presume, call <quote>right,</quote> for the Greeks call it
<foreign lang="greek">kato/rqwma,</foreign> while the ordinary duty they call <foreign lang="greek">kaqh=kon.</foreign>
And the meaning of those terms they fix thus: whatever is right they define as <quote>absolute</quote> duty, but
<quote>mean</quote> duty, they say, is duty for the performance
of which an adequate reason may be rendered.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The consideration necessary to determine conduct<note type="marg">The threefold classification of Panaetius.</note>
is, therefore, as Panaetius thinks, a threefold one:
first, people question whether the contemplated act
is morally right or morally wrong; and in such
deliberation their minds are often led to widely
divergent conclusions. And then they examine and
consider the question whether the action contemplated is or is not conducive to comfort and happiness
in life, to the command of means and wealth, to
influence, and to power, by which they may be able
to help themselves and their friends; this whole
matter turns upon a question of expediency. The
third type of question arises when that which seems
to be expedient seems to conflict with that which is
morally right; for when expediency seems to be pulling one way, while moral right seems to be calling
back in the opposite direction, the result is that the
mind is distracted in its inquiry and brings to it the
irresolution that is born of deliberation.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Although omission is a most serious defect in<note type="marg">The question is fivefold.</note>
classification, two points have been overlooked in


<pb id="p.13"/>

the foregoing:<note>For Panaetius was a Stoic, and the Stoics did not admit
that there were any degrees of right or wrong.</note> for we usually consider not only
whether an action is morally right or morally wrong,
but also, when a choice of two morally right courses
is offered, which one is morally better; and likewise,
when a choice of two expedients is offered, which one
is more expedient. Thus the question which Panaetius thought threefold ought, we find, to be divided
into five parts. First, therefore, we must discuss the
moral&mdash;and that, under two sub-heads; secondly, in
the same manner, the expedient; and finally, the
cases where they must be weighed against each other.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/> First of all, Nature has endowed every species<note type="marg">The essential differences between man and the lower animals.</note>
of living creature with the instinct of self-preservation, of avoiding what seems likely to cause injury
to life or limb, and of procuring and providing everything needful for life&mdash;food, shelter, and the like.
A common property of all creatures is also the
reproductive instinct (the purpose of which is the
propagation of the species) and also a certain amount<note type="marg">Instinct and Reason.</note>
of concern for their offspring. But the most marked
difference between man and beast is this: the beast,
just as far as it is moved by the senses and with
very little perception of past or future, adapts itself
to that alone which is present at the moment; while
man&mdash;because he is endowed with reason, by which
he comprehends the chain of consequences, perceives
the causes of things, understands the relation of
cause to effect and of effect to cause, draws analogies,
and connects and associates the present and the
future&mdash;easily surveys the course of his whole life
and makes the necessary preparations for its conduct.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Nature likewise by the power of reason associates
man with man in the common bonds of speech and<note type="marg">Family ties.</note>
life; she implants in him above all, I may say, a


<pb id="p.15"/>

strangely tender love for his offspring. She also
prompts men to meet in companies, to form public
assemblies and to take part in them themselves; and
she further dictates, as a consequence of this, the
effort on man's part to provide a store of things that
minister to his comforts and wants&mdash;and not for
himself alone, but for his wife and children and the
others whom he holds dear and for whom he ought
to provide; and this responsibility also stimulates
his courage and makes it stronger for the active
duties of life.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Above all, the search after truth and its eager<note type="marg">Search after truth.</note>
pursuit are peculiar to man. And so, when we have
leisure from the demands of business cares, we are
eager to see, to hear, to learn something new, and
we esteem a desire to know the secrets or wonders
of creation as indispensable to a happy life. Thus
we come to understand that what is true, simple,
and genuine appeals most strongly to a man's
nature. To this passion for discovering truth there
is added a hungering, as it were, for independence,
so that a mind well-moulded by Nature is unwilling
to be subject to anybody save one who gives rules of
conduct or is a teacher of truth or who, for the
general good, rules according to justice and law.
From this attitude come greatness of soul and a sense
of superiority to worldly conditions.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/> And it is no mean manifestation of Nature and<note type="marg">Moral sensibility.</note>
Reason that man is the only animal that has a feeling for order, for propriety, for moderation in word
and deed. And so no other animal has a sense of
beauty, loveliness, harmony in the visible world; and
Nature and Reason, extending the analogy of this
from the world of sense to the world of spirit, find that


<pb id="p.17"/>

beauty, consistency, order are far more to be maintained in thought and deed, and the same Nature
and Reason are careful to do nothing in an improper
or unmanly fashion, and in every thought and deed
to do or think nothing capriciously.</p>
<p>It is from these elements that is forged and
fashioned that moral goodness which is the subject
of this inquiry&mdash;something that, even though it be
not generally ennobled, is still worthy of all honour;<note>Cicero plays on the double meaning of <hi rend="italics">honestum.:</hi> (1)
'moral goodness,' and (2) ' honourable,' ' distinguished,'
etc.</note>
and by its own nature, we correctly maintain, it
merits praise, even though it be praised by none.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/> You see here, Marcus, my son, the very form
and as it were the face of Moral Goodness; <quote>and if,</quote>
as Plato says, <quote>it could be seen with the physical eye,
it would awaken a marvellous love of wisdom.</quote> But
all that is morally right rises from some one of
four sources: it is concerned either (1) with the<note type="marg">The four Cardinal Virtues.</note>
full perception and intelligent development of the
true; or (2) with the conservation of organized
society, with rendering to every man his due, and
with the faithful discharge of obligations assumed;
or (3) with the greatness and strength of a noble
and invincible spirit; or (4) with the orderliness
and moderation of everything that is said and done,
wherein consist temperance and self-control.</p>
<p><milestone unit="alternatesection" n="15"/> Although these four are connected and interwoven, <note type="marg">Their several provinces.</note> still it is in each one considered singly that
certain definite kinds of moral duties have their
origin: in that category, for instance, which was
designated first in our division and in which we
place wisdom and prudence, belong the search after
truth and its discovery; and this is the peculiar
province of that virtue.<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>  For the more clearly anyone observes the most essential truth in any given


<pb id="p.19"/>

case and the more quickly and accurately he can
see and explain the reasons for it, the more understanding and wise he is generally esteemed, and
justly so. So, then, it is truth that is, as it were,
the stuff with which this virtue has to deal and on
which it employs itself.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Before the three remaining virtues, on the other
hand, is set the task of providing and maintaining
those things on which the practical business of life
depends, so that the relations of man to man in
human society may be conserved, and that largeness
and nobility of soul may be revealed not only in
increasing one's resources and acquiring advantages
for one's self and one's family but far more in rising
superior to these very things. But orderly behaviour
and consistency of demeanour and self-control and
the like have their sphere in that department of
things in which a certain amount of physical exertion, and not mental activity merely, is required.
For if we bring a certain amount of propriety and
order into the transactions of daily life, we shall be
conserving moral rectitude and moral dignity.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="18"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/> Now, of the four divisions which we have<note type="marg">A. Wisdom.</note>
made of the essential idea of moral goodness, the
first, consisting in the knowledge of truth, touches
human nature most closely. For we are all attracted
and drawn to a zeal for learning and knowing; and
we think it glorious to excel therein, while we count
it base and immoral to fall into error, to wander
from the truth, to be ignorant, to be led astray. In
this pursuit, which is both natural and morally
right, two errors are to be avoided: first, we must
not treat the unknown as known and too readily
accept it; and he who wishes to avoid this error (as


<pb id="p.21"/>

all should do) will devote both time and attention
to the weighing of evidence.<milestone unit="section" n="19"/>  The other error is
that some people devote too much industry and too
deep study to matters that are obscure and difficult
and useless as well.</p>
<p>If these errors are successfully avoided, all the
labour and pains expended upon problems that are
morally right and worth the solving will be fully
rewarded. Such a worker in the field of astronomy,
for example, was Gaius Sulpicius, of whom we have
heard; in mathematics, Sextus Pompey, whom I
have known personally; in dialectics, many; in civil
law, still more. All these professions are occupied
with the search after truth; but to be drawn by
study away from active life is contrary to moral
duty. For the whole glory of virtue is in activity;
activity, however, may often be interrupted, and
many opportunities for returning to study are opened.
Besides, the working of the mind, which is never at
rest, can keep us busy in the pursuit of knowledge
even without conscious effort on our part. Moreover, all our thought and mental activity will be
devoted either to planning for things that are morally
right and that conduce to a good and happy life, or
to the pursuits of science and learning.</p>
<p>With this we close the discussion of the first
source of duty.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="20"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/> Of the three remaining divisions, the most<note type="marg">B. Justice</note>
extensive in its application is the principle by which
society and what we may call its <quote>common bonds</quote>
are maintained. Of this again there are two
divisions&mdash;justice, in which is the crowning glory
of the virtues and on the basis of which men are
called <quote>good men</quote>; and, close akin to justice,


<pb id="p.23"/>

charity, which may also be called kindness or
generosity.</p>
<p>The first office of justice is to keep one man from
doing harm to another, unless provoked by wrong;
and the next is to lead men to use common possessions for the common interests, private property
for their own.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="21"/> There is, however, no such thing as private<note type="marg">Public <hi rend="italics">vs.</hi> private interests.</note>
ownership established by nature, but property becomes private either through long occupancy (as in
the case of those who long ago settled in unoccupied
territory) or through conquest (as in the case of
those who took it in war) or by due process of law,
bargain, or purchase, or by allotment. On this principle the lands of Arpinum are said to belong to the
Arpinates, the Tusculan lands to the Tusculans; and
similar is the assignment of private property. Therefore, inasmuch as in each case some of those things
which by nature had been common property became the property of individuals, each one should
retain possession of that which has fallen to his lot;
and if anyone appropriates to himself anything
beyond that, he will be violating the laws of human
society.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="22"/> But since, as Plato has admirably expressed it, we
are not born for ourselves alone, but our country
claims a share of our being, and our friends a share;
and since, as the Stoics hold, everything that the
earth produces is created for man's use; and as men,
too, are born for the sake of men, that they may be
able mutually to help one another; in this direction
we ought to follow Nature as our guide, to contribute to the general good by an interchange of acts
of kindness, by giving and receiving, and thus by


<pb id="p.25"/>

our skill, our industry, and our talents to cement
human society more closely together, man to man.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="23"/> The foundation of justice, moreover, is good faith&mdash;<note type="marg">Good faith</note>
that is, truth and fidelity to promises and agreements. And therefore we may follow the Stoics,
who diligently investigate the etymology of words;
and we may accept their statement that <quote>good faith</quote>
is so called because what is promised is <quote>made good,</quote>
although some may find this derivation<note>Of course, <quote>good faith</quote> <quote>and made good</quote> have just as
little etymological connection as <hi rend="italics">fiat</hi> and <hi rend="italics">fidem.</hi></note> rather farfetched.</p>
<p>There are, on the other hand, two kinds of injustice&mdash;the <note type="marg">Injustice; active and passive.</note> one, on the part of those who inflict wrong,
the other on the part of those who, when they can, do
not shield from wrong those upon whom it is being
inflicted. For he who, under the influence of anger
or some other passion, wrongfully assaults another
seems, as it were, to be laying violent hands upon a
comrade; but he who does not prevent or oppose
wrong, if he can, is just as guilty of wrong as if he
deserted his parents or his friends or his country.
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/> Then, too, those very wrongs which people try to inflict on purpose to injure are often the result of fear:
that is, he who premeditates injuring another is
afraid that, if he does not do so, he may himself be
made to suffer some hurt. But, for the most part,
people are led to wrong-doing in order to secure
some personal end; in this vice, avarice is generally
the controlling motive.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="25"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/> Again, men seek riches partly to supply
the needs of life, partly to secure the enjoyment of
pleasure. With those who cherish higher ambitions,<note type="marg">The dangers of ambition.</note>
the desire for wealth is entertained with a view to
power and influence and the means of bestowing
favours; Marcus Crassus, for example, not long since


<pb id="p.27"/>

declared that no amount of wealth was enough for
the man who aspired to be the foremost citizen of
the state, unless with the income from it he could
maintain an army. Fine establishments and the
comforts of life in elegance and abundance also
afford pleasure, and the desire to secure it gives rise
to the insatiable thirst for wealth. Still, I do not
mean to find fault with the accumulation of property,
provided it hurts nobody, but unjust acquisition of
it is always to be avoided.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="26"/> The great majority of people, however, when
they fall a prey to ambition for either military or
civil authority, are carried away by it so completely
that they quite lose sight of the claims of justice.
For Ennius says:

<quote rend="blockquote">
<l part="F">There is no fellowship inviolate,</l>
<l>No faith is kept, when kingship is concerned;</l></quote>

and the truth of his words has an uncommonly wide
application. For whenever a situation is of such
a nature that not more than one can hold preeminence in it, competition for it usually becomes
so keen that it is an extremely difficult matter to
maintain a <quote>fellowship inviolate.</quote> We saw this<note type="marg">Caesar.</note>
proved but now in the effrontery of Gaius Caesar,
who, to gain that sovereign power which by a depraved imagination he had conceived in his fancy,
trod underfoot all laws of gods and men. But the
trouble about this matter is that it is in the greatest
souls and in the most brilliant geniuses that we usually
find ambitions for civil and military authority, for power,
and for glory, springing up; and therefore we must be
the more heedful not to go wrong in that direction.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="27"/> But in any case of injustice it makes a vast deal<note type="marg">The motives to wrong.</note>


<pb id="p.29"/>

of difference whether the wrong is done as a result
of some impulse of passion, which is usually brief
and transient, or whether it is committed wilfully and
with premeditation; for offences that come through
some sudden impulse are less culpable than those
committed designedly and with malice aforethought.</p>
<p>But enough has been said on the subject of inflicting injury.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="28"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/> The motives for failure to prevent injury and<note type="marg">Motives to passive injustice;</note>
so for slighting duty are likely to be various: people
either are reluctant to incur enmity or trouble or
expense; or through indifference, indolence, or incompetence, or through some preoccupation or selfinterest they are so absorbed that they suffer those to<note type="marg">a. Preoccupation.</note>
be neglected whom it is their duty to protect. And
so there is reason to fear that what Plato declares
of the philosophers may be inadequate, when he
says that they are just because they are busied with
the pursuit of truth and because they despise and
count as naught that which most men eagerly seek
and for which they are prone to do battle against
each other to the death. For they secure one sort
of justice, to be sure, in that they do no positive
wrong to anyone, but they fall into the opposite
injustice; for hampered by their pursuit of learning
they leave to their fate those whom they ought to
defend. And so, Plato thinks, they will not even
assume their civic duties except under compulsion.
But in fact it were better that they should assume
them of their own accord; for an action intrinsically right is just only on condition that it is
voluntary.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="29"/> There are some also who, either from zeal in<note type="marg">b. Self-interest.</note>
attending to their own business or through some


<pb id="p.31"/>

sort of aversion to their fellow-men, claim that they
are occupied solely with their own affairs, without
seeming to themselves to be doing anyone any injury.
But while they steer clear of the one kind of injustice,
they fall into the other: they are traitors to social
life, for they contribute to it none of their interest,
none of their effort, none of their means.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="30"/> Now since we have set forth the two kinds of<note type="marg">Rules of duty required by Justice.</note>
injustice and assigned the motives that lead to each,
and since we have previously established the principles by which justice is constituted, we shall be in
a position easily to decide what our duty on each
occasion is, unless we are extremely self-centred; for
indeed it is not an easy matter to be really concerned
with other people's affairs; and yet in Terence's play,
we know, Chremes <quote>thinks that nothing that concerns
man is foreign to him.</quote> Nevertheless, when things
turn out for our own good or ill, we realize it more
fully and feel it more deeply than when the same
things happen to others and we see them only, as it
were, in the far distance; and for this reason we
judge their case differently from our own. It is,
therefore, an excellent rule that they give who bid us
not to do a thing, when there is a doubt whether it
be right or wrong; for righteousness shines with a
brilliance of its own, but doubt is a sign that we are
thinking of a possible wrong.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="31"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/> But occasions often arise, when those duties<note type="marg">Change of duty in change of circumstances.</note>
which seem most becoming to the just man and to
the <quote>good man,</quote> as we call him, undergo a change
and take on a contrary aspect. It may, for example,
not be a duty to restore a trust or to fulfil a promise,
and it may become right and proper sometimes to
evade and not to observe what truth and honour


<pb id="p.33"/>

would usually demand. For we may well be guided
by those fundamental principles of justice which I
laid down at the outset: first, that no harm be done
to anyone; second, that the common interests be
conserved. When these are modified under changed
circumstances, moral duty also undergoes a change,
and it does not always remain the same.<milestone unit="section" n="32"/>  For a given
promise or agreement may turn out in such a way<note type="marg">Non-fulfilment of promises.</note>
that its performance will prove detrimental either to
the one to whom the promise has been made or to
the one who has made it. If, for example, Neptune,
in the drama, had not carried out his promise to
Theseus, Theseus would not have lost his son
Hippolytus; for, as the story runs, of the three
wishes<note>The three wishes were: (1) safe return from Hades;
(2) escape from the Labyrinth; (3) the death of Hippolytus.</note> that Neptune had promised to grant him the
third was this: in a fit of anger he prayed for the
death of Hippolytus, and the granting of this prayer
plunged him into unspeakable grief. Promises are,
therefore, not to be kept, if the keeping of them is
to prove harmful to those to whom you have made
them; and, if the fulfilment of a promise should do
more harm to you than good to him to whom you
have made it, it is no violation of moral duty to give
the greater good precedence over the lesser good.
For example, if you have made an appointment with
anyone to appear as his advocate in court, and if in
the meantime your son should fall dangerously ill, it
would be no breach of your moral duty to fail in what
you agreed to do; nay, rather, he to whom your
promise was given would have a false conception of
duty, if he should complain that he had been deserted
in his time of need. Further than this, who fails to
see that those promises are not binding which are
extorted by intimidation or which we make when


<pb id="p.35"/>

misled by false pretences? Such obligations are
annulled in most cases by the praetor's edict in
equity,<note>Each praetor, at his inauguration, announced publicly
the principles and policies that should guide him in the
administration of his office. These were the source of the
<hi rend="italics">Ius Praetorium,</hi> which explained and supplemented the
common law (<hi rend="italics">Ius Civile</hi>) and even modified its ancient rigour
so as to conform with a more advanced public sentiment,
and form a most valuable part of the body of Roman Law.</note> in some cases by the laws.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="33"/> Injustice often arises also through chicanery, that<note type="marg">Chicanery.</note>
is, through an over-subtle and even fraudulent construction of the law. This it is that gave rise to the
now familiar saw, <quote>More law, less justice.</quote> Through
such interpretation also a great deal of wrong is
committed in transactions between state and state;
thus, when a truce had been made with the enemy
for thirty days, a famous general<note>This story is told of Cleomenes, King of Sparta (520-
491 B.C.), in the war with Argos. (Plutarch, Apophth.
Lacon. 223 A.)</note> went to ravaging
their fields by night, because, he said, the truce
stipulated <quote>days,</quote> not nights. Not even our own
countryman's action is to be commended, if what is
told of Quintus Fabius Labeo is true&mdash;or whoever it
was (for I have no authority but hearsay): appointed
by the Senate to arbitrate a boundary dispute between Nola and Naples, he took up the case and
interviewed both parties separately, asking them not
to proceed in a covetous or grasping spirit, but to
make some concession rather than claim some accession. When each party had agreed to this, there
was a considerable strip of territory left between
them. And so he set the boundary of each city
as each had severally agreed; and the tract in between he awarded to the Roman People. Now that
is swindling, not arbitration. And therefore such
sharp practice is under all circumstances to be
avoided.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/> Again, there are certain duties that we owe<note type="marg">Our duty to those who have wronged us.</note>
even to those who have wronged us. For there is a
limit to retribution and to punishment; or rather, I
am inclined to think, it is sufficient that the aggressor
should be brought to repent of his wrong-doing, in


<pb id="p.37"/>

order that he may not repeat the offence and that
others may be deterred from doing wrong.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="34"/> Then, too, in the case of a state in its external
relations, the rights of war must be strictly observed.
For since there are two ways of settling a dispute:
first, by discussion; second, by physical force; and
since the former is characteristic of man, the latter
of the brute, we must resort to force only in case
we may not avail ourselves of discussion.<milestone unit="section" n="35"/>  The only. <note type="marg">Excuse for war.</note>
excuse, therefore, for going to war is that we may
live in peace unharmed; and when the victory is
won, we should spare those who have not been
blood-thirsty and barbarous in their warfare. For<note type="marg">Justice toward the vanquished.</note>
instance, our forefathers actually admitted to full
rights of citizenship the Tusculans, Aequians, Volscians, Sabines, and Hernicians, but they razed
Carthage and Numantia to the ground. I wish they
had not destroyed Corinth; but I believe they had
some special reason for what they did&mdash;its convenient situation, probably&mdash;and feared that its very
location might some day furnish a temptation to
renew the war. In my opinion, at least, we should
always strive to secure a peace that shall not admit
of guile. And if my advice had been heeded on
this point, we should still have at least some sort of
constitutional government, if not the best in the
world, whereas, as it is, we have none at all.</p>
<p>Not only must we show consideration for those
whom we have conquered by force of arms but we
must also ensure protection to those who lay down
their arms and throw themselves upon the mercy of
our generals, even though the battering-ram has
hammered at their walls. And among our countrymen justice has been observed so conscientiously in


<pb id="p.39"/>

this direction, that those who have given promise of
protection to states or nations subdued in war become,
after the custom of our forefathers, the patrons of
those states.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="36"/> As for war, humane laws touching it are drawn<note type="marg">The humanity of Rome's laws of war.</note>
up in the fetial code of the Roman People under all
the guarantees of religion; and from this it may be
gathered that no war is just, unless it is entered upon
after an official demand for satisfaction has been submitted or warning has been given and a formal declaration made. Popilius was general in command of
a province. In his army Cato's son was serving on
his first campaign. When Popilius decided to disband one of his legions, he discharged also young
Cato, who was serving in that same legion. But
when the young man out of love for the service
stayed on in the field, his father wrote to Popilius to
say that if he let him stay in the army, he should
swear him into service with a new oath of allegiance,
for in view of the voidance of his former oath he
could not legally fight the foe. So extremely scrupulous was the observance of the laws in regard to the
conduct of war.<milestone unit="section" n="37"/>  There is extant, too, a letter of the
elder Marcus Cato to his son Marcus, in which he writes
that he has heard that the youth has been discharged
by the consul,<note>Lucius Aemilius Paulus (B.C. 168).</note> when he was serving in Macedonia in
the war with Perseus. He warns him, therefore, to be
careful not to go into battle; for, he says, the man who is
not legally a soldier has no right to be fighting the foe.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/> This also I observe&mdash;that he who would
properly have been called <quote>a fighting enemy</quote>
(<hi rend="italics">perduellis</hi>) was called <quote>a guest</quote> (<hi rend="italics">hostis</hi>), thus relieving the ugliness of the fact by a softened
expression; for <quote>enemy</quote> (<hi rend="italics">hostis</hi>) meant to our ancestors <pb id="p.41"/> what we now call <quote>stranger</quote> (<hi rend="italics">peregrinus</hi>).
This is proved by the usage in the Twelve Tables:
<quote>Or a day fixed for trial with a stranger</quote> (<hi rend="italics">hostis</hi>).
And again: <quote>Right of ownership is inalienable for
ever in dealings with a stranger</quote> (<hi rend="italics">hostis</hi>). What can
exceed such charity, when he with whom one is at war
is called by so gentle a name? And yet long lapse of
time has given that word a harsher meaning: for it has
lost its signification of <quote>stranger</quote> and has taken on
the technical connotation of <quote>an enemy under arms.</quote></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="38"/> But when a war is fought out for supremacy and<note type="marg">Justice in war.</note>
when glory is the object of war, it must still not fail
to start from the same motives which I said a moment
ago were the only righteous grounds for going to
war. But those wars which have glory for their end
must be carried on with less bitterness. For we
contend, for example, with a fellow-citizen in one
way, if he is a personal enemy, in another, if he is a
rival: with the rival it is a struggle for office and
position, with the enemy for life and honour. So
with the Celtiberians and the Cimbrians we fought
as with deadly enemies, not to determine which
should be supreme, but which should survive; but
with the Latins, Sabines, Samnites, Carthaginians,
and Pyrrhus we fought for supremacy. The Carthaginians violated treaties; Hannibal was cruel; the
others were more merciful. From Pyrrhus we have
this famous speech on the exchange of prisoners:

<quote rend="blockquote"><quote><l>Gold will I none, nor price shall ye give; for I ask none;</l>
<l>Come, let us not be chaff'rers of war, but warriors embattled.</l>
<l>Nay; let us venture our lives, and the sword, not gold, weigh the outcome.</l>


<pb id="p.43"/>

<l>Make we the trial by valour in arms and see if Dame Fortune</l>
<l>Wills it that ye shall prevail or I, or what be her judgment.</l>
<l>Hear thou, too, this word, good Fabricius: whose valour soever</l>
<l>Spared hath been by the fortune of war-their freedom I grant them.</l>
<l>Such my resolve. I give and present them to you, my brave Romans;</l>
<l>Take them back to their homes; the great gods' blessings attend you.</l></quote></quote></p>

<p>A right kingly sentiment this and worthy a scion of
the Aeacidae.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="39"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/> Again, if under stress of circumstances<note type="marg">Fidelity to a promise; (1) Regulus</note>
individuals have made any promise to the enemy,
they are bound to keep their word even then. For
instance, in the First Punic War, when Regulus was
taken prisoner by the Carthaginians, he was sent
to Rome on parole to negotiate an exchange of
prisoners; he came and, in the first place, it was
he that made the motion in the Senate that the
prisoners should not be restored; and in the second
place, when his relatives and friends would have
kept him back, he chose to return to a death by
torture rather than prove false to his promise, though
given to an enemy.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="40"/> And again in the Second Punic War, after the<note type="marg">(2) Hannibal's envoys.</note>
Battle of Cannae, Hannibal sent to Rome ten Roman
captives bound by an oath to return to him, if they
did not succeed in ransoming his prisoners; and as
long as any one of them lived, the censors kept them
all degraded and disfranchised, because they were


<pb id="p.45"/>

guilty of perjury in not returning. And they
punished in like manner the one who had incurred
guilt by an evasion of his oath: with Hannibal's permission this man left the camp and returned a little
later on the pretext that he had forgotten something
or other; and then, when he left the camp the second
time, he claimed that he was released from the obligation of his oath; and so he was, according to the
letter of it, but not according to the spirit. In the
matter of a promise one must always consider the
meaning and not the mere words.</p>
<p>Our forefathers have given us another striking
example of justice toward an enemy: when a deserter from Pyrrhus promised the Senate to administer
poison to the king and thus work his death, the
Senate and Gaius Fabricius delivered the deserter
up to Pyrrhus. Thus they stamped with their disapproval the treacherous murder even of an enemy
who was at once powerful, unprovoked, aggressive,
and successful.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="41"/> With this I will close my discussion of the duties
connected with war.</p>
<p>But let us remember that we must have regard<note type="marg">Justice toward slaves.</note>
for justice even towards the humblest. Now the
humblest station and the poorest fortune are those
of slaves; and they give us no bad rule who bid us
treat our slaves as we should our employees: they
must be required to work; they must be given their
dues.</p>
<p>While wrong may be done, then, in either of two<note type="marg">Injustice of hypocrisy.</note>
ways, that is, by force or by fraud, both are bestial:
fraud seems to belong to the cunning fox, force to
the lion; both are wholly unworthy of man, but
fraud is the more contemptible. But of all forms of


<pb id="p.47"/>

injustice, none is more flagrant than that of the
hypocrite who, at the very moment when he is most
false, makes it his business to appear virtuous.</p>
<p>This must conclude our discussion of justice.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="42"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/> Next in order, as outlined above, let us<note type="marg">Justice and generosity.</note>
speak of kindness and generosity. Nothing appeals
more to the best in human nature than this, but it
calls for the exercise of caution in many particulars:
we must, in the first place, see to it that our act of
kindness shall not prove an injury either to the
object of our beneficence or to others; in the second
place, that it shall not be beyond our means; and
finally, that it shall be proportioned to the worthiness
of the recipient; for this is the corner-stone of
justice; and by the standard of justice all acts of
kindness must be measured. For those who confer
a harmful favour upon someone whom they seemingly wish to help are to be accounted not generous
benefactors but dangerous sycophants; and likewise
those who injure one man, in order to be generous
to another, are guilty of the same injustice as if
they diverted to their own accounts the property of
their neighbours.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="43"/> Now, there are many&mdash;and especially those who<note type="marg">Generosity must be (1) hurtful to no one,</note>
are ambitious for eminence and glory&mdash;who rob one
to enrich another; and they expect to be thought
generous towards their friends, if they put them in
the way of getting rich, no matter by what means.
Such conduct, however, is so remote from moral
duty that nothing can be more completely opposed
to duty. We must, therefore, take care to indulge
only in such liberality as will help our friends and
hurt no one. The conveyance of property by Lucius
Sulla and Gaius Caesar from its rightful owners to


<pb id="p.49"/>

the hands of strangers should, for that reason, not
be regarded as generosity; for nothing is generous,
if it is not at the same time just.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="44"/> The second point for the exercise of caution was<note type="marg">(2) within our means,</note>
that our beneficence should not exceed our means;
for those who wish to be more open-handed than
their circumstances permit are guilty of two faults:
first, they do wrong to their next of kin; for they
transfer to strangers property which would more
justly be placed at their service or bequeathed to
them. And second, such generosity too often engenders a passion for plundering and misappropriating
property, in order to supply the means for making
large gifts. We may also observe that a great many
people do many things that seem to be inspired
more by a spirit of ostentation than by heart-felt
kindness; for such people are not really generous
but are rather influenced by a sort of ambition to
make a show of being open-handed. Such a pose
is nearer akin to hypocrisy than to generosity or
moral goodness.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="45"/> The third rule laid down was that in acts of<note type="marg">(3) according to merit.</note>
kindness we should weigh with discrimination the
worthiness of the object of our benevolence; we
should take into consideration his moral character,
his attitude toward us, the intimacy of his relations
to us, and our common social ties, as well as the
services he has hitherto rendered in our interest.
It is to be desired that all these considerations
should be combined in the same person; if they
are not, then the more numerous and the more
important considerations must have the greater
weight.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="46"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/> Now, the men we live with are not perfect


<pb id="p.51"/>

and ideally wise, but men who do very well, if there
be found in them but the semblance of virtue. I
therefore think that this is to be taken for granted,
that no one should be entirely neglected who shows
any trace of virtue; but the more a man is endowed
with these finer virtues&mdash;temperance, self-control,
and that very justice about which so much has already been said&mdash;the more he deserves to be favoured.
I do not mention fortitude, for a courageous spirit
in a man who has not attained perfection and ideal
wisdom is generally too impetuous; it is those other
virtues that seem more particularly to mark the
good man.</p>
<p>So much in regard to the character of the object
of our beneficence.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="47"/> But as to the affection which anyone may have<note type="marg">Motives to generosity: (1) love,</note>
for us, it is the first demand of duty that we do
most for him who loves us most; but we should
measure affection, not like youngsters, by the ardour
of its passion, but rather by its strength and constancy. But if there shall be obligations already<note type="marg">(2) requital,</note>
incurred, so that kindness is not to begin with us,
but to be requited, still greater diligence, it seems,
is called for; for no duty is more imperative than
that of proving one's gratitude.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="48"/> But if, as Hesiod bids, one is to repay with interest, if possible, what one has borrowed in time
of need, what, pray, ought we to do when challenged
by an unsought kindness? Shall we not imitate
the fruitful fields, which return more than they
receive? For if we do not hesitate to confer favours
upon those who we hope will be of help to us, how
ought we to deal with those who have already
helped us? For generosity is of two kinds: doing


<pb id="p.53"/>

a kindness and requiting one. Whether we do
the kindness or not is optional; but to fail to requite
one is not allowable to a good man, provided he
can make the requital without violating the rights
of others.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="49"/> Furthermore, we must make some discrimination
between favours received; for, as a matter of course,
the greater the favour, the greater is the obligation. But in deciding this we must above all give
due weight to the spirit, the devotion, the affection,
that prompted the favour. For many people often
do favours impulsively for everybody without discrimination, prompted by a morbid sort of benevolence or by a sudden impulse of the heart, shifting as
the wind. Such acts of generosity are not to be so
highly esteemed as those which are performed with
judgment, deliberation, and mature consideration.</p>
<p>But in bestowing a kindness, as well as in making
a requital, the first rule of duty requires us&mdash;other
things being equal&mdash;to lend assistance preferably to
people in proportion to their individual need. Most
people adopt the contrary course: they put themselves most eagerly at the service of the one from<note type="marg">(3) self-interest,</note>
whom they hope to receive the greatest favours,
even though he has no need of their help.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="50"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/> The interests of society, however, and its<note type="marg">(4) relationship.</note>
common bonds will be best conserved, if kindness
be shown to each individual in proportion to the
closeness of his relationship.</p>
<p>But it seems we must trace back to their ultimate<note type="marg">The principles of human society.</note>
sources the principles of fellowship and society that
Nature has established among men. The first
principle is that which is found in the connection subsisting between all the members of the human race;


<pb id="p.55"/>

and that bond of connection is reason and speech,
which by the processes of teaching and learning, of
communicating, discussing, and reasoning associate
men together and unite them in a sort of natural
fraternity. In no other particular are we farther removed from the nature of beasts; for we admit that
they may have courage (horses and lions, for example);
but we do not admit that they have justice, equity,
and goodness; for they are not endowed with reason
or speech.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="51"/> This, then, is the most comprehensive bond that
unites together men as men and all to all; and
under it the common right to all things that Nature
has produced for the common use of man is to be
maintained, with the understanding that, while
everything assigned as private property by the
statutes and by civil law shall be so held as prescribed by those same laws, everything else shall be
regarded in the light indicated by the Greek proverb: <quote>Amongst friends all things in common.</quote><note><foreign lang="greek">koina\ ta\</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">tw=n</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">fi/lwn</foreign> (Plato, Phaedr. 279 C; Aristotle,
Eth. VIII, 11).</note>
Furthermore, we find the common property of all
men in things of the sort defined by Ennius; and,
though restricted by him to one instance, the principle may be applied very generally:

<quote rend="blockquote"><quote><l>Who kindly sets a wand'rer on his way</l>
<l>Does e'en as if he lit another's lamp by his:</l>
<l>No less shines his, when he his friend's hath lit.</l></quote></quote>

In this example he effectively teaches us all to bestow
even upon a stranger what it costs us nothing to give.
<milestone unit="section" n="52"/> On this principle we have the following maxims:
<quote rend="blockquote">Deny no one the water that flows by;</quote> <quote rend="blockquote">Let
anyone who will take fire from our fire;</quote> <quote rend="blockquote">Honest
counsel give to one who is in doubt;</quote>


<pb id="p.57"/>

for such acts are useful to the recipient and cause
the giver no loss. We should, therefore, adopt these
principles and always be contributing something to
the common weal. But since the resources of individuals are limited and the number of the needy is
infinite, this spirit of universal liberality must be
regulated according to that test of Ennius&mdash;<quote>No
less shines his</quote> &mdash;in order that we may continue to
have the means for being generous to our friends.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="53"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/> Then, too, there are a great many degrees<note type="marg">Degrees of social relationship: (1) citizenship,</note>
of closeness or remoteness in human society. To
proceed beyond the universal bond of our common
humanity, there is the closer one of belonging to the
same people, tribe, and tongue, by which men are
very closely bound together; it is a still closer relation to be citizens of the same city-state; for fellow-citizens have much in common&mdash;forum, temples,
colonnades, streets, statutes laws. Courts, rights of
suffrage, to say nothing of social and friendly circles
and diverse business relations with many.</p>
<p>But a sill closer social union exists between kindred. <note type="marg">(2) kinship,</note> Starting with that infinite bond of union of the
human race in general, the conception is now confined
to a small and narrow circle.<milestone unit="section" n="54"/>  For since the reproductive instinct is by Nature's gift the common possession of all living creatures, the first bond of union
is that between husband and wife; the next, that
between parents and children; then we find one
home, with everything in common. And this is the
foundation of civil government, the nursery, as it
were, of the state. Then follow the bonds between
brothers and sisters, and next those of first and then
of second cousins; and when they can no longer be
sheltered under one roof, they go out into other


<pb id="p.59"/>

homes, as into colonies. Then follow between these,
in turn, marriages and connections by marriage, and
from these again a new stock of relations; and from
this propagation and after-growth states have their
beginnings. The bonds of common blood hold men
fast through good-will and affection;<milestone unit="section" n="55"/>  for it means
much to share in common the same family traditions,
the same forms of domestic worship, and the same
ancestral tombs.</p>
<p>But of all the bonds of fellowship, there is none<note type="marg">(3) friendship,</note>
more noble, none more powerful than when good
men of congenial character are joined in intimate
friendship; for really, if we discover in another that
moral goodness on which I dwell so much, it attracts
us and makes us friends to the one in whose character
it seems to dwell.<milestone unit="section" n="56"/>  And while every virtue attracts
us and makes us love those who seem to possess it,
still justice and generosity do so most of all. Nothing,
moreover, is more conducive to love and intimacy
than compatibility of character in good men; for
when two people have the same ideals and the same
tastes, it is a natural consequence that each loves the
other as himself; and the result is, as Pythagoras
requires of ideal friendship, that several are united
in one.</p>
<p>Another strong bond of fellowship is effected by
mutual interchange of kind services; and as long as
these kindnesses are mutual and acceptable, those
between whom they are interchanged are united by
the ties of an enduring intimacy.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="57"/> But when with a rational spirit you have surveyed<note type="marg">(4) love of country.</note>
the whole field, there is no social relation among
them all more close, none more dear than that
which links each one of us with our country. Parents


<pb id="p.61"/>

are dear; dear are children, relatives, friends; but
one native land embraces all our loves; and who that
is true would hesitate to give his life for her, if by
his death he could render her a service? So much
the more execrable are those monsters who have
torn their fatherland to pieces with every form of
outrage and who are<note>Antony and his associates.</note> and have been<note>Caesar, Clodius, Catiline.</note> engaged in
compassing her utter destruction.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="58"/> Now, if a contrast and comparison were to be
made to find out where most of our moral obligation
is due, country would come first, and parents; for
their services have laid us under the heaviest obligation; next come children and the whole family, who
look to us alone for support and can have no other
protection; finally, our kinsmen, with whom we live
on good terms and with whom, for the most part,
our lot is one.</p>
<p>All needful material assistance is, therefore, due
first of all to those whom I have named; but intimate relationship of life and living, counsel, conversation, encouragement, comfort, and sometimes even
reproof flourish best in friendships. And that friendship is sweetest which is cemented by congeniality
of character.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="59"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/> But in the performance of all these duties<note type="marg">Duties may vary under varying circumstances.</note>
we shall have to consider what is most needful in
each individual case and what each individual person
can or cannot procure without our help. In this
way we shall find that the claims of social relationship, in its various degrees, are not identical with
the dictates of circumstances; for there are obligations that are due to one individual rather than
to another: for example, one would sooner assist
a neighbour in gathering his harvest than either


<pb id="p.63"/>

a brother or a friend; but should it be a case in
court, one would defend a kinsman and a friend
rather than a neighbour. Such questions as these
must, therefore, be taken into consideration in every
act of moral duty [and we must acquire the habit
and keep it up], in order to become good calculators
of duty, able by adding and subtracting to strike a
balance correctly and find out just how much is due
to each individual.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="60"/> But as neither physicians nor generals nor orators
can achieve any signal success without experience
and practice, no matter how well they may understand the theory of their profession, so the rules for
the discharge of duty are formulated, it is true, as I
am doing now, but a matter of such importance
requires experience also and practice.</p>
<p>This must close our discussion of the ways in
which moral goodness, on which duty depends, is
developed from those principles which hold good in
human society.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="61"/> We must realize, however, that while we have set<note type="marg">C. Fortitude.</note>
down four cardinal virtues from which as sources
moral rectitude and moral duty emanate, that
achievement is most glorious in the eyes of the
world which is won with a spirit great, exalted, and
superior to the vicissitudes of earthly life. And so,
when we wish to hurl a taunt, the very first to rise to
our lips is, if possible, something like this:

<quote rend="blockquote"><quote><l>For ye, young men, show a womanish soul, yon maiden<note>Cloelia (see Index).</note> a man's;</l></quote></quote>

and this:

<quote rend="blockquote"><quote><l>Thou son of Salmacis, win spoils that cost nor sweat nor blood.</l></quote></quote>


<pb id="p.65"/>

When, on the other hand, we wish to pay a compliment, we somehow or other praise in more eloquent
strain the brave and noble work of some great soul.
Hence there is an open field for orators on the subjects of Marathon, Salamis, Plataea, Thermopylae,
and Leuctra, and hence our own Cocles, the Decii,
Gnaeus and Publius Scipio, Marcus Marcellus, and
countless others, and, above all, the Roman People
as a nation are celebrated for greatness of spirit.
Their passion for military glory, moreover, is shown
in the fact that we see their statues usually in
soldier's garb.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="62"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/> But if the exaltation of spirit seen in times<note type="marg">Fortitude in the light of justice.</note>
of danger and toil is devoid of justice and fights for
selfish ends instead of for the common good, it is a
vice; for not only has it no element of virtue, but
its nature is barbarous and revolting to all our finer
feelings. The Stoics, therefore, correctly define
courage as <quote>that virtue which champions the cause
of right.</quote> Accordingly, no one has attained to true
glory who has gained a reputation for courage by
treachery and cunning; for nothing that lacks justice
can be morally right.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="63"/> This, then, is a fine saying of Plato's: <quote>Not only
must all knowledge that is divorced from justice be
called cunning rather than wisdom,</quote> he says, <quote>but
even the courage that is prompt to face danger, if it
is inspired not by public spirit, but by its own selfish
purposes, should have the name of effrontery rather
than of courage.</quote> And so we demand that men
who are courageous and high-souled shall at the
same time be good and straightforward, lovers of
truth, and foes to deception; for these qualities are
the centre and soul of justice.</p>


<pb id="p.67"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="64"/> But the mischief is that from this exaltation and
greatness of spirit spring all too readily self-will and
excessive lust for power. For just as Plato tells us that
the whole national character of the Spartans was on
fire with passion for victory, so, in the same way, the
more notable a man is for his greatness of spirit, the
more ambitious he is to be the foremost citizen, or, I
should say rather, to be sole ruler. But when one
begins to aspire to pre-eminence, it is difficult to
preserve that spirit of fairness which is absolutely
essential to justice. The result is that such men do
not allow themselves to be constrained either by
argument or by any public and lawful authority; but
they only too often prove to be bribers and agitators
in public life, seeking to obtain supreme power and
to be superiors through force rather than equals
through justice. But the greater the difficulty, the
greater the glory; for no occasion arises that can
excuse a man for being guilty of injustice.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="65"/> So then, not those who do injury but those who<note type="marg">True greatness of spirit.</note>
prevent it are to be considered brave and courageous.
Moreover, true and philosophic greatness of spirit
regards the moral goodness to which Nature most
aspires as consisting in deeds, not in fame, and prefers to be first in reality rather than in name. And
we must approve this view; for he who depends upon
the caprice of the ignorant rabble cannot be numbered among the great. Then, too, the higher a
man's ambition, the more easily he is tempted to
acts of injustice by his desire for fame. We are now,
to be sure, on very slippery ground; for scarcely can
the man be found who has passed through trials and
encountered dangers and does not then wish for
glory as a reward for his achievements.</p>


<pb id="p.69"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="66"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/> The soul that is altogether courageous and<note type="marg">Characteristics of Fortitude:</note>
great is marked above all by two characteristics:
one of these is indifference to outward circumstances;
for such a person cherishes the conviction that
nothing but moral goodness and propriety deserves to
be either admired or wished for or striven after, and
that he ought not to be subject to any man or any
passion or any accident of fortune. The second
characteristic is that, when the soul is disciplined in
the way above mentioned, one should do deeds not only
great and in the highest degree useful, but extremely
arduous and laborious and fraught with danger both
to life and to many things that make life worth living.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="67"/> All the glory and greatness and, I may add, all the<note type="marg">(1) Moral courage.</note>
usefulness of these two characteristics of courage are
centred in the latter; the rational cause that makes
men great, in the former. For it is the former that<note type="marg">Indifference to outward fortunes.</note>
contains the element that makes souls pre-eminent
and indifferent to worldly fortune. And this quality
is distinguished by two criteria: (1) if one account
moral rectitude as the only good; and (2) if one be
free from all passion. For we must agree that it
takes a brave and heroic soul to hold as slight what
most people think grand and glorious, and to disregard it from fixed and settled principles. And it
requires strength of character and great singleness
of purpose to bear what seems painful, as it comes
to pass in many and various forms in human life, and
to bear it so unflinchingly as not to be shaken in the
least from one's natural state of the dignity of a
philosopher.<milestone unit="section" n="68"/>  Moreover, it would be inconsistent
for the man who is not overcome by fear to be overcome by desire, or for the man who has shown himself
invincible to toil to be conquered by pleasure. We


<pb id="p.71"/>

must, therefore, not only avoid the latter, but also
beware of ambition for wealth; for there is nothing so
characteristic of narrowness and littleness of soul as
the love of riches; and there is nothing more honourable and noble than to be indifferent to money, if
one does not possess it, and to devote it to beneficence
and liberality, if one does possess it.</p>
<p>As I said before, we must also beware of ambition
for glory; for it robs us of liberty, and in defence of
liberty a high-souled man should stake everything.
And one ought not to seek military authority; nay,
rather it ought sometimes to be declined,<note>As Cicero did at the expiration of his consulship.</note> sometimes
to be resigned.<note>As Sulla did in his dictatorship. The contrast to Caesar
is the more striking for Cicero's not mentioning it.</note></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="69"/> Again, we must keep ourselves free from every<note type="marg">(3) Freedom from passion.</note>
disturbing emotion, not only from desire and fear, but
also from excessive pain and pleasure, and from anger,
so that we may enjoy that calm of soul and freedom
from care which bring both moral stability and dignity of character. But there have been many and still<note type="marg">The retired life.</note>
are many who, while pursuing that calm of soul of
which I speak, have withdrawn from civic duty and
taken refuge in retirement. Among such have been
found the most famous and by far the foremost philosophers<note>e.g. Plato, Aristotle, Zeno, Pythagoras, Anaxagoras.</note> and certain other<note>Such as Cicero's friend, Atticus, and Marcus Piso.</note> earnest, thoughtful men
who could not endure the conduct of either the
people or their leaders; some of them, too, lived in
the country and found their pleasure in the management of their private estates.<milestone unit="section" n="70"/>  Such men have had
the same aims as kings&mdash;to suffer no want, to be
subject to no authority, to enjoy their liberty, that
is, in its essence, to live just as they please.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/> So, while this desire is common to men of
political ambitions and men of retirement, of whom
I have just spoken, the one class think they can


<pb id="p.73"/>

attain their end if they secure large means; the<note type="marg">The life of public service <hi rend="italics">vs.</hi> the life of retirement.</note>
other, if they are content with the little they have
And, in this matter, neither way of thinking is altogether to be condemned; but the life of retirement is
easier and safer and at the same time less burdensome or troublesome to others, while the career
of those who apply themselves to statecraft and to
conducting great enterprises is more profitable to
mankind and contributes more to their own greatness and renown.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="71"/> So perhaps those men of extraordinary genius
who have devoted themselves to learning must be
excused for not taking part in public affairs; likewise, those who from ill-health or for some still
more valid reason have retired from the service of
the state and left to others the opportunity and the
glory of its administration. But if those who have
no such excuse profess a scorn for civil and military
offices, which most people admire, I think that this
should be set down not to their credit but to their
discredit; for in so far as they care little, as they
say, for glory and count it as naught, it is difficult
not to sympathize with their attitude; in reality,
however, they seem to dread the toil and trouble
and also, perhaps, the discredit and humiliation of
political failure and defeat. For there are people
who in opposite circumstances do not act consistently: they have the utmost contempt for pleasure,
but in pain they are too sensitive; they are indifferent to glory, but they are crushed by disgrace;
and even in their inconsistency they show no great
consistency.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="72"/> But those whom Nature has endowed with the<note type="marg">Public service a duty.</note>
capacity for administering public affairs should put


<pb id="p.75"/>

aside all hesitation, enter the race for public office,
and take a hand in directing the government; for
in no other way can a government be administered
or greatness of spirit be made manifest. Statesmen,
too, no less than philosophers&mdash;perhaps even more
so&mdash;should carry with them that greatness of spirit
and indifference to outward circumstances to which
I so often refer, together with calm of soul and freedom from care, if they are to be free from worries
and lead a dignified and self-consistent life.<milestone unit="section" n="73"/>  This is
easier for the philosophers; as their life is less exposed to the assaults of fortune, their wants are fewer;
and, if any misfortune overtakes them, their fall is not
so disastrous. Not without reason, therefore, are
stronger emotions aroused in those who engage in
public life than in those who live in retirement, and
greater is their ambition for success; the more,
therefore, do they need to enjoy greatness of spirit
and freedom from annoying cares.</p>
<p>If anyone is entering public life, let him beware
of thinking only of the honour that it brings; but
let him be sure also that he has the ability to
succeed. At the same time, let him take care not
to lose heart too readily through discouragement nor
yet to be over-confident through ambition. In a
word, before undertaking any enterprise, careful
preparation must be made.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="74"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/> Most people think that the achievements<note type="marg">Victories of war <hi rend="italics">vs.</hi> victories of peace.</note>
of war are more important than those of peace; but
this opinion needs to be corrected. For many men
have sought occasions for war from the mere ambition for fame. This is notably the case with men
of great spirit and natural ability, and it is the more
likely to happen, if they are adapted to a soldier's


<pb id="p.77"/>

life and fond of warfare. But if we will face the
facts, we shall find that there have been many
instances of achievement in peace more important
and no less renowned than in war.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="75"/> However highly Themistocles, for example, may<note type="marg">Themistocles <hi rend="italics">vs.</hi> Solon.</note>
be extolled&mdash;and deservedly&mdash;and however much
more illustrious his name may be than Solon's, and
however much Salamis may be cited as witness of
his most glorious victory&mdash;a victory glorified above
Solon's statesmanship in instituting the Areopagus
&mdash;yet Solon's achievement is not to be accounted less
illustrious than his. For Themistocles's victory served
the state once and only once; while Solon's work
will be of service for ever. For through his legislation the laws of the Athenians and the institutions
of their fathers are maintained. And while Themistocles could not readily point to any instance in
which he himself had rendered assistance to the
Areopagus, the Areopagus might with justice assert
that Themistocles had received assistance from it;
for the war was directed by the counsels of that
senate which Solon had created.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="76"/> The same may be said of Pausanias and Lysander. <note type="marg">Pausanias and Lysander <hi rend="italics">vs.</hi> Lycurgus.</note>
Although it is thought that it was by their achievements that Sparta gained her supremacy, yet these
are not even remotely to be compared with the
legislation and discipline of Lycurgus. Nay, rather,
it was due to these that Pausanias and Lysander had
armies so brave and so well disciplined. For my own
part, I do not consider that Marcus Scaurus was inferior to Gaius Marius, when I was a lad, or Quintus
Catulus to Gnaeus Pompey, when I was engaged in
public life. For arms are of little value in the field
unless there is wise counsel at home. So, too,


<pb id="p.79"/>

Africanus, though a great man and a soldier of extraordinary ability, did no greater service to the state by
destroying Numantia than was done at the same time
by Publius Nasica, though not then clothed with
official authority, by removing Tiberius Gracchus.
This deed does not, to be sure, belong wholly to the
domain of civil affairs; it partakes of the nature of
war also, since it was effected by violence; but it was,
for all that, executed as a political measure without
the help of an army.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="77"/> The whole truth, however, is in this verse, against<note type="marg">Cicero's great victory.</note>
which, I am told, the malicious and envious are wont
to rail:

<quote rend="blockquote"><quote><l>Yield, ye arms, to the toga; to civic praises,<note>The praises of Cicero for his overthrow of the conspiracy
of Catiline.</note> ye laurels.</l></quote></quote><note>The laurels of the triumphant general.</note>

Not to mention other instances, did not arms yield
to the toga, when I was at the helm of state? For
never was the republic in more serious peril, never
was peace more profound. Thus, as the result of my
counsels and my vigilance, their weapons slipped
suddenly from the hands of the most desperate
traitors&mdash;dropped to the ground of their own accord!
What achievement in war, then, was ever so great?
What triumph can be compared with that?<milestone unit="section" n="78"/>  For I
may boast to you, my son Marcus; for to you belong
the inheritance of that glory of mine and the duty
of imitating my deeds. And it was to me, too, that
Gnaeus Pompey, a hero crowned with the honours
of war, paid this tribute in the hearing of many,
when he said that his third triumph would have been
gained in vain, if he were not to have through my
services to the state a place in which to celebrate it.</p>
<p>There are, therefore, instances of civic courage


<pb id="p.81"/>

that are not inferior to the courage of the soldier.
Nay, the former calls for even greater energy and
greater devotion than the latter.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="79"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/> That moral goodness which we look for in<note type="marg">(2) Physical courage.</note>
a lofty, high-minded spirit is secured, of course, by
moral, not by physical, strength. And yet the body
must be trained and so disciplined that it can obey
the dictates of judgment and reason in attending
to business and in enduring toil. But that moral
goodness which is our theme depends wholly upon
the thought and attention given to it by the mind.
And, in this way, the men who in a civil capacity
direct the affairs of the nation render no less important service than they who conduct its wars: by their
statesmanship oftentimes wars are either averted or
terminated; sometimes also they are declared. Upon
Marcus Cato's counsel, for example, the Third Punic
War was undertaken, and in its conduct his influence
was dominant, even after he was dead.<milestone unit="section" n="80"/>  And so
diplomacy in the friendly settlement of controversies
is more desirable than courage in settling them on
the battlefield; but we must be careful not to take
that course merely for the sake of avoiding war
rather than for the sake of public expediency. War,
however, should be undertaken in such a way as to
make it evident that it has no other object than to
secure peace.</p>
<p>But it takes a brave and resolute spirit not to be
disconcerted in times of difficulty or ruffled and
thrown off one's feet, as the saying is, but to keep
one's presence of mind and one's self-possession and
not to swerve from the path of reason.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="81"/> Now all this requires great personal courage; but<note type="marg">Courage and discretion.</note>
it calls also for great intellectual ability by reflection


<pb id="p.83"/>

to anticipate the future, to discover some time in
advance what may happen whether for good or for
ill, and what must be done in any possible event, and
never to be reduced to having to say <quote>I had not
thought of that.</quote></p>
<p>These are the activities that mark a spirit strong,
high, and self-reliant in its prudence and wisdom.
But to mix rashly in the fray and to fight hand to
hand with the enemy is but a barbarous and brutish
kind of business. Yet when the stress of circumstances demands it, we must gird on the sword and
prefer death to slavery and disgrace.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="82"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/> As to destroying and plundering cities, let
me say that great care should be taken that nothing
be done in reckless cruelty or wantonness. And it is
a great man's duty in troublous times to single out
the guilty for punishment, to spare the many, and in
every turn of fortune to hold to a true and honourable course. For whereas there are many, as I have
said before, who place the achievements of war above
those of peace, so one may find many to whom
adventurous, hot-headed counsels seem more brilliant
and more impressive than calm and well-considered
measures.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="83"/> We must, of course, never be guilty of seeming<note type="marg">Courage in times of doubt and danger.</note>
cowardly and craven in our avoidance of danger; but
we must also beware of exposing ourselves to danger
needlessly. Nothing can be more foolhardy than
that. Accordingly, in encountering danger we
should do as doctors do in their practice: in light
cases of illness they give mild treatment; in cases of
dangerous sickness they are compelled to apply
hazardous and even desperate remedies. It is, therefore, only a madman who, in a calm, would pray


<pb id="p.85"/>

for a storm; a wise man's way is, when the storm
does come, to withstand it with all the means at his
command, and especially, when the advantages to
be expected in case of a successful issue are greater
than the hazards of the struggle.</p>
<p>The dangers attending great affairs of state fall<note type="marg">Patriotism and self-sacrifice.</note>
sometimes upon those who undertake them, sometimes upon the state. In carrying out such enterprises, some run the risk of losing their lives, others
their reputation and the good-will of their fellow-citizens. It is our duty, then, to be more ready to
endanger our own than the public welfare and to
hazard honour and glory more readily than other
advantages.<note>Such as the esteem and good-will of fellow-citizens;
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; the existence of
the state and all the advantages it brings.</note></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="84"/> Many, on the other hand, have been found who
were ready to pour out not only their money but
their lives for their country and yet would not
consent to make even the slightest sacrifice of personal glory&mdash;even though the interests of their
country demanded it. For example, when Callicratidas, as Spartan admiral in the Peloponnesian War,
had won many signal successes, he spoiled everything at the end by refusing to listen to the proposal
of those who thought he ought to withdraw his fleet
from the Arginusae and not to risk an engagement
with the Athenians. His answer to them was that
<quote>the Spartans could build another fleet, if they lost
that one, but he could not retreat without dishonour
to himself.</quote> And yet what he did dealt only a
slight blow to Sparta; there was another which
proved disastrous, when Cleombrotus in fear of criticism recklessly went into battle against Epaminondas. In consequence of that, the Spartan power
fell.</p>


<pb id="p.87"/>

<p>How much better was the conduct of Quintus
Maximus! Of him Ennius says:

<quote rend="blockquote"><quote><l>One man&mdash;and he alone&mdash;restored our state by delaying.</l>
<l>Not in the least did fame with him take precedence of safety;</l>
<l>Therefore now does his glory shine bright, and it grows ever brighter.</l></quote></quote></p>

<p>This sort of offence<note>Sacrificing public interests to personal glory.</note> must be avoided no less in
political life. For there are men who for fear of
giving offence do not dare to express their honest
opinion, no matter how excellent.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="85"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/> Those who propose to take charge of the<note type="marg">Public administration must be free from</note>
affairs of government should not fail to remember two
of Plato's rules: first, to keep the good of the people
so clearly in view that regardless of their own interests they will make their every action conform to
that; second, to care for the welfare of the whole
body politic and not in serving the interests of some<note type="marg">(1) partisanship</note>
one party to betray the rest. For the administration of the government, like the office of a trustee,
must be conducted for the benefit of those entrusted
to one's care, not of those to whom it is entrusted.
Now, those who care for the interests of a part of
the citizens and neglect another part, introduce
into the civil service a dangerous element&mdash;dissension and party strife. The result is that some
are found to be loyal supporters of the democratic,
others of the aristocratic party, and few of the nation
as a whole.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="86"/> As a result of this party spirit bitter strife arose
at Athens,<note>From the death of Pericles on.</note> and in our own country not only dissensions<note>Such as the conspiracy of Catiline.</note> but also disastrous civil wars<note>The civil wars of Marius and Sulla, Caesar and Pompey.</note> broke out.


<pb id="p.89"/>

All this the citizen who is patriotic, brave, and worthy
of a leading place in the state will shun with abhorrence; he will dedicate himself unreservedly to his
country, without aiming at influence or power for
himself; and he will devote himself to the state in
its entirety in such a way as to further the interests
of all. Besides, he will not expose anyone to hatred
or disrepute by groundless charges, but he will
surely cleave to justice and honour so closely that he
will submit to any loss, however heavy, rather than
be untrue to them, and will face death itself rather
than renounce them.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="87"/> A most wretched custom, assuredly, is our electioneering <note type="marg">(2) self-seeking,</note> and scrambling for office. Concerning
this also we find a fine thought in Plato: <quote>Those
who compete against one another,</quote> he says, <quote>to see
which of two candidates shall administer the government, are like sailors quarrelling as to which one of
them shall do the steering.</quote> And he likewise lays
down the rule that we should regard only those as
adversaries who take up arms against the state, not
those who strive to have the government administered according to their convictions. This was the
spirit of the disagreement between Publius Africanus
and Quintus Metellus: there was in it no trace of
rancour.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="88"/> Neither must we listen to those who think that<note type="marg">(3) vindictiveness,</note>
one should indulge in violent anger against one's
political enemies and imagine that such is the
attitude of a great-spirited, brave man. For
nothing is more commendable, nothing more
becoming in a pre-eminently great man than courtesy and forbearance. Indeed, in a free people,
where all enjoy equal rights before the law, we


<pb id="p.91"/>

must school ourselves to affability and what is called
<quote>mental poise</quote>;<note>The quality elsewhere expressed by Cicero with <foreign lang="greek">baqu/ths</foreign>
&mdash;'depth,' 'reserve,' the art of concealing and controlling
one's feelings under an outward serenity of manner.</note> for if we are irritated when
people intrude upon us at unseasonable hours or make
unreasonable requests, we shall develop a sour,
churlish temper, prejudicial to ourselves and offensive
to others. And yet gentleness of spirit and forbearance are to be commended only with the understanding that strictness may be exercised for the
good of the state; for without that, the government cannot be well administered. On the other
hand, if punishment or correction must be administered, it need not be insulting; it ought to have
regard to the welfare of the state, not to the personal
satisfaction of the man who administers the punishment or reproof.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="89"/> We should take care also that the punishment<note type="marg">(4) anger.</note>
shall not be out of proportion to the offence, and
that some shall not be chastised for the same fault
for which others are not even called to account. In
administering punishment it is above all necessary
to allow no trace of anger. For if anyone proceeds
in a passion to inflict punishment, he will never
observe that happy mean which lies between excess
and defect. This doctrine of the mean is approved
by the Peripatetics&mdash;and wisely approved, if only
they did not speak in praise of anger and tell us
that it is a gift bestowed on us by Nature for a good
purpose. But, in reality, anger is in every circumstance to be eradicated; and it is to be desired that
they who administer the government should be like
the laws, which are led to inflict punishment not by
wrath but by justice.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="90"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/> Again, when fortune smiles and the stream<note type="marg">Fortitude in prosperity.</note>
of life flows according to our wishes, let us diligently


<pb id="p.93"/>

avoid all arrogance, haughtiness, and pride. For it
is as much a sign of weakness to give way to one's
feelings in success as it is in adversity. But it
is a fine thing to keep an unruffled temper, an unchanging mien, and the same cast of countenance
in every condition of life; this, history tells us,
was characteristic of Socrates and no less of Gaius
Laelius. Philip, king of Macedon, I observe, however surpassed by his son in achievements and fame,
was superior to him in affability and refinement.
Philip, accordingly, was always great; Alexander,
often infamously bad. There seems to be sound
advice, therefore, in this word of warning: <quote>The
higher we are placed, the more humbly should we<note type="marg">Humility.</note>
walk.</quote> Panaetius tells us that Africanus, his pupil
and friend, used to say: <quote>As, when horses have
become mettlesome and unmanageable on account
of their frequent participation in battles, their
owners put them in the hands of trainers to make
them more tractable; so men, who through prosperity have become restive and over self-confident,
ought to be put into the training-ring, so to speak,
of reason and learning, that they may be brought to
comprehend the frailty of human affairs and the
fickleness of fortune.</quote></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="91"/> The greater our prosperity, moreover, the more
should we seek the counsel of friends, and the
greater the heed that should be given to their
advice. Under such circumstances also we must
beware of lending an ear to sycophants or allowing
them to impose upon us with their flattery. For
it is easy in this way to deceive ourselves, since
we thus come to think ourselves duly entitled to
praise; and to this frame of mind a thousand delusions <pb id="p.95"/> may be traced, when men are puffed up with
conceit and expose themselves to ignominy and
ridicule by committing the most egregious blunders.</p>
<p>So much for this subject.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="92"/> To revert to the original question<note>&sect; 70.</note>&mdash;we must<note type="marg">Greatness of mind in public and in private life.</note>
decide that the most important activities, those
most indicative of a great spirit, are performed by
the men who direct the affairs of nations; for such
public activities have the widest scope and touch
the lives of the most people. But even in the life
of retirement there are and there have been many
high-souled men who have been engaged in important inquiries or embarked on most important
enterprises and yet kept themselves within the
limits of their own affairs; or, taking a middle
course between philosophers on the one hand and
statesmen on the other, they were content with
managing their own property&mdash;not increasing it by
any and every means nor debarring their kindred
from the enjoyment of it, but rather, if ever there
were need, sharing it with their friends and with
the state. Only let it, in the first place, be honestly
acquired, by the use of no dishonest or fraudulent
means; let it, in the second place, increase by
wisdom, industry, and thrift; and, finally, let it
be made available for the use of as many as possible
(if only they are worthy) and be at the service of
generosity and beneficence rather than of sensuality
and excess.</p>
<p>By observing these rules, one may live in magnificence, dignity, and independence, and yet in honour,
truth and charity toward all.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="93"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/> We have next to discuss the one remaining <note type="marg">D. Temperance.</note> division of moral rectitude. That is the one


<pb id="p.97"/>

in which we find considerateness and self-control,
which give, as it were, a sort of polish to life; it
embraces also temperance, complete subjection of
all the passions, and moderation in all things.
Under this head is further included what, in Latin,<note type="marg">Propriety.</note>
may be called <hi rend="italics">decorum</hi><note><hi rend="italics">Decorum,</hi> Cicero's attempt to translate <foreign lang="greek">pre/pon,</foreign> means

<foreign lang="greek">pre/pon</foreign> is to reproduce in Latin; as an adjective, it is here
rendered by ' proper,' as a noun, by ' propriety.'</note> (propriety); for in Greek
it is called <foreign lang="greek">pre/pon.</foreign><note><hi rend="italics">Decorum,</hi> Cicero's attempt to translate <foreign lang="greek">pre/pon,</foreign> means
an appreciation of the fitness of things, propriety in inward

<foreign lang="greek">pre/pon</foreign> is to reproduce in Latin; as an adjective, it is here
rendered by ' proper,' as a noun, by ' propriety.'</note> Such is its essential nature,
that it is inseparable from moral goodness;<milestone unit="section" n="94"/>  for what
is proper is morally right, and what is morally right
is proper. The nature of the difference between
morality and propriety can be more easily felt than
expressed. For whatever propriety may be, it is
manifested only when there is pre-existing moral
rectitude. And so, not only in this division of moral
rectitude which we have now to discuss but also in
the three preceding divisions, it is clearly brought out
what propriety is. For to employ reason and speech<note type="marg">Propriety and the Cardinal Virtues.</note>
rationally, to do with careful consideration whatever one does, and in everything to discern the
truth and to uphold it&mdash;that is proper. To be
mistaken, on the other hand, to miss the truth,
to fall into error, to be led astray&mdash;that is as
improper as to be deranged and lose one's mind.
And all things just are proper; all things unjust,
like all things immoral, are improper.</p>
<p>The relation of propriety to fortitude is similar.
What is done in a manly and courageous spirit seems
becoming to a man and proper; what is done in a
contrary fashion is at once immoral and improper.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="95"/> This propriety, therefore, of which I am speaking belongs to each division of moral rectitude;
and its relation to the cardinal virtues is so close,
that it is perfectly self-evident and does not require
any abstruse process of reasoning to see it. For


<pb id="p.99"/>

there is a certain element of propriety perceptible
in every act of moral rectitude; and this can be
separated from virtue theoretically better than it
can be practically. As comeliness and beauty of
person are inseparable from the notion of health,
so this propriety of which we are speaking, while
in fact completely blended with virtue, is mentally
and theoretically distinguishable from it.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="96"/>  The classification of propriety, moreover, is twofold: <note type="marg">Propriety defined.</note> (1) we assume a general sort of propriety,
which is found in moral goodness as a whole; then (2)
there is another propriety, subordinate to this, which
belongs to the several divisions of moral goodness.
The former is usually defined somewhat as follows:
<quote>Propriety is that which harmonizes with man's
superiority in those respects in which his nature
differs from that of the rest of the animal creation.</quote>
And they so define the special type of propriety
which is subordinate to the general notion, that they
represent it to be that propriety which harmonizes
with Nature, in the sense that it manifestly embraces temperance and self-control, together with
a certain deportment such as becomes a gentleman.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="97"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/> That this is the common acceptation of<note type="marg">Poetic propriety.</note>
propriety we may infer from that propriety which
poets aim to secure. Concerning that, I have occasion to say more in another connection. Now,
we say that the poets observe propriety, when every
word or action is in accord with each individual
character. For example, if Aeacus or Minos said:

<quote rend="blockquote"><quote><l>Let them hate, if only they fear,</l></quote></quote>

or:

<quote rend="blockquote"><quote><l>The father is himself his children's tomb,</l></quote></quote>


<pb id="p.101"/>

that would seem improper, because we are told that
they were just men. But when Atreus speaks those
lines, they call forth applause; for the sentiment is
in keeping with the character. But it will rest
with the poets to decide, according to the individual
characters, what is proper for each; but to us Nature
herself has assigned a character of surpassing excellence, far superior to that of all other living creatures, and in accordance with that we shall have to
decide what propriety requires.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="98"/> The poets will observe, therefore, amid a great
variety of characters, what is suitable and proper
for all&mdash;even for the bad. But to us Nature<note type="marg">Moral propriety.</note>
has assigned the r&ocirc;les of steadfastness, temperance,
self-control, and considerateness of others; Nature
also teaches us not to be careless in our behaviour
towards our fellow-men. Hence we may clearly see
how wide is the application not only of that propriety which is essential to moral rectitude in
general, but also of the special propriety which is
displayed in each particular subdivision of virtue.
For, as physical beauty with harmonious symmetry
of the limbs engages the attention and delights the
eye, for the very reason that all the parts combine
in harmony and grace, so this propriety, which
shines out in our conduct, engages the approbation
of our fellow-men by the order, consistency, and
self-control it imposes upon every word and deed.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="99"/> We should, therefore, in our dealings with people<note type="marg">Considerateness.</note>
show what I may almost call reverence toward all
men&mdash;not only toward the men who are the best, but
toward others as well. For indifference to public
opinion implies not merely self-sufficiency, but even
total lack of principle. There is, too, a difference between <pb id="p.103"/> justice and considerateness in one's relations
to one's fellow-men. It is the function of justice
not to do wrong to one's fellow-men; of considerateness, not to wound their feelings; and in this the
essence of propriety is best seen.</p>
<p>With the foregoing exposition, I think it is clear
what the nature is of what we term propriety.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="100"/> Further, as to the duty which has its source in<note type="marg">Duties prescribed by propriety:</note>
propriety, the first road on which it conducts us
leads to harmony with Nature and the faithful observance of her laws. If we follow Nature as our<note type="marg">(1) follow Nature,</note>
guide, we shall never go astray, but we shall be
pursuing that which is in its nature clear-sighted
and penetrating (Wisdom), that which is adapted to
promote and strengthen society (Justice), and that
which is strong and courageous (Fortitude). But
the very essence of propriety is found in the division
of virtue which is now under discussion (Temperance). For it is only when they agree with Nature's
laws that we should give our approval to the movements not only of the body, but still more of the
spirit.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="101"/> Now we find that the essential activity of the<note type="marg">(2) subject appetite to reason.</note>
spirit is twofold: one force is appetite (that is, <foreign lang="greek">o(rmh/,</foreign>
in Greek), which impels a man this way and that;
the other is reason, which teaches and explains
what should be done and what should be left undone.
The result is that reason commands, appetite obeys.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/> Again, every action ought to be free from
undue haste or carelessness; neither ought we to
do anything for which we cannot assign a reasonable
motive; for in these words we have practically a
definition of duty.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="102"/> The appetites, moreover, must be made to obey


<pb id="p.105"/>

the reins of reason and neither allowed to run ahead
of it nor from listlessness or indolence to lag behind;
but people should enjoy calm of soul and be free
from every sort of passion. As a result strength<note type="marg">Self-control in (1) passions.</note>
of character and self-control will shine forth in all
their lustre. For when appetites overstep their
bounds and, galloping away, so to speak, whether
in desire or aversion, are not well held in hand
by reason, they clearly overleap all bound and
measure; for they throw obedience off and leave
it behind and refuse to obey the reins of reason,
to which they are subject by Nature's laws. And
not only minds but bodies as well are disordered by
such appetites. We need only to look at the faces
of men in a rage or under the influence of some
passion or fear or beside themselves with extravagant
joy: in every instance their features, voices, motions,
attitudes undergo a change.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="103"/> From all this&mdash;to return to our sketch of duty&mdash;
we see that all the appetites must be controlled
and calmed and that we must take infinite pains
not to do anything from mere impulse or at random,
without due consideration and care. For Nature has<note type="marg">(2) amusements.</note>
not brought us into the world to act as if we were
created for play or jest, but rather for earnestness
and for some more serious and important pursuits.
We may, of course, indulge in sport and jest, but in
the same way as we enjoy sleep or other relaxations,
and only when we have satisfied the claims of our
earnest, serious tasks. Further than that, the manner <note type="marg">(3) raillery.</note> of jesting itself ought not to be extravagant or
immoderate, but refined and witty. For as we do
not grant our children unlimited licence to play,
but only such freedom as is not incompatible with


<pb id="p.107"/>

good conduct, so even in our jesting let the light
of a pure character shine forth.<milestone unit="section" n="104"/>  There are, generally
speaking, two sorts of jest: the one, coarse, rude,
vicious, indecent; the other, refined, polite, clever,
witty. With this latter sort not only our own
Plautus and the Old Comedy of Athens, but also
the books of Socratic philosophy abound; and we
have many witty sayings of many men&mdash;like those
collected by old Cato under the title of <hi rend="italics">Bons Mots</hi>
(or Apophthegms). So the distinction between the
elegant and the vulgar jest is an easy matter: the
one kind, if well timed (for instance, in hours of
mental relaxation), is becoming to the most dignified
person; the other is unfit for any gentleman, if the
subject is indecent and the words obscene.</p>
<p>Then, too, certain bounds must be observed in
our amusements and we must be careful not to
carry things too far and, swept away by our passions,
lapse into some shameful excess. Our Campus,
however, and the amusements of the chase are
examples of wholesome recreation.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="105"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/> But it is essential to every inquiry about
duty that we keep before our eyes how far superior
man is by nature to cattle and other beasts: they
have no thought except for sensual pleasure and
this they are impelled by every instinct to seek;
but man's mind is nurtured by study and meditation; he is always either investigating or doing,
and he is captivated by the pleasure of seeing and
hearing. Nay, even if a man is more than ordinarily
inclined to sensual pleasures, provided, of course, <note type="marg">(4) pleasure.</note>
that he be not quite on a level with the beasts of
the field (for some people are men only in name,
not in fact)&mdash;if, I say, he is a little too susceptible


<pb id="p.109"/>

to the attractions of pleasure, he hides the fact,
however much he may be caught in its toils, and
for very shame conceals his appetite.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="106"/> From this we see that sensual pleasure is quite
unworthy of the dignity of man and that we ought
to despise it and cast it from us; but if someone
should be found who sets some value upon sensual
gratification, he must keep strictly within the limits
of moderate indulgence. One's physical comforts
and wants, therefore, should be ordered according
to the demands of health and strength, not according to the calls of pleasure. And if we will only
bear in mind the superiority and dignity of our
nature, we shall realize how wrong it is to abandon
ourselves to excess and to live in luxury and voluptuousness, and how right it is to live in thrift, selfdenial, simplicity, and sobriety.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="107"/>  We must realize also that we are invested by<note type="marg">The universal and the individual nature of man.</note>
Nature with two characters, as it were: one of these
is universal, arising from the fact of our being all
alike endowed with reason and with that superiority
which lifts us above the brute. From this all
morality and propriety are derived, and upon it
depends the rational method of ascertaining our
duty. The other character is the one that is<note type="marg">Individual endowments.</note>
assigned to individuals in particular. In the matter
of physical endowment there are great differences;
some, we see, excel in speed for the race, others in
strength for wrestling; so in point of personal appearance, some have stateliness, others comeliness.
Diversities of character are greater still.<milestone unit="section" n="108"/>  Lucius
Crassus and Lucius Philippus had a large fund of
wit; Gaius Caesar, Lucius's son, had a still richer
fund and employed it with more studied purpose.


<pb id="p.111"/>

Contemporary with them, Marcus Scaurus and
Marcus Drusus, the younger, were examples of
unusual seriousness; Gaius Laelius, of unbounded
jollity; while his intimate friend, Scipio, cherished
more serious ideals and lived a more austere life.
Among the Greeks, history tells us, Socrates was
fascinating and witty, a genial conversationalist;
he was what the Greeks call <foreign lang="greek">ei)/rwn</foreign>&mdash;in every conversation, pretending to need information and professing admiration for the wisdom of his companion.
Pythagoras and Pericles, on the other hand, reached
the heights of influence and power without any
seasoning of mirthfulness. We read that Hannibal,
among the Carthaginian generals, and Quintus
Maximus, among our own, were shrewd and ready
at concealing their plans, covering up their tracks,
disguising their movements, laying stratagems, forestalling the enemy's designs. In these qualities the
Greeks rank Themistocles and Jason of Pherae
above all others. Especially crafty and shrewd was
the device of Solon, who, to make his own life safer
and at the same time to do a considerably larger service for his country, feigned insanity.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="109"/> Then there are others, quite different from these,
straightforward and open, who think that nothing
should be done by underhand means or treachery.
They are lovers of truth, haters of fraud. There are
others still who will stoop to anything, truckle to anybody, if only they may gain their ends. Such, we
saw, were Sulla and Marcus Crassus. The most crafty
and most persevering man of this type was Lysander
of Sparta, we are told; of the opposite type was
Callicratidas, who succeeded Lysander as admiral of
the fleet. So we find that another, no matter how


<pb id="p.113"/>

eminent he may be, will condescend in social intercourse to make himself appear but a very ordinary
person. Such graciousness of manner we have seen
in the case of Catulus&mdash;both father and son&mdash;and also
of Quintus Mucius Mancia. I have heard from my
elders that Publius Scipio Nasica was another master
of this art; but his father, on the other hand&mdash;the
man who punished Tiberius Gracchus for his nefarious undertakings&mdash;had no such gracious manner in
social intercourse [ . . . ], and because of that very
fact he rose to greatness and fame.</p>
<p>Countless other dissimilarities exist in natures and
characters, and they are not in the least to be
criticized.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="110"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/> Everybody, however, must resolutely hold<note type="marg">Conduct must accord with individual endowments.</note>
fast to his own peculiar gifts, in so far as they are
peculiar only and not vicious, in order that propriety,
which is the object of our inquiry, may the more
easily be secured. For we must so act as not to
oppose the universal laws of human nature, but,
while safeguarding those, to follow the bent of our
own particular nature; and even if other careers
should be better and nobler, we may still regulate
our own pursuits by the standard of our own nature.
For it is of no avail to fight against one's nature or to
aim at what is impossible of attainment. From this
fact the nature of that propriety defined above comes
into still clearer light, inasmuch as nothing is proper
that <quote>goes against the grain,</quote> as the saying is&mdash;
that is, if it is in direct opposition to one's natural
genius.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="111"/> If there is any such thing as propriety at all,
it can be nothing more than uniform consistency


<pb id="p.115"/>

in the course of our life as a whole and all its individual actions. And this uniform consistency one
could not maintain by copying the personal traits of
others and eliminating one's own. For as we ought
to employ our mother-tongue, lest, like certain people
who are continually dragging in Greek words, we
draw well-deserved ridicule upon ourselves, so we
ought not to introduce anything foreign into our
actions or our life in general.<milestone unit="section" n="112"/>  Indeed, such diversity <note type="marg">The same course may be right for one, wrong for another.</note> of character carries with it so great significance
that suicide may be for one man a duty, for another
[under the same circumstances] a crime. Did
Marcus Cato find himself in one predicament, and
were the others, who surrendered to Caesar in
Africa, in another? And yet, perhaps, they would
have been condemned, if they had taken their lives;
for their mode of life had been less austere and
their characters more pliable. But Cato had been
endowed by nature with an austerity beyond belief,
and he himself had strengthened it by unswerving
consistency and had remained ever true to his purpose and fixed resolve; and it was for him to die
rather than to look upon the face of a tyrant.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="113"/> How much Ulysses endured on those long wanderings, when he submitted to the service even of
women (if Circe and Calypso may be called women)
and strove in every word to be courteous and complaisant to all! And, arrived at home, he brooked
even the insults of his men-servants and maidservants, in order to attain in the end the object of
his desire. But Ajax, with the temper he is represented as having, would have chosen to meet death
a thousand times rather than suffer such indignities!</p>
<p>If we take this into consideration, we shall see


<pb id="p.117"/>

that it is each man's duty to weigh well what are<note type="marg">Let every one sustain his own character.</note>
his own peculiar traits of character, to regulate these
properly, and not to wish to try how another man's
would suit him. For the more peculiarly his own
a man's character is, the better it fits him.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="114"/> Everyone, therefore, should make a proper
estimate of his own natural ability and show himself a critical judge of his own merits and defects;
in this respect we should not let actors display
more practical wisdom than we have. They select,
not the best plays, but the ones best suited to their
talents. Those who rely most upon the quality of
their voice take the Epigoni and the Medus; those
who place more stress upon the action choose the
Melanippa and the Clytaemnestra; Rupilius, whom
I remember, always played in the Antiope, Aesopus
rarely in the Ajax. Shall a player have regard to
this in choosing his role upon the stage, and a wise
man fail to do so in selecting his part in life?</p>
<p>We shall, therefore, work to the best advantage
in that r&ocirc;le to which we are best adapted. But
if at some time stress of circumstances shall thrust
us aside into some uncongenial part, we must devote
to it all possible thought, practice, and pains, that
we may be able to perform it, if not with propriety,
at least with as little impropriety as possible; and
we need not strive so hard to attain to points of
excellence that have not been vouchsafed to us as
to correct the faults we have.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="115"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/> To the two above-mentioned characters<note>The universal and the individual; &sect; 107.</note>
is added a third, which some chance or some circumstance imposes, and a fourth also, which we
assume by our own deliberate choice. Regal powers
and military commands, nobility of birth and political
office, wealth and influence, and their opposites


<pb id="p.119"/>

depend upon chance and are, therefore, controlled
by circumstances. But what r&ocirc;le we ourselves may<note type="marg">Selection of a career:</note>
choose to sustain is decided by our own free choice.
And so some turn to philosophy, others to the civil
law, and still others to oratory, while in case of the
virtues themselves one man prefers to excel in one,
another in another.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="116"/> They, whose fathers or forefathers have achieved<note type="marg">(1) inheritance,</note>
distinction in some particular field, often strive to
attain eminence in the same department of service:
for example, Quintus, the son of Publius Mucius, in
the law; Africanus, the son of Paulus, in the army.
And to that distinction which they have severally
inherited from their fathers some have added lustre
of their own; for example, that same Africanus, who
crowned his inherited military glory with his own
eloquence. Timotheus, Conon's son, did the same:
he proved himself not inferior to his father in military
renown and added to that distinction the glory of
culture and intellectual power. It happens sometimes, <note type="marg">(2) choice,</note> too, that a man declines to follow in the
footsteps of his fathers and pursues a vocation of
his own. And in such callings those very frequently
achieve signal success who, though sprung from
humble parentage, have set their aims high.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="117"/> All these questions, therefore, we ought to bear
thoughtfully in mind, when we inquire into the
nature of propriety; but above all we must decide
who and what manner of men we wish to be and
what calling in life we would follow; and this is the
most difficult problem in the world. For it is in the
years of early youth, when our judgment is most
immature, that each of us decides that his calling in
life shall be that to which he has taken a special
liking. And thus he becomes engaged in some


<pb id="p.121"/>

particular calling and career in life, before he is fit
to decide intelligently what is best for him.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="118"/> For we cannot all have the experience of Hercules, <note type="marg">Hercules at the parting of the ways.</note>
as we find it in the words of Prodicus in Xenophon:
<quote>When Hercules was just coming into youth's
estate (the time which Nature has appointed unto
every man for choosing the path of life on which
he would enter), he went out into a desert place.
And as he saw two paths, the path of Pleasure and
the path of Virtue, he sat down and debated long
and earnestly which one it were better for him to
take.</quote> This might, perhaps, happen to a Hercules,
<quote>scion of the seed of Jove</quote>; but it cannot well
happen to us; for we copy each the model he fancies,
and we are constrained to adopt their pursuits and
vocations. But usually, we are so imbued with the
teachings of our parents, that we fall irresistibly into
their manners and customs. Others drift with<note type="marg">(3) accident,</note>
the current of popular opinion and make especial
choice of those callings which the majority find most
attractive. Some, however, as the result either of
some happy fortune or of natural ability, enter upon
the right path of life, without parental guidance.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="119"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/> There is one class of people that is very
rarely met with: it is composed of those who are
endowed with marked natural ability, or exceptional
advantages of education and culture, or both, and
who also have time to consider carefully what career
in life they prefer to follow; and in this deliberation
the decision must turn wholly upon each individual's
natural bent. For we try to find out from each one's<note type="marg">(4) natural bias.</note>
native disposition, as was said above, just what is
proper for him; and this we require not only in case
of each individual act but also in ordering the whole
course of one's life; and this last is a matter to


<pb id="p.123"/>

which still greater care must be given, in order
that we may be true to ourselves throughout all our
lives and not falter in the discharge of any duty.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="120"/> But since the most powerful influence in the
choice of a career is exerted by Nature, and the next
most powerful by Fortune, we must, of course, take
account of them both in deciding upon our calling
in life; but, of the two, Nature claims the more
attention. For Nature is so much more stable and
steadfast, that for Fortune to come into conflict with
Nature seems like a combat between a mortal and a
goddess. If, therefore, anyone has conformed his
whole plan of life to the kind of nature that is his
(that is, his better nature), let him go on with it
consistently&mdash;for that is the essence of Propriety&mdash;
unless, perchance, he should discover that he has
made a mistake in choosing his life work. If this<note type="marg">Change of vocation.</note>
should happen (and it can easily happen), he must
change his vocation and mode of life. If circumstances favour such change, it will be effected with
greater ease and convenience. If not, it must be
made gradually, step by step, just as, when friendships become no longer pleasing or desirable, it is
more proper (so wise men think) to undo the bond
little by little than to sever it at a stroke.<milestone unit="section" n="121"/>  And when
we have once changed our calling in life, we must
take all possible care to make it clear that we have
done so with good reason.</p>
<p>But whereas I said a moment ago that we have to
follow in the steps of our fathers, let me make the
following exceptions: first, we need not imitate
their faults; second, we need not imitate certain
other things, if our nature does not permit such
imitation; for example, the son of the elder Africanus (that Scipio who adopted the younger Africanus,


<pb id="p.125"/>

the son of Paulus) could not on account of ill-health.
be so much like his father as Africanus had been
like his. If, then, a man is unable to conduct cases
at the bar or to hold the people spell-bound with
his eloquence or to conduct wars, still it will be his
duty to practise these other virtues, which are within
his reach&mdash;justice, good faith, generosity, temperance, self-control&mdash;
that his deficiencies in other respects may be less conspicuous. The noblest heritage,
however, that is handed down from fathers to children,
And one more precious than any inherited wealth, is
a reputation for virtue and worthy deeds; and to dishonour this must be branded as a sin and a shame.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="122"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/> Since, too, the duties that properly belong to different times of life are not the same, but
some belong to the young, others to those more
advanced in years, a word must be said on this distinction also.</p>
<p>It is, then, the duty of a young man to show deference <note type="marg">Duties of (1) youth,</note> to his elders and to attach himself to the best
and most approved of them, so as to receive the benefit
of their counsel and influence. For the inexperience of youth requires the practical wisdom of age
to strengthen and direct it. And this time of life
is above all to be protected against sensuality and
trained to toil and endurance of both mind and
body, so as to be strong for active duty in military
and civil service. And even when they wish to relax
their minds and give themselves up to enjoyment
they should beware of excesses and bear in mind
the rules of modesty. And this will be easier, if
the young are not unwilling to have their elders join
them even in their pleasures.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="123"/> The old, on the other hand, should, it seems, have<note type="marg">(2) age,</note>
their physical labours reduced; their mental activities <pb id="p.127"/> should be actually increased. They should
endeavour, too, by means of their counsel and practical wisdom to be of as much service as possible to
their friends and to the young, and above all to the
state. But there is nothing against which old age
has to be more on its guard than against surrendering to feebleness and idleness, while luxury, a vice
in any time of life, is in old age especially scandalous.
But if excess in sensual indulgence is added to
luxurious living, it is a twofold evil; for old age not
only disgraces itself; it also serves to make the
excesses of the young more shameless.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="124"/> At this point it is not at all irrelevant to discuss
the duties of magistrates, of private individuals,
[of native citizens,] and of foreigners.</p>
<p>It is, then, peculiarly the place of a magistrate to<note type="marg">(3) magistrates</note>
bear in mind that he represents the state and that
it is his duty to uphold its honour and its dignity, to
enforce the law, to dispense to all their constitutional
rights, and to remember that all this has been committed to him as a sacred trust.</p>
<p>The private individual ought first, in private relations, <note type="marg">(4) private citizens,</note> to live on fair and equal terms with his fellowcitizens, with a spirit neither servile and grovelling
nor yet domineering; and second, in matters pertaining to the state, to labour for her peace and
honour; for such a man we are accustomed to
esteem and call a good citizen.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="125"/> As for the foreigner or the resident alien, it is his<note type="marg">(5) allens.</note>
duty to attend strictly to his own concerns, not to pry
into other people's business, and under no condition
to meddle in the politics of a country not his own.</p>
<p>In this way I think we shall have a fairly clear<note type="marg">Duty and Propriety.</note>
view of our duties when the question arises what is
proper and what is appropriate to each character,


<pb id="p.129"/>

circumstance, and age. But there is nothing so
essentially proper as to maintain consistency in the
performance of every act and in the conception of
every plan.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="126"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/> But the propriety to which I refer shows<note type="marg">Propriety in bodily actions.</note>
itself also in every deed, in every word, even in every
movement and attitude of the body. And in outward, visible propriety there are three elements&mdash;
beauty, tact, and taste; these conceptions are difficult
to express in words, but it will be enough for my
purpose if they are understood. In these three
elements is included also our concern for the good
opinion of those with whom and amongst whom we
live. For these reasons I should like to say a few
words about this kind of propriety also.</p>
<p>First of all, Nature seems to have had a wonderful
plan in the construction of our bodies. Our face and
our figure generally, in so far as it has a comely
appearance, she has placed in sight; but the parts
of the body that are given us only to serve the
needs of Nature and that would present an unsightly
and unpleasant appearance she has covered up and
concealed from view.<milestone unit="section" n="127"/>  Man's modesty has followed<note type="marg">Modesty.</note>
this careful contrivance of Nature's; all right-minded
people keep out of sight what Nature has hidden
and take pains to respond to Nature's demands as
privately as possible; and in the case of those parts
of the body which only serve Nature's needs, neither
the parts nor the functions are called by their real
names. To perform these functions&mdash;if only it be
done in private&mdash;is nothing immoral; but to speak
of them is indecent. And so neither public performance of those acts nor vulgar mention of them
is free from indecency.</p>


<pb id="p.131"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="128"/> But we should give no heed to the Cynics (or to
some Stoics who are practically Cynics) who censure
and ridicule us for holding that the mere mention of
some actions that are not immoral is shameful, while
other things that are immoral we call by their real
names. Robbery, fraud, and adultery, for example,
are immoral in deed, but it is not indecent to name
them. To beget children in wedlock is in deed
morally right; to speak of it is indecent. And they
assail modesty with a great many other arguments
to the same purport. But as for us, let us follow
Nature and shun everything that is offensive to our
eyes or our ears. So, in standing or walking, in
sitting or reclining, in our expression, our eyes, or
the movements of our hands, let us preserve what
we have called <quote>propriety.</quote></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="129"/> In these matters we must avoid especially the two
extremes: our conduct and speech should not be
effeminate and over-nice, on the one hand, nor coarse
and boorish, on the other. And we surely must not
admit that, while this rule applies to actors and orators, it is not binding upon us. As for stage-people,
their custom, because of its traditional discipline,
carries modesty to such a point that an actor would
never step out upon the stage without a breech-cloth
on, for fear he might make an improper exhibition,
if by some accident certain parts of his person should
happen to become exposed. And in our own custom,
grown sons do not bathe with their fathers, nor
sons-in-law with their fathers-in-law. We must,
therefore, keep to the path of this sort of modesty,
especially when Nature is our teacher and guide.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="130"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/> Again, there are two orders of beauty:<note type="marg">Propriety: (1) in outward appearance;</note>
in the one, loveliness predominates; in the other,


<pb id="p.133"/>

dignity; of these, we ought to regard loveliness as
the attribute of woman, and dignity as the attribute
of man. Therefore, let all finery not suitable to a
man's dignity be kept off his person, and let him
guard against the like fault in gesture and action.
The manners taught in the palaestra,<note>The Greek palaestra, a public school of wrestling and
athletics, adopted by the Romans became a place of exercise
where the youth were trained in gestures and attitudes, a
nursery of foppish manners.</note> for example,
are often rather objectionable, and the gestures of
actors on the stage are not always free from affectation; but simple, unaffected manners are commendable in both instances. Now dignity of mien is also to
be enhanced by a good complexion; the complexion
is the result of physical exercise. We must besides
present an appearance of neatness&mdash;not too punctilious or exquisite, but just enough to avoid boorish
and ill-bred slovenliness. We must follow the same
principle in regard to dress. In this, as in most
things, the best rule is the golden mean.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="131"/> We must be careful, too, not to fall into a habit of
listless sauntering in our gait, so as to look like carriers in festal processions, or of hurrying too fast,
when time presses. If we do this, it puts us out of
breath, our looks are changed, our features distorted;
and all this is clear evidence of a lack of poise. But<note type="marg">(2) in inward self-control.</note>
it is much more important that we succeed in keeping our mental operations in harmony with Nature's
laws. And we shall not fail in this if we guard
against violent excitement or depression, and if we
keep our minds intent on the observance of propriety.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="132"/> Our mental operations, moreover, are of two


<pb id="p.135"/>

kinds: some have to do with thought, others with
impulse. Thought is occupied chiefly with the discovery of truth; impulse prompts to action. We
must be careful, therefore, to employ our thoughts
on themes as elevating as possible and to keep our
impulses under the control of reason.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/> The power of speech in the attainment<note type="marg">Propriety in speech: oratory and conversation.</note>
of propriety is great, and its function is twofold: the
first is oratory; the second, conversation. Oratory
is the kind of discourse to be employed in pleadings in
court and speeches in popular assemblies and in the
senate; conversation should find its natural place in
social gatherings, in informal discussions, and in intercourse with friends; it should also seek admission at
dinners. There are rules for oratory laid down by
rhetoricians; there are none for conversation; and
yet I do not know why there should not be. But
where there are students to learn, teachers are
found; there are, however, none who make conversation a subject of study, whereas pupils throng
about the rhetoricians everywhere. And yet the
same rules that we have for words and sentences in
rhetoric will apply also to conversation.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="133"/> Now since we have the voice as the organ of
speech, we should aim to secure two properties
for it: that it be clear, and that it be musical.
We must, of course, look to Nature for both gifts.
But distinctness may be improved by practice; the
musical qualities, by imitating those who speak
with smooth and articulate enunciation.</p>
<p>There was nothing in the two Catuli to lead one
to suppose that they had a refined literary taste;
they were men of culture, it is true; and so were
others; but the Catuli were looked upon as the perfect


<pb id="p.137"/>

masters of the Latin tongue. Their pronunciation
was charming; their words were neither mouthed
nor mumbled: they avoided both indistinctness and
affectation; their voices were free from strain, yet
neither faint nor shrill. More copious was the speech
of Lucius Crassus and not less brilliant, but the reputation of the two Catuli for eloquence was fully
equal to his. But in wit and humour Caesar, the
elder Catulus's half-brother, surpassed them all:
even at the bar he would with his conversational
style defeat other advocates with their elaborate
orations.</p>
<p>If, therefore, we are aiming to secure propriety in
every circumstance of life, we must master all these
points.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="134"/> Conversation, then, in which the Socratics are the<note type="marg">Conversation as an art.</note>
best models, should have these qualities. It should
be easy and not in the least dogmatic; it should have
the spice of wit. And the one who engages in conversation should not debar others from participating
in it, as if he were entering upon a private monopoly;
but, as in other things, so in a general conversation he should think it not unfair for each to have
his turn. He should observe, first and foremost,
what the subject of conversation is. If it is grave,
he should treat it with seriousness; if humorous,
with wit. And above all, he should be on the watch
that his conversation shall not betray some defect in
his character. This is most likely to occur, when
people in jest or in earnest take delight in making
malicious and slanderous statements about the absent,
on purpose to injure their reputations.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="135"/> The subjects of conversation are usually affairs of
the home or politics or the practice of the professions


<pb id="p.139"/>

and learning. Accordingly, if the talk begins to
drift off to other channels, pains should be taken to
bring it back again to the matter in hand&mdash;but with
due consideration to the company present; for we
are not all interested in the same things at all times
or in the same degree. We must observe, too, how
far the conversation is agreeable and, as it had a
reason for its beginning, so there should be a point
at which to close it tactfully.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="136"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/> But as we have a most excellent rule<note type="marg">Propriety of speech,</note>
for every phase of life, to avoid exhibitions of passion,
that is, mental excitement that is excessive and uncontrolled by reason; so our conversation ought to
be free from such emotions: let there be no exhibition
of anger or inordinate desire, of indolence or indifference, or anything of the kind. We must also take
the greatest care to show courtesy and consideration
toward those with whom we converse.</p>
<p>It may sometimes happen that there is need of<note type="marg">(1) in reproofs,</note>
administering reproof. On such occasions we should,
perhaps, use a more emphatic tone of voice and
more forcible and severe terms and even assume an
appearance of being angry. But we shall have recourse to this sort of reproof, as we do to cautery
and amputation, rarely and reluctantly&mdash;never at all,
unless it is unavoidable and no other remedy can be
discovered. We may seem angry, but anger should
be far from us; for in anger nothing right or judicious can be done.<milestone unit="section" n="137"/>  In most cases, we may apply a
mild reproof, so combined, however, with earnestness, that, while severity is shown, offensive language
is avoided. Nay more, we must show clearly that
even that very harshness which goes with our reproof is designed for the good of the person reproved.</p>


<pb id="p.141"/>

<p>The right course, moreover, even in our differences<note type="marg">(2) in disputes.</note>
with our bitterest enemies, is to maintain our dignity and to repress our anger, even though we are
treated outrageously. For what is done under some
degree of excitement cannot be done with perfect
self-respect or the approval of those who witness it.</p>
<p>It is bad taste also to talk about oneself&mdash;especially <note type="marg">(3) in self-praise.</note> if what one says is not true&mdash;and, amid the
derision of one's hearers, to play <quote>The Braggart
Captain.</quote><note>Like Pyrgopolinices in the <hi rend="italics">Miles Gloriosus</hi> of Plautus,
or Thraso in the <hi rend="italics">Eunuchus</hi> of Terence.</note></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="138"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/> But since I am investigating this subject<note type="marg">The proper home.</note>
in all its phases (at least, that is my purpose), I
must discuss also what sort of house a man of rank
and station should, in my opinion, have. Its prime
object is serviceableness. To this the plan of the
building should be adapted; and yet careful attention should be paid to its convenience and distinction.</p>
<p>We have heard that Gnaeus Octavius&mdash;the first
of that family to be elected consul&mdash;distinguished
himself by building upon the Palatine an attractive
and imposing house. Everybody went to see it,
and it was thought to have gained votes for the
owner, a new man, in his canvass for the consulship.
That house Scaurus demolished, and on its site he
built an addition to his own house. Octavius, then,
was the first of his family to bring the honour of a
consulship to his house; Scaurus, though the son of
a very great and illustrious man, brought to the
same house, when enlarged, not only defeat, but disgrace and ruin.<milestone unit="section" n="139"/>  The truth is, a man's dignity may be
enhanced by the house he lives in, but not wholly
secured by it; the owner should bring honour to his


<pb id="p.143"/>

house, not the house to its owner. And, as in
everything else a man must have regard not for
himself alone but for others also, so in the home of
a distinguished man, in which numerous guests must
be entertained and crowds of every sort of people
received, care must be taken to have it spacious.
But if it is not frequented by visitors, if it has an
air of lonesomeness, a spacious palace often becomes
a discredit to its owner. This is sure to be the
case if at some other time, when it had a different
owner, it used to be thronged. For it is unpleasant,
when passers-by remark:

<quote rend="blockquote"><quote><l>O good old house, alas! how different</l>
<l>The owner who now owneth thee!</l></quote></quote>

And in these times that may be said of many a
house!<note>Members of Caesar's party were now occupying the
houses that had been the homes of Pompey's friends.
Antony, for example, lived in Pompey's house.</note></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="140"/> One must be careful, too, not to go beyond
proper bounds in expense and display, especially
if one is building for oneself. For much mischief
is done in this way, if only in the example set.
For many people imitate zealously the foibles of
the great, particularly in this direction: for example,
who copies the virtues of Lucius Lucullus, excellent man that he was? But how many there are who
have copied the magnificence of his villas! Some limit
should surely be set to this tendency and it should
be reduced at least to a standard of moderation;
and by that same standard of moderation the comforts and wants of life generally should be regulated.</p>
<p>But enough on this part of my theme.</p>


<pb id="p.145"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="141"/> In entering upon any course of action, then, <note type="marg">Three rules for the duty of propriety.</note>
we must hold fast to three principles: first, that
impulse shall obey reason; for there is no better
way than this to secure the observance of duties;
second, that we estimate carefully the importance
of the object that we wish to accomplish, so that
neither more nor less care and attention may be
expended upon it than the case requires; the third
principle is that we be careful to observe moderation
in all that is essential to the outward appearance
and dignity of a gentleman. Moreover, the best
rule for securing this is strictly to observe that
propriety which we have discussed above, and not
to overstep it. Yet of these three principles, the
one of prime importance is to keep impulse subservient to reason.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="142"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/> Next, then, we must discuss orderliness of<note type="marg">Orderliness&mdash; the right thing at the right time.</note>
conduct and seasonableness of occasions. These two
qualities are embraced in that science which the
Greeks call <foreign lang="greek">eu)taci/a</foreign>&mdash;not that <foreign lang="greek">eu)taci/a</foreign> which we
translate with <hi rend="italics">moderation</hi> [<hi rend="italics">modestia</hi>], derived from
<hi rend="italics">moderate;</hi> but this is the <foreign lang="greek">eu)taci/a</foreign> by which we understand <hi rend="italics">orderly conduct.</hi> And so, if we may call it
also <hi rend="italics">moderation,</hi> it is defined by the Stoics as follows:
<quote>Moderation is the science of disposing aright
everything that is done or said.</quote> So the essence
of <hi rend="italics">orderliness</hi> and of right-placing, it seems, will be
the same; for <hi rend="italics">orderliness</hi> they define also as <quote>the
arrangement of things in their suitable and appropriate places.</quote> By <quote>place of action,</quote> moreover,
they mean <hi rend="italics">seasonableness of circumstance;</hi> and the
<hi rend="italics">seasonable circumstance</hi> for an action is called in
Greek <foreign lang="greek">eu)kairi/a,</foreign> in Latin <hi rend="italics">occasio</hi> (occasion). So it
comes about that in this sense <hi rend="italics">moderation,</hi> which we


<pb id="p.147"/>

explain as I have indicated, is the science of doing
the right thing at the right time.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="143"/> A similar definition can be given for prudence, of
which I have spoken in an early chapter. But in
this part we are considering temperance and self-control and related virtues. Accordingly, the
properties which, as we found, are peculiar to prudence were discussed in their proper place, while
those are to be discussed now which are peculiar to
these virtues of which we have for some time been
speaking and which relate to considerateness and to
the approbation of our fellow-men.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="144"/> Such orderliness of conduct is, therefore, to be observed, that everything in the conduct of our life
shall balance and harmonize, as in a finished speech. <note type="marg">Seasonableness of speech.</note>
For it is unbecoming and highly censurable, when
upon a serious theme, to introduce such jests as are
proper at a dinner, or any sort of loose talk. When
Pericles was associated with the poet Sophocles as
his colleague in command and they had met to
confer about official business that concerned them
both, a handsome boy chanced to pass and Sophocles
said: <quote>Look, Pericles; what a pretty boy!</quote> How
pertinent was Pericles's reply: <quote>Hush, Sophocles,
a general should keep not only his hands but his
eyes under control.</quote> And yet, if Sophocles had
made this same remark at a trial of athletes, he
would have incurred no just reprimand. So great
is the significance of both place and circumstance.
For example, if anyone, while on a journey or on a
walk, should rehearse to himself a case which he is
preparing to conduct in court, or if he should under
similar circumstances apply his closest thought to
some other subject, he would not be open to censure


<pb id="p.149"/>

but if he should do that same thing at a dinner,
he would be thought ill-bred, because he ignored
the proprieties of the occasion.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="145"/> But flagrant breaches of good breeding, like singing <note type="marg">The little things that count.</note> in the streets or any other gross misconduct, are
easily apparent and do not call especially for admonition and instruction. But we must even more
carefully avoid those seemingly trivial faults which
pass unnoticed by the many. However slightly out
of tune a harp or flute may be, the fault is still
detected by a connoisseur; so we must be on the
watch lest haply something in our life be out of
tune&mdash;nay, rather, far greater is the need for painstaking, inasmuch as harmony of actions is far better
and far more important than harmony of sounds.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="146"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/> As, therefore, a musical ear detects even the<note type="marg">We correct our faults</note>
slightest falsity of tone in a harp, so we, if we wish<note type="marg">(1) by observing others,</note>
to be keen and careful observers of moral faults, shall
often draw important conclusions from trifles. We
observe others and from a glance of the eyes, from
a contracting or relaxing of the brows, from an air
of sadness, from an outburst of joy, from a laugh,
from speech, from silence, from a raising or lowering
of the voice, and the like, we shall easily judge which
of our actions is proper, and which is out of accord
with duty and Nature. And, in the same manner, it
is not a bad plan to judge of the nature of our every
action by studying others, that so we may ourselves
avoid anything that is unbecoming in them. For it
happens somehow or other that we detect another's
failings more readily than we do our own; and so
in the school-room those pupils learn most easily
to do better whose faults the masters mimic for the
sake of correcting them.</p>


<pb id="p.151"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="147"/> Nor is it out of place in making a choice between<note type="marg">(2) by the criticisms of the wise.</note>
duties involving a doubt, to consult men of learning
or practical wisdom and to ascertain what their views
are on any particular question of duty. For the
majority usually drift as the current of their own
natural inclinations carries them; and in deriving
counsel from one of these, we have to see not only
what our adviser says, but also what he thinks, and
what his reasons are for thinking as he does. For,
as painters and sculptors and even poets, too, wish
to have their works reviewed by the public, in order
that, if any point is generally criticized, it may be
improved; and as they try to discover both by themselves and with the help of others what is wrong in
their work; so through consulting the judgment of
others we find that there are many things to be done
and left undone, to be altered and improved.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="148"/> But no rules need to be given about what is done<note type="marg">The laws of the state are rules of duty.</note>
in accordance with the established customs and conventions of a community; for these are in themselves
rules; and no one ought to make the mistake of
supposing that, because Socrates or Aristippus did
or said something contrary to the manners and established customs of their city, he has a right to do the
same; it was only by reason of their great and superhuman virtues that those famous men acquired this
special privilege. But the Cynics' whole system of
philosophy must be rejected, for it is inimical to moral
sensibility, and without moral sensibility nothing
can be upright, nothing morally good.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="149"/> It is, furthermore, our duty to honour and reverence <note type="marg">Special rules.</note> those whose lives are conspicuous for conduct
in keeping with their high moral standards, and who,
as true patriots, have rendered or are now rendering


<pb id="p.153"/>

efficient service to their country, just as much as if
they were invested with some civil or military authority; it is our duty also to show proper respect to old
age, to yield precedence to magistrates, to make a
distinction between a fellow-citizen and a foreigner,
and, in the case of the foreigner himself, to discriminate according to whether he has come in an official
or a private capacity. In a word, not to go into details, it is our duty to respect, defend, and maintain
the common bonds of union and fellowship subsisting between all the members of the human race.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="150"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/> Now in regard to trades and other means<note type="marg">Occupations: (1) vulgar,</note>
of livelihood, which ones are to be considered
becoming to a gentleman and which ones are
vulgar, we have been taught, in general, as follows.
First, those means of livelihood are rejected as undesirable which incur people's ill-will, as those
of tax-gatherers and usurers. Unbecoming to a
gentleman, too, and vulgar are the means of livelihood of all hired workmen whom we pay for mere
manual labour, not for artistic skill; for in their
case the very wage they receive is a pledge of their
slavery. Vulgar we must consider those also who
buy from wholesale merchants to retail immediately;
for they would get no profits without a great deal
of downright lying; and verily, there is no action
that is meaner than misrepresentation. And all
mechanics are engaged in vulgar trades; for no
workshop can have anything liberal about it. Least
respectable of all are those trades which cater for
sensual pleasures:

<quote rend="blockquote"><quote><l>Fishmongers, butchers, cooks, and poulterers,</l>
<l part="I">And fishermen,</l></quote></quote>


<pb id="p.155"/>

as Terence says. Add to these, if you please, the
perfumers, dancers, and the whole <hi rend="italics">corps de ballet</hi><note>The <hi rend="italics">ludus talarius</hi> was a kind of low variety show, with
loose songs and dances and bad music.</note></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="151"/> But the professions in which either a higher<note type="marg">(2) liberal.</note>
degree of intelligence is required or from which no
small benefit to society is derived&mdash;medicine and
architecture, for example, and teaching&mdash;these are
proper for those whose social position they become.
Trade, if it is on a small scale, is to be considered
vulgar; but if wholesale and on a large scale, importing large quantities from all parts of the world
and distributing to many without misrepresentation,
it is not to be greatly disparaged. Nay, it even
seems to deserve the highest respect, if those who
are engaged in it, satiated, or rather, I should say,
satisfied with the fortunes they have made, make
their way from the port to a country estate, as they
have often made it from the sea into port. But of
all the occupations by which gain is secured, none
is better than agriculture, none more profitable,
none more delightful, none more becoming to a
freeman. But since I have discussed this quite
fully in, my Cato Major, you will find there the
material that applies to this point.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="152"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/> Now, I think I have explained fully<note type="marg">Comparative estimate of duties.</note>
enough how moral duties are derived from the four
divisions of moral rectitude. But between those
very actions which are morally right, a conflict and
comparison may frequently arise, as to which of two
moral actions is morally better&mdash;a point overlooked by
Panaetius. For, since all moral rectitude springs from
four sources (one of which is prudence; the second,
social instinct; the third, courage; the fourth, temperance),it <pb id="p.157"/> is often necessary in deciding a question of
duty that these virtues be weighed against one
another.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="153"/> My view, therefore, is that those duties are closer<note type="marg">Justice vs. Wisdom.</note>
to Nature which depend upon the social instinct
than those which depend upon knowledge; and this
view can be confirmed by the following argument:
(1) suppose that a wise man should be vouchsafed
such a life that, with an abundance of everything
pouring in upon him, he might in perfect peace
study and ponder over everything that is worth
knowing, still, if the solitude were so complete that
he could never see a human being, he would die.
And then, the foremost of all virtues is wisdom&mdash;what
the Greeks call <foreign lang="greek">sofi/a;</foreign> for by prudence, which they
call <foreign lang="greek">fro/nhsis,</foreign> we understand something else, namely,
the practical knowledge of things to be sought for
and of things to be avoided. (2) Again, that wisdom
which I have given the foremost place is the knowledge of things human and divine, which is concerned
also with the bonds of union between gods and men
and the relations of man to man. If wisdom is the
most important of the virtues, as it certainly is, it
necessarily follows that that duty which is connected
with the social obligation is the most important duty.<note>Cicero is guilty of a curious fallacy. If it follows from
his premises, (1) some one virtue is the highest virtue, and
(2) the duties derived from the highest virtue are the highest
duties, and if (3) wisdom is the highest virtue, then it can
only follow that the duties derived from wisdom are the highest duties. But Cicero throws in a fourth premise that the
<quote>bonds of union between gods and men and the relations of
man to man</quote> are derived from wisdom, and therewith side-tracks wisdom and gives the duties derived from the social
instinct the place from which wisdom has been shunted.
<p>Cicero could not refrain from introducing a bit of
theoretical speculation that has no value for his practical
position&mdash;it actually prejudices it and confuses the reader.</p></note>
And (3) service is better than mere theoretical knowledge, for the study and knowledge of the universe
would somehow be lame and defective, were no practical results to follow. Such results, moreover, are best
seen in the safeguarding of human interests. It is


<pb id="p.159"/>

essential, then, to human society; and it should,
therefore, be ranked above speculative knowledge.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="154"/> Upon this all the best men agree, as they prove
by their conduct. For who is so absorbed in the
investigation and study of creation, but that, even
though he were working and pondering over tasks
never so much worth mastering and even though he
thought he could number the stars and measure the
length and breadth of the universe, he would drop
all those problems and cast them aside, if word were
suddenly brought to him of some critical peril to his
country, which he could relieve or repel? And he
would do the same to further the interests of parent
or friend or to save him from danger.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="155"/> From all this we conclude that the duties
scribed by justice must be given precedence
the pursuit of knowledge and the duties imp
by it; for the former concern the welfare of
fellow-men; and nothing ought to be more sacred
in men's eyes than that.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/> And vet scholars, whose whole life and<note type="marg">Wisdom in the service of Justice.</note>
interests have been devoted to the pursuit of knowledge, have not, after all, failed to contribute to the
advantages and blessings of mankind. For they have
trained many to be better citizens and to render
larger service to their country. So, for example, the
Pythagorean Lysis taught Epaminondas of Thebes;
Plato, Dion of Syracuse; and many, many others. As
for me myself, whatever service I have rendered to
my country&mdash;if, indeed, I have rendered any&mdash;I
came to my task trained and equipped for it by my
teachers and what they taught me.<milestone unit="section" n="156"/>  And not only
while present in the flesh do they teach and train those
who are desirous of learning, but by the written


<pb id="p.161"/>

memorials of their learning they continue the same
service after they are dead. For they have overlooked no point that has a bearing upon laws, customs,
or political science; in fact, they seem to have devoted their retirement to the benefit of us who are
engaged in public business. The principal thing done,
therefore, by those very devotees of the pursuits of
learning and science is to apply their own practical
wisdom and insight to the service of humanity. And
for that reason also much speaking (if only it contain
wisdom) is better than speculation never so profound
without speech; for mere speculation is self-centred,
while speech extends its benefits to those with whom
we are united by the bonds of society.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="157"/> And again, as swarms of bees do not gather for
the sake of making honeycomb but make the honeycomb because they are gregarious by nature, so human
beings&mdash;and to a much higher degree&mdash;exercise their
skill together in action and thought because they are
naturally gregarious. And so, if that virtue [Justice] <note type="marg">Justice more valuable than Wisdom and Fortitude.</note>
which centres in the safeguarding of human interests, that is, in the maintenance of human society,
were not to accompany the pursuit of knowledge,
that knowledge would seem isolated and barren of
results. In the same way, courage [Fortitude], if
unrestrained by the uniting bonds of society, would
be but a sort of brutality and savagery. Hence it
follows that the claims of human society and the
bonds that unite men together take precedence of
the pursuit of speculative knowledge.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="158"/> And it is not true, as certain people maintain, that
the bonds of union in human society were instituted
in order to provide for the needs of daily life; for,
they say, without the aid of others we could not


<pb id="p.163"/>

secure for ourselves or supply to others the things
that Nature requires; but if all that is essential to our
wants and comfort were supplied by some magic
wand, as in the stories, then every man of first-rate
ability could drop all other responsibility and devote
himself exclusively to learning and study. Not at
all. For he would seek to escape from his loneliness
and to find someone to share his studies; he would
wish to teach, as well as to learn; to hear, as well as
to speak. Every duty, therefore, that tends effectively to maintain and safeguard human society should
be given the preference over that duty which arises
from speculation and science alone.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="159"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/> The following question should, perhaps, be<note type="marg">Justice <hi rend="italics">vs.</hi> Temperance.</note>
asked: whether this social instinct, which is the
deepest feeling in our nature, is always to have precedence over temperance and moderation also. I think
not. For there are some acts either so repulsive or so
wicked, that a wise man would not commit them,
even to save his country. Posidonius has made a
large collection of them; but some of them are so
shocking, so indecent, that it seems immoral even
to mention them. The wise man, therefore, will not
think of doing any such thing for the sake of his
country; no more will his country consent to have
it done for her. But the problem is the more easily
disposed of because the occasion cannot arise when
it could be to the state's interest to have the wise
man do any of those things.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="160"/> This, then, may be regarded as settled: in choosing <note type="marg">Order of precedence of duties.</note> between conflicting duties, that class takes precedence which is demanded by the interests of
human society. [And this is the natural sequence;
for discreet action will presuppose learning and practical <pb id="p.165"/> wisdom; it follows, therefore, that discreet
action is of more value than wise (but inactive)
speculation.]</p>
<p>So much must suffice for this topic. For, in its
essence, it has been made so clear, that in determining a question of duty it is not difficult to
see which duty is to be preferred to any other.
Moreover, even in the social relations themselves
there are gradations of duty so well defined that
it can easily be seen which duty takes precedence of any other: our first duty is to the immortal
gods; our second, to country; our third, to parents;
and so on, in a descending scale, to the rest.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="161"/> From this brief discussion, then, it can be understood that people are often in doubt not only whether
an action is morally right or wrong, but also, when
a choice is offered between two moral actions, which
one is morally better. This point, as I remarked
above, has been overlooked by Panaetius. But let us
now pass on to what remains.</p></div1>

<pb id="p.169"/>
<div1 type="book" n="2"><head>Book II: Expediency</head>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/> I believe, Marcus, my son, that I have fully<note type="marg">Statement of subject.</note>
explained in the preceding book how duties are
derived from moral rectitude, or rather from each of
virtue's four divisions. My next step is to trace out
those kinds of duty which have to do with the comforts of life, with the means of acquiring the things
that people enjoy, with influence, and with wealth.
[In this connection, the question is, as I said: (1)
what is expedient, and what is inexpedient; and (2)
of several expedients, which is of more and which
of most importance.] These questions I shall proceed to discuss, after I have said a few words in
vindication of my present purpose and my principles
of philosophy.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Although my books have aroused in not a few men<note type="marg">Why Cicero wrote on philosophy.</note>
the desire not only to read but to write, yet I sometimes fear that what we term philosophy is distasteful
to certain worthy gentlemen, and that they wonder
that I devote so much time and attention to it.</p>
<p>Now, as long as the state was administered by the
men to whose care she had voluntarily entrusted
herself, I devoted all my effort and thought to her.
But when everything passed under the absolute
control of a despot and there was no longer any
room for statesmanship or authority of mine; and
finally when I had lost the friends<note>Such as Pompey, Cato, Hortensius, and Piso.</note> who had been
associated with me in the task of serving the interests
of the state, and who were men of the highest
standing, I did not resign myself to grief, by which
I should have been overwhelmed, had I not struggled


<pb id="p.171"/>

against it; neither, on the other hand, did I surrender myself to a life of sensual pleasure unbecoming to a philosopher.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/> I would that the government had stood fast in
the position it had begun to assume and had not
fallen into the hands of men who desired not so
much to reform as to abolish the constitution. For
then, in the first place, I should now be devoting
my energies more to public speaking than to writing, as I used to do when the republic stood; and in
the second place, I should be committing to written
form not these present essays but my public speeches,
as I often formerly did. But when the republic, to
which all my care and thought and effort used to be
devoted, was no more, then, of course, my voice was
silenced in the forum and in the senate.<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>  And since
my mind could not be wholly idle, I thought, as I
had been well-read along these lines of thought from
my early youth, that the most honourable way for
me to forget my sorrows would be by turning to
philosophy. As a young man, I had devoted a great
deal of time to philosophy as a discipline; but after
I began to fill the high offices of state and devoted
myself heart and soul to the public service, there
was only so much time for philosophical studies as
was left over from the claims of my friends and of
the state; all of this was spent in reading; I had no
leisure for writing.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/> Therefore, amid all the present most awful<note type="marg">Why philosophy is worth while.</note>
calamities I yet flatter myself that I have won
this good out of evil&mdash;that I may commit to written
form matters not at all familiar to our countrymen
but still very much worth their knowing. For
what, in the name of heaven, is more to be desired


<pb id="p.173"/>

than wisdom? What is more to be prized? What
is better for a man, what more worthy of his nature?
Those who seek after it are called philosophers;
and philosophy is nothing else, if one will translate
the word into our idiom, than <quote>the love of wisdom.</quote>
Wisdom, moreover, as the word has been defined
by the philosophers of old, is <quote>the knowledge of
things human and divine and of the causes by which
those things are controlled.</quote> And if the man lives
who would belittle the study of philosophy, I quite
fail to see what in the world he would see fit to
praise.<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>  For if we are looking for mental enjoyment
and relaxation, what pleasure can be compared
with the pursuits of those who are always studying
out something that will tend toward and effectively
promote a good and happy life? Or, if regard is
had for strength of character and virtue, then this
is the method by which we can attain to those
qualities, or there is none at all. And to say that
there is no <quote>method</quote> for securing the highest blessings, when none even of the least important concerns
is without its method, is the language of people who
talk without due reflection and who blunder in matters of the utmost importance. Furthermore, if
there is really a way to learn virtue, where shall one
look for it, when one has turned aside from this
field of learning?</p>
<p>Now, when I am advocating the study of philosophy, I usually discuss this subject at greater length,
as I have done in another of my books. For the
present I meant only to explain why, deprived of
the tasks of public service, I have devoted myself to
this particular pursuit.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But people raise other objections against me&mdash;


<pb id="p.175"/>

and that, too, philosophers and scholars&mdash;asking<note type="marg">Position of the New Academy.</note>
whether I think I am quite consistent in my conduct: for although our school maintains that nothing
can be known for certain, yet, they urge, I make a
habit of presenting my opinions on all sorts of subjects and at this very moment am trying to formulate
rules of duty. But I wish that they had a proper
understanding of our position. For we Academicians are not men whose minds wander in uncertainty and never know what principles to adopt.
For what sort of mental habit, or rather what sort
of life would that be which should dispense with all
rules for reasoning or even for living? Not so with
us; but, as other schools maintain that some things
are certain, others uncertain, we, differing with
them, say that some things are probable, others
improbable.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/> What, then, is to hinder me from accepting what
seems to me to be probable, while rejecting what
seems to be improbable, and from shunning the
presumption of dogmatism, while keeping clear of
that recklessness of assertion which is as far as
possible removed from true wisdom? And as to the
fact that our school argues against everything, that
is only because we could not get a clear view of
what is <quote>probable,</quote> unless a comparative estimate
were made of all the arguments on both sides.</p>
<p>But this subject has been, I think, quite fully set
forth in my <quote>Academics.</quote> And although, my dear
Cicero, you are a student of that most ancient and
celebrated school of philosophy, with Cratippus as
your master&mdash;and he deserves to be classed with the
founders of that illustrious sect<note>Aristotle and Theophrastus.</note>&mdash;still I wish our


<pb id="p.177"/>

school, which is closely related to yours, not to be
unknown to you.</p>
<p>Let us now proceed to the task in hand.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/> Five principles, accordingly, have been laid<note type="marg">Expediency and Moral Rectitude identical.</note>
down for the pursuance of duty: two of them have to
do with propriety and moral rectitude; two, with the
external conveniences of life&mdash;means, wealth, influence; the fifth, with the proper choice, if ever the
four first mentioned seem to be in conflict. The
division treating of moral rectitude, then, has been
completed, and this is the part with which I desire
you to be most familiar.</p>
<p>The principle with which we are now dealing is
that one which is called Expediency. The usage
of this word has been corrupted and perverted and
has gradually come to the point where, separating
moral rectitude from expediency, it is accepted that
a thing may be morally right without being expedient, and expedient without being morally right.
No more pernicious doctrine than this could be
introduced into human life.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/> There are, to be sure, philosophers of the very
highest reputation who distinguish theoretically between these three conceptions,<note>That is, they make a false distinction between (1) moral
rectitude that is at the same time expedient; (2) moral
rectitude that is (apparently) not expedient; and (3) the
expedient that is (apparently) not morally right.</note> although they are
indissolubly blended together; and they do this, I
assume, on moral, conscientious principles. [For
whatever is just, they hold, is also expedient; and, in
like manner, whatever is morally right is also just. It
follows, then, that whatever is morally right is also
expedient.] Those who fail to comprehend that


<pb id="p.179"/>

theory do often, in their admiration for shrewd and
clever men, take craftiness for wisdom. But they
must be disabused of this error and their way of
thinking must be wholly converted to the hope and
conviction that it is only by moral character and
righteousness, not by dishonesty and craftiness, that
they may attain to the objects of their desires.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Of the things, then, that are essential to the sustenance <note type="marg">Classification of expedients.</note> of human life, some are inanimate (gold and
silver, for example, the fruits of the earth, and so
forth), and some are animate and have their own
peculiar instincts and appetites. Of these again
some are rational, others irrational. Horses, oxen,
and the other cattle, [bees,] whose labour contributes
more or less to the service and subsistence of man,
are not endowed with reason; of rational beings two
divisions are made&mdash;gods and men. Worship and
purity of character will win the favour of the gods;
and next to the gods, and a close second to them,
men can be most helpful to men.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The same classification may likewise be made of
the things that are injurious and hurtful. But, as
people think that the gods bring us no harm, they
decide (leaving the gods out of the question) that
men are most hurtful to men.</p>
<p>As for mutual helpfulness, those very things<note type="marg">Necessity of man's helpfulness to man.</note>
which we have called inanimate are for the most
part themselves produced by man's labours; we
should not have them without the application of
manual labour and skill nor could we enjoy them
without the intervention of man. And so with many
other things: for without man's industry there could
have been no provisions for health, no navigation,
no agriculture, no ingathering or storing of the


<pb id="p.181"/>

fruits of the field or other kinds of produce.<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  Then,
too, there would surely be no exportation of our
superfluous commodities or importation of those we
lack, did not men perform these services. By the
same process of reasoning, without the labour of
man's hands, the stone needful for our use would
not be quarried from the earth, nor would <quote>iron, copper, gold, and silver, hidden far within,</quote> be mined.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/> And how could houses ever have been provided <note type="marg">Mutual helpfulness the key to civilization.</note> in the first place for the human race, to keep
out the rigours of the cold and alleviate the discomforts of the heat; or how could the ravages of
furious tempest or of earthquake or of time upon
them afterward have been repaired, had not the
bonds of social life taught men in such events to
look to their fellow-men for help?<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  Think of the
aqueducts, canals, irrigation works, breakwaters,
artificial harbours; how should we have these
without the work of man? From these and many
other illustrations it is obvious that we could not in
any way, without the work of man's hands, have received the profits and the benefits accruing from
inanimate things.</p>
<p>Finally, of what profit or service could animals be,
without the co-operation of man? For it was men
who were the foremost in discovering what use could
be made of each beast; and to-day, if it were not
for man's labour, we could neither feed them nor
break them in nor take care of them nor yet secure
the profits from them in due season. By man, too,
noxious beasts are destroyed, and those that can be
of use are captured.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Why should I recount the multitude of arts without
which life would not be worth living at all? For


<pb id="p.183"/>

how would the sick be healed? What pleasure
would the hale enjoy? What comforts should we
have, if there were not so many arts to minister to
our wants? In all these respects the civilized life
of man is far removed from the standard of the
comforts and wants of the lower animals. And, without the association of men, cities could not have been
built or peopled. In consequence of city life, laws
and customs were established, and then came the
equitable distribution of private rights and a definite
social system. Upon these institutions followed a
more humane spirit and consideration for others,
with the result that life was better supplied with all
it requires, and by giving and receiving, by mutual
exchange of commodities and conveniences, we
succeeded in meeting all our wants.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="16"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/> I have dwelt longer on this point than was
necessary. For who is there to whom those facts
which Panaetius narrates at great length are not
self-evident&mdash;namely, that no one, either as a
general in war or as a statesman at home, could have
accomplished great things for the benefit of the
state, without the hearty co-operation of other men?
He cites the deeds of Themistocles, Pericles, Cyrus,
Agesilaus, Alexander, who, he says, could not have
achieved so great success without the support of
other men. He calls in witnesses, whom he does
not need, to prove a fact that no one questions.</p>
<p>And yet, as, on the one hand, we secure great<note type="marg">Man's hurtfulness to man.</note>
advantages through the sympathetic co-operation of
our fellow-men; so, on the other, there is no curse
so terrible but it is brought down by man upon
man. There is a book by Dicaearchus on <quote>The
Destruction of Human Life.</quote> He was a famous


<pb id="p.185"/>

and eloquent Peripatetic, and he gathered together
all the other causes of destruction&mdash;floods, epidemics,
famines, and sudden incursions of wild animals in
myriads, by whose assaults, he informs us, whole
tribes of men have been wiped out. And then he
proceeds to show by way of comparison how many
more men have been destroyed by the assaults
of men&mdash;that is, by wars or revolutions&mdash;than by
any and all other sorts of calamity.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Since, therefore, there can be no doubt on this<note type="marg">Co-operation and the virtues.</note>
point, that man is the source of both the greatest
help and the greatest harm to man, I set it down as
the peculiar function of virtue to win the hearts of
men and to attach them to one's own service. And
so those benefits that human life derives from inanimate objects and from the employment and use of
animals are ascribed to the industrial arts; the
co-operation of men, on the other hand, prompt and
ready for the advancement of our interests, is secured
through wisdom and virtue [in men of superior
ability].<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>  And, indeed, virtue in general may be
said to consist almost wholly in three properties:
the first is [Wisdom,] the ability to perceive what in
any given instance is true and real, what its relations
are, its consequences, and its causes; the second is
[Temperance,] the ability to restrain the passions
(which the Greeks call <foreign lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign>) and make the impulses
(<foreign lang="greek">o(rmai/</foreign>) obedient to reason; and the third is [Justice,] the skill to treat with consideration and
wisdom those with whom we are associated, in order
that we may through their co-operation have our
natural wants supplied in full and overflowing measure, that we may ward off any impending trouble,
avenge ourselves upon those who have attempted to


<pb id="p.187"/>

injure us, and visit them with such retribution as
justice and humanity will permit.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="19"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/> I shall presently discuss the means by which we
can gain the ability to win and hold the affections of
our fellow-men; but I must say a few words by way
of preface.</p>
<p>Who fails to comprehend the enormous, two-fold<note type="marg">Co-operation <hi rend="italics">vs.</hi> Fortune.</note>
power of Fortune for weal and for woe? When we
enjoy her favouring breeze, we are wafted over to
the wished-for haven; when she blows against us,
we are dashed to destruction. Fortune herself,
then, does send those other less usual calamities,
arising, first, from inanimate Nature&mdash;hurricanes,
storms, shipwrecks, catastrophes, conflagrations;
second, from wild beasts&mdash;kicks, bites, and attacks.
But these, as I have said, are comparatively rare.
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> But think, on the one side, of the destruction of
armies (three lately, and many others at many different times), the loss of generals (of a very able and
eminent commander recently), the hatred of the
masses, too, and the banishment that as a consequence frequently comes to men of eminent services, their degradation and voluntary exile; think,
on the other hand, of the successes, the civil and
military honours, and the victories;&mdash;though all
these contain an element of chance, still they
cannot be brought about, whether for good or for
ill, without the influence and the co-operation of our
fellow-men.</p>
<p>With this understanding of the influence of Fortune, I may proceed to explain how we can win the
affectionate co-operation of our fellows and enlist it
in our service. And if the discussion of this point
is unduly prolonged, let the length be compared


<pb id="p.189"/>

with the importance of the object in view. It will
then, perhaps, seem even too short.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="21"/> Whenever, then, people bestow anything upon<note type="marg">How men are led to promote another's interests.</note>
a fellow-man to raise his estate or his dignity,
it may be from any one of several motives: (1)
it may be out of good-will, when for some reason
they are fond of him; (2) it may be from esteem,
if they look up to his worth and think him
deserving of the most splendid fortune a man can
have; (3) they may have confidence in him and think
that they are thus acting for their own interests; or
(4) they may fear his power; (5) they may, on the
contrary, hope for some favour&mdash;as, for example, when
princes or demagogues bestow gifts of money; or,
finally, (6) they may be moved by the promise of
payment or reward. This last is, I admit, the
meanest and most sordid motive of all, both for those
who are swayed by it and for those who venture to
resort to it.<milestone unit="section" n="22"/>  For things are in a bad way, when that
which should be obtained by merit is attempted
by money. But since recourse to this kind of support is sometimes indispensable, I shall explain
how it should be employed; but first I shall discuss
those qualities which are more closely allied to
merit.</p>
<p>Now, it is by various motives that people are led
to submit to another's authority and power: they
may be influenced (1) by good-will; (2) by gratitude
for generous favours conferred upon them; (3) by the
eminence of that other's social position or by the hope
that their submission will turn to their own account;
(4) by fear that they may be compelled perforce to
submit; (5) they may be captivated by the hope of
gifts of money and by liberal promises; or, finally,


<pb id="p.191"/>

(6) they may be bribed with money, as we have frequently seen in our own country.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="23"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/> But, of all motives, none is better adapted to<note type="marg">The motive of love <hi rend="italics">vs.</hi> that of fear.</note>
secure influence and hold it fast than love; nothing
is more foreign to that end than fear. For Ennius
says admirably:

<quote rend="blockquote"><quote><l>Whom they fear they hate. And whom one hates, one hopes to see him dead.</l></quote></quote>

And we recently discovered, if it was not known before, that no amount of power can withstand the
hatred of the many. The death of this tyrant,<note>Julius Caesar.</note><note type="marg">Hatred of tyranny.</note>
whose yoke the state endured under the constraint of
armed force and whom it still obeys more humbly
than ever, though he is dead, illustrates the deadly
effects of popular hatred; and the same lesson is
taught by the similar fate of all other despots, of whom
practically no one has ever escaped such a death.
For fear is but a poor safeguard of lasting power;
while affection, on the other hand, may be trusted to
keep it safe for ever.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="24"/> But those who keep subjects in check by force
would of course have to employ severity&mdash;masters, for
example, toward their servants, when these cannot
be held in control in any other way. But those who
in a free state deliberately put themselves in a
position to be feared are the maddest of the mad.
For let the laws be never so much overborne by some
one individual's power, let the spirit of freedom be
never so intimidated, still sooner or later they assert
themselves either through unvoiced public sentiment,
or through secret ballots disposing of some high
office of state. Freedom suppressed and again regained bites with keener fangs than freedom never


<pb id="p.193"/>

endangered. Let us, then, embrace this policy, which
appeals to every heart and is the strongest support
not only of security but also of influence and power
&mdash;namely, to banish fear and cleave to love. And
thus we shall most easily secure success both in
private and in public life.</p>
<p>Furthermore, those who wish to be feared must inevitably be afraid of those whom they intimidate.
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/> What, for instance, shall we think of the elder Dionysius? <note type="marg">The wretchedness of fear.</note> With what tormenting fears he used to be
racked! For through fear of the barber's razor he
used to have his hair singed off with a glowing coal. In
what state of mind do we fancy Alexander of Pherae
lived? We read in history that he dearly loved his
wife Thebe; and yet, whenever he went from the
banquet-hall to her in her chamber, he used to order
a barbarian&mdash;one, too, tattooed like a Thracian, as
the records state&mdash;to go before him with a drawn
sword; and he used to send ahead some of his bodyguard to pry into the lady's caskets and to search and
see whether some weapon were not concealed in her
wardrobe. Unhappy man! To think a barbarian, a
branded slave, more faithful than his own wife! Nor
was he mistaken. For he was murdered by her own
hand, because she suspected him of infidelity.</p>
<p>And indeed no power is strong enough to be lasting, if it labours under the weight of fear.<milestone unit="section" n="26"/>  Witness
Phalaris, whose cruelty is notorious beyond that of
all others. He was slain, not treacherously (like that
Alexander whom I named but now), not by a few
conspirators (like that tyrant of ours), but the whole
population of Agrigentum rose against him with one
accord.</p>
<p>Again, did not the Macedonians abandon Demetrius <pb id="p.195"/> and march over as one man to Pyrrhus? And
again, when the Spartans exercised their supremacy
tyrannically, did not practically all the allies desert
them and view their disaster at Leuctra, as idle
spectators?</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/> I prefer in this connection to draw my<note type="marg">The old Republic and the new despotism.</note>
illustrations from foreign history rather than from
our own. Let me add, however, that as long as the
empire of the Roman People maintained itself by
acts of service, not of oppression, wars were waged
in the interest of our allies or to safeguard our
supremacy; the end of our wars was marked by acts
of clemency or by only a necessary degree of severity;
the senate was a haven of refuge for kings, tribes,
and nations;<milestone unit="section" n="27"/>  and the highest ambition of our magistrates and generals was to defend our provinces and
allies with justice and honour.<milestone unit="alternatesection" n="27"/> And so our government could be called more accurately a protectorate
of the world than a dominion.</p>
<p>This policy and practice we had begun gradually
to modify even before Sulla's time; but since his
victory we have departed from it altogether. For
the time had gone by when any oppression of the
allies could appear wrong, seeing that atrocities so
outrageous were committed against Roman citizens.
In Sulla's case, therefore, an unrighteous victory
disgraced a righteous cause. For when he had
planted his spear<note>The Romans were accustomed to set up a spear as a
sign of an auction-sale&mdash;a symbol derived from the sale of
booty taken in war.</note> and was selling under the hammer
in the forum the property of men who were patriots
and men of wealth and, at least, Roman citizens, he
had the effrontery to announce that <quote>he was selling


<pb id="p.197"/>

his spoils.</quote> After him came one who, in an unholy
cause, made an even more shameful use of victory;
for he did not stop at confiscating the property of
individual citizens, but actually embraced whole
provinces and countries in one common ban of ruin.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="28"/> And so, when foreign nations had been oppressed
and ruined, we have seen a model of Marseilles carried
in a triumphal procession, to serve as proof to the world
that the supremacy of the people had been forfeited;
and that triumph we saw celebrated over a city without whose help our generals have never gained a
triumph for their wars beyond the Alps. I might
mention many other outrages against our allies, if
the sun had ever beheld anything more infamous
than this particular one. Justly, therefore, are<note type="marg">The wages of the sin of Rome</note>
we being punished. For if we had not allowed the
crimes of many to go unpunished, so great licence
would never have centred in one individual. His
estate descended by inheritance to but a few individuals, his ambitions to many scoundrels.<milestone unit="section" n="29"/>  And
never will the seed and occasion of civil war be
wanting, so long as villains remember that bloodstained spear and hope to see another. As Publius
Sulla wielded that spear, when his kinsman was
dictator, so again thirty-six years later he did not
shrink from a still more criminal spear. And still another Sulla, who was a mere clerk under the former
dictatorship, was under the later one a city quaestor.
From this, one would realize that, if such rewards are
offered, civil wars will never cease to be.</p>
<p>And so in Rome only the walls of her houses remain
standing&mdash;and even they wait now in fear of the
most unspeakable crimes&mdash;but our republic we have
lost for ever. But to return to my subject: it is


<pb id="p.199"/>

while we have preferred to be the object of fear
rather than of love and affection, that all these misfortunes have fallen upon us. And if such retribution
could overtake the Roman People for their injustice
and tyranny, what ought private individuals to expect? And since it is manifest that the power of
good-will is so great and that of fear is so weak, it
remains for us to discuss by what means we can most
readily win the affection, linked with honour and
confidence, which we desire.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="30"/> But we do not all feel this need to the same<note type="marg">The acquisition of friends.</note>
extent; for it must be determined in conformity
with each individual's vocation in life whether it is
essential for him to have the affection of many or
whether the love of a few will suffice. Let this then
be settled as the first and absolute essential&mdash;that
we have the devotion of friends, affectionate and
loving, who value our worth. For in just this one
point there is but little difference between the
greatest and the ordinary man; and friendship is to
be cultivated almost equally by both.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="31"/> All men do not, perhaps, stand equally in need of
political honour, fame, and the good-will of their
fellow-citizens; nevertheless, if these honours come
to a man, they help in many ways, and especially in
the acquisition of friends.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/> But friendship has been discussed in another
book of mine, entitled <quote>Laelius.</quote> Let us now take<note type="marg">The attainment of glory.</note>
up the discussion of Glory, although I have published
two books<note>Now lost, though they were still known to Petrarch.</note> on that subject also. Still, let us touch
briefly on it here, since it is of very great help in
the conduct of more important business.</p>
<p>The highest, truest glory depends upon the following <pb id="p.201"/> three things: the affection, the confidence,
and the mingled admiration and esteem of the
people. Such sentiments, if I may speak plainly and
concisely, are awakened in the masses in the same
way as in individuals. But there is also another<note type="marg">How to gain popularity:</note>
avenue of approach to the masses, by which we can,
as it were, steal into the hearts of all at once.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="32"/> But of the three above-named requisites, let us<note type="marg">(1) through good-will,</note>
look first at good-will and the rules for securing it.
Good-will is won principally through kind services<note>Cicero means by <quote>kind services</quote> the services of the
lawyer; he was forbidden by law to accept a fee; his services,
if he contributed them, were <quote>acts of kindness.</quote></note>;
next to that, it is elicited by the will to do a kind
service, even though nothing happen to come of it.
Then, too, the love of people generally is powerfully
attracted by a man's mere name and reputation for
generosity, kindness, justice, honour, and all those
virtues that belong to gentleness of character and
affability of manner. And because that very quality
which we term moral goodness and propriety is
pleasing to us by and of itself and touches all our
hearts both by its inward essence and its outward
aspect and shines forth with most lustre through
those virtues named above, we are, therefore, compelled by Nature herself to love those in whom we
believe those virtues to reside. Now these are only
the most powerful motives to love&mdash;not all of them;
there may be some minor ones besides.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="33"/> Secondly, the command of confidence can be<note type="marg">(2) through confidence.</note>
secured on two conditions: (1) if people think us
possessed of practical wisdom combined with a sense
of justice. For we have confidence in those who we
think have more understanding than ourselves, who,


<pb id="p.203"/>

we believe, have better insight into the future, and
who, when an emergency arises and a crisis comes, can
clear away the difficulties and reach a safe decision
according to the exigencies of the occasion; for that
kind of wisdom the world accounts genuine and
practical. But (2) confidence is reposed in men
who are just and true&mdash;that is, good men&mdash;on
the definite assumption that their characters admit
of no suspicion of dishonesty or wrong-doing. And
so we believe that it is perfectly safe to entrust our
lives, our fortunes, and our children to their care.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="34"/> Of these two qualities, then, justice has the greater<note type="marg">Justice <hi rend="italics">vs.</hi> Wisdom;</note>
power to inspire confidence; for even without the
aid of wisdom, it has considerable weight; but
wisdom without justice is of no avail to inspire
confidence; for take from a man his reputation for
probity, and the more shrewd and clever he is, the
more hated and mistrusted he becomes. Therefore,
justice combined with practical wisdom will command
all the confidence we can desire; justice without
wisdom will be able to do much; wisdom without
justice will be of no avail at all.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="35"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/> But I am afraid someone may wonder why I am
now separating the virtues&mdash;as if it were possible for
anyone to be just who is not at the same time wise;
for it is agreed upon among all philosophers, and
I myself have often argued, that he who has one
virtue has them all. The explanation of my apparent inconsistency is that the precision of speech we
employ, when abstract truth is critically investigated
in philosophic discussion, is one thing; and that
employed, when we are adapting our language
entirely to popular thinking, is another. And therefore I am speaking here in the popular sense, when


<pb id="p.205"/>

I call some men brave, others good, and still others
wise; for in dealing with popular conceptions we
must employ familiar words in their common acceptation; and this was the practice of Panaetius likewise.
But let us return to the subject.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="36"/> The third, then, of the three conditions I named<note type="marg">(3) through esteem and admiration.</note>
as essential to glory is that we be accounted worthy
of the esteem and admiration of our fellow-men.
While people admire in general everything that is
great or better than they expect, they admire in particular the good qualities that they find unexpectedly
in individuals. And so they reverence and extol
with the highest praises those men in whom they
see certain pre-eminent and extraordinary talents;
and they look down with contempt upon those who
they think have no ability, no spirit, no energy. For
they do not despise all those of whom they think ill.
For some men they consider unscrupulous, slanderous, fraudulent, and dangerous; they do not despise
them, it may be; but they do think ill of them. And
therefore, as I said before, those are despised who
are <quote>of no use to themselves or their neighbours,</quote>
as the saying is, who are idle, lazy, and indifferent.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="37"/> On the other hand, those are regarded with admiration who are thought to excel others in ability
and to be free from all dishonour and also from
those vices which others do not easily resist. For
sensual pleasure, a most seductive mistress, turns the
hearts of the greater part of humanity away from
virtue; and when the fiery trial of affliction draws
near, most people are terrified beyond measure.


<pb id="p.207"/>

Life and death, wealth and want affect all men most
powerfully. But when men, with a spirit great and
exalted, can look down upon such outward circumstances, whether prosperous or adverse, and when
some noble and virtuous purpose, presented to their
minds, converts them wholly to itself and carries
them away in its pursuit, who then could fail to
admire in them the splendour and beauty of virtue?</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="38"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/> As, then, this superiority of mind to such<note type="marg">Justice is the best way to popularity.</note>
externals inspires great admiration, so justice,
above all, on the basis of which alone men are called
<quote>good men,</quote> seems to people generally a quite marvellous virtue&mdash;and not without good reason; for no
one can be just who fears death or pain or exile or
poverty, or who values their opposites above equity.
And people admire especially the man who is uninfluenced by money; and if a man has proved himself
in this direction, they think him tried as by fire.</p>
<p>Those three requisites, therefore, which were presupposed as the means of obtaining glory, are all
secured by justice: (1) good-will, for it seeks to be
of help to the greatest number; (2) confidence, for
the same reason; and (3) admiration, because it scorns
and cares nothing for those things, with a consuming passion for which most people are carried away.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="39"/> Now, in my opinion at least, every walk and
vocation in life calls for human co-operation&mdash;first
and above all, in order that one may have friends
with whom to enjoy social intercourse. And this is
not easy, unless one is looked upon as a good man.
So, even to a man who shuns society and to one who
spends his life in the country a reputation for justice
is essential&mdash;even more so than to others; for they
who do not have it [but are considered unjust] will


<pb id="p.209"/>

have no defence to protect them and so will be
the victims of many kinds of wrong.<milestone unit="section" n="40"/>  So also to
buyers and sellers, to employers and employed, and
to those who are engaged in commercial dealings
generally, justice is indispensable for the conduct of
business. Its importance is so great, that not even<note type="marg">Honour among thieves.</note>
those who live by wickedness and crime can get on
without some small element of justice. For if a robber takes anything by force or by fraud from another
member of the gang, he loses his standing even in a
band of robbers; and if the one called the <quote>Pirate
Captain</quote> should not divide the plunder impartially,
he would be either deserted or murdered by his
comrades. Why, they say that robbers even have a
code of laws to observe and obey. And so, because
of his impartial division of booty, Bardulis, the Illyrian bandit, of whom we read in Theopompus,
acquired great power, Viriathus, of Lusitania, much
greater. He actually defied even our armies and
generals. But Gaius Laelius&mdash;the one surnamed
<quote>the Wise</quote>&mdash;in his praetorship crushed his power,
reduced him to terms, and so checked his intrepid
daring, that he left to his successors an easy conquest.</p>
<p>Since, therefore, the efficacy of justice is so great
that it strengthens and augments the power even of
robbers, how great do we think its power will be in
a constitutional government with its laws and courts?</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="41"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/> Now it seems to me, at least, that not only<note type="marg">Kings chosen for the sake of justice.</note>
among the Medes, as Herodotus tells us, but also
among our own ancestors, men of high moral character were made kings in order that the people
might enjoy justice. For, as the masses in their
helplessness were oppressed by the strong, they
appealed for protection to some one man who was


<pb id="p.211"/>

conspicuous for his virtue; and, as he shielded the
weaker classes from wrong, he managed by establishing equitable conditions to hold the higher and the
lower classes in an equality of right. The reason for
making constitutional laws was the same as that for
making kings.<milestone unit="section" n="42"/>  For what people have always sought
is equality of rights before the law. For rights that
were not open to all alike would be no rights. If
the people secured their end at the hands of one
just and good man, they were satisfied with that;
but when such was not their good fortune, laws were
invented, to speak to all men at all times in one and
the same voice.</p>
<p>This, then, is obvious: nations used to select for
their rulers those men whose reputation for justice
was high in the eyes of the people. If in addition
they were also thought wise, there was nothing that
men did not think they could secure under such
leadership. Justice is, therefore, in every way to be
cultivated and maintained, both for its own sake (for
otherwise it would not be justice) and for the enhancement of personal honour and glory.</p>
<p>But as there is a method not only of acquiring
money but also of investing it so as to yield an income to meet our continuously recurring expenses&mdash;both for the necessities and for the more refined
comforts of life&mdash;so there must be a method of gaining glory and turning it to account. <milestone unit="section" n="43"/> And yet, as
Socrates used to express it so admirably, <quote>the nearest <note type="marg">The way to glory is Justice.</note> way to glory&mdash;a short cut, as it were&mdash;is to strive
to be what you wish to be thought to be.</quote> For if
anyone thinks that he can win lasting glory by
pretence, by empty show, by hypocritical talk and
looks, he is very much mistaken. True glory strikes


<pb id="p.213"/>

deep root and spreads its branches wide; but all
pretences soon fall to the ground like fragile
flowers, and nothing counterfeit can be lasting.
There are very many witnesses to both facts;
but, for brevity's sake, I shall confine myself to one
family: Tiberius Gracchus, Publius's son, will be
held in honour as long as the memory of Rome
shall endure; but his sons were not approved by
patriots while they lived, and since they are dead
they are numbered among those whose murder was
justifiable.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/> If, therefore, anyone wishes to win true<note type="marg">Ways of winning a good name:</note>
glory, let him discharge the duties required by justice. And what they are has been set forth in the
course of the preceding book.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="44"/> (XIII.) But, although the very essence of the
problem is that we actually be what we wish to be
thought to be, still some rules may be laid down to
enable us most easily to secure the reputation of being
what we are. For, if anyone in his early youth has
the responsibility of living up to a distinguished name
acquired either by inheritance from his father (as, I
think, my dear Cicero, is your good fortune) or by
some chance or happy combination of circumstances,
the eyes of the world are turned upon him; his life
and character are scrutinized; and, as if he moved
in a blaze of light, not a word and not a deed of his
can be kept a secret.<milestone unit="section" n="45"/>  Those, on the other hand,
whose humble and obscure origin has kept them unknown to the world in their early years ought, as
soon as they approach young manhood, to set a high
ideal before their eyes and to strive with unswerving zeal towards its realization. This they will
do with the better heart, because that time of life is


<pb id="p.215"/>

accustomed to find favour rather than to meet with
opposition.</p>
<p>Well, then, the first thing to recommend to a young<note type="marg">(1) by a military career,</note>
man in his quest for glory is that he try to win it, if
he can, in a military career. Among our forefathers
many distinguished themselves as soldiers; for warfare was almost continuous then. The period of your
own youth, however, has coincided with that war in
which the one side was too prolific in crime, the
other in failure. And yet, when Pompey placed you
in command of a cavalry squadron in this war, you
won the applause of that great man and of the army
for your skill in riding and spear-throwing and for
endurance of all the hardships of the soldier's life.
But that credit accorded to you came to nothing
along with the fall of the republic.</p>
<p>The subject of this discussion, however, is not
your personal history, but the general theme. Let
us, therefore, proceed to the sequel.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="46"/> As, then, in everything else brain-work is far<note type="marg">(2) by personal character,</note>
more important than mere hand-work, so those
objects which we strive to attain through intellect
and reason gain for us a higher degree of gratitude
than those which we strive to gain by physical
strength. The best recommendation, then, that a
young man can have to popular esteem proceeds from
self-restraint, filial affection, and devotion to kinsfolk.
Next to that, young men win recognition most easily<note type="marg">(3) by association with the great,</note>
and most favourably, if they attach themselves to
men who are at once wise and renowned as well as
patriotic counsellors in public affairs. And if they
associate constantly with such men, they inspire in
the public the expectation that they will be like

for imitation.<milestone unit="section" n="47"/>  His frequent visits to the home of
Publius Mucius assisted young Publius Rutilius to
gain a reputation for integrity of character and for
ability as a jurisconsult. Not so, however, Lucius
Crassus; for, though he was a mere boy, he looked to
no one else for assistance, but by his own unaided
ability he won for himself in that brilliant and
famous prosecution<note>At the age of 21 Crassus conducted the case against
Gaius Papirius Carbo, a former supporter of the Gracchi. The prosecution was so ably conducted that Carbo committed suicide to escape certain condemnation.</note> a splendid reputation as an
orator. And at an age when young men are accustomed with their school exercises to win applause as
students of oratory, this Roman Demosthenes, Lucius
Crassus, was already proving himself in the law-courts
a master of the art which he might even then have
been studying at home with credit to himself.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="48"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/> But as the classification of discourse is a twofold <note type="marg">(4) by eloquence.</note> one&mdash;conversation, on the one side; oratory, on
the other&mdash;there can be no doubt that of the two
this debating power (for that is what we mean by
eloquence) counts for more toward the attainment of
glory; and yet, it is not easy to say how far an affable
and courteous manner in conversation may go toward
winning the affections. We have, for instance, the
letters of Philip to Alexander, of Antipater to Cassander, and of Antigonus to Philip the Younger.
The authors of these letters were, as we are informed, three of the wisest men in history; and in
them they instruct their sons to woo the hearts of
the populace to affection by words of kindness and
to keep their soldiers loyal by a winning address.
But the speech that is delivered in a debate before
an assembly often stirs the hearts of thousands at
once; for the eloquent and judicious speaker is received with high admiration, and his hearers think


<pb id="p.219"/>

him understanding and wise beyond all others. And,
if his speech have also dignity combined with moderation, he will be admired beyond all measure,
especially if these qualities are found in a young man.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="49"/> But while there are occasions of many kinds that
call for eloquence, and while many young men in
our republic have obtained distinction by their
speeches in the courts, in the popular assemblies,
and in the senate, yet it is the speeches before our
courts that excite the highest admiration.</p>
<p>The classification of forensic speeches also is a<note type="marg">Prosecution <hi rend="italics">vs.</hi> defence.</note>
twofold one: they are divided into arguments for
the prosecution and arguments for the defence. And
while the side of the defence is more honourable,
still that of the prosecution also has very often
established a reputation. I spoke of Crassus a moment ago; Marcus Antonius, when a youth, had the
same success. A prosecution brought the eloquence
of Publius Sulpicius into favourable notice, when he
brought an action against Gaius Norbanus, a seditious and dangerous citizen.<milestone unit="section" n="50"/>  But this should not be
done often&mdash;never, in fact, except in the interest of
the state (as in the cases of those above mentioned)
or to avenge wrongs (as the two Luculli, for example,
did) or for the protection of our provincials (as I did
in the defence of the Sicilians, or Julius in the prosecution of Albucius in behalf of the Sardinians). The
activity of Lucius Fufius in the impeachment of
Manius Aquilius is likewise famous. This sort of
work, then, may be done once in a lifetime, or at all
events not often. But if it shall be required of anyone to conduct more frequent prosecutions, let him
do it as a service to his country; for it is no disgrace
to be often employed in the prosecution of her


<pb id="p.221"/>

enemies. And yet a limit should be set even to
that. For it requires a heartless man, it seems, or
rather one who is well-nigh inhuman, to be arraigning one person after another on capital charges.<note>A <quote>capital charge</quote> meant to the Roman a charge endangering a person's <hi rend="italics">caput,</hi> or civil status. A conviction
on such a charge resulted in his civil degradation and the
loss of his privileges as a Roman citizen.</note> It is
not only fraught with danger to the prosecutor himself, but is damaging to his reputation, to allow
himself to be called a prosecutor. Such was the
effect of this epithet upon Marcus Brutus, the scion
of a very noble family and the son of that Brutus who
was an eminent authority in the civil law.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="51"/> Again, the following rule of duty is to be carefully<note type="marg">Spare the innocent; defend the guilty.</note>
observed: never prefer a capital charge against any
person who may be innocent. For that cannot
possibly be done without making oneself a criminal.
For what is so unnatural as to turn to the ruin and
destruction of good men the eloquence bestowed by
Nature for the safety and protection of our fellowmen? And yet, while we should never prosecute
the innocent, we need not have scruples against
undertaking on occasion the defence of a guilty
person, provided he be not infamously depraved and
wicked. For people expect it; custom sanctions it;
humanity also accepts it. It is always the business of
the judge in a trial to find out the truth; it is sometimes the business of the advocate to maintain what
is plausible, even if it be not strictly true, though I
should not venture to say this, especially in an ethical
treatise, if it were not also the position of Panaetius,
that strictest of Stoics. Then, too, briefs for the defence are most likely to bring glory and popularity
to the pleader, and all the more so, if ever it falls to
him to lend his aid to one who seems to be oppressed
and persecuted by the influence of someone in power.
This I have done on many other occasions; and once


<pb id="p.223"/>

in particular, in my younger days, I defended Sextus
Roscius of Ameria against the power of Lucius Sulla
when he was acting the tyrant. The speech is published, as you know.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="52"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/> Now that I have set forth the moral duties of<note type="marg">Generosity of two kinds:</note>
a young man, in so far as they may be exerted for
the attainment of glory, I must next in order discuss
kindness and generosity. The manner of showing
it is twofold: kindness is shown to the needy either
by personal service, or by gifts of money. The latter
way is the easier, especially for a rich man; but the
former is nobler and more dignified and more becoming to a strong and eminent man. For, although
both ways alike betray a generous wish to oblige,
still in the one case the favour makes a draft upon
one's bank account, in the other upon one's personal
energy; and the bounty which is drawn from one's
material substance tends to exhaust the very fountain
of liberality. Liberality is thus forestalled by liberality: for the more people one has helped with
gifts of money, the fewer one can help.<milestone unit="section" n="53"/>  But if
people are generous and kind in the way of personal
service&mdash;that is, with their ability and personal
effort&mdash;various advantages arise: first, the more
people they assist, the more helpers they will have
in works of kindness; and second, by acquiring the
habit of kindness they are better prepared and in
better training, as it were, for bestowing favours
upon many.</p>
<p>In one of his letters Philip takes his son Alexander
sharply to task for trying by gifts of money to secure
the good-will of the Macedonians: <quote>What in the
mischief induced you to entertain such a hope,</quote> he
says, <quote>as that those men would be loyal subjects to


<pb id="p.225"/>

you whom you had corrupted with money? Or are
you trying to do what you can to lead the Macedonians to expect that you will be not their king but
their steward and purveyor?</quote></p>
<p><quote>Steward and purveyor</quote> was well said, because
it was degrading for a prince; better still, when he
called the gift of money <quote>corruption.</quote> For the
recipient goes from bad to worse and is made all the
more ready to be constantly looking for one bribe
after another.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="54"/> It was to his son that Philip gave this lesson; but
let us all take it diligently to heart.</p>
<p>That liberality, therefore, which consists in personal service and effort is more honourable, has wider
application, and can benefit more people. There can
be no doubt about that. Nevertheless, we should<note type="marg">(1) gifts of money,</note>
sometimes make gifts of money; and this kind of
liberality is not to be discouraged altogether. We
must often distribute from our purse to the worthy
poor, but we must do so with discretion and moderation. For many<note>Julius Caesar was a striking example of this.</note> have squandered their patrimony
by indiscriminate giving. But what is worse folly than
to do the thing you like in such a way that you can
no longer do it at all? Then, too, lavish giving
leads to robbery;<note>Cicero evidently had in mind such instances as Sulla,
Caesar, Antony, and Catiline&mdash;<hi rend="italics">alieni appetens, sui profusus</hi>
(Sall., Cat. V).</note> for when through over-giving
men begin to be impoverished, they are constrained
to lay their hands on the property of others. And
so, when men aim to be kind for the sake of winning
good-will, the affection they gain from the objects
of their gifts is not so great as the hatred they incur
from those whom they despoil.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="55"/> One's purse, then, should not be closed so tightly
that a generous impulse cannot open it, nor yet so
loosely held as to be open to everybody. A limit


<pb id="p.227"/>

should be observed and that limit should be determined by our means. We ought, in a word, to
remember the phrase, which, through being repeated
so very often by our countrymen, has come to be a
common proverb: <quote>Bounty has no bottom.</quote> For
indeed what limit can there be, when those who
have been accustomed to receive gifts claim what
they have been in the habit of getting, and those
who have not wish for the same bounty?</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/> There are, in general, two classes of those<note type="marg">Extravagant waste of the public games.</note>
who give largely: the one class is the lavish, the
other the generous. The lavish are those who
squander their money on public banquets, doles of
meat among the people, gladiatorial shows, magnificent games, and wild-beast fights&mdash;vanities of which
but a brief recollection will remain, or none at all.
<milestone unit="section" n="56"/> The generous, on the other hand, are those who
employ their own means to ransom captives from
brigands, or who assume their friends' debts or help
in providing dowries for their daughters, or assist
them in acquiring property or increasing what they
have.<milestone unit="alternatesection" n="56"/> And so I wonder what Theophrastus could
have been thinking about when he wrote his book
on <quote>Wealth.</quote> It contains much that is fine; but
his position is absurd, when he praises at great length
the magnificent appointments of the popular games,
and it is in the means for indulging in such expenditures that he finds the highest privilege of wealth.
But to me the privilege it gives for the exercise of
generosity, of which I have given a few illustrations,
seems far higher and far more certain.</p>
<p>How much more true and pertinent are Aristotle's
words, as he rebukes us for not being amazed at this
extravagant waste of money, all to win the favour of


<pb id="p.229"/>

the populace. <quote>If people in time of siege,</quote> he says,
<quote>are required to pay a mina for a pint of water, this
seems to us at first beyond belief, and all are amazed;
but, when they think about it, they make allowances
for it on the plea of necessity. But in the matter of
this enormous waste and unlimited expenditure we
are not very greatly astonished, and that, too, though
by it no extreme need is relieved, no dignity is enhanced, and the very gratification of the populace is
but for a brief, passing moment; such pleasure as it
is, too, is confined to the most frivolous, and even in
these the very memory of their enjoyment dies as
soon as the moment of gratification is past.</quote><milestone unit="section" n="57"/>  His
conclusion, too, is excellent: <quote>This sort of amusement pleases children, silly women, slaves, and the
servile free; but a serious-minded man who weighs
such matters with sound judgment cannot possibly
approve of them.</quote></p>
<p>And yet I realize that in our country, even in the<note type="marg">Magnificent entertainments expected of an aedile.</note>
good old times, it had become a settled custom to
expect magnificent entertainments from the very
best men in their year of aedileship. So both Publius Crassus, who was not merely surnamed <quote>The
Rich</quote> but was rich in fact, gave splendid games in
his aedileship; and a little later Lucius Crassus (with
Quintus Mucius, the most unpretentious man in the
world, as his colleague) gave most magnificent entertainments in his aedileship. Then came Gaius
Claudius, the son of Appius, and, after him, many
others&mdash;the Luculli, Hortensius, and Silanus. Publius
Lentulus, however, in the year of my consulship,
eclipsed all that had gone before him, and Scaurus
emulated him. And my friend Pompey's exhibitions
in his second consulship were the most magnificent


<pb id="p.231"/>

of all. And so you see what I think about all this
sort of thing.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="58"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/> Still we should avoid any suspicion of
penuriousness. Mamercus was a very wealthy man,
and his refusal of the aedileship was the cause of his
defeat for the consulship. If, therefore, such entertainment is demanded by the people, men of right<note type="marg">Justification of such extravagance.</note>
judgment must at least consent to furnish it, even if
they do not like the idea. But in so doing they
should keep within their means, as I myself did.
They should likewise afford such entertainment, if
gifts of money to the people are to be the means of
securing on some occasion some more important or
more useful object. Thus Orestes recently won
great honour by his public dinners given in the
streets, on the pretext of their being a tithe-offering.
Neither did anybody find fault with Marcus Seius
for supplying grain to the people at an <hi rend="italics">as</hi><note>The <hi rend="italics">as</hi> was a copper coin worth somewhat less than a
penny. Selling grain to the people at such a price was
practically giving it away to purchase their good-will.</note> the peck
at a time when the market-price was prohibitive;
for he thus succeeded in disarming the bitter and
deep-seated prejudice of the people against him at
an outlay neither very great nor discreditable to him
in view of the fact that he was aedile at the time. But
the highest honour recently fell to my friend Milo,
who bought a band of gladiators for the sake of the
country, whose preservation then depended upon
my recall from exile, and with them put down the
desperate schemes, the reign of terror, of Publius
Clodius.</p>
<p>The justification for gifts of money, therefore, is
either necessity or expediency.<milestone unit="section" n="59"/>  And, in making them
even in such cases, the rule of the golden mean is best. <note type="marg">The golden mean is best.</note>
To be sure, Lucius Philippus, the son of Quintus, a
man of great ability and unusual renown, used to


<pb id="p.233"/>

make it his boast that without giving any entertainments he had risen to all the positions looked upon
as the highest within the gift of the state. Cotta
could say the same, and Curio. I, too, may make
this boast my own&mdash;to a certain extent;<note>The saving clause is added, because Cicero never filled
the office of Censor.</note> for in comparison with the eminence of the offices to which I
was unanimously elected at the earliest legal age&mdash; and this was not the good fortune of any one of
those just mentioned&mdash;the outlay in my aedileship
was very inconsiderable.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="60"/> Again, the expenditure of money is better justified<note type="marg">Lavish expenditure on public works.</note>
when it is made for walls, docks, harbours, aqueducts, and all those works which are of service to
the community. There is, to be sure, more of present
satisfaction in what is handed out, like cash
down; nevertheless public improvements win us
greater gratitude with posterity. Out of respect
for Pompey's memory I am rather diffident about
expressing any criticism of theatres, colonnades, and
new temples; and yet the greatest philosophers do
not approve of them&mdash;our Panaetius himself, for
example, whom I am following, not slavishly translating, in these books; so, too, Demetrius of
Phalerum, who denounces Pericles, the foremost
man of Greece, for throwing away so much money
on the magnificent, far-famed Propylaea. But this
whole theme is discussed at length in my books on
<quote>The Republic.</quote></p>
<p>To conclude, the whole system of public bounties
in such extravagant amount is intrinsically wrong;
but it may under certain circumstances be necessary
to make them; even then they must be proportioned
to our ability and regulated by the golden mean.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="61"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/> Now, as touching that second division of<note type="marg">General rules of beneficence.</note>


<pb id="p.235"/>

gifts of money, those which are prompted by a spirit
of generosity, we ought to look at different cases
differently. The case of the man who is overwhelmed by misfortune is different from that of the
one who is seeking to better his condition, though
he suffers from no actual distress.<milestone unit="section" n="62"/>  It will be the
duty of charity to incline more to the unfortunate,
unless, perchance, they deserve their misfortune.
But of course we ought by no means to withhold
our assistance altogether from those who wish for
aid, not to save them from utter ruin but to enable
them to reach a higher degree of fortune. But, in
selecting worthy cases, we ought to use judgment
and discretion. For, as Ennius says so admirably,

<quote rend="blockquote"><quote><l>Good deeds misplaced, methinks, are evil deeds.</l></quote></quote></p>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="63"/> Furthermore, the favour conferred upon a man
who is good and grateful finds its reward, in such a
case, not only in his own good-will but in that of
others. For, when generosity is not indiscriminate
giving, it wins most gratitude and people praise it
with more enthusiasm, because goodness of heart in
a man of high station becomes the common refuge
of everybody. Pains must, therefore, be taken to
benefit as many as possible with such kindnesses
that the memory of them shall be handed down to
children and to children's children, so that they too
may not be ungrateful. For all men detest ingratitude and look upon the sin of it as a wrong
committed against themselves also, because it discourages generosity; and they regard the ingrate as
the common foe of all the poor.</p>
<p>Ransoming prisoners from servitude and relieving
the poor is a form of charity that is a service to the


<pb id="p.237"/>

state as well as to the individual. And we find in
one of Crassus's orations the full proof given that
such beneficence used to be the common practice
of our order. This form of charity, then, I much
prefer to the lavish expenditure of money for public
exhibitions. The former is suited to men of worth
and dignity, the latter to those shallow flatterers, if
I may call them so, who tickle with idle pleasure,
so to speak, the fickle fancy of the rabble.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="64"/> It will, moreover, befit a gentleman to be at the
same time liberal in giving and not inconsiderate in
exacting his dues, but in every business relation&mdash;in buying or selling, in hiring or letting, in relations
arising out of adjoining houses and lands&mdash;to be fair,
reasonable, often freely yielding much of his own
right, and keeping out of litigation as far as his
interests will permit and perhaps even a little
farther. For it is not only generous occasionally to
abate a little of one's rightful claims, but it is sometimes even advantageous. We should, however,
have a care for our personal property, for it is discreditable to let it run through our fingers; but we
must guard it in such a way that there shall be no
suspicion of meanness or avarice. For the greatest
privilege of wealth is, beyond all peradventure, the
opportunity it affords for doing good, without sacrificing one's fortune.</p>
<p>Hospitality also is a theme of Theophrastus's praise, <note type="marg">Another expression of beneficence is hospitality.</note>
and rightly so. For, as it seems to me at least, it is
most proper that the homes of distinguished men
should be open to distinguished guests. And it is
to the credit of our country also that men from
abroad do not fail to find hospitable entertainment
of this kind in our city. It is, moreover, a very


<pb id="p.239"/>

great advantage, too, for those who wish to obtain a
powerful political influence by honourable means to
be able through their social relations with their
guests to enjoy popularity and to exert influence
abroad. For an instance of extraordinary hospitality, Theophrastus writes that at Athens Cimon
was hospitable even to the Laciads, the people of
his own deme; for he instructed his bailiffs to that
end and gave them orders that every attention
should be shown to any Laciad who should ever call
at his country home.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="65"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/> Again, the kindnesses shown not by gifts<note type="marg">(2) personal service.</note>
of money but by personal service<note>Acts of kindness and personal service mean to Cicero
throughout this discussion the services of the lawyer, which
were voluntary and gratis.</note> are bestowed
sometimes upon the community at large, sometimes
upon individual citizens. To protect a man in his
legal rights [, to assist him with counsel,] and to serve
as many as possible with that sort of knowledge
tends greatly to increase one's influence and popularity.</p>
<p>Thus, among the many admirable ideas of our<note type="marg">The profession of the law.</note>
ancestors was the high respect they always accorded
to the study and interpretation of the excellent body
of our civil law. And down to the present unsettled
times the foremost men of the state have kept this
profession exclusively in their own hands; but now
the prestige of legal learning has departed along
with offices of honour and positions of dignity; and
this is the more deplorable, because it has come to
pass in the lifetime of a man<note>This eminent jurist was Servius Sulpicius Lemonia
Rufus, a close friend of Cicero, author of the well-known
letter of condolence to Cicero on the death of his daughter
Tullia.</note> who in knowledge of
the law would easily have surpassed all his predecessors, while in honour he is their peer. Service
such as this, then, finds many to appreciate it and is
calculated to bind people closely to us by our good
services.</p>


<pb id="p.241"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="66"/> Closely connected with this profession, furthermore, <note type="marg">Eloquence at the bar.</note> is the gift of eloquence; it is at once more
popular and more distinguished. For what is better
than eloquence to awaken the admiration of one's
hearers or the hopes of the distressed or the gratitude
of those whom it has protected? It was to eloquence,
therefore, that our fathers assigned the foremost
rank among the civil professions. The door of opportunity for generous patronage to others, then, is
wide open to the orator whose heart is in his work
and who follows the custom of our forefathers in
undertaking the defence of many clients without
reluctance and without compensation.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="67"/> My subject suggests that at this point I express<note type="marg">The decline of eloquence.</note>
once more my regret at the decadence, not to say
the utter extinction, of eloquence; and I should do
so, did I not fear that people would think that I
were complaining on my own account. We see,
nevertheless, what orators have lost their lives and
how few of any promise are left, how far fewer there
are who have ability, and how many there are who
have nothing but presumption. But though not all
&mdash;no, not even many&mdash;can be learned in the law or
eloquent as pleaders, still anybody may be of service
to many by canvassing in their support for appointments, by witnessing to their character before juries
and magistrates, by looking out for the interests of
one and another, and by soliciting for them the aid
of jurisconsults or of advocates. Those who perform
such services win the most gratitude and find a
most extensive sphere for their activities.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="68"/> Of course, those who pursue such a course do not<note type="marg">A warning to eloquence.</note>
need to be warned (for the point is self-evident) to
be careful when they seek to oblige some, not to


<pb id="p.243"/>

offend others. For oftentimes they hurt those whom
they ought not or those whom it is inexpedient to
offend. If they do it inadvertently, it is carelessness;
if designedly, inconsiderateness. A man must apologize also, to the best of his ability, if he has involuntarily hurt anyone's feelings, and explain why what
he has done was unavoidable and why he could not
have done otherwise; and he must by future services
and kind offices atone for the apparent offence.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="69"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/> Now in rendering helpful service to people, <note type="marg">The basis for personal service is character not fortune.</note>
we usually consider either their character or their
circumstances. And so it is an easy remark, and
one commonly made, to say that in investing kindnesses we look not to people's outward circumstances, but to their character. The phrase is
admirable! But who is there, pray, that does not in
performing a service set the favour of a rich and influential man above the cause of a poor, though most
worthy, person? For, as a rule, our will is more inclined to the one from whom we expect a prompter
and speedier return. But we should observe more
carefully how the matter really stands: the poor man
of whom we spoke cannot return a favour in kind, of
course, but if he is a good man he can do it at least
in thankfulness of heart. As someone has happily
said, <quote>A man has not repaid money, if he still has it;
if he has repaid it, he has ceased to have it. But a
man still has the sense of favour, if he has returned
the favour; and if he has the sense of the favour, he
has repaid it.</quote></p>
<p>On the other hand, they who consider themselves
wealthy, honoured, the favourites of fortune, do not
wish even to be put under obligations by our kind
services. Why, they actually think that they have


<pb id="p.245"/>

conferred a favour by accepting one, however great;
and they even suspect that a claim is thereby set up
against them or that something is expected in return.
Nay more, it is bitter as death to them to have
accepted a patron or to be called clients.<milestone unit="section" n="70"/>  Your man
of slender means, on the other hand, feels that whatever is done for him is done out of regard for himself and not for his outward circumstances. Hence<note type="marg">The poor man's gratitude.</note>
he strives to show himself grateful not only to the
one who has obliged him in the past but also to those
from whom he expects similar favours in the future
&mdash;and he needs the help of many; and his own
service, if he happens to render any in return, he does
not exaggerate, but he actually depreciates it. This
fact, furthermore, should not be overlooked&mdash;that, if
one defends a wealthy favourite of fortune, the
favour does not extend further than to the man himself or, possibly, to his children. But, if one defends
a man who is poor but honest and upright, all the
lowly who are not dishonest&mdash;and there is a large
proportion of that sort among the people&mdash;look upon
such an advocate as a tower of defence raised up for
them.<milestone unit="section" n="71"/>  I think, therefore, that kindness to the good
is a better investment than kindness to the favourites
of fortune.</p>
<p>We must, of course, put forth every effort to oblige
all sorts and conditions of men, if we can. But if it
comes to a conflict of duty on this point, we must, I
should say, follow the advice of Themistocles: when
someone asked his advice whether he should give
his daughter in marriage to a man who was poor but
honest or to one who was rich but less esteemed, he<note type="marg">Wealth no inducement nor a bar to personal service.</note>
said: <quote>For my part, I prefer a man without money

<pb id="p.247"/>

to-day is demoralized and depraved by our worship
of wealth. Of what concern to any one of us is the
size of another man's fortune? It is, perhaps, an
advantage to its possessor; but not always even that.
But suppose it is; he may, to be sure, have more
money to spend; but how is he any the better man
for that? Still, if he is a good man, as well as a rich
one, let not his riches be a hindrance to his being
aided, if only they are not the motive to it; but in
conferring favours our decision should depend entirely
upon a man's character, not on his wealth.</p>
<p>The supreme rule, then, in the matter of kindnesses to be rendered by personal service is never
to take up a case in opposition to the right nor
in defence of the wrong. For the foundation
of enduring reputation and fame is justice, and
without justice there can be nothing worthy of
praise.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="72"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/> Now, since we have finished the discussion<note type="marg">Service to the state through personal service to individuals.</note>
of that kind of helpful services which concern individuals, we must next take up those which touch the
whole body politic and the state. Of these public
services, some are of such a nature that they concern
the whole body of citizens; others, that they affect
individuals only. And these latter are the more productive of gratitude. If possible, we should by all
means attend to both kinds of service; but we must
take care in protecting the interests of individuals
that what we do for them shall be beneficial, or at
least not prejudicial, to the state. Gaius Gracchus
inaugurated largesses of grain on an extensive scale;
this had a tendency to exhaust the exchequer.
Marcus Octavius inaugurated a moderate dole; this
was both practicable for the state and necessary for


<pb id="p.249"/>

the commons; it was, therefore, a blessing both to
the citizens and to the state.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="73"/> The man in an administrative office, however, must<note type="marg">The statesman's duty toward (1) property rights,</note>
make it his first care that everyone shall have what
belongs to him and that private citizens suffer no invasion of their property rights by act of the state. It
was a ruinous policy that Philippus proposed when
in his tribuneship he introduced his agrarian bill.
However, when his law was rejected, he took his
defeat with good grace and displayed extraordinary
moderation. But in his public speeches on the
measure he often played the demagogue, and that
time viciously, when he said that <quote>there were not
in the state two thousand people who owned any
property.</quote> That speech deserves unqualified condemnation, for it favoured an equal distribution of
property; and what more ruinous policy than that
could be conceived? For the chief purpose in the
establishment of constitutional state and municipal
governments was that individual property rights
might be secured. For, although it was by Nature's
guidance that men were drawn together into communities, it was in the hope of safeguarding their
possessions that they sought the protection of cities.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="74"/> The administration should also put forth every effort<note type="marg">(2) taxation,</note>
to prevent the levying of a property tax, and to this
end precautions should be taken long in advance.
Such a tax was often levied in the times of our forefathers on account of the depleted state of their
treasury and their incessant wars. But, if any state
(I say <quote>any,</quote> for I would rather speak in general
terms than forebode evils to our own; however, I
am not discussing our own state but states in general)
&mdash;if any state ever has to face a crisis requiring the


<pb id="p.251"/>

imposition of such a burden, every effort must be
made to let all the people realize that they must
bow to the inevitable, if they wish to be saved. And<note type="marg">(3) necessities o life,</note>
it will also be the duty of those who direct the affairs
of the state to take measures that there shall be an
abundance of the necessities of life. It is needless
to discuss the ordinary ways and means; for the
duty is self-evident; it is necessary only to mention
the matter.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="75"/> But the chief thing in all public administration<note type="marg">(4) Official integrity.</note>
and public service is to avoid even the slightest
suspicion of self-seeking. <quote>I would,</quote> says Gaius
Pontius, the Samnite, <quote>that fortune had withheld
my appearance until a time when the Romans began
to accept bribes, and that I had been born in those
days! I should then have suffered them to hold
their supremacy no longer.</quote> Aye, but he would
have had many generations to wait; for this plague
has only recently infected our nation. And so I
rejoice that Pontius lived then instead of now, seeing
that he was so mighty a man! It is not yet a hundred and ten years since the enactment of Lucius
Piso's bill to punish extortion; there had been no
such law before. But afterward came so many laws,
each more stringent than the other, so many men
were accused and so many convicted, so horrible a
war<note>The Italian or Social War, B.C. 100&ndash;88.</note> was stirred up on account of the fear of what
our courts would do to still others, so frightful was
the pillaging and plundering of the allies when the
laws and courts were suppressed,<note>During the dictatorships of Sulla and Caesar.</note> that how we
find ourselves strong not in our own strength but in
the weakness of others.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="76"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/> Panaetius praises Africanus for his integrity
in public life. Why should he not? But Africanus


<pb id="p.253"/>

had other and greater virtues. The boast of official
integrity belongs not to that man alone but also to
his times. When Paulus got possession of all the
wealth of Macedon&mdash;and it was enormous&mdash;he
brought into our treasury so much money<note>Nearly two million pounds sterling.</note> that the
spoils of a single general did away with the need for a
tax on property in Rome for all time to come. But to
his own house he brought nothing save the glory of an
immortal name. Africanus emulated his father's
example and was none the richer for his overthrow
of Carthage. And what shall we say of Lucius
Mummius, his colleague in the censorship? Was he
one penny the richer when he had destroyed to its
foundations the richest of cities? He preferred to
adorn Italy rather than his own house. And yet by
the adornment of Italy his own house was, as it
seems to me, still more splendidly adorned.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="77"/> There is, then, to bring the discussion back to the<note type="marg">Integrity <hi rend="italics">vs.</hi> avarice.</note>
point from which it digressed, no vice more offensive
than avarice, especially in men who stand foremost
and hold the helm of state. For to exploit the state
for selfish profit is not only immoral; it is criminal,
infamous. And so the oracle, which the Pythian
Apollo uttered, that <quote>Sparta should not fall from any
other cause than avarice,</quote> seems to be a prophecy
not to the Lacedaemonians alone, but to all wealthy
nations as well. They who direct the affairs of
state, then, can win the good-will of the masses by
no other means more easily than by self-restraint
and self-denial.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="78"/> But they who pose as friends of the people, and<note type="marg">The menace of agrarian laws.</note>
who for that reason either attempt to have agrarian
laws passed, in order that the occupants may be
driven out of their homes, or propose that money


<pb id="p.255"/>

loaned should be remitted to the borrowers, are
undermining the foundations of the commonwealth:
first of all, they are destroying harmony, which
cannot exist when money is taken away from one
party and bestowed upon another; and second, they
do away with equity, which is utterly subverted, if
the rights of property are not respected. For, as I
said above, it is the peculiar function of the state
and the city to guarantee to every man the free and
undisturbed control of his own particular property.
<milestone unit="section" n="79"/> And yet, when it comes to measures so ruinous to
public welfare, they do not gain even that popularity
which they anticipate. For he who has been robbed
of his property is their enemy; he to whom it has
been turned over actually pretends that he had no
wish to take it; and most of all, when his debts are
cancelled, the debtor conceals his joy, for fear that he
may be thought to have been insolvent; whereas the
victim of the wrong both remembers it and shows
his resentment openly. Thus even though they to
whom property has been wrongfully awarded be
more in number than they from whom it has been unjustly taken, they do not for that reason have more
influence; for in such matters influence is measured
not by numbers but by weight. And how is it fair
that a man who never had any property should take
possession of lands that had been occupied for many
years or even generations, and that he who had
them before should lose possession of them?</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="80"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/> Now, it was on account of just this sort of<note type="marg">Instances of agrarian legislation.</note>
wrong-doing that the Spartans banished their ephor
Lysander, and put their king Agis to death&mdash;an act
without precedent in the history of Sparta. From
that time on&mdash;and for the same reason&mdash;dissensions


<pb id="p.257"/>

so serious ensued that tyrants arose, the nobles were
sent into exile, and the state, though most admirably constituted, crumbled to pieces. Nor did it
fall alone, but by the contagion of the ills that,
starting in Lacedaemon, spread widely and more
widely, it dragged the rest of Greece down to ruin.
What shall we say of our own Gracchi, the sons of
that famous Tiberius Gracchus and grandsons of
Africanus? Was it not strife over the agrarian issue
that caused their downfall and death?</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="81"/> Aratus of Sicyon, on the other hand, is justly<note type="marg">Aratus of Sicyon.</note>
praised. When his city had been kept for fifty
years in the power of its tyrants, he came over
from Argos to Sicyon, secretly entered the city and
took it by surprise; he fell suddenly upon the tyrant
Nicocles, recalled from banishment six hundred
exiles who had been the wealthiest men of the city,
and by his coming made his country free. But he
found great difficulty in the matter of property and
its occupancy; for he considered it most unjust, on
the one hand, that those men should be left in want
whom he had restored and of whose property others
had taken possession; and he thought it hardly fair,
on the other hand, that tenure of fifty years' standing should be disturbed. For in the course of that
long period many of those estates had passed into
innocent hands by right of inheritance, many by
purchase, many by dower. He therefore decided that
it would be wrong either to take the property away
from the present incumbents or to let them keep it
without compensation to its former possessors.<milestone unit="section" n="82"/>  So,
when he had come to the conclusion that he must
have money to meet the situation, he announced
that he meant to make a trip to Alexandria and gave


<pb id="p.259"/>

orders that matters should remain as they were until
his return. And so he went in haste to his friend
Ptolemy, then upon the throne, the second king
after the founding of Alexandria. To him he explained that he wished to restore constitutional
liberty to his country and presented his case to him.
And, being a man of the highest standing, he easily
secured from that wealthy king assistance in the
form of a large sum of money. And, when he had
returned with this to Sicyon, he called into counsel
with him fifteen of the foremost men of the city.
With them he investigated the cases both of those
who were holding possession of other people's property and of those who had lost theirs. And he
managed by a valuation of the properties to persuade
some that it was more desirable to accept money and
surrender their present holdings; others he convinced that it was more to their interest to take a
fair price in cash for their lost estates than to try to
recover possession of what had been their own. As
a result, harmony was preserved, and all parties went
their way without a word of complaint.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="83"/> A great statesman, and worthy to have been<note type="marg">Justice the corner-stone of statecraft.</note>
born in our commonwealth! That is the right way
to deal with one's fellow-citizens, and not, as we have
already witnessed on two occasions, to plant the
spear in the forum and knock down the property of
citizens under the auctioneer's hammer. But yon
Greek, like a wise and excellent man, thought that
he must look out for the welfare of all. And this
is the highest statesmanship and the soundest wisdom
on the part of a good citizen, not to divide the interests of the citizens but to unite all on the basis of
impartial justice. <quote>Let them live in their neighbour's

house rent-free.</quote> <note>An assumed appeal to one of Caesar's edicts.</note> Why so? In order that, when I
have bought, built, kept up, and spent my money
upon a place, you may without my consent enjoy
what belongs to me? What else is that but to rob
one man of what belongs to him and to give to
another what does not belong to him?<milestone unit="section" n="84"/>  And what
is the meaning of an abolition of debts, except that
you buy a farm with my money; that you have the

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/> We must, therefore, take measures that<note type="marg">Economics of debts.</note>
there shall be no indebtedness of a nature to endanger the public safety. It is a menace that can
be averted in many ways; but should a serious debt
be incurred, we are not to allow the rich to lose
their property, while the debtors profit by what is
their neighbour's. For there is nothing that upholds
a government more powerfully than its credit; and
it can have no credit, unless the payment of debts
is enforced by law. Never were measures for the
repudiation of debts more strenuously agitated than
in my consulship. Men of every sort and rank
attempted with arms and armies to force the project
through. But I opposed them with such energy
that this plague was wholly eradicated from the body
politic. Indebtedness was never greater; debts
were never liquidated more easily or more fully; for
the hope of defrauding the creditor was cut off and
payment was enforced by law. But the present
victor, though vanquished then, still carried out his
old design, when it was no longer of any personal
advantage to him.<note>Caesar, it seems, had had some part in the schemes of
Catiline in B.C. 63 and possibly in the plot of B.C. 66&ndash;65. When
his conquests in Gaul had freed him from his debts and
made him rich, his party, with his consent, passed (B.C. 49)
the obnoxious legislation here referred to&mdash;that all interest
in arrears should be remitted, and that that which had been
paid should be deducted from the principal.</note> So great was his passion for
wrong-doing that the very doing of wrong was a joy
to him for its own sake, even when there was no
motive for it.</p>


<pb id="p.263"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="85"/> Those, then, whose office it is to look after the
interests of the state will refrain from that form of
liberality which robs one man to enrich another.
Above all, they will use their best endeavours that<note type="marg">Administration of the courts in equity</note>
everyone shall be protected in the possession of his
own property by the fair administration of the law
and the courts, that the poorer classes shall not be
oppressed because of their helplessness, and that
envy shall not stand in the way of the rich, to prevent
them from keeping or recovering possession of what
justly belongs to them; they must strive, too, by
whatever means they can, in peace or in war, to advance the state in power, in territory, and in revenues.</p>
<p>Such service calls for great men; it was commonly
rendered in the days of our ancestors; if men will
perform duties such as these, they will win popularity and glory for themselves and at the same time
render eminent service to the state.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="86"/> Now, in this list of rules touching expediency, <note type="marg">Sanitation.</note>
Antipater of Tyre, a Stoic philosopher who recently
died at Athens, claims that two points were overlooked by Panaetius&mdash;the care of health and of
property. I presume that the eminent philosopher
overlooked these two items because they present no
difficulty. At all events they are expedient. Although they are a matter of course, I will still say a
few words on the subject. Individual health is preserved by studying one s own constitution, by observing what is good or bad for one, by constant self-control in supplying physical wants and comforts
(but only to the extent necessary to self-preservation), by forgoing sensual pleasures, and finally, by
the professional skill of those to whose science these
matters belong.</p>


<pb id="p.265"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="87"/> As for property, it is a duty to make money, but<note type="marg">Finance.</note>
only by honourable means; it is a duty also to save
it and increase it by care and thrift. These principles Xenophon, a pupil of Socrates, has set forth
most happily in his book entitled <quote>Oeconomicus.</quote>
When I was about your present age, I translated it
from the Greek into Latin.</p>
<p>But this whole subject of acquiring money, investing money (I wish I could include also spending
money),is more profitably discussed by certain worthy
gentlemen on <quote>Change</quote> than could be done by any
philosophers of any school. For all that, we must
take cognizance of them; for they come fitly under
the head of expediency, and that is the subject of
the present book.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="88"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/> But it is often necessary to weigh one<note type="marg">Comparison of expediencies.</note>
expediency against another;&mdash;for this, as I stated, is a
fourth point overlooked by Panaetius. For not only
are physical advantages regularly compared with outward advantages [and outward, with physical], but
physical advantages are compared with one another,
and outward with outward. Physical advantages
are compared with outward advantages in some such
way as this: one may ask whether it is more desirable to have health than wealth; [external advantages with physical, thus: whether it is better to have
wealth than extraordinary bodily strength;] while
the physical advantages may be weighed against one
another, so that good health is preferred to sensual
pleasure, strength to agility. Outward advantages
also may be weighed against one another: glory, for
example, may be preferred to riches, an income
derived from city property to one derived from the
farm.<milestone unit="section" n="89"/>  To this class of comparisons belongs that


<pb id="p.267"/>

famous saying of old Cato's: when he was asked
what was the most profitable feature of an estate, he
replied: <quote>Raising cattle successfully.</quote> What next
to that? <quote>Raising cattle with fair success.</quote> And
next? <quote>Raising cattle with but slight success.</quote>
And fourth? <quote>Raising crops.</quote> And when his
questioner said, <quote>How about money-lending?</quote> Cato
replied: <quote>How about murder?</quote></p>
<p>From this as well as from many other incidents we
ought to realize that expediencies have often to be
weighed against one another and that it is proper
for us to add this fourth division in the discussion of
moral duty.</p>
<p>Let us now pass on to the remaining problems.</p>
</div1>
	<pb/>
	
<pb id="p.271"/>

<div1 type="book" n="1"><head>Book III: the conflict between the right and the expedient</head>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/> Cato, who was of about the same years, Marcus,<note type="marg">Preface: Scipio and Cicero.</note>
my son, as that Publius Scipio who first bore the
surname of Africanus, has given us the statement
that Scipio used to say that he was never less idle
than when he had nothing to do and never less
lonely than when he was alone. An admirable
sentiment, in truth, and becoming to a great and
wise man. It shows that even in his leisure hours
his thoughts were occupied with public business and
that he used to commune with himself when alone;
and so not only was he never unoccupied, but he
sometimes had no need for company. The two
conditions, then, that prompt others to idleness&mdash;
leisure and solitude&mdash;only spurred him on. I wish
I could say the same of myself and say it truly. But
if by imitation I cannot attain to such excellence of
character, in aspiration, at all events, I approach it as
nearly as I can; for as I am kept by force of armed
treason away from practical politics and from my
practice at the bar, I am now leading a life of leisure.
For that reason I have left the city and, wandering in
the country from place to place, I am often alone.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But I should not compare this leisure of mine
with that of Africanus, nor this solitude with his.
For he, to find leisure from his splendid services
to his country, used to take a vacation now and then
and to retreat from the assemblies and the throngs
of men into solitude, as into a haven of rest. But


<pb id="p.273"/>

my leisure is forced upon me by want of public<note type="marg">The orator's retirement.</note>
business, not prompted by any desire for repose.
For now that the senate has been abolished and the
courts have been closed, what is there, in keeping with
my self-respect, that I can do either in the senatechamber or in the forum?<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>  So, although I once
lived amid throngs of people and in the greatest
publicity, I am now shunning the sight of the miscreants with whom the world abounds and withdrawing from the public eye as far as I may, and I
am often alone. But I have learned from philosophers that among evils one ought not only to choose
the least, but also to extract even from these any
element of good that they may contain. For that
reason, I am turning my leisure to account&mdash;though
it is not such repose as the man should be entitled
to who once brought the state repose from civil
strife&mdash;and I am not letting this solitude, which
necessity and not my will imposes on me, find me idle.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/> And yet, in my judgment, Africanus earned the
higher praise. For no literary monuments of his
genius have been published, we have no work produced in his leisure hours, no product of his solitude.
From this fact we may safely infer that, because of
the activity of his mind and the study of those problems to which he used to direct his thought, he
was never unoccupied, never lonely. But I have
not strength of mind enough by means of silent
meditation to forget my solitude; and so I have
turned all my attention and endeavour to this kind
of literary work. I have, accordingly, written more
in this short time since the downfall of the republic
than I did in the course of many years, while the
republic stood.</p>


<pb id="p.275"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/> But, my dear Cicero, while the whole field of<note type="marg">Young Cicero admonished to diligence in his studies.</note>
philosophy is fertile and productive and no portion
of it barren and waste, still no part is richer or more
fruitful than that which deals with moral duties; for
from these are derived the rules for leading a consistent and moral life. And therefore, although
you are, as I trust, diligently studying and profiting
by these precepts under the direction of our friend
Cratippus, the foremost philosopher of the present
age, I still think it well that your ears should be
dinned with such precepts from every side and that,
if it could be, they should hear nothing else.
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> These precepts must be laid to heart by all who
look forward to a career of honour, and I am inclined to think that no one needs them more than
you. For you will have to fulfil the eager anticipation that you will imitate my industry, the confident
expectation that you will emulate my course of political
honours, and the hope that you will, perhaps, rival my
name and fame. You have, besides, incurred a heavy
responsibility on account of Athens and Cratippus:
for, since you have gone to them for the purchase,
as it were, of a store of liberal culture, it would be
a great discredit to you to return empty-handed,
thereby disgracing the high reputation of the city
and of your master. Therefore, put forth the best
mental effort of which you are capable; work as
hard as you can (if learning is work rather than
pleasure); do your very best to succeed; and do not,
when I have put all the necessary means at your
disposal, allow it to be said that you have failed to
do your part.</p>
<p>But enough of this. For I have written again
and again for your encouragement. Let us now


<pb id="p.277"/>

return to the remaining section of our subject as
outlined.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Panaetius, then, has given us what is unquestionably <note type="marg">Panaetius on Moral Duties.</note> the most thorough discussion of moral duties
that we have, and I have followed him in the main
&mdash;but with slight modifications. He classifies under
three general heads the ethical problems which
people are accustomed to consider and weigh: first,
the question whether the matter in hand is morally
right or morally wrong; second, whether it is expedient or inexpedient; third, how a decision ought
to be reached, in case that which has the appearance
of being morally right clashes with that which seems
to be expedient. He has treated the first two heads
at length in three books; but, while he has stated
that he meant to discuss the third head in its proper
turn, he has never fulfilled his promise.<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>  And I
wonder the more at this, because Posidonius, a pupil
of his, records that Panaetius was still alive thirty
years after he published those three books. And I
am surprised that Posidonius has but briefly touched
upon this subject in certain memoirs of his, and
especially, as he states that there is no other topic in
the whole range of philosophy so essentially important as this.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Now, I cannot possibly accept the view of those<note type="marg">Why Panaetius omitted the <quote>Conflict</quote> of the moral and the expedient.</note>
who say that that point was not overlooked but purposely omitted by Panaetius, and that it was not one
that ever needed discussion, because there never can
be such a thing as a conflict between expediency and
moral rectitude. But with regard to this assertion,
the one point may admit of doubt&mdash;whether that
question which is third in Panaetius's classification
ought to have been included or omitted altogether;


<pb id="p.279"/>

but the other point is not open to debate&mdash;that it
was included in Panaetius's plan but left unwritten.
For, if a writer has finished two divisions of a threefold subject, the third must necessarily remain for
him to do. Besides, he promises at the close of the
third book that he will discuss this division also in its
proper turn.<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>  We have also in Posidonius a competent witness to the fact. He writes in one of his
letters that Publius Rutilius Rufus, who also was a
pupil of Panaetius's, used to say that <quote>as no painter
had been found to complete that part of the Venus of
Cos which Apelles had left unfinished (for the beauty
of her face made hopeless any attempt adequately to
represent the rest of the figure), so no one, because
of the surpassing excellence of what Panaetius did
complete, would venture to supply what he had left
undone.</quote></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/> In regard to Panaetius's real intentions,<note type="marg">The conflict between Expediency and Moral Rectitude only apparent.</note>
therefore, no doubt can be entertained. But
whether he was or was not justified in adding this
third division to the inquiry about duty may, perhaps, be a matter for debate. For whether moral
goodness is the only good, as the Stoics believe, or
whether, as your Peripatetics think, moral goodness is in so far the highest good that everything
else gathered together into the opposing scale
would have scarcely the slightest weight, it is
beyond question that expediency can never conflict with moral rectitude. And so, we have heard,
Socrates used to pronounce a curse upon those
who first drew a conceptual distinction between
things naturally inseparable. With this doctrine
the Stoics are in agreement in so far as they
maintain that if anything is morally right, it is


<pb id="p.281"/>

expedient, and if anything is not morally right, it
is not expedient.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/> But if Panaetius were the sort of man to say that
virtue is worth cultivating only because it is productive of advantage, as do certain philosophers who
measure the desirableness of things by the standard
of pleasure or of absence of pain, he might argue that
expediency sometimes clashes with moral rectitude.
But since he is a man who judges that the morally
right is the only good, and that those things which
come in conflict with it have only the appearance of
expediency and cannot make life any better by their
presence nor any worse by their absence, it follows
that he ought not to have raised a question involving the weighing of what seems expedient against
what is morally right.<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>  Furthermore, when the
Stoics speak of the supreme good as <quote>living conformably to Nature,</quote> they mean, as I take it, something
like this: that we are always to be in accord with
virtue, and from all other things that may be in
harmony with Nature to choose only such as are not
incompatible with virtue. This being so, some
people are of the opinion that it was not right to
introduce this counterbalancing of right and expediency and that no practical instruction should have
been given on this question at all.</p>
<p>And yet moral goodness, in the true and proper
sense of the term, is the exclusive possession of the
wise and can never be separated from virtue; but
those who have not perfect wisdom cannot possibly
have perfect moral goodness, but only a semblance
of it.<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>  And indeed these duties under discussion in
these books the Stoics call <quote>mean duties</quote>;<note>See Note on I,8.</note> they are<note type="marg">The <quote>absolute</quote> and the <quote>mean.</quote></note>
a common possession and have wide application; and


<pb id="p.283"/>

many people attain to the knowledge of them through
natural goodness of heart and through advancement
in learning. But that duty which those same Stoics
call <quote>right</quote> is perfect and absolute and <quote>satisfies all
the numbers,</quote><note>I.e., fills all the requirements of absolute perfection&mdash;an
allusion to the Pythagorean doctrine that specific numbers
stand for perfection of specific kinds; <quote>absolute duty</quote>
combines them all.</note> as that same school says, and is
attainable by none except the wise man.<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>  On the
other hand, when some act is performed in which we
see <quote>mean</quote> duties manifested, that is generally regarded as fully perfect, for the reason that the common crowd does not, as a rule, comprehend how far it
falls short of real perfection; but, as far as their comprehension does go, they think there is no deficiency.
This same thing ordinarily occurs in the estimation of
poems, paintings, and a great many other works of
art: ordinary people enjoy and praise things that do
not deserve praise. The reason for this, I suppose, is
that those productions have some point of excellence
which catches the fancy of the uneducated, because
these have not the ability to discover the points of
weakness in any particular piece of work before
them. And so, when they are instructed by experts,
they readily abandon their former opinion.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/> The performance of the duties, then, which I<note type="marg">Absolute goodness and imperfeet humanity,</note>
am discussing in these books, is called by the Stoics
a sort of second-grade moral goodness, not the peculiar
property of their wise men, but shared by them with
all mankind.<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>  Accordingly, such duties appeal to all
men who have a natural disposition to virtue. And
when the two Decii or the two Scipios are mentioned
as <quote>brave men</quote> or Fabricius [or Aristides] is called
<quote>the just,</quote> it is not at all that the former are quoted
as perfect models of courage or the latter as a perfect
model of justice, as if we had in one of them the
ideal <quote>wise man.</quote> For no one of them was wise in


<pb id="p.285"/>

the sense in which we wish to have <quote>wise</quote> understood; neither were Marcus Cato and Gaius Laelius
wise, though they were so considered and were surnamed <quote>the wise.</quote> Not even the famous Seven were
<quote>wise.</quote> But because of their constant observance
of <quote>mean</quote> duties they bore a certain semblance and
likeness to wise men.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="17"/> For these reasons it is unlawful either to weigh
true morality against conflicting expediency, or
common morality, which is cultivated by those who
wish to be considered good men, against what is
profitable; but we every-day people must observe
and live up to that moral right which comes
within the range of our comprehension as jealously
as the truly wise men have to observe and live up
to that which is morally right in the technical and
true sense of the word. For otherwise we cannot
maintain such progress as we have made in the
direction of virtue.</p>
<p>So much for those who have won a reputation for
being good men by their careful observance of duty.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Those, on the other hand, who measure everything <note type="marg">Moral rectitude and apparent expediency.</note> by a standard of profits and personal advantage
and refuse to have these outweighed by considerations of moral rectitude are accustomed, in considering any question, to weigh the morally right against
what they think the expedient; good men are not.
And so I believe that when Panaetius stated that
people were accustomed to hesitate to do such
weighing, he meant precisely what he said&mdash;merely
that <quote>such was their custom,</quote> not that such was
their duty. And he gave it no approval; for it is
most immoral to think more highly of the apparently
expedient than of the morally right, or even to set


<pb id="p.287"/>

these over against each other and to hesitate to
choose between them.</p>
<p>What, then, is it that may sometimes give room<note type="marg">Occasion for doubt.</note>
for a doubt and seem to call for consideration? It
is, I believe, when a question arises as to the character of an action under consideration.<milestone unit="section" n="19"/>  For it often
happens, owing to exceptional circumstances, that
what is accustomed under ordinary circumstances to
be considered morally wrong is found not to be
morally wrong. For the sake of illustration, let us
assume some particular case that admits of wider
application: what more atrocious crime can there be
than to kill a fellow-man, and especially an intimate
friend? But if anyone kills a tyrant&mdash;be he never
so intimate a friend&mdash;he has not laden his soul with
guilt, has he? The Roman People, at all events, are
not of that opinion; for of all glorious deeds they
hold such an one to be the most noble. Has expediency, then, prevailed over moral rectitude? Not at
all; moral rectitude has gone hand in hand with
expediency.</p>
<p>Some general rule, therefore, should be laid down<note type="marg">Need of a rule for guidance.</note>
to enable us to decide without error, whenever
what we call the expedient seems to clash with what
we feel to be morally right; and, if we follow that
rule in comparing courses of conduct, we shall never
swerve from the path of duty.<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>  That rule, moreover, shall be in perfect harmony with the Stoics'
system and doctrines. It is their teachings that
I am following in these books, and for this
reason: the older Academicians and your Peripatetics (who were once the same as the Academicians) give what is morally right the preference over
what seems expedient; and yet the discussion of


<pb id="p.289"/>

these problems, if conducted by those who consider
whatever is morally right also expedient and nothing
expedient that is not at the same time morally right,
will be more illuminating than if conducted by those
who think that something not expedient may be
morally right and that something not morally right
may be expedient. But our New Academy allows
us wide liberty, so that it is within my right to
defend any theory that presents itself to me as most
probable. But to return to my rule.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="21"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/> Well then, for a man to take something from<note type="marg">Wrongful gains are against the laws: (1) of nature,</note>
his neighbour and to profit by his neighbour's loss is
more contrary to Nature than is death or poverty or
pain or anything else that can affect either our person or our property. For, in the first place, injustice
is fatal to social life and fellowship between man
and man. For, if we are so disposed that each, to
gain some personal profit, will defraud or injure his
neighbour, then those bonds of human society, which
are most in accord with Nature's laws, must of
necessity be broken.<milestone unit="section" n="22"/>  Suppose, by way of comparison, that each one of our bodily members should conceive this idea and imagine that it could be strong
and well if it should draw off to itself the health and
strength of its neighbouring member, the whole
body would necessarily be enfeebled and die; so, if
each one of us should seize upon the property of his
neighbours and take from each whatever he could
appropriate to his own use, the bonds of human
society must inevitably be annihilated. For, without
any conflict with Nature's laws, it is granted that
everybody may prefer to secure for himself rather
than for his neighbour what is essential for the conduct of life; but Nature's laws do forbid us to increase


<pb id="p.291"/>

our means, wealth, and resources by despoiling
others.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="23"/> But this principle is established not by Nature's<note type="marg">(2) of nations,</note>
laws alone (that is, by the common rules of equity),
but also by the statutes of particular communities, in
accordance with which in individual states the public
interests are maintained. In all these it is with one
accord ordained that no man shall be allowed for the
sake of his own advantage to injure his neighbour.
For it is to this that the laws have regard; this is
their intent, that the bonds of union between citizens
should not be impaired; and any attempt to destroy
these bonds is repressed by the penalty of death,
exile, imprisonment, or fine.</p>
<p>Again, this principle follows much more effectually<note type="marg">(3) of gods and men.</note>
directly from the Reason which is in Nature, which
is the law of gods and men. If anyone will hearken
to that voice (and all will hearken to it who wish to
live in accord with Nature's laws), he will never be
guilty of coveting anything that is his neighbour's
or of appropriating to himself what he has taken
from his neighbour.<milestone unit="section" n="24"/>  Then, too, loftiness and greatness of spirit, and courtesy, justice, and generosity
are much more in harmony with Nature than are
selfish pleasure, riches, and life itself; but it requires
a great and lofty spirit to despise these latter and
count them as naught, when one weighs them over
against the common weal. [But for anyone to rob<note type="marg">Self-seeking <hi rend="italics">vs.</hi> self-sacrifice.</note>
his neighbour for his own profit is more contrary to
Nature than death, pain, and the like.]</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="25"/> In like manner it is more in accord with Nature
to emulate the great Hercules and undergo the
greatest toil and trouble for the sake of aiding or
saving the world, if possible, than to live in seclusion,


<pb id="p.293"/>

not only free from all care, but revelling in pleasures
and abounding in wealth, while excelling others
also in beauty and strength. Thus Hercules denied
himself and underwent toil and tribulation for the
world, and, out of gratitude for his services, popular
belief has given him a place in the council of the
gods.</p>
<p>The better and more noble, therefore, the character with which a man is endowed, the more does he
prefer the life of service to the life of pleasure.
Whence it follows that man, if he is obedient to
Nature, cannot do harm to his fellow-man.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="26"/> Finally, if a man wrongs his neighbour to gain
some advantage for himself, he must either imagine
that he is not acting in defiance of Nature or he
must believe that death, poverty, pain, or even the
loss of children, kinsmen, or friends, is more to be
shunned than an act of injustice against another.
If he thinks he is not violating the laws of Nature,
when he wrongs his fellow-men, how is one to argue
with the individual who takes away from man all
that makes him man? But if he believes that, while
such a course should be avoided, the other alternatives are much worse&mdash;namely, death, poverty, pain
&mdash;he is mistaken in thinking that any ills affecting
either his person or his property are more serious
than those affecting his soul.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/> This, then, ought to be the chief end of all<note type="marg">The interest of society is the interest of the individual.</note>
men, to make the interest of each individual and of
the whole body politic identical. For, if the individual
appropriates to selfish ends what should be devoted
to the common good, all human fellowship will be
destroyed.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="27"/> And further, if Nature ordains that one man shall


<pb id="p.295"/>

desire to promote the interests of a fellow-man,
whoever he may be, just because he is a fellow-man,
then it follows, in accordance with that same Nature,
that there are interests that all men have in common. And, if this is true, we are all subject to one
and the same law of Nature; and, if this also is true,
we are certainly forbidden by Nature's law to wrong
our neighbour. Now the first assumption is true;
therefore the conclusion is likewise true.<milestone unit="section" n="28"/>  For that
is an absurd position which is taken by some people,
who say that they will not rob a parent or a brother
for their own gain, but that their relation to the
rest of their fellow-citizens is quite another thing.
Such people contend in essence that they are bound
to their fellow-citizens by no mutual obligations,
social ties, or common interests. This attitude
demolishes the whole structure of civil society.</p>
<p>Others again who say that regard should be had<note type="marg">Better endure any loss than wrong a fellow man for gain.</note>
for the rights of fellow-citizens, but not of foreigners,
would destroy the universal brotherhood of mankind; and, when this is annihilated, kindness,
generosity, goodness, and justice must utterly
perish; and those who work all this destruction
must be considered as wickedly rebelling against
the immortal gods. For they uproot the fellowship
which the gods have established between human
beings, and the closest bond of this fellowship is
the conviction that it is more repugnant to Nature
for man to rob a fellow-man for his own gain than
to endure all possible loss, whether to his property
or to his person . . . or even to his very soul&mdash;so far
as these losses are not concerned with justice;<note>I.e., there are no circumstances of loss or gain that can
warrant a violation of justice.</note> for
this virtue is the sovereign mistress and queen of
all the virtues.</p>


<pb id="p.297"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="29"/> But, perhaps, someone may say: <quote>Well, then,
suppose a wise man were starving to death, might
he not take the bread of some perfectly useless
member of society?</quote> [Not at all; for my life is not
more precious to me than that temper of soul which
would keep me from doing wrong to anybody for my
own advantage.] <quote>Or again; supposing a righteous
man were in a position to rob the cruel and inhuman
tyrant Phalaris of clothing, might he not do it to
keep himself from freezing to death?</quote></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="30"/> These cases are very easy to decide. For, if merely
for one's own benefit one were to take something
away from a man, though he were a perfectly worthless fellow, it would be an act of meanness and contrary to Nature's law. But suppose one would be<note type="marg">The interests of society must decide about exceptions.</note>
able, by remaining alive, to render signal service to
the state and to human society&mdash;if from that motive
one should take something from another, it would not
be a matter for censure. But, if such is not the case,
each one must bear his own burden of distress rather
than rob a neighbour of his rights. We are not to
say, therefore, that sickness or want or any evil of
that sort is more repugnant to Nature than to covet
and to appropriate what is one's neighbour's; but we
do maintain that disregard of the common interests
is repugnant to Nature; for it is unjust.<milestone unit="section" n="31"/>  And therefore Nature's law itself, which protects and conserves
human interests, will surely determine that a man
who is wise, good, and brave, should in emergency
have the necessaries of life transferred to him from
a person who is idle and worthless; for the good
man's death would be a heavy loss to the common
weal; only let him beware that self-esteem and self-love do not find in such a transfer of possessions


<pb id="p.299"/>

a pretext for wrong-doing. But, thus guided in his
decision, the good man will always perform his duty,
promoting the general interests of human society on
which I am so fond of dwelling.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="32"/> As for the case of Phalaris, a decision is quite<note type="marg">No duty due to a tyrant.</note>
simple: we have no ties of fellowship with a tyrant,
but rather the bitterest feud; and it is not opposed
to Nature to rob, if one can, a man whom it is morally
right to kill;&mdash;nay, all that pestilent and abominable
race should be exterminated from human society.
And this may be done by proper measures; for, as
certain members are amputated, if they show signs
themselves of being bloodless and virtually lifeless
and thus jeopardize the health of the other parts of
the body, so those fierce and savage monsters in
human form should be cut off from what may be
called the common body of humanity.</p>
<p>Of this sort are all those problems in which we
have to determine what moral duty is, as it varies
with varying circumstances.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="33"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/> It is subjects of this sort that I believe
Panaetius would have followed up, had not some
accident or business interfered with his design. For
the elucidation of these very questions there are in
his former books rules in plenty, from which one
can learn what should be avoided because of its immorality and what does not have to be avoided for
the reason that it is not immoral at all.</p>
<p>We are now putting the capstone, as it were, upon
our structure, which is unfinished, to be sure, but still
almost completed; and, as mathematicians make a
practice of not demonstrating every proposition, but
require that certain axioms be assumed as true, in
order more easily to explain their meaning, so, my


<pb id="p.301"/>

dear Cicero, I ask you to assume with me, if you can, <note type="marg">Moral Right the only good or the chief good.</note>
that nothing is worth the seeking for its own sake
except what is morally right. But if Cratippus<note>As a Peripatetic, Cratippus insisted that there was <hi rend="italics">natural</hi>
good as well as <hi rend="italics">moral</hi> good; thus health, honour, etc., were
good and worth seeking for their own sake, though in less
degree than virtue. But the Stoics (and Cicero is now speaking as a Stoic) called all those other blessings not <quote>good</quote>
nor <quote>worth seeking for their own sake,</quote> but <quote>indifferent.</quote></note> does
not permit this assumption, you will still grant this
at least&mdash;that what is morally right is the object
most worth the seeking for its own sake. Either
alternative is sufficient for my purposes; first the one
and then the other seems to me the more probable;
and, besides these, there no other alternative that
seems probable at all.<note>With this he waves aside, without even the honour of
mentioning them, the Epicureans, Cyrenaics, etc.</note></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="34"/> In the first place, I must undertake the defence<note type="marg">Vindication of Panaetius: nothing can be expedient that is not morally right.</note>
of Panaetius on this point; for he has said, not that
the truly expedient could under certain circumstances clash with the morally right (for he could
not have said that conscientiously<note>Because he was a Stoic.</note>), but only that
what <hi rend="italics">seemed</hi> expedient could do so. For he often
bears witness to the fact that nothing is really expedient that is not at the same time morally right,
and nothing morally right that is not at the same
time expedient; and he says that no greater curse
has ever assailed human life than the doctrine of
those who have separated these two conceptions.
And so he introduced an apparent, not a real, conflict between them, not to the end that we should
under certain circumstances give the expedient
preference over the moral, but that, in case they ever
should get in each other's way, we might decide
between them without uncertainty. This part,
therefore, which was passed over by Panaetius, I will
carry to completion without any auxiliaries, but
fighting my own battle, as the saying is. For, of all
that has been worked out on this line since the time
of Panaetius, nothing that has come into my hands is
at all satisfactory to me.</p>


<pb id="p.303"/>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="35"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/> Now when we meet with expediency in<note type="marg">Expediency and immorality incompatible.</note>
some specious form or other, we cannot help being
influenced by it. But if upon closer inspection one
sees that there is some immorality connected with
what presents the appearance of expediency, then
one is not necessarily to sacrifice expediency but
to recognize that there can be no expediency where
there is immorality. But if there is nothing so
repugnant to Nature as immorality (for Nature
demands right and harmony and consistency and
abhors their opposites), and if nothing is so
thoroughly in accord with Nature as expediency,
then surely expediency and immorality cannot coexist in one and the same object.</p>
<p>Again: if we are born for moral rectitude and if<note type="marg">The morally right is also expedient.</note>
that is either the only thing worth seeking, as Zeno
thought, or at least to be esteemed as infinitely outweighing everything else, as Aristotle holds, then it
necessarily follows that the morally right is either
the sole good or the supreme good. Now, that
which is good is certainly expedient; consequently,
that which is morally right is also expedient.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="36"/> Thus it is the error of men who are not strictly<note type="marg">The evils resulting from contrary view.</note>
upright to seize upon something that seems to be
expedient and straightway to dissociate that from
the question of moral right. To this error the
assassin's dagger, the poisoned cup, the forged wills
owe their origin; this gives rise to theft, embezzlement of public funds, exploitation and plundering
of provincials and citizens; this engenders also the
lust for excessive wealth, for despotic power, and
finally for making oneself king even in the midst of
a free people; and anything more atrocious or repulsive than such a passion cannot be conceived. For


<pb id="p.305"/>

with a false perspective they see the material rewards
but not the punishment&mdash;I do not mean the penalty
of the law, which they often escape, but the heaviest
penalty of all, their own demoralization.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="37"/> Away, then, with questioners of this sort (for
their whole tribe is wicked and ungodly), who stop
to consider whether to pursue the course which they
see is morally right or to stain their hands with what
they know is crime. For there is guilt in their very
deliberation, even though they never reach the performance of the deed itself. Those actions, therefore, should not be considered at all, the mere consideration of which is itself morally wrong.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in any such consideration we must<note type="marg">Moral rectitude and secret sin.</note>
banish any vain hope and thought that our action
may be covered up and kept secret. For if we have
only made some real progress in the study of philosophy, we ought to be quite convinced that, even
though we may escape the eyes of gods and men,
we must still do nothing that savours of greed or
of injustice, of lust or of intemperance.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="38"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/> By way of illustrating this truth Plato introduces <note type="marg">The story of Gyges and his ring.</note> the familiar story of Gyges: Once upon a time
the earth opened in consequence of heavy rains;
Gyges went down into the chasm and saw, so the story
goes, a horse of bronze; in its side was a door. On
opening this door he saw the body of a dead man of
enormous size with a gold ring upon his finger. He
removed this and put it on his own hand and then
repaired to an assembly of the shepherds, for he was
a shepherd of the king. As often as he turned the
bezel of the ring inwards toward the palm of his
hand, he became invisible to everyone, while lie
himself saw everything; but as often as he turned


<pb id="p.307"/>

it back to its proper position, he became visible
again. And so, with the advantage which the ring
gave him, he debauched the queen, and with her
assistance he murdered his royal master and removed
all those who he thought stood in his way, without
anyone's being able to detect him in his crimes.
Thus, by virtue of the ring, he shortly rose to be
king of Lydia.</p>
<p>Now, suppose a wise man had just such a ring, he
would not imagine that he was free to do wrong any
more than if he did not have it; for good men aim
to secure not secrecy but the right.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="39"/> And yet on this point certain philosophers, who
are not at all vicious but who are not very discerning, declare that the story related by Plato is fictitious and imaginary. As if he affirmed that it was
actually true or even possible! But the force of the<note type="marg">The moral of the story.</note>
illustration of the ring is this: if nobody were to
know or even to suspect the truth, when you do anything to gain riches or power or sovereignty or
sensual gratification&mdash;if your act should be hidden
for ever from the knowledge of gods and men, would
you do it? The condition, they say, is impossible.
Of course it is. But my question is, if that were
possible which they declare to be impossible, what,
pray, would one do? They press their point
with right boorish obstinacy: they assert that it is
impossible and insist upon it; they refuse to see the
meaning of my words, <quote>if possible.</quote> For when
we ask what they would do, if they could escape
detection, we are not asking whether they can escape
detection; but we put them as it were upon the rack:
should they answer that, if impunity were assured,
they would do what was most to their selfish interest,


<pb id="p.309"/>

that would be a confession that they are criminally
minded; should they say that they would not do
so, they would be granting that all things in and of
themselves immoral should be avoided.</p>
<p>But let us now return to our theme.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="40"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/> Many cases oftentimes arise to perplex our<note type="marg">Conflicts between: (1) apparent Expediency and Justice,</note>
minds with a specious appearance of expediency: the
question raised in these cases is not whether moral
rectitude is to be sacrificed to some considerable
advantage (for that would of course be wrong), but
whether the apparent advantage can be secured
without moral wrong. When Brutus deposed his
colleague Collatinus from the consular office, his
treatment of him might have been thought unjust;
for Collatinus had been his associate, and had helped
him with word and deed in driving out the royal
family. But when the leading men of the state had
determined that all the kindred of Superbus and the
very name of the Tarquins and every reminder of the
monarchy should be obliterated, then the course that
was expedient&mdash;namely, to serve the country's interests&mdash;was so pre-eminently right, that it was even
Collatinus's own duty to acquiesce in its justice. And
so expediency gained the day because of its moral
rightness; for without moral rectitude there could
have been no possible expediency.</p>
<p>Not so in the case of the king<note>Romulus.</note> who founded the
city:<milestone unit="section" n="41"/>  it was the specious appearance of expediency
that actuated him; and when he decided that it
was more expedient for him to reign alone than to
share the throne with another, he slew his brother.<note>Remus.</note>
He threw to the winds his brotherly affection and his
human feelings, to secure what seemed to him&mdash;but
was not&mdash;expedient; and yet in defence of his deed


<pb id="p.311"/>

he offered the excuse about his wall&mdash;a specious show
of moral rectitude, neither reasonable nor adequate
at all. He committed a crime, therefore, with due
respect to him let me say so, be he Quirinus or
Romulus.<note>I.e., whether he be god or man.</note></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="42"/> And yet we are not required to sacrifice our own<note type="marg">(2) individual and general interests.</note>
interests and surrender to others what we need for
ourselves, but each one should consider his own
interests, as far as he may without injury to his
neighbour's. <quote>When a man enters the foot-race,</quote>
says Chrysippus with his usual aptness, <quote>it is his
duty to put forth all his strength and strive with all
his might to win; but he ought never with his foot
to trip, or with his hand to foul a competitor. Thus
in the stadium of life, it is not unfair for anyone to
seek to obtain what is needful for his own advantage,
but he has no right to wrest it from his neighbour.</quote></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="43"/> It is in the case of friendships, however, that<note type="marg">(3) obligations to friends and duty,</note>
men's conceptions of duty are most confused; for it
is a breach of duty either to fail to do for a friend
what one rightly can do, or to do for him what is
not right. But for our guidance in all such cases we
have a rule that is short and easy to master: apparent
advantages&mdash;political preferment, riches, sensual
pleasures, and the like&mdash;should never be preferred
to the obligations of friendship. But an upright
man will never for a friend's sake do anything in
violation of his country's interests or his oath or his
sacred honour, not even if he sits as judge in a
friend's case; for he lays aside the role of friend
when he assumes that of judge. Only so far will he
make concessions to friendship, that he will prefer
his friend's side to be the juster one and that he will
set the time for presenting his case, as far as the


<pb id="p.313"/>

laws will allow, to suit his friend's convenience.
<milestone unit="section" n="44"/> But when he comes to pronounce the verdict under
oath, he should remember that he has God as his
witness&mdash;that is, as I understand it, his own conscience, than which God himself has bestowed upon
man nothing more divine. From this point of view
it is a fine custom that we have inherited from our
forefathers (if we were only true to it now), to appeal
to the juror with this formula&mdash;<quote>to do what he can
consistently with his sacred honour.</quote> This form of
appeal is in keeping with what I said a moment ago
would be morally right for a judge to concede to a
friend. For supposing that we were bound to do
everything that our friends desired, such relations
would have to be accounted not friendships but
conspiracies.<milestone unit="section" n="45"/>  But I am speaking here of ordinary
friendships; for among men who are ideally wise
and perfect such situations cannot arise.</p>
<p>They say that Damon and Phintias, of the Pythagorean <note type="marg">Damon and Phintias.</note> school, enjoyed such ideally perfect friendship, that when the tyrant Dionysius had appointed a
day for the execution of one of them, and the one
who had been condemned to death requested a few
days' respite for the purpose of putting his loved
ones in the care of friends, the other became surety
for his appearance, with the understanding that if
his friend did not return, he himself should be put
to death. And when the friend returned on the
day appointed, the tyrant in admiration for their
faithfulness begged that they would enrol him as a
third partner in their friendship.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="46"/> Well then, when we are weighing what seems to<note type="marg">Rules of precedence.</note>
be expedient in friendship against what is morally
right, let apparent expediency be disregarded and


<pb id="p.315"/>

moral rectitude prevail; and when in friendship
requests are submitted that are not morally right, let
conscience and scrupulous regard for the right take
precedence of the obligations of friendship. In this
way we shall arrive at a proper choice between conflicting duties&mdash;the subject of this part of our
investigation.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/> Through a specious appearance of expediency<note type="marg">(4) apparent political expediency and duty to humanity.</note>
wrong is very often committed in transactions between state and state, as by our own country in the
destruction of Corinth. A more cruel wrong was
perpetrated by the Athenians in decreeing that the
Aeginetans, whose strength lay in their navy, should
have their thumbs cut off. This seemed to be
expedient; for Aegina was too grave a menace, as it
was close to the Piraeus. But no cruelty can be
expedient; for cruelty is most abhorrent to human
nature, whose lead we ought to follow.<milestone unit="section" n="47"/>  They,
too, do wrong who would debar foreigners from
enjoying the advantages of their city and would
exclude them from its borders, as was done by
Pennus in the time of our fathers, and in recent
times by Papius. It may not be right, of course,
for one who is not a citizen to exercise the rights and
privileges of citizenship; and the law on this point
was secured by two of our wisest consuls, Crassus and
Scaevola. Still, to debar foreigners from enjoying
the advantages of the city is altogether contrary to
the laws of humanity.</p>
<p>There are splendid examples in history where the<note type="marg">Moral right far outweighs apparent expediency.</note>
apparent expediency of the state has been set at
naught out of regard for moral rectitude. Our own
country has many instances to offer throughout her
history, and especially in the Second Punic War,


<pb id="p.317"/>

when news came of the disaster at Cannae, Rome displayed a loftier courage than ever she did in success;
never a trace of faint-heartedness, never a mention
of making terms. The influence of moral right is so
potent, that it eclipses the specious appearance of
expediency.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="48"/> When the Athenians could in no way stem the
tide of the Persian invasion and determined to
abandon their city, bestow their wives and children
in safety at Troezen, embark upon their ships, and
fight on the sea for the freedom of Greece, a man
named Cyrsilus proposed that they should stay at
home and open the gates of their city to Xerxes.
They stoned him to death for it. And yet he was
working for what he thought was expediency; but
it was not&mdash;not at all, for it clashed with moral
rectitude.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="49"/> After the victorious close of that war with Persia,
Themistocles announced in the Assembly that he
had a plan for the welfare of the state, but that it
was not politic to let it be generally known. He
requested the people to appoint someone with whom
he might discuss it. They appointed Aristides.
Themistocles confided to him that the Spartan fleet,
which had been hauled up on shore at Gytheum,
could be secretly set on fire; this done, the Spartan
power would inevitably be crushed. When Aristides
heard the plan, he came into the Assembly amid the
eager expectation of all and reported that the plan
proposed by Themistocles was in the highest degree
expedient, but anything but morally right. The
result was that the Athenians concluded that what
was not morally right was likewise not expedient,
and at the instance of Aristides they rejected the


<pb id="p.319"/>

whole proposition without even listening to it. Their
attitude was better than ours; for we let pirates go
scot free, while we make our allies pay tribute.<note>The Cilician pirates had been crushed by Pompey and
settled at Soli (Pompeiopolis). They gathered strength
again during the distractions of the civil wars, and Antony
is even said to have sought their aid in the war against
Brutus and Cassius.
Marseilles and King Deiotarus of Armenia had supported
Pompey and in consequence were made tributary by Caesar's
party.</note></p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/> Let it be set down as an established principle, then, that what is morally wrong can never be
expedient&mdash;not even when one secures by means of
it that which one thinks expedient; for the mere
act of thinking a course expedient, when it is morally
wrong, is demoralizing.<milestone unit="section" n="50"/>  But, as I said above, cases<note type="marg">Expediency <hi rend="italics">vs.</hi> moral rectitude in business relations.</note>
often arise in which expediency may seem to clash
with moral rectitude; and so we should examine in
carefully and see whether their conflict is inevitable
or whether they may be reconciled. The following
are problems of this sort: suppose, for example, a
time of dearth and famine at Rhodes, with provisions
at fabulous prices; and suppose that an honest man
has imported a large cargo of grain from Alexandria
and that to his certain knowledge also several other
importers have set sail from Alexandria, and that on
the voyage he has sighted their vessels laden with
grain and bound for Rhodes; is he to report the fact
to the Rhodians or is he to keep his own counsel
and sell his own stock at the highest market price?
I am assuming the case of a virtuous, upright man,
and I am raising the question how a man would
think and reason who would not conceal the facts
from the Rhodians if he thought that it was immoral
to do so, but who might be in doubt whether such
silence would really be immoral.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="51"/> In deciding cases of this kind Diogenes of Baby-<note type="marg">Diogenes <hi rend="italics">vs.</hi> Antipater.</note>
lonia, a great and highly esteemed Stoic, consistently
holds one view; his pupil Antipater, a most profound
scholar, holds another. According to Antipater all
the facts should be disclosed, that the buyer may


<pb id="p.321"/>

not be uninformed of any detail that the seller
knows; according to Diogenes the seller should
declare any defects in his wares, in so far as such a
course is prescribed by the common law of the land;
but for the rest, since he has goods to sell, he may
try to sell them to the best possible advantage,
provided he is guilty of no misrepresentation.</p>
<p><quote>I have imported my stock,</quote> Diogenes's merchant will say; <quote>I have offered it for sale; I sell
at a price no higher than my competitors&mdash;perhaps
even lower, when the market is overstocked. Who
is wronged?</quote></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="52"/> <quote>What say you?</quote> comes Antipater's argument on
the other side; <quote>it is your duty to consider the interests of your fellow-men and to serve society; you
were brought into the world under these conditions
and have these inborn principles which you are in duty
bound to obey and follow, that your interest shall be
the interest of the community and conversely that
the interest of the community shall be your interest<note type="marg">Is concealment of truth immoral?</note>
as well; will you, in view of all these facts, conceal
from your fellow-men what relief in plenteous
supplies is close at hand for them?</quote></p>
<p><quote>It is one thing to conceal,</quote> Diogenes will perhaps reply; <quote>not to reveal is quite a different thing.
At this present moment I am not concealing from
you, even if I am not revealing to you, the nature of
the gods or the highest good; and to know these
secrets would be of more advantage to you than to
know that the price of wheat was down. But I am
under no obligation to tell you everything that it
may be to your interest to be told.</quote></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="53"/> <quote>Yea,</quote> Antipater will say, <quote>but you are, as you
must admit, if you will only bethink you of the


<pb id="p.323"/>

bonds of fellowship forged by Nature and existing
between man and man.</quote></p>
<p><quote>I do not forget them,</quote> the other will reply;
<quote>but do you mean to say that those bonds of fellowship are such that there is no such thing as private
property? If that is the case, we should not
sell anything at all, but freely give everything
away.</quote></p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/> In this whole discussion, you see, no one
says, <quote>However wrong morally this or that may be,
still, since it is expedient, I will do it</quote>; but the one
side asserts that a given act is expedient, without
being morally wrong, while the other insists that
the act should not be done, because it is morally
wrong.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="54"/> Suppose again that an honest man is offering a<note type="marg">A vendor's duty.</note>
house for sale on account of certain undesirable
features of which he himself is aware but which
nobody else knows; suppose it is unsanitary, but
has the reputation of being healthful; suppose it is
not generally known that vermin are to be found in
all the bedrooms; suppose, finally, that it is built of
unsound timber and likely to collapse, but that no
one knows about it except the owner; if the vendor
does not tell the purchaser these facts but sells him
the house for far more than he could reasonably
have expected to get for it, I ask whether his transaction is unjust or dishonourable.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="55"/> <quote>Yes,</quote> says Antipater, <quote>it is; for to allow a purchaser to be hasty in closing a deal and through
mistaken judgment to incur a very serious loss, if
this is not refusing ' to set a man right when he has
lost his way' (a crime which at Athens is prohibited
on pain of public execration), what is? It is even


<pb id="p.325"/>

worse than refusing to set a man on his way: it is
deliberately leading a man astray.</quote></p>
<p><milestone unit="alternatesection" n="55"/> <quote>Can you say,</quote> answers Diogenes, <quote>that he compelled you to purchase, when he did not even advise
it? He advertised for sale what he did not like;
you bought what you did like. If people are not
considered guilty of swindling when they place upon
their placards FOR SALE: A FINE VILLA, WELL BUILT,
even when it is neither good nor properly built, still
less guilty are they who say nothing in praise of
their house. For where the purchaser may exercise
his own judgment, what fraud can there be on the
part of the vendor? But if, again, not all that is
expressly stated has to be made good, do you think
a man is bound to make good what has not been
said? What, pray, would be more stupid than for a
vendor to recount all the faults in the article he is
offering for sale? And what would be so absurd as
for an auctioneer to cry, at the owner's bidding,
'Here is an unsanitary house for sale'?</quote></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="56"/> In this way, then, in certain doubtful cases moral
rectitude is defended on the one side, while on the
other side the case of expediency is so presented as
to make it appear not only morally right to do what
seems expedient, but even morally wrong not to do
it. This is the contradiction that seems often to
arise between the expedient and the morally right.
But I must give my decision in these two cases; for<note type="marg">Cicero's decision in the cases.</note>
I did not propound them merely to raise the questions, but to offer a solution.<milestone unit="section" n="57"/>  I think, then, that it
was the duty of that grain-dealer not to keep back
the facts from the Rhodians, and of this vendor of
the house to deal in the same way with his purchaser,
The fact is that merely holding one's peace about a


<pb id="p.327"/>

thing does not constitute concealment, but concealment consists in trying for your own profit to keep
others from finding out something that you know,
when it is for their interest to know it. And who
fails to discern what manner of concealment that is
and what sort of person would be guilty of it? At
all events he would be no candid or sincere or
straightforward or upright or honest man, but rather
one who is shifty, sly, artful, shrewd, underhand,
cunning, one grown old in fraud and subtlety. Is it
not inexpedient to subject oneself to all these terms
of reproach and many more besides?</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="58"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/> If, then, they are to be blamed who suppress<note type="marg">Concealment of truth <hi rend="italics">vs.</hi> misrepresentation and falsehood.</note>
the truth, what are we to think of those who actually state what is false? Gaius Canius, a Roman
a man of considerable wit and literary culture, once went to Syracuse for a vacation, as he
himself used to say, and not for business. He gave
out that he had a mind to purchase a little country
seat, where he could invite his friends and enjoy
himself, uninterrupted by troublesome visitors.
When this fact was spread abroad, one Pythius, a
banker of Syracuse, informed him that he had such
an estate; that it was not for sale, however, but
Canius might make himself at home there, if he
pleased; and at the same time he invited him to the
estate to dinner next day. Canius accepted. Then
Pythius, who, as might be expected of a moneylender, could command favours of all classes, called
the fishermen together and asked them to do their
fishing the next day out in front of his villa, and
told them what he wished them to do. Canius came
to dinner at the appointed hour; Pythius had a
sumptuous banquet prepared; there was a whole


<pb id="p.329"/>

fleet of boats before their eyes; each fisherman
brought in in turn the catch that he had made; and
the fishes were deposited at the feet of Pythius.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="59"/> <quote>Pray, Pythius,</quote> said Canius thereupon, <quote>what
does this mean?&mdash;all these fish?&mdash;all these boats?</quote></p>
<p><quote>No wonder,</quote> answered Pythius; <quote>this is where
all the fish in Syracuse are; here is where the fresh
water comes from; the fishermen cannot get along
without this estate.</quote></p>
<p>Inflamed with desire for it, Canius insisted upon
Pythius's selling it to him. At first he demurred.
To make a long story short, Canius gained his point.
The man was rich, and, in his desire to own the
country seat, he paid for it all that Pythius asked;
and he bought the entire equipment, too. Pythius
entered the amount upon his ledger and completed
the transfer. The next day Canius invited his
friends; he came early himself. Not so much as a
thole-pin was in sight. He asked his next-door
neighbour whether it was a fishermen's holiday, for
not a sign of them did he see.</p>
<p><quote>Not so far as I know,</quote> said he; <quote>but none are
in the habit of fishing here. And so I could not
make out what was the matter yesterday.</quote></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="60"/> Canius was furious; but what could he do? For<note type="marg">Criminal fraud.</note>
not yet had my colleague and friend, Gaius Aquilius,
introduced the established forms to apply to criminal
fraud. When asked what he meant by <quote>criminal
fraud,</quote> as specified in these forms, he would reply:</p>
<p><quote>Pretending one thing and practising another</quote>&mdash;a
very felicitous definition, as one might expect from
an expert in making them. Pythius, therefore, and
all others who do one thing while they pretend
another are faithless, dishonest, and unprincipled


<pb id="p.331"/>

scoundrels. No act of theirs can be expedient, when
what they do is tainted with so many vices.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="61"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/> But if Aquilius's definition is correct, pretence and concealment should be done away with in
all departments of our daily life. Then an honest
man will not be guilty of either pretence or concealment in order to buy or to sell to better advantage.
Besides, your <quote>criminal fraud</quote> had previously been<note type="marg">Criminal fraud and the law.</note>
prohibited by the statutes: the penalty in the matter
of trusteeships, for example, is fixed by the Twelve
Tables; for the defrauding of minors, by the Plaetorian law. The same prohibition is effective, without statutory enactment, in equity cases, in which
it is added that the decision shall be <quote>as good
faith requires.</quote><note>See &sect; 70 below.</note> In all other cases in equity,
moreover, the following phrases are most noteworthy: in a case calling for arbitration in the matter
of a wife's dowry: what is <quote>the fairer is the better</quote>;
in a suit for the restoration of a trust: <quote>honest
dealing, as between honest parties.</quote> Pray, then,
can there be any element of fraud in what is adjusted
for the <quote>better and fairer</quote>? Or can anything
fraudulent or unprincipled be done, when <quote>honest
dealing between honest parties</quote> is stipulated? But
<quote>criminal fraud,</quote> as Aquilius says, consists in false
pretence. We must, therefore, keep misrepresentation <note type="marg">Criminal fraud in the light of moral rectitude.</note> entirely out of business transactions: the seller
will not engage a bogus bidder to run prices up nor
the buyer one to bid low against himself to keep
them down; and each, if they come to naming a
price, will state once for all what he will give or take.
<milestone unit="section" n="62"/> Why, when Quintus Scaevola, the son of Publius
Scaevola, asked that the price of a farm that he
desired to purchase be definitely named and the


<pb id="p.333"/>

vendor named it, he replied that he considered it
worth more, and paid him 100,000 sesterces over
and above what he asked. No one could say that
this was not the act of an honest man; but people do
say that it was not the act of a worldly-wise man, any
more than if he had sold for a smaller amount than
he could have commanded. Here, then, is that
mischievous idea&mdash;the world accounting some men
upright, others wise; and it is this fact that gives
Ennius occasion to say:

<quote rend="blockquote"><quote><l>In vain is the wise man wise, who cannot benefit himself.</l></quote></quote>

And Ennius is quite right, if only he and I were agreed
upon the meaning of <quote>benefit.</quote></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="63"/> Now I observe that Hecaton of Rhodes, a pupil of
Panaetius, says in his books on <quote>Moral Duty</quote>
dedicated to Quintus Tubero that <quote>it is a wise
man's duty to take care of his private interests, at<note type="marg">The standard of selfishness.</note>
the same time doing nothing contrary to the civil
customs, laws, and institutions. But that depends
on our purpose in seeking prosperity; for we do not
aim to be rich for ourselves alone but for our children, relatives, friends, and, above all, for our country.
For the private fortunes of individuals are the wealth
of the state.</quote> Hecaton could not for a moment
approve of Scaevola's act, which I cited a moment
ago; for he openly avows that he will abstain from
doing for his own profit only what the law expressly
forbids. Such a man deserves no great praise nor
gratitude.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="64"/> Be that as it may, if both pretence and concealment constitute <quote>criminal fraud,</quote> there are very
few transactions into which <quote>criminal fraud</quote> does


<pb id="p.335"/>

not enter; or, if he only is a good man who help
all he can, and harms no one, it will certainly be no
easy matter for us to find the good man as thus
defined.</p>
<p>To conclude, then, it is never expedient to do
wrong, because wrong is always immoral; and it is
always expedient to be good, because goodness is
always moral.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="65"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/> In the laws pertaining to the sale of real<note type="marg">Concealment of truth about real estate prohibited by law.</note>
property it is stipulated in our civil code that when
a transfer of any real estate is made, all its defects
shall be declared as far as they are known to the
vendor. According to the laws of the Twelve Tables
it used to be sufficient that such faults as had been
expressly declared should be made good and that for
any flaws which the vendor expressly denied, when
questioned, he should be assessed double damages.
A like penalty for failure to make such declaration
also has now been secured by our jurisconsults:
they have decided that any defect in a piece of real
estate, if known to the vendor but not expressly
stated, must be made good by him.<milestone unit="section" n="66"/>  For example,
the augurs were proposing to take observations from
the citadel and they ordered Tiberius Claudius Centumalus, who owned a house upon the Caelian Hill,
to pull down such parts of the building as obstructed
the augurs' view by reason of their height. Claudius
at once advertised his block for sale, and Publius
Calpurnius Lanarius bought it. The same notice
was served also upon him. And so, when Calpurnius
had pulled down those parts of the building and
discovered that Claudius had advertised it for sale
only after the augurs had ordered them to be pulled
down, he summoned the former owner before a court


<pb id="p.337"/>

of equity to decide <quote>what indemnity the owner was
under obligation 'in good faith ' to pay and deliver
to him.</quote> The verdict was pronounced by Marcus
Cato, the father of our Cato (for as other men receive
a distinguishing name from their fathers, so he who
bestowed upon the world so bright a luminary must
have his distinguishing name from his son); he, as
I was saying, was presiding judge and pronounced
the verdict that <quote>since the augurs' mandate was
known to the vendor at the time of making the
transfer and since he had not made it known, he was
bound to make good the purchaser's loss.</quote></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="67"/> With this verdict he established the principle that<note type="marg">Scope of Cato's decision.</note>
it was essential to good faith that any defect known
to the vendor must be made known to the purchaser.
If his decision was right, our grain-dealer and the
vendor of the unsanitary house did not do right to
suppress the facts in those cases. But the civil code
cannot be made to include all cases where facts are
thus suppressed; but those cases which it does
include are summarily dealt with. Marcus Marius
Gratidianus, a kinsman of ours, sold back to Gaius
Sergius Orata the house which he himself had
bought a few years before from that same Orata. It
was subject to an encumbrance, but Marius had said
nothing about this fact in stating the terms of sale.
The case was carried to the courts. Crassus was
counsel for Orata; Antonius was retained by Gratidianus. Crassus pleaded the letter of the law that
<quote>the vendor was bound to make good the defect,
for he had not declared it, although he was aware of
it</quote>; Antonius laid stress upon the equity of the case,
pleading that, <quote>inasmuch as the defect in question
had not been unknown to Sergius (for it was the


<pb id="p.339"/>

same house that he had sold to Marius), no declaration of it was needed, and in purchasing it back he
had not been imposed upon, for he knew to what
legal liability his purchase was subject.</quote></p>

nothing be done with unfairness, with false pretence,

then, to set snares, even if one does not mean to
start the game or to drive it into them? Why, wild

a method of procedure, I find, is neither by custom
accounted morally wrong nor forbidden either by
statute or by civil law; nevertheless it is forbidden
by the moral law. For there is a bond of fellowship&mdash;although I have often made this statement, I
must still repeat it again and again&mdash;which has the
very widest application, uniting all men together
and each to each. This bond of union is closer
between those who belong to the same nation, and
more intimate still between those who are citizens
of the same city-state. It is for this reason that
our forefathers chose to understand one thing by the
universal law and another by the civil law. The

civil law is not necessarily also the universal law;
but the universal law ought to be also the civil law.
But we possess no substantial, life-like image of true
Law and genuine Justice; a mere outline sketch is
all that we enjoy. I only wish that we were true
even to this; for, even as it is, it is drawn from the
excellent models which Nature and Truth afford.
For how weighty are the words:<milestone unit="section" n="70"/>  <quote>That I be not<note type="marg"><quote>Good faith</quote> in performance of contracts.</note>
deceived and defrauded through you and my confidence in you</quote>! How precious are these: <quote>As
between honest people there ought to be honest
dealing, and no deception</quote>! But who are <quote>honest
people,</quote> and what is <quote>honest dealing</quote> &mdash;these are
serious questions.</p>
<p>It was Quintus Scaevola, the pontifex maximus,
who used to attach the greatest importance to all
questions of arbitration to which the formula was
appended <quote>as good faith requires</quote>; and he held
that the expression <quote>good faith</quote> had a very extensive application, for it was employed in trusteeships
and partnerships, in trusts and commissions, in buying and selling, in hiring and letting&mdash;in a word, in
all the transactions on which the social relations of
daily life depend; in these, he said, it required
a judge of great ability to decide the extent of
each individual's obligation to the other, especially when counter-claims were admissible in most
cases.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="71"/> Away, then, with sharp practice and trickery,
which desires, of course, to pass for wisdom, but is
far from it and totally unlike it. For the function
of wisdom is to discriminate between good and evil;
whereas, inasmuch as all things morally wrong are
evil, trickery prefers the evil to the good.</p>


<pb id="p.343"/>

<p>It is not only in the case of real estate transfers
that the civil law, based upon a natural feeling for
the right, punishes trickery and deception, but
also in the sale of slaves every form of deception
on the vendor's part is disallowed. For by the
aediles' ruling the vendor is answerable for any
deficiency in the slave he sells, for he is supposed
to know if his slave is sound, or if he is a runaway,
or a thief. The case of those who have just come
into the possession of slaves by inheritance is
different.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="72"/> From this we come to realize that since Nature is<note type="marg">Cunning is not wisdom.</note>
the source of right, it is not in accord with Nature
that anyone should take advantage of his neighbour's ignorance. And no greater curse in life
can be found than knavery that wears the mask
of wisdom. Thence come those countless cases
in which the expedient seems to conflict with the
right. For how few will be found who can refrain
from wrong-doing, if assured of the power to keep
it an absolute secret and to run no risk of punishment!</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="73"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/> Let us put our principle to the test, if
you please, and see if it holds good in those instances
in which, perhaps, the world in general finds no
wrong; for in this connection we do not need to
discuss cut-throats, poisoners, forgers of wills, thieves,
and embezzlers of public moneys, who should be
repressed not by lectures and discussions of philosophers, but by chains and prison walls; but let us
study here the conduct of those who have the
reputation of being honest men.</p>
<p>Certain individuals brought from Greece to Rome
a forged will, purporting to be that of the wealthy


<pb id="p.345"/>

Lucius Minucius Basilus. The more easily to procure validity for it, they made joint-heirs with themselves two of the most influential men of the day,
Marcus Crassus and Quintus Hortensius. Although
these men suspected that the will was a forgery,
still, as they were conscious of no personal guilt in
the matter, they did not spurn the miserable boon
procured through the crime of others. What shall we
say, then? Is this excuse competent to acquit them
of guilt? I cannot think so, although I loved the
one while he lived, and do not hate the other now
that he is dead.<milestone unit="section" n="74"/>  Be that as it may, Basilus had in fact
desired that his nephew Marcus Satrius should bear
his name and inherit his property. (I refer to the
Satrius who is the present patron of Picenum and
the Sabine country&mdash;and oh, what a shameful stigma
it is upon the times!<note>The shame was that states enjoying the rights of Roman
citizenship should need a patron to protect their interests in
the Roman capital.</note>) And therefore it was not
right that two of the leading citizens of Rome
should take the estate and Satrius succeed to nothing
except his uncle's name. For if he does wrong who
does not ward off and repel injury when he can&mdash;as
I explained in the course of the First Book&mdash;what is to
be thought of the man who not only does not try to
prevent wrong, but actually aids and abets it? For
my part, I do not believe that even genuine legacies
are moral, if they are sought after by designing
flatteries and by attentions hypocritical rather than
sincere.</p>
<p>And yet in such cases there are times when one<note type="marg">The same standard for expediency as for moral rectitude.</note>
course is likely to appear expedient and another
morally right.<milestone unit="section" n="75"/>  The appearance is deceptive; for
our standard is the same for expediency and for
moral rectitude.<milestone unit="alternatesection" n="75"/>  And the man who does not accept
the truth of this will be capable of any sort of dishonesty, <pb id="p.347"/> any sort of crime. For if he reasons,
<quote>That is, to be sure, the right course, but this
course brings advantage,</quote> he will not hesitate in his
mistaken judgment to divorce two conceptions that
Nature has made one; and that spirit opens the
door to all sorts of dishonesty, wrong-doing, and
crime.</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/> Suppose, then, that a good man had such<note type="marg">The good man not tempted to unrighteous gain.</note>
power that at a snap of his fingers his name could
steal into rich men's wills, he would not avail himself of that power&mdash;no, not even though he could be
perfectly sure that no one would ever suspect it.
Suppose, on the other hand, that one were to offer
a Marcus Crassus the power, by the mere snapping
of his fingers, to get himself named as heir, when he
was not really an heir, he would, I warrant you,
dance in the forum. But the righteous man, the
one whom we feel to be a good man, would never
rob anyone of anything to enrich himself. If anybody is astonished at this doctrine, let him confess
that he does not know what a good man is.<milestone unit="section" n="76"/>  If, on<note type="marg">Who is the good man?</note>
the other hand, anyone should desire to unfold the
idea of a good man which lies wrapped up in his own
mind,<note>The Platonic doctrine of ideas known in a previous
existence and gradually developing into renewed consciousness. Learning is but a remembering of what the
soul has known before.</note> he would then at once make it clear to himself that a good man is one who helps all whom he
can and harms nobody, unless provoked by wrong.
What shall we say, then? Would he not be doing
harm who by a kind of magic spell should succeed
in displacing the real heirs to an estate and pushing
himself into their place? <quote>Well,</quote> someone may
say, <quote>is he not to do what is expedient, what is advantageous to himself?</quote> Nay, verily; he should rather
be brought to realize that nothing that is unjust is
either advantageous or expedient; if he does not


<pb id="p.349"/>

learn this lesson, it will never be possible for him to
be a <quote>good man.</quote></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="77"/> When I was a boy, I used to hear my father tell
that Gaius Fimbria, an ex-consul, was judge in a
case of Marcus Lutatius Pinthia, a Roman knight of
irreproachable character. On that occasion Pinthia
had laid a wager to be forfeited <quote>if he did not prove
in court that he was a good man.</quote> Fimbria declared that he would never render a decision in such
a case, for fear that he might either rob a reputable
man of his good name, if he decided against him, or
be thought to have pronounced someone a good
man, when such a character is, as he said, established by the performance of countless duties and
the possession of praiseworthy qualities without
number.</p>
<p>To this type of good man, then, known not only<note type="marg">To a good man moral wrong is never expedient.</note>
to a Socrates but even to a Fimbria, nothing can
possibly seem expedient that is not morally right.
Such a man, therefore, will never venture to think
&mdash;to say nothing of doing&mdash;anything that he would
not dare openly to proclaim. Is it not a shame
that philosophers should be in doubt about moral
questions on which even peasants have no doubts
at all? For it is with peasants that the proverb,
already trite with age, originated: when they
praise a man's honour and honesty, they say, <quote>He
is a man with whom you can safely play at odd
and even<note>Lit. flash with the fingers'; shoot out some fingers,
the number of which had to be guessed.</note> in the dark.</quote> What is the point of
the proverb but this&mdash;that what is not proper
brings no advantage, even if you can gain your


<pb id="p.351"/>

end without anyone's being able to convict you of
wrong?</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="78"/> Do you not see that in the light of this proverb
no excuse is available either for the Gyges of the
story or for the man who I assumed a moment
ago could with a snap of his fingers sweep together everybody's inheritance at once? For as
the morally wrong cannot by any possibility be
made morally right, however successfully it may
be covered up, so what is not morally right cannot be made expedient, for Nature refuses and
resists.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="79"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/> <quote>But stay,</quote> someone will object, <quote>when<note type="marg">The moral loss that comes fro wrong ambitions:</note>
the prize is very great, there is excuse for doing
wrong.</quote></p>
<p>Gaius Marius had been left in obscurity for more<note type="marg">(1) Marius,</note>
than six whole years after his praetorship and had
scarcely the remotest hope of gaining the consulship. It looked as if he would never even be a
candidate for that office. He was now a lieutenant
under Quintus Metellus, who sent him on a furlough
to Rome. There before the Roman People he
accused his own general, an eminent man and one
of our first citizens, of purposely protracting the war
and declared that if they would make him consul,
he would within a short time deliver Jugurtha alive
or dead into the hands of the Roman People. And
so he was elected consul, it is true, but he was a
traitor to his own good faith and to justice; for by a
false charge he subjected to popular disfavour an
exemplary and highly respected citizen, and that
too, although he was his lieutenant and under leave
of absence from him.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="80"/> Evea our kinsman Gratidianus failed on one occa-<note type="marg">(2) Gratidianu</note>


<pb id="p.353"/>

sion to perform what would be a good man's duty:
in his praetorship the tribunes of the people summoned the college of praetors to council, in order
to adopt by joint resolution a standard of value for
our currency; for at that time the value of money
was so fluctuating that no one could tell how much
he was worth. In joint session they drafted an
ordinance, defining the penalty and the methods of
procedure in cases of violation of the ordinance, and
agreed that they should all appear together upon
the rostra in the afternoon to publish it. And while
all the rest withdrew, some in one direction, some
in another, Marius (Gratidianus) went straight from
the council-chamber to the rostra and published
individually what had been drawn up by all together.
And that coup, if you care to know, brought him
vast honour; in every street statues of him were
erected; before these incense and candles burned.
In a word, no one ever enjoyed greater popularity
with the masses.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="81"/> It is such cases as these that sometimes perplex<note type="marg">No material gain can compensate for moral loss.</note>
us in our consideration, when the point in which
justice is violated does not seem so very significant,
but the consequences of such slight transgression
seem exceedingly important. For example, it was not
so very wrong morally, in the eyes of Marius,<note>Gratidianus's</note> to overreach his colleagues and the tribunes in turning to
himself alone all the credit with the people; but to
secure by that means his election to the consulship,
which was then the goal of his ambition,<note>Never attained, however. For his conspicuous position
as a popular leader made him an early mark for Sulla's
proscriptions.</note> seemed
very greatly to his interest. But for all cases we
have one rule, with which I desire you to be perfectly familiar: that which seems expedient must
not be morally wrong; or, if it is morally wrong, it


<pb id="p.355"/>

must not seem expedient. What follows? Can we
account either the great Marius or our Marius Gratidianus a good man? Work out your own ideas and
sift your thoughts so as to see what conception and
idea of a good man they contain. Pray, tell me,
does it coincide with the character of your good man
to lie for his own profit, to slander, to overreach, to
deceive? Nay, verily; anything but that!</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="82"/> Is there, then, any object of such value or any
advantage so worth the winning that, to gain it, one
should sacrifice the name of a <quote>good man</quote> and the
lustre of his reputation? What is there that your
so-called expediency can bring to you that will compensate for what it can take away, if it steals from
you the name of a <quote>good man</quote> and causes you to
lose your sense of honour and justice? For what
difference does it make whether a man is actually
transformed into a beast or whether, keeping the
outward appearance of a man, he has the savage
nature of a beast within?</p>
<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/> Again, when people disregard everything
that is morally right and true, if only they may
secure power thereby, are they not pursuing the
same course as he<note>Pompey, who in 59 married Caesar's daughter Julia,
twenty-four years his junior, and already betrothed to
Caepio.</note> who wished to have as a father-inlaw <note type="marg">(3) Pompey</note> the man by whose effrontery he might gain
power for himself? He thought it advantageous to
secure supreme power while the odium of it fell
upon another; and he failed to see how unjust to
his country this was, and how wrong morally. But<note type="marg">(4) Caesar.</note>
the father-in-law himself used to have continually
upon his lips the Greek verses from the Phoenissae,
which I will reproduce as well as I can&mdash;awkwardly,
it may be, but still so that the meaning can be
understood:

<pb id="p.357"/>

<quote rend="blockquote"><cit><quote><l>If wrong may e'er be right, for a throne's sake</l>
<l>Were wrong most right:&mdash;be God in all else feared!</l></quote><bibl>From A. S. Way's translation.</bibl></cit></quote>

Our tyrant deserved his death for having made an
exception of the one thing that was the blackest
crime of all.<milestone unit="section" n="83"/>  Why do we gather instances of petty
crime&mdash;legacies criminally obtained and fraudulent
buying and selling? Behold, here you have a man
who was ambitious to be king of the Roman People
and master of the whole world; and he achieved it!
The man who maintains that such an ambition is<note type="marg">Even to gain a throne by moral wrong is not expedient.</note>
morally right is a madman; for he justifies the destruction of law and liberty and thinks their hideous
and detestable suppression glorious. But if anyone
agrees that it is not morally right to be kind in a
state that once was free and that ought to be free
now, and yet imagines that it is advantageous for
him who can reach that position, with what remonstrance or rather with what appeal should I try to
tear him away from so strange a delusion? For, oh
ye immortal gods! can the most horrible and hideous
of all murders&mdash;that of fatherland&mdash;bring advantage
to anybody, even though he who has committed
such a crime receives from his enslaved fellow-citizens the title of <quote>Father of his Country</quote>?<note>The title bestowed on Cicero for saving the republic
(in 63) and on Caesar for overthrowing it (after the battle
of Munda, in 45).</note><note type="marg">Identity of expediency and moral rectitude.</note>
Expediency, therefore, must be measured by the
standard of moral rectitude, and in such a way, too,
that these two words shall seem in sound only to be
different but in real meaning to be one and the same.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="84"/> What greater advantage one could have, according
to the standard of popular opinion, than to be a king,
I do not know; when, however, I begin to bring the
question back to the standard of truth, then I find
nothing more disadvantageous for one who has risen to


<pb id="p.359"/>

that height by injustice. For can occasions for worry,
anxiety, fear by day and by night, and a life all beset
with plots and perils be of advantage to anybody?

<quote rend="blockquote"><quote><l>Thrones have many foes and friends untrue,</l>
<l part="I">but few devoted friends,</l></quote></quote>

says Accius. But of what sort of throne was he
speaking? Why, one that was held by right, handed
down from Tantalus and Pelops. Aye, but how many
more foes, think you, had that king who with the
Roman People's army brought the Roman People
themselves into subjection and compelled a state that
not only had been free but had been mistress of the
world to be his slave?<milestone unit="section" n="85"/>  What stains do you think he
had upon his conscience, what scars upon his heart?
But whose life can be advantageous to himself, if that
life is his on the condition that the man who takes it
shall be held in undying gratitude and glory? But
if these things which seem so very advantageous are
not advantageous because they are full of shame and
moral wrong, we ought to be quite convinced that
nothing can be expedient that is not morally right.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="86"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/> And yet this very question has been decided <note type="marg">Apparent conflicts between expediency and moral rectitude: (1) Fabricius and the deserter,</note> on many occasions before and since; but in
the war with Pyrrhus the decision rendered by Gaius
Fabricius, in his second consulship, and by our senate
was particularly striking. Without provocation King
Pyrrhus had declared war upon the Roman People;
the struggle was against a generous and powerful
prince, and the supremacy of power was the prize; a
deserter came over from him to the camp of Fabricius
and promised, if Fabricius would assure him of a reward, to return to the camp of Pyrrhus as secretly as
he had come, administer poison to the king, and bring


<pb id="p.361"/>

about his death. Fabricius saw to it that this fellow
was taken back to Pyrrhus; and his action was commended by the senate. And yet, if the mere show
of expediency and the popular conception of it are
all we want, this one deserter would have put an
end to that wasting war and to a formidable foe of
our supremacy; but it would have been a lasting
shame and disgrace to us to have overcome not by
valour but by crime the man with whom we had a
contest for glory.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="87"/> Which course, then, was more expedient for
Fabricius, who was to our city what Aristides was to
Athens, or for our senate, who never divorced expediency from honour&mdash;to contend against the enemy
with the sword or with poison? If supremacy is to
be sought for the sake of glory, crime should be excluded, for there can be no glory in crime; but if it
is power for its own sake that is sought, whatever
the price, it cannot be expedient if it is linked with
shame.</p>
<p>That well-known measure, therefore, introduced<note type="marg">(2) the senate and the tributary allies,</note>
by Philippus, the son of Quintus, was not expedient.
With the authority of the senate, Lucius Sulla had
exempted from taxation certain states upon receipt
of a lump sum of money from them. Philippus
proposed that they should again be reduced to the
condition of tributary states, without repayment on
our part of the money that they had paid for their
exemption. And the senate accepted his proposal.
Shame upon our government! The pirates' sense of
honour is higher than the senate's. <quote>But,</quote> someone will say, <quote>the revenues were increased, and
therefore it was expedient.</quote> How long will people
venture to say that a thing that is not morally right


<pb id="p.363"/>

can be expedient?<milestone unit="section" n="88"/>  Furthermore, can hatred and
shame be expedient for any government? For
government ought to be founded upon fair fame
and the loyalty of allies.</p>
<p>On this point I often disagreed even with my<note type="marg">(3) Cato and the publicans,</note>
friend Cato; it seemed to me that he was too rigorous in his watchful care over the claims of the
treasury and the revenues; he refused everything
that the farmers of the revenue asked for and much
that the allies desired; whereas, as I insisted, it was
our duty to be generous to the allies and to treat
the publicans as we were accustomed individually to
treat our tenants&mdash;and all the more, because harmony
between the orders was essential to the welfare of
the republic.<note>The publicans, farmers of the revenue, were the moneyed
men of the times, and belonged to the equestrian order. They
purchased from the senate the farming of the revenues and
then sublet their contract to the collectors. Sometimes they
found that they had agreed to pay too high a rate and
petitioned the senate to release them from their contract
or reduce their obligations, as on this occasion (B.C. 61).
The opposition of Cato and others strained the relations
between the senate, who had control of the business, and
the equestrian order, driving many of the equites over to
Caesar's side. Complete harmony between the senate and
the knights, as Cicero says, was the only thing that could
have saved Rome from the popular party and Caesar.</note> Curio, too, was wrong, when he<note type="marg">(4) Curio and the colonies.</note>
pleaded that the demands of the people beyond the
Po were just, but never failed to add, <quote>Let expediency prevail.</quote> He ought rather to have proved
that the claims were not just, because they were
not expedient for the republic, than to have admitted
that they were just, when, as he maintained, they
were not expedient.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="89"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/> The sixth book of Hecaton's <quote>Moral<note type="marg">Hecaton debates the question of expediency <hi rend="italics">vs.</hi> moral rectitude.</note>
Duties</quote> is full of questions like the following: <quote>Is
it consistent with a good man's duty to let his slaves
go hungry when provisions are at famine prices?</quote></p>
<p>Hecaton gives the argument on both sides of the
question; but still in the end it is by the standard of
expediency, as he conceives it, rather than by one of
human feeling, that he decides the question of duty.</p>
<p>Then he raises this question: supposing a man
had to throw part of his cargo overboard in a storm,
should he prefer to sacrifice a high-priced horse or a
cheap and worthless slave? In this case regard for


<pb id="p.365"/>

his property interest inclines him one way, human
feeling the other.</p>
<p><quote>Suppose that a foolish man has seized hold of a
plank from a sinking ship, shall a wise man wrest it
away from him if he can?</quote></p>
<p><quote>No,</quote> says Hecaton; <quote>for that would be unjust.</quote></p>
<p><quote>But how about the owner of the ship? Shall
he take the plank away because it belongs to him?</quote></p>
<p><quote>Not at all; no more than he would be willing
when far out at sea to throw a passenger overboard
on the ground that the ship was his. For until they
reach the place for which the ship is chartered, she
belongs to the passengers, not to the owner.</quote></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="90"/> <quote>Again; suppose there were two to be saved from
the sinking ship&mdash;both of them wise men&mdash;and only
one small plank, should both seize it to save themselves? Or should one give place to the other?</quote></p>
<p><quote>Why of course, one should give place to the
other, but that other must be the one whose life is
more valuable either for his own sake or for that of
his country.</quote></p>
<p><quote>But what if these considerations are of equal
weight in both?</quote></p>
<p><quote>Then there will be no contest, but one will give
place to the other, as if the point were decided by
lot or at a game of odd and even.</quote></p>
<p><quote>Again, suppose a father were robbing temples or
making underground passages to the treasury, should
a son inform the officers of it?</quote></p>
<p><quote>Nay; that were a crime; rather should he defend
his father, in case he were indicted.</quote></p>
<p><quote>Well, then, are not the claims of country paramount to all other duties?</quote></p>


<pb id="p.367"/>

<p><quote>Aye, verily; but it is to our country's interest to
have citizens who are loyal to their parents.</quote></p>
<p><quote>But once more&mdash;if the father attempts to make
himself king, or to betray his country, shall the son
hold his peace?</quote></p>
<p><quote>Nay, verily; he will plead with his father not to
do so. If that accomplishes nothing, he will take
him to task; he will even threaten; and in the end,
if things point to the destruction of the state, he
will sacrifice his father to the safety of his country.</quote></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="91"/> Again, he raises the question: <quote>If a wise man<note type="marg">A similar debate by Diogenes <hi rend="italics">vs.</hi> Antipater.</note>
should inadvertently accept counterfeit money for
good, will he offer it as genuine in payment of a
debt after he discovers his mistake?</quote> Diogenes
says, <quote>Yes</quote>; Antipater, <quote>No,</quote> and I agree with
him.</p>
<p>If a man knowingly offers for sale wine that is
spoiling, ought he to tell his customers? Diogenes
thinks that it is not required; Antipater holds that
an honest man would do so. These are like so
many points of the law disputed among the Stoics.
<quote>In selling a slave, should his faults be declared&mdash;not those only which the seller is bound by the civil
law to declare or have the slave returned to him, but
also the fact that he is untruthful, or disposed to
gamble, or steal, or get drunk?</quote> The one thinks
such facts should be declared, the other does not.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="92"/> <quote>If a man thinks that he is selling brass, when he
is actually selling gold, should an upright man inform
him that his stuff is gold, or go on buying for one
shilling<note>The denarius was worth at this time about nine-pence.</note> what is worth a thousand?</quote></p>
<p>It is clear enough by this time what my views are
on these questions, and what are the grounds of
dispute between the above-named philosophers.</p>


<pb id="p.369"/>

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/> The question arises also whether agreements <note type="marg">Promises not binding: (1) when life or health is at stake,</note> and promises must always be kept, <quote>when,</quote>
in the language of the praetors' edicts, <quote>they have
not been secured through force or criminal fraud.</quote></p>
<p>If one man gives another a remedy for the dropsy,
with the stipulation that, if he is cured by it, he
shall never make use of it again; suppose the
patient's health is restored by the use of it, but some
years later he contracts the same disease once more;
and suppose he cannot secure from the man with
whom he made the agreement permission to use the
remedy again, what should he do? That is the
question. Since the man is unfeeling in refusing
the request, and since no harm could be done to
him by his friend's using the remedy, the sick man

are inexpedient for the persons themselves to whom

story, the sungod promised his son Phaethon to do
for him whatever he should wish. His wish was to
be allowed to ride in his father's chariot. It was
granted. And before he came back to the ground
he was consumed by a stroke of lightning. How
much better had it been, if in his case the father's
promise had not been kept. And what of that
promise, the fulfilment of which Theseus required
from Neptune? When Neptune offered him three
wishes, he wished for the death of his son Hippolytus, because the father was suspicious of the son's
relations with his step-mother. And when this wish
was granted, Theseus was overwhelmed with grief.

that a man who has entrusted money to you proposes

restore the trust? I believe you should not; for

you would be acting against the state, which ought to
be the dearest thing in the world to you. Thus there
are many things which in and of themselves seem
morally right, but which under certain circumstances
prove to be not morally right: to keep a promise, to
abide by an agreement, to restore a trust may, with
a change of expediency, cease to be morally right.</p>

duties from the four sources of moral rectitude, let us
continue the same fourfold division here in pointing
out how hostile to virtue are those courses of conduct which seem to be, but really are not, expedient.
We have discussed wisdom, which cunning seeks to
counterfeit, and likewise justice, which is always
expedient. There remain for our discussion two
divisions of moral rectitude, the one of which is
discernible in the greatness and pre-eminence of a
superior soul, the other, in the shaping and regulation of it by temperance and self-control.</p>

persisted in that pretended madness, seeing that,
notwithstanding his deeds of heroism in the war, he

<milestone unit="section" n="99"/> Nay, for him it had been better to battle not only
with the enemy but also with the waves, as he did,
than to desert Greece when she was united for

<p>But let us leave illustrations both from story and
from foreign lands and turn to real events in our own
history. Marcus Atilius Regulus in his second consulship <note type="marg">(2) the example of Regulus.</note> was taken prisoner in Africa by the stratagem
of Xanthippus, a Spartan general serving under
the command of Hannibal's father Hamilcar.<note>Cicero is careless in his dates. Regulus was consul in
267 and 256. He was defeated and taken prisoner in his
second proconsulship at the battle of Tunes in 255. And the
Hamilcar of 255 was not Hannibal's father, for his career
does not begin until 247, when he was a mere youth, and he
was still in his prime when he fell in battle in Spain, in 229.</note> He
was sent to the senate on parole, sworn to return
to Carthage himself, if certain noble prisoners of
war<note>At the battle of Panormus in 250 Lucius Caecilius
Metellus took among the prisoners no less than thirteen
Carthaginian generals&mdash;all men of noble birth.</note> were not restored to the Carthaginians. When
he came to Rome, he could not fail to see the


<pb id="p.377"/>

specious appearance of expediency, but he decided
that it was unreal, as the outcome proves. His apparent interest was to remain in his own country, to
stay at home with his wife and children, and to
retain his rank and dignity as an ex-consul, regarding
the defeat which he had suffered as a misfortune
that might come to anyone in the game of war.
Who says that this was not expedient? Who, think
you? Greatness of soul and courage say that it was
not.<milestone unit="section" n="100"/>  <milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/> Can you ask for more competent<note type="marg">The violation of his oath could not have been expedient for him.</note>
authorities? The denial comes from those virtues,
for it is characteristic of them to await nothing
with fear, to rise superior to all the vicissitudes of
earthly life, and to count nothing intolerable that
can befall a human being. What, then, did he do?
He came into the senate and stated his mission;
but he refused to give his own vote on the question;
for, he held, he was not a member of the senate so
long as he was bound by the oath sworn to his
enemies. And more than that, he said&mdash;<quote>What a
foolish fellow,</quote> someone will say, <quote>to oppose his
own best interests</quote> &mdash;he said that it was not expedient that the prisoners should be returned; for
they were young men and gallant officers, while he
was already bowed with age. And when his counsel
prevailed, the prisoners were retained and he himself returned to Carthage; affection for his country
and his family failed to hold him back. And even
then he was not ignorant of the fact that he was
going to a most cruel enemy and to exquisite torture;
still, he thought his oath must be sacredly kept.
And so even then, when he was being slowly put
to death by enforced wakefulness, he enjoyed a
happier lot than if he had remained at home an

<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/> People overturn the fundamental principles <note type="marg">Expediency inseparable from moral rectitude.</note> established by Nature, when they divorce

upon what is to him expedient? Or rather, who is
there that does not exert himself to the utmost to
secure it? But because we cannot discover it anywhere except in good report, propriety, and moral
rectitude, we look upon these three for that reason
as the first and the highest objects of endeavour,
while what we term expediency we account not so
much an ornament to our dignity as a necessary
incident to living.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="102"/> <quote>What significance, then,</quote> someone will say, <note type="marg">Arguments against Regulus's fidelity to his oath: (1) he had no need to fear God's wrath,</note>
<quote>do we attach to an oath? It is not that we fear
the wrath of Jove, is it? Not at all; it is the universally accepted view of all philosophers that God
is never angry, never hurtful. This is the doctrine
not only of those<note>The Epicureans.</note> who teach that God is Himself
free from troubling cares and that He imposes no
trouble upon others, but also of those<note>The Stoics.</note> who believe
that God is ever working and ever directing His
world. Furthermore, suppose Jupiter had been


<pb id="p.381"/>

wroth, what greater injury could He have inflicted
upon Regulus than Regulus brought upon himself?
Religious scruple, therefore, had no such preponderance as to outweigh so great expediency.</quote></p>
<p><quote>Or was he afraid that his act would be morally<note type="marg">(2) <quote>Of two evils choose the less,</quote></note>
wrong? As to that, first of all, the proverb says,
'Of evils choose the least.' Did that moral wrong,
then, really involve as great an evil as did that awful
torture? And secondly, there are the lines of Accius:

<quote rend="blockquote"><sp><speaker>Thyestes.</speaker><l>'Hast thou broke thy faith?'</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Atreus.</speaker> <l>None have I giv'n; none give I ever to
the faithless.'</l></sp></quote>

Although this sentiment is put into the mouth of a
wicked king, still it is illuminating in its correctness.</quote></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="103"/> Their third argument is this: just as we maintain<note type="marg">(3) oaths extorted by constraint not binding,</note>
that some things seem expedient but are not, so they
maintain, some things seem morally right but,
are not. <quote>For example,</quote> they contend, <quote>in this
very case it seems morally right for Regulus to have
returned to torture for the sake of being true to his
oath. But it proves not to be morally right, because
what an enemy extorted by force ought not to have
been binding.</quote></p>
<p>As their concluding argument, they add: whatever <note type="marg">(4) exceptional expediency makes right.</note> is highly expedient may prove to be morally
right, even if it did not seem so in advance.</p>
<p>These are in substance the arguments raised
against the conduct of Regulus. Let us consider
them each in turn.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="104"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/> <quote>He need not have been afraid that<note type="marg">Rebuttal.</note>
Jupiter in anger would inflict injury upon him; he
is not wont to be angry or hurtful.</quote></p>

<pb id="p.383"/>

<p>This argument, at all events, has no more weight<note type="marg">(1) An oath is a covenant with Justice and Good Faith;</note>
against Regulus's conduct than it has against the
keeping of any other oath. But in taking an oath
it is our duty to consider not what one may have to
fear in case of violation but wherein its obligation
lies: an oath is an assurance backed by religious
sanctity; and a solemn promise given, as before God
as one's witness, is to be sacredly kept. For the
question no longer concerns the wrath of the gods
(for there is no such thing) but the obligations of
justice and good faith. For, as Ennius says so
admirably:

<quote rend="blockquote"><quote><l>Gracious Good Faith, on wings upborne;</l>
<l>thou oath in Jupiter's great name!</l></quote></quote>

Whoever, therefore, violates his oath violates Good
Faith; and, as we find it stated in Cato's speech, our
forefathers chose that she should dwell upon the
Capitol <quote>neighbour to Jupiter Supreme and Best.</quote></p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="105"/> <quote>But,</quote> objection was further made, <quote>even if<note type="marg">What is evil?</note>
Jupiter had been angry, he could not have inflicted
greater injury upon Regulus than Regulus brought
upon himself.</quote></p>
<p>Quite true, if there is no evil except pain. But
philosophers<note>The Stoics</note> of the highest authority assure us that
pain is not only not the supreme evil but no evil at
all. And pray do not disparage Regulus, as no unimportant witness&mdash;nay, I am rather inclined to
think he was the very best witness&mdash;to the truth of
their doctrine. For what more competent witness
do we ask for than one of the foremost citizens of
Rome, who voluntarily faced torture for the sake of
being true to his moral duty?</p>
<p>Again, they say, <quote>Of evils choose the least</quote>&mdash;


<pb id="p.385"/>

that is, shall one <quote>choose moral wrong rather than<note type="marg">(2) no evil can be greater than moral wrong;</note>
misfortune,</quote> or is there any evil greater than moral
wrong? For if physical deformity excites a certain
amount of aversion, how offensive ought the deformity and hideousness of a demoralized soul to seem!
<milestone unit="section" n="106"/> Therefore, those<note>The Stoics.</note> who discuss these problems with
more rigour make bold to say that moral wrong is
the only evil, while those<note>The Peripatetics.</note> who treat them with
more laxity do not hesitate to call it the supreme
evil.</p>
<p>Once more, they quote the sentiment:

<quote rend="blockquote"><quote><l>None have I given, none give I ever to the faithless.</l></quote></quote></p>

<p>It was proper for the poet to say that, because, when
he was working out his Atreus, he had to make the
words fit the character. But if they mean to adopt
it as a principle, that a pledge given to the faithless
is no pledge, let them look to it that it be not a mere
loophole for perjury that they seek.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="107"/> Furthermore, we have laws regulating warfare, <note type="marg">What is perjury?</note>
and fidelity to an oath must often be observed in
dealings with an enemy: for an oath sworn with the
clear understanding in one's own mind that it should
be performed must be kept; but if there is no such
understanding, it does not count as perjury if one
does not perform the vow. For example, suppose
that one does not deliver the amount agreed upon
with pirates as the price of one's life, that would be
accounted no deception&mdash;not even if one should fail
to deliver the ransom after having sworn to do so;
for a pirate is not included in the number of lawful
enemies, but is the common foe of all the world;
and with him there ought not to be any pledged


<pb id="p.387"/>

word nor any oath mutually binding.<milestone unit="section" n="108"/>  For swearing
to what is false is not necessarily perjury, but to
take an oath <quote>upon your conscience,</quote> as it is expressed in our legal formulas, and then fail to perform it, that is perjury. For Euripides aptly says:

<quote rend="blockquote"><quote><l>My tongue has sworn; the mind I have has sworn no oath.</l></quote></quote>

But Regulus had no right to confound by perjury<note type="marg">Oaths made to an enemy as binding as treaties.</note>
the terms and covenants of war made with an enemy.
For the war was being carried on with a legitimate,
declared enemy; and to regulate our dealings with
such an enemy, we have our whole fetial<note>See Index, s.v.</note> code as
well as many other laws that are binding in common
between nations. Were this not the case, the senate
would never have delivered up illustrious men of
ours in chains to the enemy.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="109"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/> And yet that very thing happened. Titus<note type="marg">Roman strictness.</note>
Veturius and Spurius Postumius in their second consulship lost the battle at the Caudine Forks, and
our legions were sent under the yoke. And because
they made peace with the Samnites, those generals
were delivered up to them, for they had made
the peace without the approval of the people
and senate. And Tiberius Numicius and Quintus
Maelius, tribunes of the people, were delivered up
at the same time, because it was with their sanction
that the peace had been concluded. This was done
in order that the peace with the Samnites might be
annulled. And Postumius, the very man whose delivery was in question, was the proposer and advocate
of the said delivery.</p>
<p>Many years later,<note>184 years, i.e., in B.C. 137.</note> Gaius Mancinus had a similar
experience: he advocated the bill, introduced in


<pb id="p.389"/>

accordance with a decree of the senate by Lucius
Furius and Sextus Atilius, that he should be delivered
up to the Numantines, with whom he had made a
treaty without authorization from the senate; and
when the bill was passed, he was delivered up to the
enemy. His action was more honourable than Quintus Pompey's; Pompey's situation was identical with
his, and yet at his own entreaty the bill was rejected.
In this latter case, apparent expediency prevailed
over moral rectitude; in the former cases, the false
semblance of expediency was overbalanced by the
weight of moral rectitude.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="110"/> <quote>But,</quote> they argued against Regulus, <quote>an oath<note type="marg">(3) the interests of the state higher than personal advantage;</note>
extorted by force ought not to have been binding.</quote>
As if force could be brought to bear upon a brave
man!</p>
<p><quote>Why, then, did he make the journey to the
senate, especially when he intended to plead against
the surrender of the prisoners of war?</quote></p>
<p>Therein you are criticizing what is the noblest
feature of his conduct. For he was not content to
stand upon his own judgment but took up the case,
in order that the judgment might be that of the
senate; and had it not been for the weight of his
pleading, the prisoners would certainly have been
restored to the Carthaginians; and in that case,
Regulus would have remained safe at home in his
country. But because he thought this not expedient
for his country, he believed that it was therefore
morally right for him to declare his conviction and
to suffer for it.</p>
<p>When they argued also that what is highly expedient <note type="marg">(4) nothing expedient unless morally right.</note> may prove to be morally right, they ought
rather to say not that it <quote>may prove to be</quote> but that


<pb id="p.391"/>

it actually is morally right. For nothing can be expedient which is not at the same time morally right;
neither can a thing be morally right just because it
is expedient, but it is expedient because it is morally
right.</p>
<p>From the many splendid examples in history,
therefore, we could not easily point to one either
more praiseworthy or more heroic than the conduct
of Regulus.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="111"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/> But of all that is thus praiseworthy in the<note type="marg">The most striking lesson in the story of Regulus.</note>
conduct of Regulus, this one feature above all others
calls for our admiration: it was he who offered the
motion that the prisoners of war be retained. For
the fact of his returning may seem admirable to us
nowadays, but in those times he could not have done
otherwise. That merit, therefore, belongs to the
age, not to the man. For our ancestors were of
the opinion that no bond was more effective in
guaranteeing good faith than an oath. That is
clearly proved by the laws of the Twelve Tables, by
the <quote>sacred</quote> laws,<note><quote>Sacred</quote> laws, according to Festus (p. 318), were laws
that placed their transgressor, together with his household
and his property, under the ban of some divinity; other
authorities limit the term to the laws enacted upon the
Sacred Mount (B.C. 394).</note> by the treaties in which good
faith is pledged even to the enemy, by the investigations made by the censors and the penalties
imposed by them; for there were no cases in which
they used to render more rigorous decisions than
in cases of violation of an oath.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="112"/> Marcus Pomponius, a tribune of the people, <note type="marg">The sanctity of an oath in the old days.</note>
brought an indictment against Lucius Manlius,
Aulus's son, for having extended the term of his
dictatorship a few days beyond its expiration. He
further charged him with having banished his own
son Titus (afterward surnamed Torquatus) from all
companionship with his fellow-men, and with requiring him to live in the country. When the son, who


<pb id="p.393"/>

was then a young man, heard that his father was
in trouble on his account, he hastened to Rome&mdash;
so the story goes&mdash;and at daybreak presented himself at the house of Pomponius. The visitor was
announced to Pomponius. Inasmuch as he thought
that the son in his anger meant to bring him some
new evidence to use against the father, he arose
from his bed, asked all who were present to leave
the room, and sent word to the young man to come
in. Upon entering, he at once drew a sword and
swore that he would kill the tribune on the spot, if
he did not swear an oath to withdraw the suit against
his father. Constrained by the terror of the situation, Pomponius gave his oath. He reported the
matter to the people, explaining why he was obliged
to drop the prosecution, and withdrew his suit against
Manlius. Such was the regard for the sanctity of
an oath in those days.</p>
<p>And that lad was the Titus Manlius who in the
battle on the Anio killed the Gaul by whom he had
been challenged to single combat, pulled off his
torque and thus won his surname. And in his third
consulship he routed the Latins and put them to
flight in the battle on the Veseris. He was one of
the greatest of the great, and one who, while more
than generous toward his father, could yet be
bitterly severe toward his son.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="113"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/> Now, as Regulus deserves praise for<note type="marg">Contrast between Regulus and the ten envoys from Hannibal.</note>
being true to his oath, so those ten whom Hannibal
sent to the senate on parole after the battle of
Cannae deserve censure, if it is true that they did not
return; for they were sworn to return to the camp
which had fallen into the hands of the Carthaginians,
if they did not succeed in negotiating an exchange


<pb id="p.395"/>

of prisoners. Historians are not in agreement in
regard to the facts. Polybius, one of the very best
authorities, states that of the ten eminent nobles
who were sent at that time, nine returned when
their mission failed at the hands of the senate. But
one of the ten, who, a little while after leaving the
camp, had gone back on the pretext that he had
forgotten something or other, remained behind at
Rome; he explained that by his return to the camp
he was released from the obligation of his oath.
He was wrong; for deceit does not remove the guilt
of perjury&mdash;it merely aggravates it. His cunning
that impudently tried to masquerade as prudence<note type="marg">The ancient Roman discipline.</note>
was, therefore, only folly. And so the senate
ordered that the cunning scoundrel should be taken
back to Hannibal in chains.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="114"/> But the most significant part of the story is this:
the eight thousand prisoners in Hannibal's hands
were not men that he had taken in the battle or that
had escaped in the peril of their lives, but men that
the consuls Paulus and Varro had left behind in
camp. Though these might have been ransomed
by a small sum of money, the senate voted not to
redeem them, in order that our soldiers might have
the lesson planted in their hearts that they must
either conquer or die. When Hannibal heard this
news, according to that same writer, he lost heart
completely, because the senate and the people of
Rome displayed courage so lofty in a time of disaster.
Thus apparent expediency is outweighed when
placed in the balance against moral rectitude.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="115"/> Gaius Acilius, on the other hand, the author of a
history of Rome in Greek, says that there were
several who played the same trick of returning to


<pb id="p.397"/>

the camp to release themselves thus from the obligation of their oath, and that they were branded by
the censors with every mark of disgrace.</p>
<p>Let this be the conclusion of this topic. For it<note type="marg">Expediency and Courage identical.</note>
must be perfectly apparent that acts that are done with a cowardly, craven, abject, broken spirit, as the
act of Regulus would have been if he had supported
in regard to the prisoners a measure that seemed to
be advantageous for him personally, but disadvantageous for the state, or if he had consented to
remain at home&mdash;that such acts are not expedient,
because they are shameful, dishonourable, and immoral.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="116"/> <milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/> We have still left our fourth division, <note type="marg">Apparent Expediency <hi rend="italics">vs.</hi> Temperance.</note>
comprising propriety, moderation, temperance, selfrestraint, self-control.</p>
<p>Can anything be expedient, then, which is contrary to such a chorus of virtues? And yet the
Cyrenaics, adherents of the school of Aristippus,
and the philosophers who bear the name of Anniceris find all good to consist in pleasure and consider
virtue praiseworthy only because it is productive of
pleasure. Now that these schools are out of date,
Epicurus has come into vogue&mdash;an advocate and
supporter of practically the same doctrine. Against
such a philosophy we must fight it out <quote>with horse
and foot,</quote> as the saying is, if our purpose is to
defend and maintain our standard of moral rectitude.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="117"/> For if, as we find it in the writings of Metrodorus,<note type="marg">The fallacy of Epicureanism.</note>
not only expediency but happiness in life depends
wholly upon a sound physical constitution and the

sound, then that expediency&mdash;and, what is more,
the highest expediency, as they estimate it&mdash;will


<pb id="p.399"/>

assuredly clash with moral rectitude. For, first of all,
what position will wisdom occupy in that system?
The position of collector of pleasures from every
possible source? What a sorry state of servitude
for a virtue&mdash;to be pandering to sensual pleasure!
And what will be the function of wisdom? To make
skilful choice between sensual pleasures? Granted
that there may be nothing more pleasant, what can
be conceived more degrading for wisdom than such
a r&ocirc;le?</p>
<p>Then again, if anyone hold that pain is the
supreme evil, what place in his philosophy has fortitude, which is but indifference to toil and pain?
For, however many passages there are in which
Epicurus speaks right manfully of pain, we must
nevertheless consider not what he says, but what it
is consistent for a man to say who has defined the
good in terms of pleasure and evil in terms of pain.</p>
<p>And further, if I should listen to him, I should
find that in many passages he has a great deal to say
about temperance and self-control; but <quote>the water
will not run,</quote> as they say. For how can he commend self-control and yet posit pleasure as the
supreme good? For self-control is the foe of the
passions, and the passions are the handmaids of
pleasure.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="118"/> And yet when it comes to these three cardinal<note type="marg">Epicureanism and the Cardinal Virtues.</note>
virtues, those philosophers shift and turn as best
they can, and not without cleverness. They admit
wisdom into their system as the knowledge that
provides pleasures and banishes pain; they clear the
way for fortitude also in some way to fit in with
their doctrines, when they teach that it is a rational
means for looking with indifference upon death and


<pb id="p.401"/>

for enduring pain. They bring even temperance in
&mdash;not very easily, to be sure, but still as best they can;
for they hold that the height of pleasure is found
in the absence of pain. Justice totters or rather, I
should say, lies already prostrate; so also with all
those virtues which are discernible in social life and
the fellowship of human society. For neither goodness nor generosity nor courtesy can exist, any more
than friendship can, if they are not sought of and
for themselves, but are cultivated only for the sake
of sensual pleasure or personal advantage.</p>
<p>Let us now recapitulate briefly.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="119"/> As I have shown that such expediency as is opposed<note type="marg">Sensual pleasure and moral rectitude incompatible.</note>
to moral rectitude is no expediency, so I maintain
that any and all sensual pleasure is opposed to moral
rectitude. And therefore Calliphon and Dinomachus,
in my judgment, deserve the greater condemnation;
they imagined that they should settle the controversy by coupling pleasure with moral rectitude; as
well yoke a man with a beast! But moral rectitude
does not accept such a union; she abhors it, spurns
it. Why, the supreme good, which ought to be
simple, cannot be a compound and mixture of absolutely contradictory qualities. But this theory I have
discussed more fully in another connection; for the
subject is a large one. Now for the matter before
us.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="120"/> We have, then, fully discussed the problem how a
question is to be decided, if ever that which seems
to be expediency clashes with moral rectitude. But
if, on the other hand, the assertion is made that
pleasure admits of a show of expediency also, there
can still be no possible union between it and moral
rectitude. For, to make the most generous admission


<pb id="p.403"/>

we can in favour of pleasure, we will grant that it
may contribute something that possibly gives some
spice to life, but certainly nothing that is really expedient.</p>
<p><milestone unit="section" n="121"/> Herewith, my son Marcus, you have a present<note type="marg">Conclusion.</note>
from your father&mdash;a generous one, in my humble
opinion; but its value will depend upon the spirit in
which you receive it. And yet you must welcome
these three books as fellow-guests, so to speak, along
with your notes on Cratippus's lectures. But as you
would sometimes give ear to me also, if I had come
to Athens (and I should be there now, if my country
had not called me back with accents unmistakable,
when I was half-way there), so you will please devote
as much time as you can to these volumes, for in
them my voice will travel to you; and you can
devote to them as much time as you will. And
when I see that you take delight in this branch of
philosophy, I shall then talk further with you&mdash;at
an early date,<note>But Cicero never saw his son Marcus again.</note> I hope, face to face-but as long as
you are abroad, I shall converse with you thus at a
distance.</p>
<p>Farewell, my dear Cicero, and be assured that,
while you are the object of my deepest affection, you
will be dearer to me still, if you find pleasure in
such counsel and instruction.</p>
