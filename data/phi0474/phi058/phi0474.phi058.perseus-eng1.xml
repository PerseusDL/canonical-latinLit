              anchored="true">Quintus Cicero was praetor in <date when="-0062">B.C. 62</date>. In
                <date when="-0061">B.C. 61</date> (March) he went out to "<placeName
                key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>" as propraetor; his first year of office would be
              up in March, <date when="-0060">B.C. 60</date>, but his governorship was, as was very
              common, extended till March, <date when="-0059">B.C. 59</date>. Towards the end of
                <date when="-0060">B.C. 60</date> the senate seems to have arranged not to appoint
              his successor, that is, he would be left in office till about March, <date
                when="-0058">B.C. 58</date>. It is in view of this third year of office that Cicero
              writes this essay-letter to him on the duties of a provincial governor. Apparently
              Quintus bad faults of temper which had caused some scandals to reach <placeName
                key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. We have seen how he was one of the few who
              managed to quarrel with <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticus;</foreign> and in <date
                when="-0048">B.C. 48</date> we shill find how fiercely he resented the exercise of
              his brother's influence which had led him to take the losing side, which from his
              attachment to Caesar he may have been half inclined to think the wrong side. His
              constant squabbles with his wife (though the fault was evidently in great part hers)
              also go towards forming our conclusion about him that, with some ability and honesty,
              he was <foreign xml:lang="fr">un peu difficile</foreign>.</note> and even common
            rumour, with its usual speed, will anticipate this letter, and that you will already
            have heard from others that a third year has been added to my loss and your labour, yet
            I thought you ought to receive from me also the news of this tiresome circumstance. For
            not in one, but in several of my previous letters, in spite of others having given up
            the idea in despair, I gave you hope of being able at an early date to quit your
            province, not only that I might as <pb n="71"/> long as possible cheer you with a
            pleasurable belief, but also because I and the praetors took such pains in the matter,
            that I felt no misgiving as to the possibility of its being arranged. As it is, since
            matters have so turned out that neither the praetors by the weight of their influence,
            nor I by my earnest efforts, have been able to prevail, it is certainly difficult not to
            be annoyed, yet our minds, practised as they are in conducting and supporting business
            of the utmost gravity, ought not to be crushed or weakened by vexation. And since men
            ought to feel most vexed at what has been brought upon them by their own fault, it is I
            who ought in this matter to be more vexed than you. For it is the result of a fault on
            my part, against which you had protested both in conversation at the moment of your
            departure, and in letters since, that your successor was not named last year. In this,
            while consulting for the interests of our allies, and resisting the shameless conduct of
            some merchants, and while seeking the increase of our reputation by your virtues, I
            acted unwisely, especially as I made it possible for that second year to entail a third.
            And as I confess the mistake to have been mine, it lies with your wisdom and kindness to
            remedy it, and to see that my imprudence is turned to advantage by your careful
            performance of your duties. And truly, if you exert yourself in every direction to earn
            men's good word, not with a view to rival others, but henceforth to surpass yourself, if
            you rouse your whole mind and your every thought and care to the ambition of gaining a
            superior reputation in all respects, believe me, one year added to your labour will
            bring us, nay, our posterity also, a joy of many years' duration. Wherefore I begin by
            entreating you not to let your soul shrink and be cast down, nor to allow yourself to be
            overpowered by the magnitude of the business as though by a wave; but, on the contrary,
            to stand upright and keep your footing, or even advance to meet the flood of affairs.
            For you are not administering a department of the state, in which fortune reigns
            supreme, but one in which a well-considered policy and an attention to business are the
            most important things. But if I had seen you receiving the prolongation of a command in
            a great and dangerous war, I should have trembled in spirit, because I should have <pb
              n="72"/> known that the dominion of fortune over us had been at the same time
            prolonged. As it is, however, a department of the state has been entrusted to you in
            which fortune occupies no part, or, at any rate, an insignificant one, and which appears
            to me to depend entirely on your virtue and self-control. We have no reason to fear, as
            far as I know, any designs of our enemies, any actual fighting in the field, any revolts
            of allies, any default in the tribute or in the supply of corn, any mutiny in the army:
            things which have very often befallen the wisest of men in such a way, that they have
            been no more able to get the better of the assault of been granted profound peace, a
            dead calm: yet if the pilot fortune, than the best of pilots a violent tempest. You have
            falls asleep, it may even so overwhelm him, though if he keeps awake it may give him
            positive pleasure. For your province consists, in the first place, of allies of a race
            which; of all the world, is the most civilized; and, in the second place, of Citizens,
            who, either as being <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign> are very closely
            connected with me, or, as being traders who have made money, think that they owe the
            security of their property to my consulship. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But it
            may be said that among even such men as these there occur serious disputes, many
            wrongful acts are committed, and hotly contested litigation is the result. As though I
            ever thought that you had no trouble to contend with! I know that the trouble is
            exceedingly great, and such as demands the very greatest prudence; but remember that it
            is prudence much more than fortune on which, in my opinion, the result of your trouble
            depends. For what trouble is it to govern those over whom you are set, if you do but
            govern yourself? That may be a great and difficult task to others, and indeed it is most
            difficult: to you it has always been the easiest thing in the world, and indeed ought to
            be so, for your natural disposition is such that, even without discipline, it appears
            capable of self-control; whereas a discipline has, in fact, been applied that might
            educate the most faulty of characters. But while you resist, as you do, money, pleasure,
            and every kind of desire yourself, there will, I am to be told, be a risk of your not
            being able to suppress some fraudulent banker or some rather over-extortionate
            tax-collector! For as to the Greeks, they will think, as they behold the innocence of
              <pb n="73"/> your life, that one of the heroes of their history, or a demigod from
            heaven, has come down into the province. And this I say, not to induce you to act thus,
            but to make you glad that you are acting or have acted so. It is a splendid thing to
            have been three years in supreme power in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>
            without allowing statue, picture, plate, napery, slave, anyone's good looks, or any
            offer of money—all of which are plentiful in your province—to cause you to swerve from
            the most absolute honesty and purity of life. What can be imagined so striking or so
            desirable as that a virtue, a command over the passions, a self-control such as yours,
            are not remaining in darkness and obscurity, but have been set in the broad daylight of
              <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, before the eyes of a famous province,
            and in the hearing of all nations and peoples? That the inhabitants are not being ruined
            by your progresses, drained by your charges, agitated by your approach? That there is
            the liveliest joy, public and private, wheresoever you come, the city regarding you as a
            protector and not a tyrant, the private house as a guest and not a plunderer? <milestone
              unit="section" n="3"/></p>
          <p>But in these matters I am sure that mere experience has by this time taught you that it
            is by no means sufficient to have these virtues yourself, but that you must keep your
            eyes open and vigilant, in order that in the guardianship of your province you may be
            considered to vouch to the allies, the citizens, and the state, not for yourself alone,
            but for all the subordinates of your government. However, you have in the persons of
            your <foreign xml:lang="la">legati</foreign> men likely to have a regard for their own
            reputation. Of these in rank, position, and age Tubero is first; who, I think,
            particularly as he is a writer of history, could select from his own Annals many whom he
            would like and would be able to imitate. Allienus, again, is ours, as well in heart and
            affection, as in his conformity to our principles. I need not speak of Gratidius: I am
            sure that, while taking pains to preserve his own reputation, his fraternal affection
            for us makes him take pains for ours also. <note n="1" anchored="true">Of the persons
              mentioned, L. Aelius <foreign xml:lang="la">Tubero</foreign> is elsewhere praised as a
              man of learning (<bibl n="Cic. Lig. 10">pro Lig. § 10</bibl>); A. Allienus (praetor
                <date when="-0049">B.C. 49</date>) was a friend and Correspondent; M. Gratidius is
              mentioned in <bibl n="Cic. Flac. 49">pro Flacco, § 49</bibl>, as acting in a judicial
              capacity, and was perhaps a cousin of Cicero's. </note> Your quaestor is not of your
            own selection, but the one assigned you by lot. He is bound both to act with propriety
              <pb n="74"/> of his own accord, and to conform to the policy and principles which you
            lay down. But should any one of these adopt a lower standard of conduct, you should
            tolerate such behaviour, if it goes no farther than a breach, in his private capacity,
            of the rules by which he was bound, but not if it goes to the extent of employing for
            gain the authority which you granted him as a promotion. For I am far from thinking,
            especially since the moral sentiments of the day are so much inclined to excessive
            laxity and self-seeking, that you should investigate every case of petty misconduct, and
            thoroughly examine every one of these persons; but that you should regulate your
            confidence by the trustworthiness of its recipient. And among such persons you will have
            to vouch for those whom the Republic has itself given you as companions and assistants
            in public affairs, at least within the limits which I have before laid down. <milestone
              unit="section" n="4"/></p>
          <p>In the case, however, of those of your personal staff or official attendants whom you
            have yourself selected to be about you—who are usually spoken of as a kind of praetor's
            cohort—we must vouch, not only for their acts, but even for their words. But those you
            have with you are the sort of men of whom you may easily be fond when they are acting
            rightly, and whom you may very easily check when they show insufficient regard for your
            reputation. By these, when you were raw to the work, your frank disposition might
            possibly have been deceived—for the better a man is the less easily does he suspect
            others of being bad—now, however, let this third year witness an integrity as perfect as
            the two former, but still more wary and vigilant. Listen to that only which you are
            supposed to listen to; don't let your ears be open to whispered falsehoods and
            interested suggestions. Don't let your signet ring be a mere implement, but, as it were,
            your second self: not the minister of another's will, but a witness of your own. Let
            your marshal hold the rank which our ancestors wished him to hold, who, looking upon
            this place as not one of profit, but of labour and duty, scarcely ever conferred it upon
            any but their freedmen, whom they indeed controlled almost as absolutely as their
            slaves. Let the lictor be the dispenser of your clemency, not his own; and let the
            fasces and axes which they carry before you constitute ensigns rather of rank than of
            power. Let it, in fact, <pb n="75"/> be known to the whole province that the life,
            children, fame, and fortunes of all over whom you preside are exceedingly dear to you.
            Finally, let it be believed that you will, if you detect it, be hostile not only to
            those who have accepted a bribe, but to those also who have given it. And, indeed, no
            one will give anything, if it is made quite clear that nothing is usually obtained from
            you through those who pretend to be very influential with you. Not, however, that the
            object of this discourse is to make you over-harsh or suspicious towards your staff. For
            if any of them in the course of the last two years has never fallen under suspicion of
            rapacity, as I am told about Caesius and Chaerippus and Labeo—and think it true, because
            I know them—there is no authority, I think, which may not be entrusted to them, and no
            confidence which may not be placed in them with the utmost propriety, and in anyone else
            like them. But if there is anyone of whom you have already had reason to doubt, or
            concerning whom you have made some discovery, in such a man place no confidence, intrust
            him with no particle of your reputation. V. If, however, you have found in the province
            itself anyone, hitherto unknown to us, who has made his way into intimacy with you, take
            care how much confidence you repose in him; not that there may not be many good
            provincials, but, though we may hope so, it is risky to be positive. For everyone's real
            character is covered by many wrappings of pretence and is concealed by a kind of veil:
            face, eyes, expression very often lie, speech most often of all. Wherefore, how can you
            expect to find in that class <note n="1" anchored="true">The class of Romans who have
              practically become provincials. </note> any who, while foregoing for the sake of money
            all from which we can scarcely tear ourselves away, <note n="2" anchored="true"
                ><placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and its society and interests.
            </note> will yet love you sincerely and not merely pretend to do so from interested
            motives? I think, indeed, it is a hard task to find such men, especially if we notice
            that the same persons care nothing for almost any man out of office, yet always with one
            consent show affection for the praetors. But of this class, if by chance you have
            discovered any one to be fonder of you—for it may so happen—than of your office, such a
            man indeed gladly admit upon <pb n="76"/> your list of friends: but if you fail to
            perceive that, there is no Class of people you must be more on your guard against
            admitting to intimacy, just because they are acquainted with all the ways of making
            money, do everything for the sake of it, and have no consideration for the reputation of
            a man with whom they are not destined to pass their lives. And even among the Greeks
            themselves you must be on your guard against admitting close intimacies, except in the
            case of the very few, if such are to be found, who are worthy of ancient <placeName
              key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>. As things now stand, indeed, too many of them
            are untrustworthy, false, and schooled by long servitude in the arts of extravagant
            adulation. My advice is that these men should all be entertained with courtesy, but that
            close ties of hospitality or friendship should only be formed with the best of them:
            excessive intimacies with them are not very trustworthy—for they do not venture to
            oppose our wishes—and they are not only jealous of our countrymen, but of their own as
            well. VI. And now, considering the caution and care that I would show in matters of this
            kind—in which I fear I may be somewhat over-severe—what do you suppose my sentiments are
            in regard to slaves? Upon these we ought to keep a hold in all places, but especially in
            the provinces. On this head many rules may be laid down, but this is at once the
            shortest and most easily maintained—that they should behave during your progresses in
              <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> as though you were travelling on the
            Appian way, and not suppose that it makes any difference whether they have arrived at
              <placeName key="tgn,7002359">Tralles</placeName> or <placeName key="perseus,Formiae"
              >Formiae</placeName>. But if, again, any one of your slaves is conspicuously
            trustworthy, employ him in your domestic and private affairs; but in affairs pertaining
            to your office as governor, or in any department of the state, do not let him lay a
            finger. For many things which may, with perfect propriety, be in-trusted to slaves, must
            yet not be so entrusted, for the sake of avoiding talk and hostile remark. But my
            discourse, I know not how, has slipped into the didactic vein, though that is not what I
            proposed to myself originally. For what right have I to be laying down rules for one
            who, I am fully aware, in this subject especially, is not my inferior in wisdom, while
            in experience he is even my superior? Yet, after all, if your actions had the additional
            weight of my approval, I <pb n="77"/> thought that they would seem more satisfactory to
            yourself. Wherefore, let these be the foundations on which your public character rests:
            first and foremost your own honesty and self-control, then the scrupulous conduct of all
            your staff, the exceedingly cautious and careful selection in regard to intimacies with
            provincials and Greeks, the strict and unbending government of your slaves. These are
            creditable even in the conduct of our private and everyday business: in such an
            important government, where morals are so debased and the province has such a corrupting
            influence, they must needs seem divine. Such principles and conduct on your part are
            sufficient to justify the strictness which you have displayed in some acts of
            administration, owing to which I have encountered certain personal disputes with great
            satisfaction, unless, indeed, you suppose me to be annoyed by the complaints of a fellow
            like Paconius—who is not even a Greek, but in reality a Mysian or Phrygian—or by the
            words of Tuscenius, a madman and a knave, from whose abominable jaws you snatched the
            fruits of a most infamous piece of extortion with the most complete justice. <milestone
              unit="section" n="7"/></p>
          <p>These and similar instances of your strict administration in your province we shall
            find difficulty in justifying, unless they are accompanied by the most perfect
            integrity: wherefore let there be the greatest strictness in your administration of
            justice, provided only that it is never varied from favour, but is kept up with
            impartiality. But it is of little avail that justice is administered by yourself with
            impartiality and care, unless the same is done by those to whom you have entrusted any
            portion of this duty. And, indeed, in my view there is no very great variety of business
            in the government of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>: the entire province
            mainly depends on the administration of justice. In it we have the whole theory of
            government, especially of provincial government, clearly displayed: all that a governor
            has to do is to show consistency and firmness enough, not only td resist favouritism,
            but even the suspicion of it. To this also must be added courtesy in listening to
            pleaders, consideration in pronouncing a decision, and painstaking efforts to convince
            suitors of its justice, and to answer their arguments. It is by such habits that C.
            Octavius has recently made himself <pb n="78"/> very popular; <note n="1"
              anchored="true">Father of Augustus, governor of <placeName key="tgn,7006667"

              to his praetorship (<date when="-0061">B.C. 61</date>) at <placeName
                key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; at any rate, as well as to his conduct in

            first time, <note n="2" anchored="true">Reading <foreign xml:lang="la">primum</foreign>;
              others <foreign xml:lang="la">primus</foreign>, "his head <foreign xml:lang="la"

            silence, while every suitor spoke as often and as long as he chose. In which conduct he
            would perhaps have been thought over-lax, had it not been that this laxity enabled him
            to maintain the following in stance of severity. The partisans of Sulla were forced to
            restore what they had taken by violence and terrorism. Those who had made inequitable
            decrees; while in office, were now as private citizens forced to submit to the
            principles they had established. This strictness on his part would have been thought
            harsh, had it not been rendered palatable by many sweetening influences of courtesy. But
            if this gentleness was sufficient to make him popular at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
              >Rome</placeName>, where there is such haughtiness of spirit, such unrestrained
            liberty, such unlimited licence of individuals, and, in fine, so many magistrates, so
            many means of obtaining protection, such vast power in the hands of the popular
            assembly, and such influence exercised by the senate, how welcome must a praetor's
            courtesy be in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, in which there is such a
            numerous body of citizens and allies, so many cities, so many communities, all hanging
            on one man's nod, and in which there are no means of protection, no one to whom to make
            a complaint, no senate, no popular assembly! Wherefore it requires an exalted character,
            a man who is not only equitable from natural impulse, but who has also been trained by
            study and the refinements of a liberal education, so to conduct himself while in the
            possession of such immense power, that those over whom he rules should not feel the want
            of any other power. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/></p>
          <p>Take the case of the famous Cyrus, portrayed by Xenophon, not as an historical
            character, but as a model of righteous government, the serious dignity of whose
            character is represented by that philosopher as combined with a peculiar courtesy. And,
            indeed, it is not without reason that our hero Africanus used perpetually to have those
            books in his hands, for there is no duty pertaining to a careful and equitable governor
            which is not to be found in them. Well, if he <pb n="79"/> cultivated those qualities,
            though never destined to be in a private station, how carefully ought those to maintain
            them to whom power is given with the understanding that it must be surrendered, and
            given by laws under whose authority they must once more come? In my opinion all who
            govern others are bound to regard as the object of all their actions the greatest
            happiness of the governed. That this is your highest object, and has been so since you
            first landed in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, has been published abroad
            by Consistent rumour and the conversation of all. It is, let me add, not only the duty
            of one who governs allies and citizens, but even of one who governs slaves and dumb
            animals, to serve the interests and advantage of those under him. In this point I notice
            that everyone agrees that you take the greatest pains: no new debt is being contracted
            by the states, while many have been relieved by you from a heavy and long-standing one.
            Several cities that had become dilapidated and almost deserted—of which one was the most
            famous state in <placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName>, the other in <placeName
              key="tgn,7002358">Caria</placeName>, Samus and Halicarnassus—have been given a new
            life by you: there is no party fighting, no civil strife in the towns: you take care
            that the government of the states is administered by the best class of citizens:
            brigandage is abolished in <placeName key="tgn,7016748">Mysia</placeName>; murder
            suppressed in many districts; peace is established throughout the province; and not only
            the robberies usual on highways and in country places, but those more numerous and more
            serious ones in towns and temples, have been completely stopped: the fame, fortunes, and
            repose of the rich have been relieved of that most oppressive instrument of praetorial
            rapacity-vexatious prosecution; the expenses and tribute of the states are made to fall
            with equal weight on all who live in the territories of those states: access to you is
            as easy as possible: your ears are open to the complaints of all: no man's want of means
            or want of friends excludes him, I don't say from access to you in public and on the
            tribunal, but -even from your house and chamber: in a word, throughout your government
            there is no harshness or cruelty-everywhere clemency, mildness, and kindness reign
            supreme. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/></p>
          <p>What an immense benefit, again, have you done in having liberated <placeName
              key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> from the tribute exacted by the aediles, a measure
            which cost me some violent controversies! For <pb n="80"/> if one of our nobles
            complains openly that by your edict, "No moneys shall be voted for the games," you have
            robbed him of 200 sestertia, what a vast sum of money would have been paid, had a grant
            been made to the Credit of every magistrate who held games, as had become the regular
            custom! However, I stopped these Complaints by taking up this position—what they think
            of it in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> I don't know, in <placeName
              key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> it meets with no little approval and praise—I
            refused to accept a sum of money which the states had decreed for a temple and monument
            in our honour, though they had done so with the greatest enthusiasm in view both of my
            services and of your most valuable benefactions; and though the law contained a special
            and distinct exception in these words, "that it was lawful to receive for temple or
            monument"; and though again the money was not going to be thrown away, but would be
            employed on decorating a temple, and would thus appear to have been given to the Roman
            people and gift in its favour, I determined that I must not accept it, for the immortal
            Gods rather than to myself—yet, in spite of its having desert, law, and the wishes of
            those who offered the this reason among others, namely, to prevent those, to whom such
            an honour was neither due nor legal, from being jealous. Wherefore adhere with all your
            heart and soul to the policy which you have hitherto adopted—that of being devoted to
            those whom the senate and people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> have
            committed and entrusted to your honour and authority, of doing your best to protect
            them, and of desiring their greatest happiness. Even if the lot had made you governor of
            Africans, or Spaniards, or Gauls—uncivilized and barbarous nations—it would still have
            been your duty as a man of feeling to consult for their interests and advantage, and to
            have contributed to their safety. But when we rule over a race of men in which
            civilization not only exists, but from which it is believed to have spread to others, we
            are bound to repay them, above all things, what we received from them. For I shall not
            be ashamed to go so far—especially as my life and achievements have been such as to
            exclude any suspicion of sloth or frivolity—as to confess that, whatever I have
            accomplished, I have accomplished by means of those studies and principles which have
            been transmitted to us in Greek literature and schools of thought. Wherefore, over and
            above the <pb n="81"/> general good faith which is due to all men, I think we are in a
            special sense under an obligation to that nation, to put in practice what it has taught
            us among the very men by whose maxims we have been brought out of barbarism. <milestone

          <p>And indeed Plato, the fountain-head of genius and learning, thought that states would
            only be happy when scholars and philosophers began being their rulers, or when those who
            were their rulers had devoted all their attention to learning and philosophy. It was
            plainly this union of power and philosophy that in his opinion might prove the salvation
            of states. And this perhaps has at length fallen to the fortune of the whole empire:
            certainly it has in the present instance to your province, to have a man in supreme
            power in it, who has from boyhood spent the chief part of his zeal and time in imbibing
            the principles of philosophy, virtue, and humanity. Wherefore be careful that this third
            year, which has been added to your labour, may be thought a prolongation of prosperity
            to <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>. And since <placeName key="tgn,1000004"
              >Asia</placeName> was more fortunate in retaining you than I was in my endeavour to
            bring you back, see that my regret is softened by the exultation of the province. For if
            you have displayed the very greatest activity in earning honours such as, I think, have
            never been paid to anyone else, much greater ought your activity to be in preserving
            these honours. What I for my part think of honours of that kind I have told you in
            previous letters. I have always regarded them, if given indiscriminately, as of little
            value, if paid from interested motives, as worthless: if, however, as in this case, they
            are tributes to solid services on your part, I hold you bound to take much pains in
            preserving them. Since, then, you are exercising supreme power and official authority in
            cities, in which you have before your eyes the consecration and apotheosis of your
            virtues, in all decisions, decrees, and official acts consider what you owe to those
            warm opinions entertained of you, to those verdicts on your character, to those honours
            which have been rendered you. And what you owe will be to consult for the interests of
            all, to remedy men's misfortunes, to provide for their safety, to resolve that you will
            be both called and believed to be the "father of <placeName key="tgn,1000004"
              >Asia</placeName>." <milestone unit="section" n="11"/></p>
          <p>However, to such a resolution and deliberate policy on your part the great obstacle are
            the <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign>: for, if <pb n="82"/> we oppose them, we
            shall alienate from ourselves and from the Republic an order which has done us most
            excellent service, and which has been brought into sympathy with the Republic by our
            means; if, on the other hand, we comply with them in every case, we shall allow the
            complete ruin of those whose interests, to say nothing of their preservation, we are
            bound to consult. This is the one difficulty, if we look the thing fairly in the face,
            in your whole government. For disinterested conduct on one's own part, the suppression
            of all inordinate desires, the keeping a check upon one's staff, courtesy in hearing
            causes, in listening to and admitting suitor—all this is rather a question of credit
            than of difficulty: for it does not depend on any special exertion, but rather on a
            mental resolve and inclination. But how much bitterness of feeling is caused to allies
            by that question of the <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign> we have had reason to
            know in the case of citizens who, when recently urging the removal of the port-dues in
              <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, did not complain so much of the dues
            themselves, as of certain extortionate conduct on the part of the collectors. Wherefore,
            after hearing the grievances of citizens in <placeName key="tgn,1000080"
              >Italy</placeName>, I can comprehend what happens to allies in distant lands. To
            conduct oneself in this matter in such a way as to satisfy the <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >publicani</foreign> especially when contracts have been undertaken at a loss, and yet
            to preserve the allies from ruin, seems to demand a virtue with something divine in it,
            I mean a virtue like yours. To begin with, that they are subject to tax at all, which is
            their greatest grievance, ought not to be thought so by the Greeks, because they were so
            subject by their own laws without the Roman government. Again, they cannot despise the
            word <foreign xml:lang="la">publicanus</foreign>, for they have been unable to pay the
            assessment according to Sulla's poll-tax without the aid of the publican. But that Greek
              <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign> are not more considerate in exacting the
            payment of taxes than our own may be gathered from the fact that the Caunii, and all the
            islands assigned to the Rhodians by Sulla, recently appealed to the protection of the
            senate, and petitioned to be allowed to pay their tax to us rather than to the Rhodians.
            Wherefore neither ought those to revolt at the name of a <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >publicanus</foreign> who have always been subject to tax, nor those to despise it who
            have been unable to make up the tribute by themselves, <pb n="83"/> nor those to refuse
            his services who have asked for them. At the same time let <placeName key="tgn,1000004"
              >Asia</placeName> reflect on this, that if she were not under our government, there is
            no calamity of foreign war or internal strife from which she would be free. And since
            that government cannot possibly be maintained without taxes, she should be content to
            purchase perpetual peace and tranquillity at the price of a certain proportion of her
            products. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/></p>
          <p>But if they will fairly reconcile themselves to the existence and name of publican, all
            the rest may be made to appear to them in a less offensive light by your skill and
            prudence. They may, in making their bargains with the <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >publicani</foreign>, not have regard so much to the exact conditions laid down by the
            censors as to the convenience of settling the business and freeing themselves from
            farther trouble. You also may do, what you have done splendidly and are still doing,
            namely, dwell on the high position of the <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign>,
            and on your obligations to that order, in such a way as—putting out of the question all
            considerations of your <foreign xml:lang="la">imperium</foreign> and the power of your
            official authority and dignity—to reconcile the Greeks with the <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >publicani</foreign>; and to beg of those, whom you have served eminently well, and
            who owe you everything, to suffer you by their compliance to maintain and preserve the
            bonds which unite us with the <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign>. But why do I
            address these exhortations to you, who are not only capable of carrying them out of your
            own accord without anyone's instruction, but have already to a great extent thoroughly
            done so? For the most respectable and important companies do not cease offering me
            thanks daily, and this is all the more gratifying to me because the Greeks do the same.
            Now it is an achievement of great difficulty to unite in feeling things which are
            opposite in interests, aims, and, I had almost said, in their very nature. But I have
            not written all this to instruct you—for your wisdom requires no man's instruction—but
            it has been a pleasure to me while writing to set down your virtues, though I have run
            to greater length in this letter than I could have wished, or than I thought I should.
              <milestone unit="section" n="13"/></p>
          <p>There is one thing on which I shall not cease from giving you advice, nor will I, as
            far as in me lies, allow your praise to be spoken of with a reservation. For all who <pb
              n="84"/> come from your province do make one reservation in the extremely high praise
            which they bestow on your virtue, integrity, and kindness—it is that of sharpness of
            temper. That is a fault which, even in our private and everyday life, seems to indicate
            want of solidity and strength of mind; but nothing, surely, can be more improper than to
            combine harshness of temper with the exercise of supreme power. Wherefore I will not
            undertake to lay before you now what the greatest philosophers say about anger, for I
            should not wish to be tedious, and you can easily ascertain it yourself from the
            writings of many of them: but I don't think I ought to pass over what is the essence of
            a letter, namely, that the recipient should be informed of what he does not know. Well,
            what nearly everybody reports to me is this: they usually say that, as long as you are
            not out of temper, nothing can be pleasanter than you are, but that when some instance
            of dishonesty or wrong-headedness has stirred you, your temper rises to such a height
            that no one Can discover any trace of your usual kindness. Wherefore, since no mere
            desire for glory, but circumstances and fortune have brought us upon a path of life
            which makes it inevitable that men will always talk about us, let us be on our guard, to
            the utmost of our means and ability, that no glaring fault may be alleged to have
            existed in us. And I am not now urging, what is perhaps difficult in human nature
            generally, and at our time of life especially, that you should change your disposition
            and suddenly pluck out a deeply-rooted habit, but I give you this hint: if you cannot
            completely avoid this failing, because your mind is surprised by anger before cool
            calculation has been able to prevent it, deliberately prepare yourself beforehand, and
            daily reflect on the duty of resisting anger, and that, when it moves your heart most
            violently, it is just the time for being most careful to restrain your tongue. And that
            sometimes seems to me to be a. greater virtue than not being angry at all. For the
            latter is not always a mark of superiority to weakness, it is sometimes the result of
            dullness; but to govern temper and speech, however angry you may be, or even to hold
            your tongue and keep your indignant feelings and resentment under control, although it
            may not be a proof of perfect wisdom, yet requires no ordinary force of character. And,
              <pb n="85"/> indeed, in this respect they tell me that you are now much more gentle
            and less irritable. No violent outbursts of indignation on your part, no abusive words,
            no insulting language are reported to me: which, while quite alien to culture and
            refinement, are specially unsuited to high power and place. For if your anger is
            implacable, it amounts to extreme harshness; if easily appeased, to extreme weakness.
            The latter, however, as a choice of evils, is, after all, preferable to harshness.
              <milestone unit="section" n="14"/></p>
          <p>But since your first year gave rise to most talk in regard to this particular
            complaint—I believe because the wrong-doing, the covetousness, and the arrogance of men
            came upon you as a surprise, and seemed to you unbearable-while your second year was
            much milder, because habit and refection, and, as I think, my letters also, rendered you
            more tolerant and gentle, the third ought to be so completely reformed, as not to give
            even the smallest ground for anyone to find fault. And here I go on to urge upon you,
            not by way of exhortation or admonition, but by brotherly entreaties, that you would set
            your whole heart, care, and thought on the gaining of praise from everybody and from
            every quarter. If, indeed, our achievements were only the subject of a moderate amount
            of talk and commendation, nothing eminent, nothing beyond the practice of others, would
            have been demanded of you. As it is, however, owing to the brilliancy and magnitude of
            the affairs in which we have been engaged, if we do not obtain the very highest
            reputation from your province, it seems scarcely possible for us to avoid the most
            violent abuse. Our position is such that all loyalists support us, but demand also and
            expect from us every kind of activity and virtue, while all the disloyal, seeing that we
            have entered upon a lasting war with them, appear contented with the very smallest
            excuse for attacking us. Wherefore, since fortune has allotted to you such a theatre as
              <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, completely packed with an audience, of
            immense size, of the most refined judgment, and, moreover, naturally so capable of
            conveying sound, that its expressions of opinion and its remarks reach <placeName
              key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, put out all your power, I beseech you, exert all
            your energies to appear not only to have been worthy of the part we played here, but to
            have surpassed everything done there by your high qualities. <pb n="86"/>
            <milestone unit="section" n="15"/></p>
          <p>And since chance has assigned to me among the magistracies the Conduct of public
            business in the city, to you that in a province, if my share is inferior to no one's,
            take care that yours surpasses others. At the same time think of this: we are not now
            working for a future and prospective glory, but are fighting in defence of what has been
            already gained; which indeed it was not so much an object to gain as it is now our duty
            to defend. And if anything in me could be apart from you, I should desire nothing more
            than the position which I have already gained. The actual fact, however, is that unless
            all your acts and deeds in your province correspond to my achievements, I shall think
            that I have gained nothing by those great labours and dangers, in all of which you have
            shared. But if it was you who, above all others, assisted me to gain a most splendid
            reputation, you will certainly also labour more than others to enable me to retain it.
            You must not be guided by the opinions and judgments of the present generation only, but
            of those to come also: and yet the latter will be a more candid judgment, for it will
            not be influenced by detraction and malice. Finally, you should think of this—that you
            are not seeking glory for yourself alone (and even if that were the case, you still
            ought not to be careless of it, especially as you had determined to consecrate the
            memory of your name by the most splendid monuments), but you have to share it with me,
            and to hand it down to our children. In regard to which you must be on your guard lest
            by any excess of carelessness you should seem not only to have neglected your own
            interests, but to have begrudged those of your family also. <milestone unit="section"

          <p>And these observations are not made with the idea of any speech of mine appearing to
            have roused you from your sleep, but to have rather "added speed to the runner. For you
            will continue to compel all in the future, as you have compelled them in the past, to
            praise your equity, self-control, strictness, and honesty. But from my extreme affection
            I am possessed with a certain insatiable greed for glory for you. However, I am
            convinced that, as <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> should now be as
            well-known to you as each man's own house is to himself, and since to your supreme good
            sense such great experience has now been added, there is nothing that affects reputation
            which you do not know as well as possible yourself, and <pb n="87"/> which does not
            daily occur to your mind without anybody's exhortation. But I, who when I read your
            writing seem to hear your voice, and when I write to you seem to be talking to you, am
            therefore always best pleased with your longest letter, and in writing am often somewhat
            prolix myself. My last prayer and advice to you is that, as good poets and painstaking
            actors always do, so you should be most attentive in the last scenes and conclusion of
            your function and business, so that this third year of your government, like a third act
            in a play, may appear to have been the most elaborated and most highly finished. You
            will do that with more ease if you will think that I, whom you always wished to please
            more than all the world besides, am always at your side, and am taking part in
            everything you say and do. It remains only to beg you to take the greatest care of your
            health, if you wish me and all your friends to be well also. Farewell. </p>

          <p> Statius arrived at my house on the 25th October. His arrival gave me uneasiness,
            because you said in your letter that you would be plundered by your household in his
            absence. However, I thought it a very happy circumstance that he anticipated the
            expectation of his arrival, and the company that would have assembled to meet him, if he
            had <pb n="126"/> left the province with you, and had not appeared before. For people
            have exhausted their remarks, and many observations have been made and done with of the
            "Nay, but I looked for a mighty man" <note n="1" anchored="true">
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)ll' ai)ei]\ tina fw=ta me/gan kai\ kalo\n
                e)de/gmhn</foreign> "but I ever expected some big and handsome man" (<bibl
                n="Hom. Od. 9.513">Hom. Od. 9.513</bibl>). Statius had been manumitted by Quintus
              Cicero, and there had been much talk about it, as we have already heard. See XLIV, p.
              109, and XLV, </note> kind, which I am glad to have all over before you come. But as
            for the motive for your sending him—that he might clear himself with me—that was not at
            all necessary. For, to begin with, I had never suspected him, nor in what I wrote to you
            about him was I expressing my own judgment; but since the interest and safety of all of
            us who take part in public business depends, not on truth alone, but on report also, I
            wrote you word of what people were saying, not what I thought myself. How prevalent and
            how formidable that talk was Statius ascertained himself on his arrival. For he was
            present when certain persons at my house gave vent to some complaints on that very
            subject, and had the opportunity of perceiving that the observations of the malevolent
            were being directed at himself especially. But it used to annoy me most when I was told
            that he had greater influence with you, than your sober time of life and the wisdom of a
            governor required. How many people, do you suppose, have solicited me to give them a
            letter of introduction to Statius? How often, do you suppose, has he himself, while
            talking without reserve to me, made such observations as, "I never approved of that," "I
            told him so," "I tried to persuade him," "I warned him not to"? And even if these things
            show the highest fidelity, as I believe they do, since that is your judgment, yet the
            mere appearance of a freedman or slave enjoying such influence cannot but lower your
            dignity: and the long and short of it is—for I am in duty bound not to say anything
            without good grounds, nor to keep back anything from motives of policy—that Statius has
            supplied all the material for the gossip of those who wished to decry you; that formerly
            all that could be made out was that certain persons were. angry at your strictness; but
            that after his manumission the angry had something to talk about. <pb n="127"/>
            <milestone unit="para"/>Now I will answer the letters delivered to me by L. Caesius,
            whom, as I see you wish it, I will serve in every way I can. One of them is about Zeuxis
            of Blaundus, whom you say was warmly recommended to you by me though a most notorious
            matricide. In this matter, and on this subject generally, please listen to a short
            statement, lest you should by chance be surprised at my having become so conciliatory
            towards Greeks. Seeing, as I did, that the complaints of Greeks, because they have a
            genius for deceit, were allowed an excessive weight, whenever I was told of any of them
            making complaint of you, I appeased them by every means in my power. First, I pacified
            the Dionysopolitans, who were very bitter: whose chief man, Hermippus, I secured not
            only by my conversation, but by treating him as a friend. I did the same to Hephaestus
            of <placeName key="tgn,7017535">Apameia</placeName>; the same to that most untrustworthy
            fellow, Megaristus of Antandrus; the same to Nicias of <placeName key="perseus,Smyrna"
              >Smyrna</placeName>; I also embraced with all the courtesy I possessed the most
            trumpery of men, even Nymphon of <placeName key="perseus,Colophon">Colophon</placeName>.
            And all this I did from no liking for these particular people, or the nation as a whole:
            I was heartily sick of their fickleness and obsequiousness, of feelings that are not
            affected by our kindness, but by our position. <milestone unit="para"/>But to return to
            Zeuxis. When he was telling me the same story as you mention in your letter about what
            M. Cascellius had said to him in conversation, I stopped him from farther talk, and
            admitted him to my society. I cannot, however, understand your virulence when you say
            that, having sewn up in the parricide's-sack two Mysians at <placeName
              key="perseus,Smyrna">Smyrna</placeName>, you desired to display a similar example of
            your severity in the upper part of your province, and that, therefore, you had wished to
            inveigle Zeuxis into your hands by every possible means. For if he had been brought into
            court, he ought perhaps not to have been allowed to escape: but there was no necessity
            for his being hunted out and inveigled by soft words to stand a trial, as you say in
            your letter—especially as he is one whom I learn daily, both from his fellow citizens
            and from many others, to be a man of higher character than you would expect from such an
            obscure town as his. <note n="1" anchored="true">Reading <foreign xml:lang="la">quam pro
                civitate sua</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="la">prope quam civitatem

              changed, the case of <foreign xml:lang="la">civitate</foreign> would follow. Prof.
              Tyrrell, who writes the town Blandus, would read <foreign xml:lang="la"
                >molliorem</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="la">nobiliorem</foreign>, and imagines a
              pun on the meaning of <foreign xml:lang="la">Blandius</foreign>. But the name of the
              town seems certainly Blaundus, <foreign xml:lang="grc">*blau=ndos</foreign>, or
                <foreign xml:lang="grc">*mlau=ndos</foreign> (Stephanus, <foreign xml:lang="grc"
                >*blau=dos</foreign>); see Head, Hist. <foreign xml:lang="la">Num</foreign>. p. 559:
              and Cicero, though generally punning on names, would hardly do so here, where he is
              making a grave excuse. </note> But, you will say, it is only Greeks <pb n="128"/> to
            whom I am indulgent. What! did not I do everything to appease L. Caecilius? What a man!
            how irritable! how violent! In fact, who is there except Tuscenius, <note n="1"
              anchored="true">Whom he called (Letter XXIX) "a madman and a knave." </note> whose
            case admitted of no cure, have I not softened? See again, I have now on my hands a
            shifty, mean fellow, though of equestrian rank, called Catienus: even he is going to be
            smoothed down. I don't blame you for having been somewhat harsh to his father, for I am
            quite sure you have acted with good reason: but what need was there of a letter of the
            sort which you sent to the man himself? "That the man was rearing the cross for himself
            from which you had already pulled him off once; that you would take care to have him
            smoked to death, and would be applauded by the whole province for it." Again, to a man
            named C. Fabius—for that letter also T. Catienus is handing round—"that you were told
            that the kidnapper Licinius, with his young kite of a son, was collecting taxes." And
            then you go on to ask Fabius to burn both father and son alive if he can; if not, to
            send them to you, that they may be burnt to death by legal sentence. That letter sent by
            you in jest to C. Fabius, if it really is from you, exhibits to ordinary readers a
            violence of language very injurious to you. <milestone unit="para"/>Now, if you will
            refer to the exhortations in all my letters, you will perceive that I have never found
            fault with you for anything except harshness and sharpness of temper, and occasionally,
            though rarely, for want of caution in the letters you write. In which particulars,
            indeed, if my influence had had greater weight with you than a somewhat excessive
            quickness of disposition, or a certain enjoyment in indulging temper, or a faculty for
            epigram and a sense of humour, we should certainly have had no cause for
            dissatisfaction. And don't you suppose that I feel no common vexation when I am told how
            Vergilius is esteemed, and your neighbour <pb n="129"/> C. Octavius? <note n="1"

            and <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, that is a pretty thing to boast of!
            And that is just the sting of the matter, that though the men I have named are not more
            blameless than yourself, they yet outdo you in the art of winning favour, though they
            know nothing of Xenophon's Cyrus or Agesilaus; from which kings, in the exercise of
            their great office, no one ever heard an irritable word. But in giving you this advice,
            as I have from the first, I am well aware how much good I have done. <note n="2"
              anchored="true">I have endeavoured to leave the English as ambiguous as the Latin.
              Cicero may mean that he has done some good, for at the end of Letter XXIX he says that
              Quintus has improved in these points, and had been better in his second than in his
              first year. On the other hand, the context here seems rather to point to the meaning
              "how little good I have done"—impatiently dismissing the subject of temper. </note>
            <milestone unit="para"/>Now, however, as you are about to quit your province, pray do
            leave behind you—as I think you are now doing—as pleasant a memory as possible. You have
            a successor of very mild manners; in other respects, on his arrival, you will be much
            missed. In sending letters of requisition, as I have often told you, you have allowed
            yourself to be too easily persuaded. Destroy, if you can, all such as are inequitable,
            or contrary to usage, or contradictory to others. Statius told me that they were usually
            put before you ready written, read by himself, and that, if they were inequitable, he
            informed you of the fact: but that before he entered your service there had been no
            sifting of letters; that the result was that there were volumes containing a selection
            of letters, which were usually adversely criticised. <note n="3" anchored="true">These
              "requisitionary letters" were granted by a provincial governor to certain persons
              requiring supplies, payment of debts, or legal decisions in their favour in the
              provinces, or other privileges, and, if carelessly granted, were open to much abuse.
              Cicero, in his own government of <foreign xml:lang="la">Cilicia</foreign>, boasted
              that he had signed none such in six months. The ill-wishers of Quintus had apparently
              got hold of a number of these letters signed by him (having been first written out by
              the suitors themselves and scarcely glanced at by him), and a selection of them
              published to prove his injustice or carelessness. </note> On this subject I am not
            going to give you any advice at this time of day, for <pb n="130"/> it is too late; and
            you cannot but be aware that I have often warned you in various ways and with precision.
            But I have, on a hint from Theopompus, entrusted him with this message to you: do see by
            means of persons attached to you, which you will find no difficulty in doing, that the
            following classes of letters are destroyed—first, those that are inequitable; next,
            those that are contradictory; then those expressed in an eccentric or unusual manner;
            and lastly, those that contain reflections on anyone. I don't believe all I hear about
            these matters, and if, in the multiplicity of your engagements, you have let certain
            things escape you, now is the time to look into them and weed them out. I have read a
            letter said to have been written by your nomenclator Sulla himself, which I cannot
            approve: I have read some written in an angry spirit. But the subject of letters comes
            in pat: for while this sheet of paper was actually in my hands, L. Flavius,
            praetor-designate and a very intimate friend, came to see me. He told me that you had
            sent a letter to his agents, which seemed to me most inequitable, prohibiting them from
            taking anything from the estate of the late L. Octavius Naso, whose heir L. Flavius is,
            until they had paid a sum of money to C. Fundanius; and that you had sent a similar
            letter to the Apollonidenses, not to allow any payment on account of the estate of the
            late Octavius till the debt to Fundanius had been discharged. It seems to me hardly
            likely that you have done this; for it is quite unlike your usual good sense. The heir
            not to take anything? What if he disowns the debt? What if he doesn't owe it at all?
            Moreover, is the praetor wont to decide whether a debt is due ? <note n="1"
              anchored="true">The governor of a province would stand in such a matter in the place
              of the praetor in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, i.e., he would
              decide on questions of law, not of fact, as, whether a debt was due or not. However,
              Quintus perhaps only erred in the form of his injunction. He might forbid the
              deceased's estate being touched till the question of Fundanius's debt was decided; but
              in his letter he assumed (as he had no right to do) that the claim was good.
              Substantially it seems to me that Quintus was right, and certainly in his appeal to
              him Cicero does not follow his own injunction to disregard personal feelings. </note>
            Don't I, again, wish well to Fundanius? Am I not his friend? Am I not touched with
            compassion? No one more so: but in certain matters the course of law is so clear as to
            leave no place for personal feeling. And Flavius told me that expressions were used in
            the letter, <pb n="131"/> which he said was yours, to the effect that you would "either
            thank them as friends, or make yourself disagreeable to them as enemies." In short, he
            was much annoyed, complained of it to me in strong terms, and begged me to write to you
            as seriously as I could. This I am doing, and I do strongly urge you again and again to
            withdraw your injunction to Flavius's agents about taking money from the estate, and not
            to lay any farther injunction on the Apollonidenses contrary to the rights of Flavius.
            Pray do everything you can for the sake of Flavius and, indeed, of Pompey also. I would
            not, upon my honour, have you think me liberal to him at the expense of any inequitable
            decision on your part: but I do entreat you to leave behind you some authority, and some
            memorandum of a decree or of a letter under your hand, so framed as to support the
            interests and cause of Flavius. For the man, who is at once very attentive to me, and
            tenacious of his own rights and dignity, is feeling extremely hurt that he has not
            prevailed with you either on the grounds of personal friendship or of legal right; and,
            to the best of my belief, both Pompey and Caesar have, at one time or another, commended
            the interests of Flavius to you, and Flavius has written to you personally, and
            certainly I have. Wherefore, if there is anything which you think you ought to do at my
            request, let it be this. If you love me, take every care, take every trouble, and insure
            Flavius's cordial thanks both to yourself and myself. I cannot use greater earnestness
            in making any request than I use in this. <milestone unit="para"/>As to what you say
            about Hermias, it has been in truth a cause of much vexation to me. I wrote you a letter
            in a rather unbrotherly spirit, which I dashed off in a fit of anger and now wish to
            recall, having been irritated by what Lucullus's freedman told me, immediately after
            hearing of the bargain. For this letter, which was not expressed in a brotherly way, you
            ought to have brotherly feeling enough to make allowance. As to Censorinus, Antonius,
            the Cassii, Scaevola—I am delighted to hear from you that you possess their friendship.
            The other contents of that same letter of yours were expressed more strongly than I
            could have wished, such as your "with my ship at least well trimmed" <note n="1"
              anchored="true">
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">o)rqa\n ta\n nau=n</foreign>. Quintus had written, it seems,
              defiantly about the slanders afloat against him, and had quoted two Greek proverbial
              sayings. The first is found in Stobaeus, 108 (extract from <foreign xml:lang="la"
                >Teles</foreign>): "It was a fine saying of the pilot, 'At least, Poseidon, a ship
              well trimmed,'" i.e., if you sink my ship, she shall at least go down with honour.
              Quintus means, "whatever my enemies may do afterwards, I will keep my province in a
              sound state as long as I am here." </note> and your "die <pb n="132"/> once for all."
              <note n="1" anchored="true">
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">a(/pac qanei=n</foreign>, perhaps "Better to <foreign

              </quote> But I don't feel sure that this is the passage alluded to. </note> You will
            find those expressions to be unnecessarily strong. My scoldings have always been very
            full of affection. They mention certain things for complaint, <note n="2"
              anchored="true">Reading <foreign xml:lang="la">queruntur</foreign> for <foreign
                xml:lang="la">quae sunt</foreign>. </note> but these are not important, or rather,
            are quite insignificant. For my part, I should never have thought you deserving of the
            least blame in any respect, considering the extreme purity of your conduct, had it not
            been that our enemies are numerous. Whatever I have written to you in a tone of
            remonstrance or reproach I have written from a vigilant caution, which I maintain, and
            shall maintain; and I shall not cease imploring you to do the same. Attalus of Hypaepa
            has begged me to intercede with you that you should not prevent his getting the money
            paid which has been decreed for a statue of Q. Publicius. In which matter I both ask as
            a favour and urge as a duty, that you should not consent to allow the honour of a man of
            his character, and so close a friend of mine, to be lowered or hindered by your means.
            Furthermore, Licinius, who is known to you, a slave of my friend Aesopus, has run away.
            He has been at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, living in the house
            of Patron the Epicurean as a free man. Thence he has made his way to <placeName
              key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>. Afterwards a certain Plato of Sardis, who is often
            at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and happened to be at <placeName
              key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> at the time that Licinius arrived there,
            having subsequently learnt by a letter from Aesopus that he was an escaped slave,
            arrested the fellow, and put him into confinement at <placeName key="tgn,7002499"
              >Ephesus</placeName>; but whether into the public prison, or into a slave mill, we
            could not clearly make out from his letter. But since he is at <placeName
              key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>, I should be obliged if you would trace him in
            any manner open to you, and with all care <pb n="133"/> either [send him] or bring him
            home with you. Don't take into consideration the fellow's value: such a good-for-nothing
            is worth very little; but Aesopus is so much vexed at his slave's bad conduct and
            audacity, that you can do him no greater favour than by being the means of his
            recovering him. <milestone unit="para"/>Now for the news that you chiefly desire. We
            have so completely lost the constitution that Cato, <note n="1" anchored="true">Gaius
                <foreign xml:lang="la">Cato</foreign>, tribune <date when="-0056">B.C. 56</date>.
            </note> a young man of no sense, but yet a Roman citizen and a Cato, scarcely got off
            with his life because, having determined to prosecute Gabinius for bribery, when the
            praetors could not be approached for several days, and refused to admit anyone to their
            presence, he mounted the rostra in public meeting and called Pompey an "unofficial
            dictator." No one ever had a narrower escape of being killed. From this you may see the
            state of the whole Republic. People, however, show no inclination to desert my cause.
            They make wonderful professions, offers of service, and promises: and, indeed, I have
            the highest hopes and even greater spirit—so that I hope to get the better in the
            struggle, and feel confident in my mind that, in the present state of the Republic, I
            need not fear even an accident. However, the matter stands thus: if Clodius gives notice
            of an action against me, the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>
            will rush to my support, so that I shall come off with many times greater glory than
            before; but if he attempts the use of violence, I hope, by the zeal not only of friends
            but also of opponents, to be able to meet force with force. All promise me the aid of
            themselves, their friends, clients, freedmen, slaves, and, finally, of their money. Our
            old regiment of loyalists is warm in its zeal and attachment to me. If there were any
            who had formerly been comparatively hostile or lukewarm, they are now uniting themselves
            with the loyalists from hatred to these despots. Pompey makes every sort of promise, and
            so does Caesar: but my confidence in them is not enough to induce me to drop any of my
            preparations. The tribunes-designate are friendly to us. The consuls-designate make
            excellent professions. Some of the new praetors are very friendly and very brave
            citizens-Domitius, Nigidius, Memmius, <pb n="134"/> Lentulus <note n="1" anchored="true"
              >L. Domitius Ahenobarbus, who as praetor threatened Caesar with impeachment, and as

          <p> BROTHER! Brother! Brother! did you really fear that I had been induced by some angry
            feeling to send slaves to you without a letter? Or even that I did not wish to see you?
            I to be angry with you! Is it possible for me to be angry with you? Why, one would think
            that it was you that brought me low! Your enemies, your unpopularity, that miserably
            ruined me, and not I that unhappily ruined you! The fact is, the much-praised consulate
            of mine has deprived me of you, of children, country, fortune; from you I should hope it
            will <pb n="149"/> have taken nothing but myself. Certainly on your side I have
            experienced nothing but what was honourable and gratifying: on mine you have grief for
            my fall and fear for your own, regret, mourning, desertion. Not wish to see you? The
            truth is rather that I was unwilling to be seen by you. For you would not have seen your
            brother-not the brother you had left, not the brother you knew, not him to whom you had
            with mutual tears bidden farewell as he followed you on your departure for your
            province: not a trace even or faint image of him, but rather what I may call the
            likeness of a living corpse. And oh that you had sooner seen me or heard of me as a
            corpse! Oh that I could have left you to survive, not my life merely, but my
            undiminished rank! But I call all the gods to witness that the one argument which
            recalled me from death was, that all declared that to some extent your life depended
            upon mine. In which matter I made an error and acted Culpably. For if I had died, that
            death itself would have given clear evidence of my fidelity and love to you. As it is, I
            have allowed you to be deprived of my aid, though I am alive, and with me still living
            to need the help of others; and my voice, of all others, to fail when dangers threatened
            my family, which had so often been successfully used in the defence of the merest
            strangers. For as to the slaves coming to you without a letter, the real reason (for you
            see that it was not anger) was a deadness of my faculties, and a seemingly endless
            deluge of tears and sorrows. How many tears do you suppose these very words have Cost
            me? As many as I know they will cost you to read them! Can I ever refrain from thinking
            of you or ever think of you without tears? For when I miss you, is it only a brother
            that I miss? Rather it is a brother of almost my own age in the charm of his
            companionship, a son in his consideration for my wishes, a father in the wisdom of his
            advice! What pleasure did I ever have without you, or you without me? And what must my
            case be when at the same time I miss a daughter: How affectionate! how modest! how
            clever! The express image of my face, of my speech, of my very soul! Or again a son, the
            prettiest boy, the very joy of my heart? Cruel inhuman monster that I am, I dismissed
            him from my arms better schooled in the world than I could have wished: for the poor
            child began to understand <pb n="150"/> what was going on. So, too, your own son, your
            own image, whom my little Cicero loved as a brother, and was now beginning to respect as
            an elder brother! Need I mention also how I refused to allow my unhappy wife—the truest
            of helpmates—to accompany me, that there might be some one to protect the wrecks of the
            calamity which had fallen on us both, and guard our common children? Nevertheless, to
            the best of my ability, I did write a letter to you, and gave it to your freedman
            Philogonus, which, I believe, was delivered to you later on; and in this I repeated the
            advice and entreaty, which had been already transmitted to you as a message from me by
            my slaves, that you should go on with your journey and hasten to <placeName
              key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. For, in the first place, I desired your
            protection, in case there were any of my enemies whose cruelty was not yet satisfied by
            my fall. In the next place, I dreaded the renewed lamentation which our meeting would
            cause : while I could not have borne your departure, and was afraid of the very thing
            you mention in your letter—that you would be unable to tear yourself away. For these
            reasons the supreme pain of not seeing you—and nothing more painful or more wretched
            could, I think, have happened to the most affectionate and united of brothers-was a less
            misery than would have been such a meeting followed by such a parting. Now, if you can,
            though I, whom you always regarded as a brave man, cannot do so, rouse yourself and
            collect your energies in view of any contest you may have to confront. I hope, if my
            hope has anything to go upon, that your own spotless character and the love of your
            fellow citizens, and even remorse for my treatment, may prove a certain protection to
            you. But if it turns out that you are free from personal danger, you will doubtless do
            whatever you think can be done for me. In that matter, indeed, many write to me at great
            length and declare that they have hopes; but I personally cannot see what hope there is,
            since my enemies have the greatest influence, while my friends have in some cases
            deserted, in others even betrayed me, fearing perhaps in my restoration a censure on
            their own treacherous conduct. But how matters stand with you I would have you ascertain
            and report to me. In any case I shall continue to live as long as you shall need me, in
            view of any danger you may <pb n="151"/> have to undergo: longer than that I cannot go
            on in this kind of life. For there is neither wisdom nor philosophy with sufficient
            strength to sustain such a weight of grief. I know that there has been a time for dying,
            more honourable and more advantageous; and this is not the only one of my many
            omissions, which, if I should choose to bewail, I should merely be increasing your
            sorrow and emphasizing my own stupidity. But one thing I am not bound to do, and it is
            in fact impossible-remain in a life so wretched and so dishonoured any longer than your
            necessities, or some well-grounded hope, shall demand. For I, who was lately supremely
            blessed in brother, children, wife, wealth, and in the very nature of that wealth, while
            in position, influence, reputation, and popularity, I was inferior to none, however
            distinguished—I cannot, I repeat, go on longer lamenting over myself and those dear to
            me in a life of such humiliation as this, and in a state of such utter ruin. Wherefore,
            what do you mean by writing to me about negotiating a bill of exchange? As though I were
            not now wholly dependent on your means! And that is just the very thing in which I see
            and feel, to my misery, of what a culpable act I have been guilty in squandering to no
            purpose the money which I received from the treasury in your name, <note n="1"
              anchored="true">See pp. 92, 107. </note> while you have to satisfy your creditors out
            of the very vitals of yourself and your son. However, the sum mentioned in your letter
            has been paid to M. Antonius, and the same amount to Caepio. For me the sum at present
            in my hands is sufficient for what I contemplate doing. For in either case-whether I am
            restored or given up in despair—I shall not want any more money. For yourself, if you
            are molested, I think you should apply to Crassus and Calidius. I don't know how far
            Hortensius is to be trusted. Myself, with the most elaborate pretence of affection and
            the closest daily intimacy, he treated with the most utter want of principle and the
            most consummate treachery, and Q. Arrius helped him in it: acting under whose advice,
            promises, and injunctions, I was left helpless to fall into this disaster. But this you
            will keep dark for fear they might injure you. Take care also—and it is on this account
            that I <pb n="152"/> think you should Cultivate Hortensius himself by means of
            Pomponius—that the epigram on the <foreign xml:lang="la">lex Aurelia</foreign>

              would be likely to give offence. </note> attributed to you when Candidate for the
            aedileship is not proved by false testimony to be yours. For there is nothing that I am
            so afraid of as that, when people understand how much pity for me your prayers and your
            acquittal will rouse, they may attack you with all the greater violence. Messalla I
            reckon as really attached to you : Pompey I regard as still pretending only. But may you
            never have to put these things to the test! And that prayer I would have offered to the
            gods had they not ceased to listen to prayers of mine. However, I do pray that they may
            be content with these endless miseries of ours; among which, after all, there is no
            discredit for any wrong thing done-sorrow is the beginning and end, sorrow that
            punishment is most severe when our conduct has been most unexceptionable. As to my
            daughter and yours and my young Cicero, why should I recommend them to you, my dear
            brother? Rather I grieve that their orphan state will cause you no less sorrow than it
            does me. Yet as long as you are uncondemned they will not be fatherless. The rest, by my
            hopes of restoration and the privilege of dying in my fatherland, my tears will not
            allow me to write! Terentia also I would ask you to protect, and to write me word on
            every subject. Be as brave as the nature of the case admits. <placeName

          <p> I beg you, my dear brother, if you and all my family have been ruined by my single
            misfortune, not to attribute it to dishonesty and bad conduct on my part, rather than to
            shortsightedness and the wretched state I was in. I have committed no fault except in
            trusting those whom I believed to be bound by the most sacred obligation not to deceive
            me, or whom I thought to be even interested in not doing so. All my most intimate,
            nearest and dearest friends were either alarmed for themselves or jealous of me: the
            result was that all I lacked was good faith on the part of my friends and caution on my
            own. <note n="1" anchored="true">Reading <foreign xml:lang="la">defuit</foreign> for
                <foreign xml:lang="la">fuit</foreign>. </note> But if your own blameless character
            and the compassion of the world prove sufficient to preserve you at this juncture from
            molestation, you can, of course, observe whether any hope of restoration is left for me.
            For Pomponius, Sestius, and my son-in-law Piso have caused me as yet to stay at
              <placeName key="tgn,7011182">Thessalonica</placeName>, forbidding me, on account of
            certain impending movements, to increase my distance. But in truth I am awaiting the
            result more on account of their letters than from any firm hope of my own. For what can
            I hope with an enemy possessed of the most formidable power, with my detractors masters
            of the state, with friends unfaithful, with numbers of people jealous? However, of the
            new tribunes there is one, it is true, most warmly attached to me—Sestius—and I hope
            Curius, Milo, Fadius, <pb n="159"/> Fabricius; but still there is Clodius in violent
            opposition, who even when out of office will be able to stir up the passions of the mob
            by the help of that same gang, and then there will be found some one also to veto the
            bill. Such a state of things was not put before me when I was leaving <placeName
              key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, but I often used to be told that I was certain to
            return in three days with the greatest <foreign xml:lang="fr">>éclat</foreign>. "What
            made you go, then?" you will say. What, indeed! Many circumstances concurred to throw me
            off my balance—the defection of Pompey, the hostility of the consuls, and of the
            praetors also, the timidity of the <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign>, the armed
            bands. The tears of my friends prevented me seeking refuge in death, which would
            certainly have been the best thing for my honour, the best escape from unbearable
            sorrows. But I have written to you on this subject in the letter I gave to Phaetho. Now
            that you have been plunged into griefs and troubles, such as no one ever was before, if
            the compassion of the world can lighten our common misfortune, you will, it seems, score
            a success beyond belief! But if we are both utterly ruined—ah me-I shall have been the
            absolute destruction of my whole family, to whom I used to be at least no discredit! But
            pray, as I said in a previous letter to you, look into the business, test it thoroughly,
            and write to me with the candour which our situation demands, and not as your affection
            for me would dictate. I shall retain my life as long as I shall think that it is in your
            interest for me to do so, or that it ought to be preserved with a view to future hope.
            You will find Sestius most friendly to us, and I believe that Lentulus, the coming
            consul, will also be so for your sake. However, deeds are not so easy as words. You will
            see what is wanted and what the truth is. On the whole, supposing that no one takes
            advantage of your unprotected position and our common calamity, it is by your means, or
            not at all, that something may be effected. But even if your enemies have begun to annoy
            you, don't flinch: for you will be attacked by legal process, not by swords. However, I
            hope that this may not occur. I beg you to write me back word on all subjects, and to
            believe that though I have less spirit and resource than in old times, I have quite as
            much affection and loyalty. <pb n="160"/>

          <p> The letter<note n="1" anchored="true">Quintus Cicero was in <foreign xml:lang="la"
                >Sardinia</foreign> as Pompey's <foreign xml:lang="la">legatus</foreign> as
              superintendent of the corn-supply, to which office he had been appointed in August.
              The letter is written not earlier than the 10th of December, for the new tribunes for
                <date when="-0056">B.C. 56</date> have come into office, and not later than the
              16th, because on the 17th the Saturnalia began. Perhaps as the senate is summoned and
              presided over by <persName><surname>Lupus</surname></persName>, it is on the 10th, the
              day of his entrance upon office. </note>which you have already read I had sent off in
            the morning. But Licinius was polite enough to call on me in the evening after the
            senate had risen, that, in case of any business having been done there, I might, if I
            thought good, write an account of it to you. The senate was fuller than I had thought
            possible in the month of December just <pb n="199"/> before the holidays. Of us
            consulars there were P. Servilius, M. Lucullus, Lepidus, Volcatius, Glabrio: the two
            consuls-designate; the praetors. We were a really full house: two hundred in all. <note
              n="1" anchored="true">Full,"that is, for the time of year. A "full house" is elsewhere
              mentioned as between three and four hundred. </note>
            <persName><surname>Lupus</surname></persName> had excited some interest. <note n="2"
              anchored="true">P. Rutilius Lupus, one of the new tribunes. </note> He raised the
            question of the Campanian land in considerable detail. He was listened to in profound
            silence. You are not unaware what material that subject affords. He omitted none of the
            points which I had made in this business. <note n="3" anchored="true">This refers to
              Cicero's attempts to exempt the <foreign xml:lang="la">ager publicus</foreign> in
                <foreign xml:lang="la">Campania</foreign> from being divided (see Letter XXIV, p.
              55); and not only to his speeches against Rullus. It was because Caesar disregarded
              the ancient exception of this land from such distribution that Cicero opposed his
              bill, and refused to serve on the commission. </note> There were some sharp thrusts at
            Caesar, some denunciations of Gellius, some appeals to the absent Pompey. After
            concluding his speech at a late hour, he said that he would not ask for our votes lest
            he might burden us with a personal controversy; he quite understood the sentiments of
            the senate from the denunciations of past times and the silence on the present occasion.
            Milo spoke. Lupus begins the formula of dismissal, <note n="4" anchored="true">
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Nihil vos moramur</foreign> were the words used by the
              presiding magistrate, indicating that he had no more business to bring before the
              senate. If no one said anything, the senate was dismissed; but any magistrate, or
              magistrate-designate, could speak, and so continue the sitting up to nightfall, when
              the house stood adjourned. </note> when Marcellinus says: " Don't infer from our
            silence, Lupus, what we approve or disapprove of at this particular time. As far as I am
            concerned, and I think it is the same with the rest, I am only silent because I do not
            think it suitable that the case of the Campanian land should be debated in Pompey's
            absence." Then Lupus said that he would not detain the senate. <note n="5"
              anchored="true">Because consul-designate. L. Racilius, one of the new tribunes.
            </note> Racilius rose and began bringing before the house the case of the pro-posed
            prosecutions. He calls upon Marcellinus, of course, first; who, after complaining in
            serious tones of the Clodian incendiaries, massacres, and stonings, proposed a
            resolution that "Clodius himself should, under the superintendence of the praetor
            urbanus, have his jury allotted to him; that the elections should be held only when the

              accused could, however, challenge a certain number, and the praetor had then to draw

            also Cassius—spoke against it, with very emphatic murmurs of disapprobation on the part
            of the senate, when he proposed to hold the elections before the trials. Philippus
            supported Lentulus. <note n="4" anchored="true">I.e., Marcellinus (Cn. <foreign

              senators not in office only spoke when called on (<foreign xml:lang="la"

              first, and then the consulars in order. To be called first was a subject of ambition,
              and an opportunity for the presiding magistrate to pay a compliment or the reverse.
            </note> I made a long speech upon the whole story of P. Clodius's mad proceedings and
            murderous violence: I impeached him at considerable length, and, by
                <persName><surname>Hercules</surname></persName> with no little as though he were on
            his trial, amidst frequent murmurs of approbation from the whole senate. My speech was
            praised oratorical skill by Antistius Vetus, who also supported the priority of the
            legal proceedings, and declared that he should consider it of the first importance. The
            senators were crossing the floor in support of this view, <note n="6" anchored="true"
              >They went and sat or stood near the speaker they wished to support. It was not,
              however, a formal division till the speeches ended, and the presiding magistrate
              counted. Still, it made the division easier. </note> when Clodius, being called on,
            began trying to talk out the sitting. He spoke in furious terms of having been attacked
            by Racilius in an unreasonable and discourteous manner. Then his roughs on the

              as Prof. Tyrrell says. </note> and the steps of the house suddenly raised <pb n="201"
            /> a pretty loud shout, in wrath, I suppose, against Q. Sextilius and the other friends
            of Milo. At this sudden alarm we broke up with loud expressions of indignation on all
            sides. Here are the transactions of one day for you: the rest, I think, will be put off
            to January. Of all the tribunes I think Racilius is by far the best: Antistius also
            seems likely to be friendly to me: Plancius, of course, is wholly ours. Pray, if you
            love me, be careful and cautious about sailing in December. </p>

          <p> It was not from the multiplicity of business, though I am very much engaged, but from
            a slight inflammation of the eyes that I was induced to dictate this letter, and not, as
            is my usual habit, write it with my own hand. And, to begin with, I wish to excuse
            myself to you on the very point on which I accuse yoti. For no one up to now has asked
            me "whether I have any commands for <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName>
            "—I think you often have people who say, "Have you any commands for <placeName

            about the debt of Lentulus and Sestius, I have spoken with Cincius. <note n="1"

            <dateline><placeName key="perseus,Rome">ROME</placeName>, 12 FEBRUARY</dateline>
          </opener>
          <p> I have already told you the earlier proceedings; now let me describe what was done
            afterwards. The legations were post-poned from the 1st of February to the 13th. On the
            former day our business was not brought to a settlement. On the 2nd of February Milo
            appeared for trial. Pompey came to support him. Marcellus spoke on being called upon by
            me. <note n="1" anchored="true">
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Milo</foreign> impeached by Clodius before the <foreign
                xml:lang="la">comitia tributa</foreign> for his employment of gladiators. Dio
              (xxxix. 18) says that Clodius thus impeached <foreign xml:lang="la">Milo</foreign>,
              not with any hope of securing his conviction against the powerful support of Cicero
              and Pompey, but to get the chance of insulting these latter. Marcellus was one of the
              candidates for the aedileship with Clodius. See Letter XCI. </note> We came off with
            flying colours. The case was adjourned to the 7th. Meanwhile (in the senate), the
            legations having been postponed to the i3th, the business of allotting the quaestors and
            furnishing the outfit of the praetors was brought before the house. But nothing was
            done, because many speeches were interposed denouncing the state of the Republic. Gaius
            Cato published his bill for the recall of Lentulus, whose son thereupon put on mourning.
            On the 7th Milo appeared. Pompey spoke, or rather wished to speak. For as soon as he got
            up Clodius's ruffians raised a shout, and throughout his whole speech he was
            interrupted, not only by hostile cries, but by personal abuse and insulting remarks.
            However, when he had finished his speech—for he shewed great courage in these
            circumstances, he was <pb n="214"/> not cowed, he said all he had to say, and at times
            had by his Commanding presence even secured silence for his words —well, when he had
            finished, up got Clodius. Our party received him with such a shout—for they had
            determined to pay him out—that he lost all presence of mind, power of speech, or control
            over his countenance. This went on up to two o'clock-Pompey having finished his speech
            at noon —and every kind of abuse, and finally epigrams of the most outspoken indecency
            were uttered against Clodius and Clodia. Mad and livid with rage Clodius, in the very
            midst of the shouting, kept putting questions to his claque: "Who was it who was
            starving the commons to death?" His ruffians answered, "Pompey." "Who wanted to be sent
            to <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>?" They answered, "Pompey."
            "Who did they wish to go?" They answered, "Crassus." The latter was present at the time
            with no friendly feelings to Milo. About three o'clock, as though at a given signal, the
            Clodians began spitting at our men. There was an outburst of rage. They began a movement
            for forcing us from our ground. Our men charged: his ruffians turned tail. Clodius was
            pushed off the rostra: and then we too made our escape for fear of mischief in the riot.
            The senate was summoned into the Curia: Pompey went home. However, I did not myself
            enter the senate-house, lest I should be obliged either to refrain from speaking on
            matters of such gravity, or in defending Pompey (for he was being attacked by Bibulus,
            Curio, Favonius, and Servilius the younger) should give offence to the loyalists. The
            business was adjourned to the next day. Clodius fixed the Quirinalia (17th of February)
            for his prosecution. On the 8th the senate met in the temple of Apollo, that Pompey
            might attend. Pompey made an impressive speech. That day nothing was concluded. On the
            9th in the temple of Apollo a decree passed the senate "that what had taken place on the
            7th of February was treasonable." On this day Cato warmly inveighed against Pompey, and
            throughout his speech arraigned him as though he were at the bar. He said a great deal
            about me, to my disgust, though it was in very laudatory terms. When he attacked
            Pompey's perfidy to me, he was listened to in profound silence on the part of my
            enemies. Pompey answered him boldly with a palpable allusion to Crassus, and said
            outright that "he would take <pb n="215"/> better precautions to protect his life than
            Mricanus had done, whom C. Carbo had assassinated." <note n="1" anchored="true">In <date
                when="-0129">B.C. 129</date>, after making a speech in favour of the claims of the

                >Scipio</foreign> Aemilianus, the younger Africanus, was found dead in his bed. The
              common report was that he had been assassinated by <foreign xml:lang="la"
                >Carbo</foreign>, or with his privity, but it was never proved (see <bibl
                n="Cic. Orat. 2.170"/><bibl n="Cic. Off. 2">de Orat. 2</bibl>.170). Cicero does not
              here assume the truth of the story he merely repeats Pompey's words. </note>
            Accordingly, important events appear to me to be in the wind. For Pompey understands
            what is going on, and imparts to me that plots are being formed against his life, that
            Gaius Cato is being supported by Crassus, that money is being supplied to Clodius, that
            both are backed by Crassus and Curio, as well as by Bibulus and his other detractors:
            that he must take extraordinary precautions to prevent being overpowered by that
            demagogue-with a people all but wholly alienated, a nobility hostile, a senate
            ill-affected, and the younger men corrupt. So he is making his preparations and
            summoning men from the country. On his part, Clodius is rallying his gangs: a body of
            men is being got together for the Quirinalia. For that occasion we are considerably in a
            majority, owing to the forces brought up by Pompey himself: and a large contingent is
            expected from Picenum and <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gallia</placeName>, to enable us
            to throw out Cato's bills also about 'Milo and Lentulus. On the ioth of February an
            indictment was lodged against Sestius for bribery by the informer Cn. Nerius, of the
            Pupinian tribe, and on the same day by a certain M. Tullius for <note n="2"

            at once, as I was bound to do, to his house, and put myself wholly at his service: and
            that was more than people expected, who thought that I had good cause for being angry
            with him. The result is that my extreme kindness and grateful disposition are made
            manifest both to Sestius himself and to all the world, and I shall be as good as my
            word. But this same informer Nerius also named Cn. Lentulus Vatia and C. Cornelius to
            the commissioners. <note n="3" anchored="true">

            that those who did not break off from them should be liable to the same penalty as those
            convicted of riot." On the 11th of February I spoke in defence of Bestia <note n="1"

            occasion to pave the way beforehand for a refutation of the charges which are being got
            up against Sestius, and I passed a well-deserved encomium upon him with the cordial
            approval of everybody. He was himself very much delighted with it. I tell you this
            because you have often advised me in your letters to retain the friendship of Sestius. I

            popularity: this is a return to old times for you and me effected, my brother, by your

          <p> Our friend Sestius was acquitted on the uth of March, and, what was of great
            importance to the Republic—that there should be no appearance of difference of opinion
            in a case of that sort—was acquitted unanimously. As to what I had often gathered from
            your letters, that you were anxious about—that I should not leave any loophole for abuse
            to an unfriendly critic on the score of my being ungrateful, if I did not treat with the
            utmost indulgence his occasional wrong-headedness—let me tell you that in this trial I
            established my character for being the most grateful of men. For in conducting the
            defence I satisfied in the fullest manner possible a man of difficult temper, and, what
            he above all things desired, I cut up Vatinius (by whom he was being openly attacked)
            just as I pleased, with the applause of gods and men. And, farther, when our friend
            Paullus <note n="1" anchored="true">L. Aemilius Paullus, praetor <date when="-0053">B.C.

              >P. Vatinius, the tribune of <date when="-0059">B.C. 59</date>, who had supported

              afterwards we shall find them ostensibly reconciled. </note> if Licinius Macer
            hesitated to do so, and Macer, rising from Sestius's benches, declared that he would not
            fail. Need I say more? That impudent swaggering fellow Vatinius was overwhelmed with
            confusion and thoroughly discredited. That most excellent boy, your son Quintus, is
            getting on splendidly with his education. I notice this the more because Tyrannio <note

              and shall hear of again in connexion with Cicero's library. </note> gives his lessons

            energetically. I have caused half the money to be paid to your contractor. I hope before
            winter we may be under the same roof. As to our Tullia, who, by Hercules, is very warmly

            consul, and his colleague does not put any difficulty in his way: he is so good, I

              to bar some additional days for public business, and prevent legislation, as later on
              the election of Pompey and Crassus was prevented (<bibl n="TLG385.1 39.30">Dio,

              anchored="true">Gaius <foreign xml:lang="la">Cato</foreign> the tribune, who proposed
              to recall Lentulus. </note> on whom, however, our friend Milo played a very pretty
            trick. For that defender of the employment of gladiators and beast-fighters had bought
            some beast-fighters from Cosconius and Pomponius, and had never appeared in public
            without them in their full armour. He could not afford to maintain <pb n="221"/> them,
            and accordingly had great difficulty in keeping them together. Milo found this out. He
            commissioned an individual, with whom he was not intimate, to buy this troop from Cato
            without exciting his suspicion. As soon as it had been removed, Racilius—at this time
            quite the only real tribune-revealed the truth, acknowledged that the men had been
            purchased for himself—for this is what they had agreed—and put up a notice that he
            intended to sell "Cato's troop." This notice caused much laughter. Accordingly, Lentulus
            has prevented Cato from going on with his laws, and also those who published bills of a
            monstrous description about Caesar, with no tribune to veto them. Caninius's proposal,
            indeed, about Pompey has died a natural death. For it is not approved of in itself, and
            our friend Pompey is also spoken of with great severity for the breach of his friendship
            with Publius Lentulus. He is not the man he was. The fact is that to the lowest dregs of
            the populace his support of Milo gives some offence, while the aristocrats are
            dissatisfied with much that he omits to do, and find fault with much that he does. This
            is the only point, however, in which I am not pleased with Marcellinus- that he handles
            him too roughly. Yet in this he is not going counter to the wishes of the senate:
            consequently I am the more glad towithdrawfrom the senate-house and from politics
            altogether. In the courts I have the same position as I ever had: never was my house
            more crowded. One untoward circumstance has occurred owing to Milo's rashness—the
            acquittal of Sext. Clodius <note n="1" anchored="true">A <foreign xml:lang="la"
                >scriba</foreign> or public clerk, and a client of the patrician Clodii. </note>
            -whose prosecution at this particular time, and by a weak set of accusers, was against
            my advice. In a most Corrupt panel his conviction failed by only three votes.
            Consequently the people clamour for a fresh trial, and he must surely be brought back
            into court. For people will not put up with it, and seeing that, though pleading before
            a panel of his own kidney, he was all but condemned, they look upon him as practically
            condemned. Even in this matter the unpopularity of Pompey was an obstacle in our path.
            For the votes of the senators were largely in his favour, those of the knights were
            equally divided, while the <foreign xml:lang="la">tribuni aerarii</foreign> voted for
            his condemntion. <pb n="222"/> But for this eon'rekmps I am consoled by the daily
            condemnations of my enemies, among whom, to my great delight, Servius <note n="1"
              anchored="true">Unknown. Cicero's words seem to imply that he nearly got convicted,
              but not quite. </note> got upon the rocks: the rest are utterly done for. Gaius Cato
            declared in public meeting that he would not allow the elections to be held, if he were
            deprived of the days for doing business with the people. Appius has not yet returned
            from his visit to Caesar. I am looking forward with extraordinary eagerness to a letter
            from you. Although I know the sea is still closed, yet they tell me that certain persons
            have, nevertheless, arrived from <placeName key="tgn,7001663">Olbia</placeName> full of
            your praises, and declaring you to be very highly thought of in the province. They said
            also that these persons reported that you intended to cross as soon as navigation became
            possible. That is what I desire: but although it is yourself, of course, that I most
            look forward to, yet meanwhile I long for a letter. Farewell, my dear brother. </p>

          <p> I have already sent you a letter containing the information of my daughter Tullia
            having been betrothed to Crassipes on the 4th of April, and other intelligence public
            and private. The following are the events since then. On the 5th of April, by a decree
            of the senate, a sum of money amounting to 40,000 sestertia (about £320,000) was voted
            to Pompey for the business of the corn-supply. But on the same day there was a vehement
            debate on the Campanian land, the senators making almost as much noise as a public
            meeting. The shortness of money and the high price of corn increased the exasperation.
            Nor will I omit the following: the members of the colleges of the Capitolini and the
            Mercuriales <note n="2" anchored="true">In <date when="-00357">B.C. 357</date> a

              consisted of men living on the Capitoline (<bibl n="Liv. 5.50">Livy, 5.50</bibl>). The
              Mercuriates were a "college" or company of merchants who celebrated the rite of the

            <pb n="223"/> expelled from their society a Roman knight named M. Furius Flaccus, a man
            of bad character: the expulsion took place when he was at the meeting, and though he
            threw himself at the feet of each member. On the 6th of April, the eve of my departure
            from town, I gave a betrothal party to Crassipes. That excellent boy, your and my
            Quintus, was not at the banquet owing to a very slight indisposition. On the 7th of
            April I visited Quintus and found him quite restored. He talked a good deal and with
            great feeling about the quarrels between our wives. What need I say more? Nothing could
            have been pleasanter. Pomponia, however, had some Complaints to make of you also: but of
            this when we meet. After leaving your boy I went to the site of your house: the building
            was going on with a large number of workmen. I urged the contractor Longilius to push
            on. He assured me that he had every wish to satisfy us. The house will be splendid, for
            it Can be better seen now than we could judge from the plan: my own house is also being
            built with despatch. On this day I dined with Crassipes. After dinner I went in my sedan
            to visit Pompey at his suburban villa. I had not been able to call on him in the daytime
            as he was away from home. However, I wished to see him, because I am leaving <placeName
              key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> tomorrow, and he is on the point of starting for
              <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName>. I found him at home and begged him
            to restore you to us as soon as possible. "Immediately," he said. He is going to start,
            according to what he said, on the uth of April, with the intention of embarking at
              <placeName key="tgn,7006074">Livorno</placeName> or <placeName key="perseus,Pisa"

          <p> How delighted I was to get your letter! It had been expected by me at first, it is
            true, only with longing, but recently with alarm also. And, in fact, let me tell you
            that this is the only letter which has reached me since the one brought me by your
            sailor and dated <placeName key="tgn,7001663">Olbia</placeName>. But let everything
            else, as you say, be reserved till we can talk it over together. One thing, however, I
            cannot put off: on the 15th of May the senate covered itself with glory by refusing
            Gabinius a <foreign xml:lang="la">supplicatio</foreign>. Procilius <note n="1"
              anchored="true">One of the tribunes. He was convicted of <foreign xml:lang="la"

            such a slight was never inflicted on anyone. Out of doors there is much applause. To me,
            gratifying as it is on its own account, it is even more so because it was done when I
            was not in the house. For it was an unbiassed <note n="2" anchored="true"><foreign
                xml:lang="grc">ei)likrine/s</foreign>, ''pure," '' clear."</note> judgment of the
            senate, without any attack or exercise of influence on my part. The debate previously
            arranged for the 15th and 16th, namely, the question of the Campanian land, did not come
            on. In this matter I don't quite see my way. <note n="3" anchored="true"><foreign

          <p> I thought you would like my book: <note n="1" anchored="true">His poem "On his own
              Times."</note> that you like it as much as you say I am greatly delighted. As to your
            hint about my Urania and your advice to remember the speech of lupiter, <note n="2"
              anchored="true">In his poem <title>de Consulatu suo</title>, the second book of which
                (<foreign xml:lang="la">Urania</foreign>) ends with a speech of Iupiter, who
              recommends his leaving politics for literature.</note> which comes at the end of that
            book, I do indeed remember it, and that whole passage was aimed at myself rather than at
            the rest of the world. Nevertheless, the day after you started I went long before
            daybreak with Vibullius to call on Pompey; and upon addressing him on the subject of the
            works and inscriptions in your honour, <note n="3" anchored="true">A statue in the
              temple of Tellus.</note> he answered me very kindly, gave me great hopes, said he
            would like to talk to Crassus about it, and advised me to do so too. I joined in
            escorting Crassus to his house on his assuming the consulate: he undertook the affair,
            and said that Clodius would at this juncture have something that wanted to get by means
            of himself and Pompey: he thought that, if I did not baulk Clodius's views, I might get
            what I wanted without any opposition. I left the matter entirely in his hands and told
            him that I would do exactly as he wished. Publius Crassus the younger was present at
            this conversation, who, as you know, is very warmly attached to me. What Clodius wants
            is an honorary mission (if not by decree of the senate, then by popular vote) to
              <placeName key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</placeName> or to Brogitarus, or to both.
              <note n="4" anchored="true">Brogitarus was a Galatian and connexion of Deiotarus.
              Clodius, as tribune, had done some services to <placeName key="perseus,Byzantium"

                <foreign xml:lang="la">Cybele</foreign>. He wants now to go and get his money for
              these favours.</note> There is a good deal of money in it. It is a thing I don't
            trouble myself about much, even if I don't get what I am trying to get. Pompey, however,
            has spoken <pb n="249"/> to Crassus. They seem to have taken the business in hand. If
            they carry it through, well and good: if not, let us return to my "Iupiter." On the 11th
            of February a decree passed the senate as to bribery on the motion of Afranius, against
            which I had spoken when you were in the house. To the loudly expressed disapprobation of
            the senate the consuls did not go on with the proposals of those who, while agreeing
            with Afranius's motion, added a rider that after their election the praetors were to
            remain private citizens for sixty days. <note n="1" anchored="true">The praetorian
              elections, like the consular, had been put off till February. Those elected would

              would have been liable if, as in ordinary years, they had been "praetors designate"
              from July to January. Afranius's motion seems to have been for suspending the bribery

            confronted me the first time with an unanswerable excuse—the health of my son: I was

            delicate charm of that old-fashioned courtesy, and of a conversation which is the
            essence of culture. But I did not like to invite a man of weak health to a villa

            writing. But as when we are together we are never at a loss for something to say, so
            ought our letters at times to digress into loose chat. Well then, to begin, the liberty
            of the Tenedians has received short shrift, <note n="1" anchored="true">Lit. "has been
              beheaded with the axe of <foreign xml:lang="la">Tenes</foreign>," mythical founder and
              legislator of <foreign xml:lang="la">Tenedos</foreign>, whose laws were of Draconian
              severity. A <foreign xml:lang="la">legatio</foreign>from <foreign xml:lang="la"
                >Tenedos</foreign>, heard as usual in February, had asked that <foreign
                xml:lang="la">Tenedos</foreign> might be made a <foreign xml:lang="la">libera
                civitas</foreign>. </note> no one speaking for them except myself, Bibulus,
            Calidius, and Favonius. A complimentary reference to you was made by the legates from
              <placeName key="tgn,7002751">Magnesia</placeName> ad Sipylum, they saying that you
            were the man who alone <pb n="266"/> had resisted the demand of L. Sestius Pansa. <note

            days of this business in the senate, if anything occurs which you ought to know, or even
            if there is nothing, I will write you something every day. On the 12th I will not fail
            you or Pomponius. The poems of Lucretius are as you say—with many flashes of genius, yet
            very technical. <note n="2" anchored="true">Lucretius seems to have been now dead,
              according to Donatus 15 October (<date when="-0055">B.C. 55</date>), though the date
              is uncertain. I have translated the reading <foreign xml:lang="la">multi tamen
                artis</foreign>, which has been changed by some to <foreign xml:lang="la">multa
                etiam artis</foreign>. But the contrast in the criticism seems to be between the
              fine poetical passages in the <foreign xml:lang="la">de Rerum Natura</foreign> and the
              mass of technical exposition of philosophy which must have repelled the "general
              reader" at all times. It suggests at once to Cicero to mention another poem on a
              similar subject, the <title>Empedoclea</title> of Sallustius, of which and its writer
              we know nothing. It was not the historian. </note> But when you return, ... if you
            succeed in reading the <title>Empedoclea</title> of Sallustius, I shall regard you as a

          <p> I am glad you like my letter: however, I should not even now have had anything to
            write about, if I had not received yours. For on the 12th, when Appius had got together
            a thinly-attended meeting of the senate, the cold was so great that he was compelled by
            the general clamour <note n="3" anchored="true">Retaining <foreign xml:lang="la">populi
                convicio</foreign>, and explaining <foreign xml:lang="la">populi</foreign> to have
              the general meaning of the crowd, including senators and spectators. Cicero uses
                <foreign xml:lang="la">populus</foreign> in this vague way elsewhere. </note> to
            dismiss us. As to the Commagenian, because I have blown that proposition to the winds,
            Appius makes wonderful advances to me both personally and through Pomponius; for he sees
            that if I adopt a similar style of discussion in the other business, February will not
            bring him anything in. And <pb n="267"/> certainly I did chaff him pretty well, and not
            only wrenched from his grasp that petty township of his—situated in the territory of
              <placeName key="tgn,7017540">Zeugma</placeName> on the <placeName key="tgn,1123842"
              >Euphrates</placeName>
            <note n="1" anchored="true">
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Zeugma</foreign> I take to mean the "territory of <foreign

                >Euphrates</placeName>, part of the Roman province of <placeName key="tgn,1000140"
                >Syria</placeName>, and close to the frontier of <foreign xml:lang="la"
                >Commagene</foreign>. Antiochus had asked that some stronghold should be reckoned as
              his rather than as belonging to the province. </note> —but also raised a loud laugh by
            my satire on the man's purple-edged toga, which he had been granted when Caesar was
            consul. <note n="2" anchored="true">Appius, he insinuates, hoped to make money by
              granting the request of Antiochus, left king of <foreign xml:lang="la"

              right of wearing the <foreign xml:lang="la">toga praetexta</foreign>, which symbolized
              some position with a shadow of Roman' <foreign xml:lang="la">imperium</foreign>, while
              at the same time conveying a compliment to the Roman suzerainty. See Polyb. xxvi;
              30.26; <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 60">Suet. Aug. 60</bibl>. </note> "His wish," said I, "for
            a renewal of the same honour, to save the yearly re-dying of his purple-edged toga, I do

              xml:lang="la">toga praetexta</foreign>, will you allow the Commagenian to do so?" You
            see the style of chaff, and the line I took. I spoke at length against the petty
            princeling, with the result that he was utterly laughed out of court. Alarmed by this
            exhibition, as I said, Appius is making up to me For nothing could be easier than to
            explode the rest of his proposals. But I will not go so far as to trip him up, lest he
            appeal to the god of hospitality, and summon all his Greeks—it is they who make us
            friends again. I will do what Theopompus wants. I had forgotten to write to you about
            Caesar: for I perceive what sort of letter you have been expecting. But the fact is, he
            has written word to Balbus that the little packet of letters, in which mine and Balbus's
            were packed, had been so drenched with rain that he was not even aware that there was a
            letter from me. He had, however, made out a few words of Balbus's letter, to which he
            answered as follows: "I perceive that you have written something about Cicero, which I
            have not fully made out: but, as far I could guess, it was of a kind that I thought was
            more to be wished than hoped for." Accordingly, I afterwards sent Caesar a duplicate
            copy of the letter. Don't be put off by that passage <pb n="268"/> about his want of
            means. In answer to it I wrote back saying that he must not stop payment from any
            reliance on my money chest, and descanted playfully on that subject, in familiar terms
            and yet without derogating from my dignity. His good feeling towards us, however,
            according to all accounts, is marked. The letter, indeed, on the point of which you
            expect to hear, will almost coincide with your return : <note n="1" anchored="true"
              >Quintus was expecting, what he got, the offer of serving under Caesar as <foreign

              the senate, and so give me no news to send you. </note> that there is very great
            danger that Appius may find his house frost-bitten and deserted! <note n="3"
              anchored="true">There is a <foreign xml:lang="la">double entendre</foreign>. Cold

              will be also cold and dull, and that dullness will probably be nowhere so evident as
              in the deserted state of the Consul Appius's house, which in all probability will miss
              its usual bevy of callers. This explanation—put forward by Prof. Tyrrell—is not wholly

          <p> Your "black snow" <note n="1" anchored="true">We cannot tell the allusion, not having
              the letter of Quintus. But he seems to have used the expression for something
              incongruous either in politics, or in regard to his contemplated services with Caesar.
            </note> made me laugh, and I am very glad that you are in a cheerful frame of mind and
            ready for a joke. As to Pompey, I agree with you, or rather you agree with me. For, as
            you know, I have long been singing the praises of your Caesar. Believe me, he is very
            close to my heart, and I am not going to let him slip from his place. Now for the
            history of the Ides (13th). It was Caelius's tenth day. <note n="2" anchored="true">I.e.
              the day he had to appear for trial, usually fixed by the praetor on the tenth day from
              the notice of prosecution. Caelius had been acquitted in <date when="-0056">B.C.
                56</date>, when Cicero defended him; this second trial appears to have in some way
              fallen through. The praetor Domitius is said to be Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus, son of
              Lucius, but he was much too young to have been praetor this year. The former trial of
              Caelius (<date when="-0056">B.C. 56</date>) had been before Cn. Domitius Calvinus,
              hence a difficulty about this passage. For the praetor Domitius of this year is not
              known. Domitius Calvinus was praetor <date when="-0056">B.C. 56</date>. </note>
            Domitius had not obtained a full panel. I am afraid that foul ruffian, Servius Pola,
            will appear for the prosecution. For our friend Caelius has a dead set made at him by
            the Clodian gens. There is nothing certain as yet, but I am afraid. On the same day
            there was a full house for the case of the Tyrians: the <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >publicani</foreign> of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> appeared in <pb
              n="271"/> large numbers against them. Gabinius was abused roundly : <note n="1"
              anchored="true">The <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign> of <placeName
                key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> were enraged with Gabinius for neglecting his
              province while going to <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, thus allowing
              the pirates so to plunder that they could not collect enough dues to recoup them for
              their bargain to the state (<bibl n="TLG385.1 39.59">Dio, 39.59</bibl>). </note> the
              <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign> were also denounced by (the consul)
            Domitius for having escorted him on his start on horseback. Our friend Lucius Lamia was
            somewhat insolent: for on Domitius saying, "It is your fault, equites of <placeName
              key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, that such things have happened: for you give
            verdicts laxly," he said, "Yes, we give verdicts, but you senators give evidence of
            character." <note n="2" anchored="true">L. Aelius <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Lamia</foreign>, an <foreign xml:lang="la">eques</foreign>, appears to have been one
              of the deputation of <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign> who attended the
              senate to accuse Gabinius. </note> Nothing was done that day: the house stood
            adjourned at nightfall. On the comitial days which follow the Quirinalia (17th
            February), Appius holds the view that he is not prevented by the <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >lex Pupia</foreign> from holding a meeting of the senate, and that by the <foreign
              xml:lang="la">lex Gabinia</foreign> he is even compelled to have a meeting for the
            legations from the 1st of February to the 1st of March. <note n="3" anchored="true">The
              praetorian elections were again postponed from the previous year to the early months
              of <date when="-0054">B.C. 54</date>. Appius Claudius found means to put them off till
              March by holding meetings of the senate each day—the electoral <foreign xml:lang="la"
                >comitia</foreign> not being able to meet on the same day as the senate. </note> And
            so the elections are supposed to be put off till March. Nevertheless, on these comitial
            days the tribunes say that they will bring forward the case of Gabinius. <note n="4"
              anchored="true">The tribune C. Memmius was prosecuting Gabinius (Letter CXLVII). The

            and Philistus, in whom I see that you have been wallowing. Callisthenes is a commonplace
            and hackneyed piece of business, like a good many Greeks. The Sicilian is a first-rate

            tending very powerfully to secure our reputation and exalted position in the state. But

            all that warm affection of Caesar for me, which I prefer to all the honours which he
            desires me to expect at his hands. His letter too, despatched at the same time as your
            own—which begins by saying what pleasure your arrival and the renewed memory of our old
            affection had given him, and goes on to say that he will take care that, in the midst of
            my sorrow and regret at losing you, I shall have reason to be <pb n="277"/> glad that
            you are with him of all people—gave me extraordinary delight. Wherefore you, of course,
            are acting in a truly brotherly spirit when you exhort me, though, by heaven, I am now
            indeed forward enough to do so, to concentrate all my attentions upon him alone. Yes, I
            will do so, indeed, with a burning zeal: and perhaps I shall manage to accomplish what
            is frequently the fortune of travellers when they make great haste, who, if they have
            got up later than they intended, have, by increasing their speed, arrived at their
            destination sooner than if they had waked up before daylight. Thus I, since I have long
            overslept myself in cultivating that great man, though you, by heaven, often tried to
            wake me up, will make up for my slowness with horses and (as you say he likes my poem) a
            poet's chariots. Only let me have <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName> to
            paint in colours supplied by yourself, but with my own brush. But what am I saying? What
            prospect of leisure have I, especially as I remain at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
              >Rome</placeName> in accordance with his request? But I will see. For perhaps, as
            usual, my love for you will overcome all difficulties. For my having sent Trebatius to
            him he even thanks me in very witty and polite terms, remarking that there was no one in
            the whole number of his staff who knew how to draw up a recognizance. I have asked him
            for a tribuneship for M. Curtius—since Domitius (the consul) would have thought that he
            was being laughed at, if my petition had been addressed to him, for his daily assertion
            is that he hasn't the appointment of so much as a military tribune: he even jested in
            the senate at his colleague Appius as having gone to visit Caesar, <note n="1"
              anchored="true">At <foreign xml:lang="la">Luca</foreign> in the year <date
                when="-0056">B.C. 56</date>. </note> that he might get from him at least one
            tribuneship. But my request was for next year, for that was what Curtius wished.
            Whatever line you think I ought to take in politics and in treating my opponents, be
            sure I shall take, and shall be "gentler than any ear-lap." Affairs at <placeName
              key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> stand thus: there is some hope of the elections
            taking place, but it is an uncertain one. There is some latent idea of a dictatorship,
              <note n="2" anchored="true">
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Comitia habendi causa</foreign>. No such had been appointed

          <p> Well! this time I'll use a good pen, well-mixed ink, and superfine paper. For you say
            you could hardly read my previous letter, for which, my dear brother, the reason was
            none of those which you suppose. For I was not busy, nor agitated, nor out of temper
            with some one: but it is always my way to take the first pen that turns up and use it as
            if it were a good one. But now attend, best and dearest of brothers, to my answer to
            what you wrote in this same short letter in such a very business-like way. On this
            subject you beg that I should write back to you with brotherly candour, without
            concealment, or reserve, or consideration for your feelings—I mean whether you are to
            hasten home, as we had talked of, or to stay where you are, if there is any excuse for
            doing so, in order to extricate yourself from your embarrassments. If, my dear Quintus,
            it were some small matter on which you were asking my opinion, though I should have left
            it to you to do what you chose, I should yet have shewn you what mine was. But on this
            subject your question amounts to this—what sort of year I expect the next to be? Either
            quite undisturbed as far as we are concerned, or at any rate one that will find us in
            the highest state of preparation for defence. This is shewn by the daily throng at my
            house, my reception in the forum, the cheers which greet me in the theatre. My friends
            feel no anxiety, because they know the strength of my position in my hold upon the
            favour <pb n="279"/> both of Caesar and Pompey. These things give me entire confidence.
            But if some furious outbreak of that madman occurs, everything is ready for crushing
            him. This is my feeling, my deliberate opinion: I write to you with entire confidence. I
            bid you have no doubts, and I do so with no intention of pleasing you, but with
            brotherly frankness. Therefore, while I should wish you to come at the time you
            arranged, for the sake of the pleasure we should have in each other's society, yet I
            prefer the course you yourself think the better one. I, too, think these objects of
            great importance—ample means for yourself and extrication from your load of debt. Make
            up your mind to this, that, free from embarrassments, we should be the happiest people
            alive if we keep well. For men of our habits the deficiency is small, and such as can be
            supplied with the greatest ease, granted only that we keep our health. <milestone
              unit="para"/>There is an enormous recrudescence of bribery. Never was there anything
            equal to it. On the 15th of July the rate of interest rose from four to eight per cent,
            owing to the compact made by Memmius with the consul Domitius : <note n="1"
              anchored="true">For the nature of this compact, see p.300. </note> I wish Scaurus
            could get the better of it. Messalla is very shaky. I am not exaggerating—they arrange
            to offer as much as 10,000 sestertia for the vote of the first century. The matter is a
            burning scandal. The candidates for the tribuneship have made a mutual compact—having
            deposited 500 sestertia apiece with Cato, they agree to conduct their canvass according
            to his direction, with the understanding that anyone offending against it is to be
            condemned by him. If this election then turns out to be pure, Cato will have been of
            more avail than all laws and jurors put together. <pb n="280"/>

          <p> When you receive a letter from me by the hand of an amanuensis, you may be sure that I
            have not even a little leisure; when by my own—a little. For let me tell you that in
            regard to causes and trials in court, I have never been closer tied, and that, too, at
            the most unhealthy season of the year, and in the most oppressively hot weather. But
            these things, since you so direct me, I must put up with, and must not seem to have come
            short of the ideas and expectations which you and Caesar entertain of me, especially
            since, even if it were somewhat difficult not to do that, I am yet likely from this
            labour to reap great popularity and <pb n="290"/> prestige. Accordingly, as you wish me
            to do, I take great pains not to hurt anyone's feelings, and to secure being liked even
            by those very men who are vexed at my close friendship with Caesar, while by those who
            are impartial, or even inclined to this side, I may be warmly courted and loved. When
            some very violent debates took place in the senate on the subject of bribery for several
            days, because the candidates for the consulship had gone to such lengths as to be past
            all bearing, I was not in the house. I have made up my mind not to attempt any Cure of
            the political situation without powerful protection. The day I write this Drusus has
            been acquitted on a charge of collusion by the <foreign xml:lang="la">tribuni
              aerarii</foreign>, in the grand total by four votes, for the majority of senators and
            equites were for condemnation. On the same day I am to defend Vatinius. That is an easy
            matter. The <foreign xml:lang="la">comitia</foreign> have been put off to September.
            Scaurus's trial will take place immediately, and I shall not fail to appear for him. I
            don't like your "Sophoclean Banqueters" at all, though I see that you played your part
            with a good grace. <note n="1" anchored="true">In the "Banqueters" (<foreign
                xml:lang="grc">su/ndeipnoi</foreign>) of Sophocles, Achilles is excluded from a

              occurred to Quintus in camp. </note> I come now to a subject which, perhaps, ought to
            have been my first. How glad I was to get your letter from <placeName key="tgn,7008653"
              >Britain</placeName>! I was afraid of the ocean, afraid of the coast of the island.
            The other parts of the enterprise I do not underrate; but yet they inspire more hope
            than fear, and it is the suspense rather than any positive alarm that renders me uneasy.
            You, however, I can see, have a splendid subject for description, topography, natural
            features of things and places, manners, races, battles, your commander himself—what
            themes for your pen! I will gladly, as you request, assist you in the points you
            mention, and will send you the verses you ask for, that is, "An owl to <placeName

            you are keeping me in the dark. Tell me, my dear brother, what Caesar thinks of my
            verses. For he wrote before to tell me he had read my first book. Of the first part, he
            said that he had never read anything better even in Greek: the rest, up to a particular
            passage, somewhat "careless " <note n="3" anchored="true">
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">r(a|qumo/tera</foreign>. </note> —that is his word. Tell me
            the truth—is it the subject-matter or <pb n="291"/> the "style" that he does not like?
            You needn't be afraid: I shall not admire myself one whit the less. On this subject
            speak like a lover of truth, and with your usual brotherly frankness. </p>

            <dateline>ARPINUM AND ROME, 28 SEPTEMBER</dateline>
          </opener>
          <p> After extraordinarily hot weather—I never remember greater heat—I have refreshed
            myself at <placeName key="perseus,Arpinum">Arpinum</placeName>, and enjoyed the extreme
            loveliness of the river during the days of the games, having left my tribesmen under the
            charge of Philotimus. <note n="1" anchored="true">That is, to get them seats at the
              games. See Letter XXVI, p.63. </note> I was at Arcanum on the 10th of September. There
            I found Mescidius and Philoxenus, and saw the water, for which they were making a course
            not far from your villa, running quite nicely, especially considering the extreme
            drought, and they said that they were going to collect it in much greater abundance.
            Everything is right with <placeName key="tgn,7017431">Herus</placeName>. In your
            Manilian property I came across Diphilus outdoing himself in dilatoriness. Still, he had
            nothing left to construct, except baths, and a promenade, and an aviary. I liked that
            villa very much, because its paved colonnade gives it an air of very great dignity. I
            never appreciated this till now that the colonnade <note n="2" anchored="true">The
                <foreign xml:lang="la">porticus</foreign> is a kind of cloister round the <foreign
                xml:lang="la">peristylium</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="la">atrium</foreign>.
            </note> itself has been all laid open, and the columns have been polished. It all
            depends—and this I will look to—upon the stuccoing being prettily done. The pavements
            seemed to be being well laid. Certain of the ceilings I did not like, and ordered them
            to be changed. As to the place in which they say that you write word that a small
            entrance hall is to be built—namely, in the colonnade—I liked it better as it is. For I
            did not think there was space sufficient for an entrance hall; nor is it usual to have
            one, except in those buildings which have a larger court; nor could it have bedrooms and
            apartments of that kind attached <pb n="292"/> to it. As it is, from the very beauty of
            its arched roof, it will serve as an admirable summer room. However, if you think
            differently, write back word as soon as possible. In the bath I have moved the hot
            chamber to the other corner of the dressing-room, because it was so placed that its
            steam-pipe was immediately under the bedrooms. A fair-sized bedroom and a lofty winter
            one I admired very much, for they were both spacious and well-situated—on the side of
            the promenade nearest to the bath. Diphilus had placed the columns out of the
            perpendicular, and not opposite each other. These, of course, he shall take down; he
            will learn some day to use the plumb-line and measure. On the whole, I hope Diphilus's
            work will be completed in a few months: for Caesius, who was with me at the time, keeps
            a very sharp lookout upon him. Thence I started straight along the <foreign
              xml:lang="la">via Vitularia</foreign> to your Fufidianum, the estate which we bought
            for you a few weeks ago at <placeName key="perseus,Arpinum">Arpinum</placeName> for
            100,000 sesterces. I never saw a shadier spot in summer-water springs in many parts of
            it, and abundant into the bargain. In short, Caesius thought that you would easily
            irrigate fifty <foreign xml:lang="la">jugera</foreign> of the meadow land. For my part,
            I can assure you of this, which is more in my line, that you will have a villa
            marvellously pleasant, with the addition of a fish-pond, spouting fountains, a <foreign
              xml:lang="la">palaestra</foreign>, and a shrubbery. I am told that you wish to keep
            this Bovillae estate. You will determine as you think good. Calvus said that, even if
            the control of the water were taken from you, and the right of drawing it off were
            established by the vendor, and thus an easement were imposed on that property, we could
            yet maintain the price in case we wished to sell. He said that he had agreed with you to
            do the work at three sesterces a foot, and that he had stepped it, and made it three
            miles. It seemed to me more. But I will guarantee that the money could nowhere be better
            laid out. I had sent for Cillo from <placeName key="perseus,Venafrum"
              >Venafrum</placeName>, but on that very day four of his fellow servants and
            apprentices had been crushed by the falling in of a tunnel at <placeName
              key="perseus,Venafrum">Venafrum</placeName>. On the 13th of September I was at
            Laterium. I examined the road, which appeared to me to be so good as to seem almost like
            a high road, except a hundred and fifty paces—for I measured it myself from the little
            bridge at the temple of Furina, in the direction of <placeName key="perseus,Satricum"
              >Satricum</placeName>. There they had put <pb n="293"/> down dust, not gravel (this
            shall be changed), and that part of the road is a very steep incline. But I understood
            that it could not be taken in any other direction, particularly as you did not wish it
            to go through the property of Locusta or Varro. The latter alone had made the road very
            well where it skirted his own property. Locusta hadn't touched it but I will call on him
            at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and think I shall be able to stir him
            up, and at the same time I shall ask M. Taurus, who is now at <placeName
              key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and whom I am told promised to allow you to do
            so, about making a watercourse through his property. I much approved of your steward
            Nicephorius, and I asked him what orders you had given about that small building at
            Laterium, about which you spoke to me. He told me in answer that he had himself
            contracted to do the work for sixteen sestertia, but that you had afterwards made many
            additions to the work, but nothing to the price, and that he had therefore given it up.
            I quite approve, by Hercules, of your making the additions you had determined upon;
            although the villa as it stands seems to have the air of a philosopher, meant to rebuke
            the extravagance of other villas. Yet, after all, that addition will be pleasing. I
            praised your landscape gardener: he has so covered everything with ivy, both the
            foundation-wall of the villa and the spaces between the columns of the walk, that, upon
            my word, those Greek statues seemed to be engaged in fancy gardening, and to be shewing
            off the ivy. Finally, nothing can be cooler or more mossy than the dressing-room of the
            bath. That is about all I have to say about country matters. The gardener, indeed, as
            well as Philotimus and Cincius are pressing on the ornamentation of your town house; but
            I also often look in upon it myself, as I can do without difficulty. Wherefore don't be
            at all anxious about that. <milestone unit="para"/>As to your always asking me about
            your son, of course I "excuse you"; but I must ask you to "excuse" me also, for I don't
            allow that you love him more than I do. And oh that he had been with me these last few
            days at <placeName key="perseus,Arpinum">Arpinum</placeName>, as he had himself set his
            heart on being, and as I had no less done! As to Pomponia, please write and say that,
            when I go out of town anywhere, she is to come with me and bring the boy. I'll do
            wonders with him, if I get him to myself when I am at leisure: for at <placeName
              key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> there is no time to breathe. You <pb n="294"/>
            know I formerly promised to do so for nothing. What do you expect with such a reward as
            you promise me? I now come to your letters which I received in several packets when I
            was at <placeName key="perseus,Arpinum">Arpinum</placeName>. For I received three from
            you in one day, and, indeed, as it seemed, despatched by you at the same time—one of
            considerable length, in which your first point was that my letter to you was dated
            earlier than that to Caesar. Oppius at times cannot help this: the reason is that,
            having settled to send letter-carriers, and having received a letter from me, he is
            hindered by something turning up, and obliged to despatch them later than he had
            intended; and I don't take the trouble to have the day altered on a letter which I have
            once handed to him. You write about Caesar's extreme affection for us. This affection
            you must on your part keep warm, and I for mine will endeavour to increase it by every
            means in my power. About Pompey, I am carefully acting, and shall continue to act, as
            you advise. That my permission to you to stay longer is a welcome one, though I grieve
            at your absence and miss you exceedingly, I am yet partly glad. What you can be thinking
            of in sending for such people as Hippodamus and some others, I do not understand. There
            is not one of those suburban estate. However, there is no reason for your fellows that
            won't expect a present from you equal to a classing my friend Trebatius with them. I
            sent him to Caesar, and Caesar has done all I expected. If he has not done quite what
              <emph>he</emph> expected himself, I am not bound to make it up to him, and I in like
            manner free and absolve you from all claims on his part. Your remark, that you are a
            greater favourite with Caesar every day, is a source of undying satisfaction to me. As
            to Balbus, who, as you say, promotes that state of things, he is the apple of my eye. I
            am indeed glad that you and my friend Trebonius like each other. As to what you say
            about the military tribuneship, I, indeed, asked for it definitely for Curtius, and
            Caesar wrote back definitely to say that there was one at Curtius's service, and chided
            me for my modesty in making the request. If I have asked one for anyone else—as I told
            Oppius to write and tell Caesar—I shall not be at all annoyed by a refusal, since those
            who pester me for letters <emph>are</emph> annoyed at a refusal from me. I like Curtius,
            as I have told him, not only <pb n="295"/> because you asked me to do so, but from the
            character you gave of him; for from your letter I have gathered the zeal he shewed for
            my restoration. As for the British expedition, I conclude from your letter that we have
            no occasion either for fear or exultation. As to public affairs, about which you wish
            Tiro to write to you, I have written to you hitherto somewhat more carelessly than
            usual, because I knew that all events, small or great, were reported to Caesar. I have
            now answered your longest letter. <milestone unit="para"/>Now hear what I have to say to
            your small one. The first point is about Clodius's letter to Caesar. In that matter I
            approve of Caesar's policy, in not having given way to your request so far as to write a
            single word to that Fury. The next thing is about the speech of Calventius "Marius."
              <note n="1" anchored="true">Calventius is said to stand for L. Calpurnius <foreign
                xml:lang="la">Piso</foreign> Caesoninus, the <foreign xml:lang="la">consul</foreign>
              of <date when="-0058">B.C. 58</date>, against whom Cicero's speech was spoken in <date
                when="-0055">B.C. 55</date> in the senate. He calls him Calventius from his maternal
              grandfather, and Marius because—as he had said, in the speech, 20—he had himself gone
              into exile rather than come to open fight with him; just as Q. Metellus had done in
                <date when="-0100">B.C. 100</date>, when, declining to take the oath to the agrarian
              law of Saturninus, rather than fight Marius, who had taken the oath, he went into
              exile. This seems rather a roundabout explanation; but no better has been proposed,
              and, of course, Quintus, who had lately read the speech, would be able better to
              understand the allusion. </note> I am surprised at your saying that you think I ought
            to answer it, particularly as, while no one is likely to read that speech, unless I
            write an answer to it, every schoolboy learns mine against him as an exercise. My books,
            all of which you are expecting, I have begun, but I cannot finish them for some days
            yet. The speeches for Scaurus and Plancius which you clamour for I have finished. The
            poem to Caesar, which I had begun, I have cut short. I will write what you ask me for,
            since your poetic springs are running dry, as soon as I have time. <milestone
              unit="para"/>Now for the third letter. It is very pleasant and welcome news to hear
            from you that Balbus is soon coming to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>,
            and so well accompanied! <note n="2" anchored="true">I.e., with money. </note> and will
            stay with me continuously till the 15th of May. As to your exhorting me in the same
            letter, as in many previous ones, to ambition and labour, I shall, of course, do as you
            say: but when am I to enjoy any real life? <milestone unit="para"/>Your fourth letter
            reached me on the 13th of September, <pb n="296"/> dated on the 10th of August from
              <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>. In it there was nothing new except
            about your <title>Erigona</title>, and if I get that from Oppius I will write and tell
            you what I think of it. I have no doubt I shall like it. <note n="1" anchored="true"
              >This tragedy of Quintus's never reached Cicero. It was lost in transit. Perhaps no
              great loss. </note> Oh yes I had almost forgotten to remark as to the man who, you say
            in your letter, had written to Caesar about the applause given to Milo—I am not
            unwilling that Caesar should think that it was as warm as possible. And in point of fact
            it was so, and yet that applause, which is given to him, seems in a certain sense to be
            given to me. <note n="2" anchored="true">
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Milo</foreign> was aedile and had just given some splendid
              games. </note>
            <milestone unit="para"/>I have also received a very old letter, but which was late in
            coming into my hands, in which you remind me about the temple of Tellus and the
            colonnade of Catulus. Both of these matters are being actively carried out. At the
            temple of Tellus I have even got your statue placed. So, again, as to your reminder
            about a suburban villa and gardens, I was never very keen for one, and now my town house
            has all the charm of such a pleasure-ground. On my arrival in Rome on the 18th of
            September I found the roof on your house finished: the part over the sitting-rooms,
            which you did not wish to have many gables, now slopes gracefully towards the roof of
            the lower colonnade. Our boy, in my absence, did not cease working with his rhetoric
            master. You have no reason for being anxious about his education, for you know his
            ability, and I see his application. Everything else I take it upon myself to guarantee,
            with full consciousness that I am bound to make it good. <milestone unit="para"/>As yet
            there are three parties prosecuting Gabinius: first, L. Lentulus, son of the <foreign
              xml:lang="la">flamen</foreign>, who has entered a prosecution for <foreign
              xml:lang="fr">lèse majesté</foreign>; <note n="3" anchored="true">
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Majestas</foreign>. He would be liable to this charge, under a
              law of Sulla's, for having left his province to interfere in Egypt. </note> secondly,
            Tib. Nero, with good names at the back of his indictment; thirdly, C. Memmius the
            tribune in conjunction with L. Capito. He came to the walls of the city on the 19th of
            September, undignified and neglected to the last degree. But in the present state of the
            law courts I do not venture to be confident of anything. As Cato is unwell, he has not
            yet been formally indicted for extortion. Pompey <pb n="297"/> is trying hard to
            persuade me to be reconciled to him, but as yet he has not succeeded at all, nor, if I
            retain a shred of liberty, will he succeed. I am very anxious for a letter from you. You
            say that you have been told that I was a party to the Coalition of the consular
            candidates—it is a lie. The compacts made in that coalition, afterwards made public by
            Memmius, were of such a nature that no loyal man ought to have been a party to them ;
              <note n="1" anchored="true">See p.300. </note> nor at the same time was it possible
            for me to be a party to a coalition from which Messalla was excluded, who is thoroughly
            satisfied with my conduct in every particular, as also, I think, is Memmius. To Domitius
            himself I have rendered many services, which he desired and asked of me. I have put
            Scaurus under a heavy obligation by my defence of him. It is as yet very uncertain both
            when the elections will be and who will be consuls. <milestone unit="para"/>Just as I
            was folding up this epistle letter-carriers arrived from you and Caesar (20th September)
            after a journey of twenty days. How anxious I was! How painfully I was affected by
            Caesar's most kind letter! <note n="2" anchored="true">Apparently referring to the death
              of his daughter Iulia. </note> But the kinder it was, the more sorrow did his loss
            occasion me. But to turn to your letter. To begin with, I reiterate my approval of your
            staying on, especially as, according to your account, you have consulted Caesar on the
            subject. I wonder that Oppius has anything to do with Publius, for I advised against it.
            Farther on in your letter you say that I am going to be made <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >legatus</foreign> to Pompey on the 13th of September: I have heard nothing about it,
            and I wrote to Caesar to tell him that neither Vibullius nor Oppius had delivered his
            message to Pompey about my remaining at home. Why, I know not. However, it was I who
            restrained Oppius from doing so, because it was Vibullius who should take the leading
            part in that matter: for with him Caesar had communicated personally, with Oppius only
            by letter. I indeed can have no "second thoughts " <note n="3" anchored="true">
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">deute/ras fronti/das</foreign> from <bibl n="Eur. Hipp. 436"

                sofw/terai</foreign>. </note> in matters connected with Caesar. He comes next after
            you and our children in my regard, and not much after. I think I act in this with
            deliberate <pb n="298"/> judgment, for I have by this time good cause for it, yet warm
            personal feeling no doubt does influence me also. <milestone unit="para"/>Just as I had
            written these last words—which are by my own hand—your boy came in to dine with me, as
            Pomponia was dining out. He gave me your letter to read, which he had received shortly
            before—a truly Aristophanic mixture of jest and earnest, with which I was greatly
            charmed. <note n="1" anchored="true">Or, "as kindly and critical at once as <foreign
                xml:lang="la">Aristophanes</foreign> (of Byzantium), "as though Quintus had written
              a Caxtonian criticism of his son's style. </note> He gave me also your second letter,
            in which you bid him cling to my side as a mentor. How delighted he was with those
            letters! And so was I. Nothing could be more attractive than that boy, nothing more
            affectionate to me !—This, to explain its being in another handwriting, I dictated to
            Tiro while at dinner. <milestone unit="para"/>Your letter gratified Annalis very much,
            as shewing that you took an active interest in his concerns, and yet assisted him with
            exceedingly candid advice. Publius Servilius the elder, from a letter which he said he
            had received from Caesar, declares himself highly obliged to you for having spoken with
            the greatest kindness and earnestness of his devotion to Caesar. After my return to Rome
            from Arpinum I was told that Hippodamus had started to join you. I cannot say that I was
            surprised at his having acted so discourteously as to start to join you without a letter
            from me: I only say this, that I was annoyed. For I had long resolved, from an
            expression in your letter, that if I had anything I wished conveyed to you with more
            than usual care, I should give it to him : for, in truth, into a letter like this, which
            I send you in an ordinary way, I usually put nothing that, if it fell into certain
            hands, might be a source of annoyance. I reserve myself for Minucius and Salvius and
            Labeo. Labeo will either be starting late or will stay here altogether. Hippodamus did
            not even ask me whether he could do anything for me. T. Penarius sends me a kind letter
            about you: says that he is exceedingly charmed with your literary pursuits,
            conversation, and above all by your dinners. He was always a favourite of mine, and I
            see a good deal of his brother. Wherefore continue, as you have begun, to admit the
            young man to your intimacy. <pb n="299"/> From the fact of this letter having been in
            hand during many days, owing to the delay of the letter-carriers, I have jotted down in
            it many various things at odd times, as, for instance, the following. Titus Anicius has
            mentioned to me more than once that he would not hesitate to buy a suburban property for
            you, if he found one. In these remarks of his I find two things surprising: first, that
            when you write to him about buying a suburban property, you not only don't write to me
            to that effect, but write even in a contrary sense; and, secondly, that in writing to
            him you totally forget his letters which you shewed me at Tusculum, and as totally the
            rule of Epicharmus, "Notice how he has treated another": <note n="1" anchored="true">
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">gnw=qi pw=s a)/llw| ke/xrhtai</foreign>. </note> in fact, that
            you have quite forgotten, as I think, the lesson conveyed by the expression of his face,
            his conversation, and his spirit. But this is your concern. As to a suburban property,
            be sure to let me know your wishes, and at the same time take care that that fellow
            doesn't get you into trouble. What else have I to say? Anything? Yes, there is this:
            Gabinius entered the city by night on the 27th of September, and today, at two o'clock,
            when he ought to have appeared on his trial for <foreign xml:lang="fr">lèse
              majesté</foreign>, in accordance with the edict of C. Alfius, he was all but crushed
            to the earth by a great and unanimous demonstration of the popular hatred. Nothing could
            exceed his humiliating position. However, Piso comes next to him. So I think of
            introducing a marvellous episode into my second book <note n="2" anchored="true">Of his
              poem "On his own Times." <foreign xml:lang="la">Piso</foreign> in Macedonia, where he
              had been unsuccessful with border tribes: Gabinius in going to Egypt to support
              Ptolemy. He left many of his soldiers there. </note> —Apollo declaring in the council
            of the gods what sort of return that of the two commanders was to be, one of whom had
            lost, and the other sold his army. From Britain I have a letter of Caesar's dated the
            1st of September, which reached me on the 27th, satisfactory enough as far as the
            British expedition is concerned, in which, to prevent my wondering at not getting one
            from you, he tells me that you were not with him when he reached the coast. To that
            letter I made no reply, not even a formal congratulation, on account of his mourning.
            Many, many wishes, dear brother, for your health. <pb n="300"/>

          </opener>
          <p> In the evening of the 10th of October Salvius started on board ship for Ostia with the
            things you wished sent to you from home. On that same day Memmius <note n="4"
              anchored="true">C. Memmius, a tribune of this year, not the same as the C. Memmius
              Gemellus of the last letter. </note> gave Gabinius such a splendid warming in public
            meeting that Calidius couldn't say a word for him. Tomorrow (which is strictly the day
            after tomorrow, for I am writing before daybreak) there is a trial before Cato for the
            selection of his prosecutor between Memmius, Tiberius Nero, and Gaius and Lucius, sons
            of M. Antonius. I think the result will be in favour of Memmius, though a strong case is
            being made out for Nero. In short, he is in a fairly tight fix, unless our friend
            Pompey, to the disgust of gods and men, upsets the whole concern. Let me give you a
            specimen of the fellow's impudence, and extract something amusing from the public
            disasters. Gabinius having given out wherever he came that he was demanding a triumph,
            and having suddenly, the <pb n="304"/> excellent general! invaded the city of his
            enemies by night, <note n="1" anchored="true">Referring to the fact that Gabinius, on
              his arrival outside Rome, without the usual procession of friends which met a
              returning proconsul, skulked about till nightfall, not venturing to enter Rome (the
              city of his enemies!) in daylight. By entering Rome he gave up his <foreign
                xml:lang="la">imperium</foreign> and could no longer ask a triumph. </note> did not
            venture to enter the senate. Meanwhile, exactly on the tenth day, on which he was bound
            to report the number of the enemy and of his own soldiers who had been killed, he slunk
            into the house, which was very thinly attended. When he made as if to go out, he was
            stopped by the consuls. The <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign> were introduced.
            The fellow was assailed on every side, and my words stinging him more than all, he lost
            patience, and in a voice quivering with anger called me "Exile." Thereupon—Heavens I
            never had such a compliment paid me in all my life —the senate rose up to a man with a
            loud shout and made a menacing movement in his direction : the <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >publicani</foreign> made an equal noise and a similar movement. In fine, they all
            behaved exactly as you would have done. It is the leading topic of conversation out of
            the house. However, I refrain from prosecuting, with difficulty, by Hercules ! yet
            refrain I do : either because I don't want to quarrel with Pompey—the impending question
            of Milo is enough in that direction—or because we have no jurors worthy of the name. I
            fear a fiasco: besides, there is the ill-will of certain persons to me, and I am afraid
            my conducting the prosecution might give him some advantage: besides, I do not despair
            of the thing being done both without me and yet partly through my assistance. All the
            candidates for the consulships have had prosecutions for bribery lodged against them:
            Domitius Calvinus by Memmius (the tribune), Memmius (the candidate) by Q. Acutius, an
            excellent young man and a good lawyer, Messalla by Q. Pompeius, Scaurus by Triarius. The
            affair causes great commotion, because it is a plain alternative between shipwreck for
            the men concerned or for the laws. Pressure is being applied to prevent the trials
            taking place. It looks like an <foreign xml:lang="la">interregnum</foreign> again. The
            consuls desire to hold the <foreign xml:lang="la">comitia</foreign>: the accused don't
            wish it, and especially Memmius, because he hopes that Caesar's approach <note n="2"
              anchored="true">Caesar was accustomed to come to North Italy (<foreign xml:lang="la"
                >Gallia Cisalpina</foreign>) for the winter to <foreign xml:lang="la"
                >Ravenna</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="la">Luca</foreign>, and there he could be
              communicated with and exercise great influence. </note>
            <pb n="305"/> may secure him the consulship. But he is at a very low ebb. Domitius, with
            Messalla as his colleague, I think is a certainty. Scaurus has lost his chance. Appius
            declares that he will relieve Lentulus even without a curiate law, <note n="1"
              anchored="true">That is, he would go to his province of <foreign xml:lang="la"
                >Cilicia</foreign> on the strength of his nomination or allotment by the senate.
              There was some doubt as to the question whether such allotment did not give <foreign

                <foreign xml:lang="la">imperium</foreign>, and he might consider it to be
              uninterrupted if he left Rome immediately. However, as there was always an interval
              between the end of the consulship and the quitting Rome <foreign xml:lang="la"
                >paludatus</foreign>, the <foreign xml:lang="la">lex</foreign>
              <foreign xml:lang="la">curiata</foreign> had generally been considered necessary
                (<bibl n="Caes. Civ. 1.6">Caes. B.C. 1.6</bibl>). After <date when="-0052">B.C.
                52</date> the <foreign xml:lang="la">lex Pompeia</foreign> enacted a five years'
              interval, when, of course, a law would be necessary. </note> and, indeed, he
            distinguished himself amazingly that day (I almost forgot to mention it) in an attack
            upon Gabinius. He accused him of <foreign xml:lang="fr">lèse majesté</foreign>, and gave
            the names of his witnesses without Gabinius answering a word. That is all the public
            news. At home all is well : your house itself is being proceeded with by the contractors

          <p> The writing of an amanuensis must shew you the amount of my engagements. I assure you
            that no day passes without my appearing for the defence of some one. Accordingly, all
            composition or reflexion I reserve for the hour of my walk. So stands my business:
            matters at home, however, are everything I could wish. Our boys are well, diligent in
            their studies, and affectionate to me and each other. The decoration of both of our
            houses is still in hand: but your rural works at Arcanum and Laterium are now completed.
            For the rest, as to the water and the road, I went into the case thoroughly, in a
            certain letter of mine, without Omitting anything. <pb n="306"/> But, in truth, the
            anxiety which is now giving me great uneasiness and pain is that for a period of fifty
            days I have heard nothing from you or from Caesar—nothing has found its way from those
            parts, either in the shape of a letter, or even of a rumour. Moreover, both the sea and
            land out there make me uneasy, and I never cease imagining, as one does when one's
            affections are deeply involved, all that I least desire. Wherefore I do not, indeed, for
            the present ask you to write me an account of yourself and your doings, for that you
            never omit doing when possible, but I wish you to know this—that I have scarcely ever
            been so anxious for anything as at the moment of writing I am for a letter from you. Now
            for what is going on in politics. One day after another for the <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >comitia</foreign> is struck out by notices of bad omens, to the great satisfaction of
            all the loyalists: so great is the scandal in which the consuls are involved, owing to
            the suspicion of their having bargained for a bribe from the candidates. The four
            candidates for the consulship are all arraigned : their cases are difficult of defence,
            but I shall do my best to secure the safety of our friend Messalla—and that is
            inseparable from the acquittal of the others. Publius Sulla has accused Gabinius of
            bribery—his stepson Memmius his cousin Caecilius, and his son Sulla backing the
            indictment. L. Torquatus put in his claim to the conduct of the prosecution, and, to
            everybody's satisfaction, failed to establish it. You ask, "What will become of
            Gabinius?" We shall know in three days' time about the charge of <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >lèse majesté</foreign>. In that case he is at a disadvantage from the hatred
            entertained by all classes for him; witnesses against him as damaging as can be:
            accusers in the highest degree inefficient: the panel of jurors of varied character: the
            president a man of weight and decision—Alfius: Pompey active in soliciting the jurors on
            his behalf. What the result will be I don't know; I don't see, however, how he can
            maintain a position in the state. I shew no rancour in promoting his destruction, and
            await the result with the utmost good temper. That is nearly all the news. I will add
            this one item: your boy (who is mine also) is exceedingly devoted to his rhetoric master
            Paeonius, a man, I think, of great experience in his profession, and of very good
            character. But you are aware that my method of instruction aims at a somewhat more <pb
              n="307"/> scholarly and philosophical style. <note n="1" anchored="true">
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">qetikw/teron</foreign>. From <foreign xml:lang="grc"
                >qe/sis</foreign>, a philosophical proposition or thesis. In Paradox. praef. he uses
                <foreign xml:lang="grc">qetika/</foreign> of subjects suited to such theses. </note>
            Accordingly I, for my part, am unwilling that his course of training should be
            interrupted, and the boy himself seems to be more drawn to that declamatory style, and
            to like it better; and as that was the style in which I was myself initiated, let us
            allow him to follow in my path, for I feel sure it will eventually bring him to the same
            point; nevertheless, if I take him with me somewhere in the country, I shall guide him
            to the adoption of my system and practice. For you have held out before me a great
            reward, which it certainly shall not be my fault if I fail to fully obtain. I hope you
            will write and tell me most carefully in what district you are going to pass the winter,
            and what your prospects are. </p>

          <p> Gabinius has been acquitted. Nothing could be more absolutely futile than his accuser,
            Lentulus, and the backers of the indictment, or more corrupt than the jury. Yet, after
            all, had it not been for incredible exertions and entreaties on Pompey's part, and even
            an alarming rumour of a dictatorship, he would not have been able to answer even
            Lentulus; for even as it was, with such an accuser and such a jury, he had thirty-two
            votes out of seventy recorded against him. This trial is altogether so scandalous, that
            he seems certain to be convicted in the other suits, especially in that for extortion.
            But you must see that the Republic, the senate, the law courts are mere ciphers, and
            that not one of us has any constitutional position at all. What else should I tell you
            about the jurors? Two men of praetorian rank were on the panel—Domitius Calvinus, who
            voted for acquittal so openly that everybody could see; and Cato, who, as soon as the
            voting tablets had <pb n="308"/> been counted, withdrew from the ring of people, and was
            the first to tell Pompey the news. Some people—for instance, Sallust—say that I ought to
            have been the prosecuting counsel. Was I to have exposed myself to such a jury as this?
            What would have been my position, if he had escaped when I conducted the case? But there
            were other considerations which influenced me. Pompey would have looked upon it as a
            contest with me, not for that man's safety, but for his own position: he would have
            entered the city; <note n="1" anchored="true">Pompey was outside the <foreign
                xml:lang="la">pomerium</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="la">ad Romam</foreign>) as
              having <foreign xml:lang="la">imperium</foreign>. </note> it would have become a
            downright quarrel; I should have seemed like a Pacideianus matched with the Samnite
            Aeserninus <note n="2" anchored="true">Two gladiators, one incomparably superior to the
              other. </note> —he would, perhaps, have bitten off my ear, <note n="3" anchored="true"
              >A proverbial expression, cp. "snapped my nose off." </note> and at least he would
            have become reconciled to Clodius. For my part, especially if you do not disapprove of
            it, I strongly approve my own policy. That great man, though his advancement had been
            promoted by unparalleled exertions on my part, and though I owed him nothing, while he
            owed me all, yet could not endure that I should differ from him in politics—to put it
            mildly—and, when in a less powerful position, shewed me what he could do against me when
            in my zenith. At this time of day, when I don't even care to be influential, and the
            Republic certainly has no power to do anything, while he is supreme in everything, was I
            to enter upon a contest with him? For that is what I should have had to have done. I do
            not think that you hold me bound to have undertaken it. "Then, as an alternative," says
            the grave Sallust, "you should have defended him, and have made that concession to
            Pompey's earnest wish, for he begged you very hard to do so." An ingenious friend is
            Sallust, to give me the alternative of a dangerous quarrel or undying infamy! I,
            however, am quite pleased with the middle course which I have steered; and another
            gratifying circumstance is that, when I had given my evidence with the utmost solemnity,
            in accordance with my honour and oath, the defendant said that, if he retained his right
            to remain in the city, he would repay me, and did not attempt to cross-question me.
              <milestone unit="para"/>As to the verses which you wish me to compose, it is true <pb
              n="309"/> that I am deficient in industry in regard to them, which requires not only
            time, but also a mind free from all anxiety, but I am also wanting in inspiration. For I
            am not altogether without anxiety as to the coming year, though without fear. At the
            same time, and, upon my word, I speak without irony, I consider you a greater master of
            that style of writing than myself. As to filling up your Greek library, effecting
            interchanges of books, and purchasing Latin books, I should be very glad that your
            wishes should be carried out, especially as they would be very useful to me. But I have
            no one to employ for myself in such a business: for such books as are really worth
            getting are not for sale, and purchases cannot be effected except by an agent who is
            both well-informed and active. However, I will give orders to Chrysippus and speak to
            Tyrannio. I will inquire what Scipio has done about the treasury. I will see that what
            seems to be the right thing is done. As to Ascanio, do what you like: I shall not
            interfere. As to a suburban property, I commend your not being in a hurry, but I advise
            your having one. I write this on the 24th of October, the day of the opening of the
            games, on the point of starting for my Tusculan villa, and taking my dear young Cicero
            with me as though to school (a school not for sport, but for learning), since I did not
            wish to be at any greater distance from town, because I purposed supporting Pomptinus's
              <note n="1" anchored="true">C. Pomptinus, praetor in <date when="-0063">B.C. 63</date>

          <p> You ask me what I have done about the books which I begun to write when in my Cuman
            villa: I have not been idle and am not being idle now; but I have frequently changed the
            whole plan and arrangement of the work. I had already completed two books, in which I
            represented a conversation taking place on the Novendialia held in the consulship of
            Tuditanus and Aquilius, <note n="1" anchored="true">
              <date when="-00129">B.C. 129</date>. The <foreign xml:lang="la">Novendialia</foreign>
              was a nine days' festival on the occasion of some special evil omens or prodigies; for
              an instance (in <date when="-00202">B.C. 202</date>), see Livy, 30, 38. The book
              referred to is that "On the Republic." </note> between Africanus, shortly before his
            death, and Laelius, Philus, Manilius, P. Rutilius, Q. Tubero, and Laelius's sons-in-law,
            Fannius and Scaevola; a conversation which was extended to nine days and the same number
            of books "On the best Constitution of the State" and "On the best Citizen." The work was
            excellently composed, and the rank of the speakers added considerable weight to the
            style. But when these books were read to me in the presence of Sallustius at Tusculum,
            it was suggested to me by him that a discourse on such subjects would come with much
            greater force if I were myself the speaker on the Republic, especially as I was a no
            mere Heraclides Ponticus, <note n="2" anchored="true">I.e., a mere theorist like
                <foreign xml:lang="la">Heraclides</foreign> Ponticus, a pupil of Plato's, whose work
              "On Constitutions" still exists. </note> but an ex-consul, and one who had been
            engaged in the most important affairs in the state: that when I put them in the mouth of
            men of such ancient date they would have an air of unreality: that I had shewn good
            taste in my books about the science of rhetoric in keeping the dialogue of the orators
            apart from myself, and yet had attributed it to men whom I had personally seen: and,
            finally, that Aristotle delivers in the first person his essays "On the Republic "and
            "On the Eminent Man." I was influenced the more by this from the fact that I was unable
            to touch on <pb n="329"/> the most important commotions in our state, because they were
            subsequent to the age of the speakers. Moreover, my express object then was not to
            offend anyone by launching into the events of my own time: as it is, I shall avoid that
            and at the same time be the speaker with you. Nevertheless, when I come to Rome I will
            send you the dialogues as they originally stood. For I fancy that those books will
            convince you that they have not been abandoned by me without some chagrin. <milestone
              unit="para"/>I am extremely gratified by Caesar's affection of which you write to me.
            The offers which he holds out I do not much reckon on, nor have I any thirst for honours
            or longing for glory; and I look forward more to the continuation of his kindness than
            to the fulfillment of his promises. Still, I live a life so prominent and laborious that
            I might seem to be expecting the very thing that I deprecate. As to your request that I
            should compose some verses, you could hardly believe, my dear brother, how short of time
            I am: nor do I feel much moved in spirit to write poetry on the subject you mention. Do
            you really come to me for disquisitions on things that I can scarcely conceive even in
            imagination—you who have distanced everybody in that style of vivid and descriptive
            writing? Yet I would have done it if I could, but, as you will assuredly not fail to
            notice, for writing poetry there is need of a certain freshness of mind of which my
            occupations entirely deprive me. I withdraw myself, it is true, from all political
            anxiety and devote myself to literature; still, I will hint to you what, by heaven, I
            specially wished to have concealed from you. It cuts me to the heart, my dearest
            brother, to the heart, to think that there is no Republic, no law courts, and that my
            present time of life, which ought to have been in the full bloom of senatorial dignity,
            is distracted with the labours of the forum or eked out by private studies, and that the
            object on which from boyhood I had set my heart, <quote>
              <l>Far to excel, and tower above the crowd,</l>
            </quote>
            <note n="1" anchored="true">Hom. 51.6.208. </note> is entirely gone: that my opponents
            have in some cases been left unattacked by me, in others even defended: that <pb n="330"
            /> not only my sympathies, but my very dislikes, are not free: and that Caesar is the
            one man in the world who has been found to love me to my heart's Content, or even, as
            others think, the only one who was inclined to do so. However, there is none of all
            these vexations of such a kind as to be beyond the reach of many daily consolations; but
            the greatest of consolations will be our being together. As it is, to those other
            sources of vexation there is added my very deep regret for your absence. If I had
            defended Gabinius, which Pansa thought I ought to have done, I should have been quite
            ruined: those who hate him—and that is entire orders—would have begun to hate me for the
            sake of their hatred for him. I confined myself, as I think with great dignity, to doing
            only that which all the world saw me do. And to sum up the whole case, I am, as you
            advise, devoting all my efforts to tranquillity and peace. As to the books: Tyrannio is
            a slow-coach : I will speak to Chrysippus, but it is a laborious business and requires a
            man of the utmost industry. I find it in my own case, for, though I am as diligent as
            possible, I get nothing done. As to the Latin books, I don't know which way to turn—they
            are copied and exposed for sale with such a quantity of errors! However, whatever can
            possibly be done I will not neglect to do. Gaius Rebilus, as I wrote to you before, is
            at Rome. He solemnly affirms his great obligations to you, and reports well of your
            health. <note n="1" anchored="true">Reading <foreign xml:lang="la">qui omnia adiurat

            I think the question of the treasury was settled in my absence. When you speak of having
            finished four tragedies in sixteen days, I presume you are borrowing from some one else?
            And do <emph>you</emph> deign to be indebted to others after writing the

            discourage vanity: it means also that we should be aware of our own qualities. But pray

            <salute>TO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN GAUL)</salute>
            <dateline>ROME (NOVEMBER)</dateline>
          </opener>
          <p> The earlier of your two letters is full of irritability and complainings, and you say
            you gave another of the same sort the day before to Labienus, who has not yet
            arrived—but I have nothing to say in answer to it, for your more recent letter has
            obliterated all trace of vexation from my mind. I will only give you this hint and make
            this request, that in the midst of your vexations and labours you should recall what our
            notion was as to your going to Caesar. For our object was not the acquisition of certain
            small and unimportant gains. For what was there of that kind which we should have
            thought worth the price of our separation? What we sought was the strongest possible
            security for the maintenance of our entire political position by the countenance of a
            man of the highest character and most commanding influence. Our interest is not so much
            in the acquisition of sums of money, as in the realization of this hope: all else that
            you get is to be regarded only as a security against actual loss. <note n="1"
              anchored="true">Cicero means, "the substantial gain to be got from your serving under
              Caesar in Gaul is the securing of his protection in the future : all other gains, such
              as money etc., are merely to be regarded as securing you from immediate loss in thus
              going to Gaul: they don't add anything fresh to our position and prospects." </note>
            Wherefore, if you will frequently turn your thoughts back upon what we originally
            proposed to ourselves and hoped to do, you will bear with less impatience the labours of
            military service of which you speak and the <pb n="335"/> other things which annoy you,
            and, nevertheless, will resign them whenever you choose. But the right moment for that
            step is not yet come, though it is now not far off. Furthermore, I give you this
            hint—don't commit anything at all to writing, the publication of which would be annoying
            to us. There are many things that I would rather not know than learn at some risk. I
            shall write at greater length to you with a mind less preoccupied, when my boy Cicero
            is, as I hope he will be, in a good state of health. Pray be careful to let me know to
            whom I should give the letter which I shall then send you—to Caesar's letter-carriers,
            for him to forward them direct to you, or to those of Labienus? For where your Nervii
            dwell, and how far off, I have no idea. <note n="1" anchored="true">Quintus had his
              winter quarters among the <foreign xml:lang="la">Nervii</foreign>, in a town near the
              modern Charleroi. In this winter he was in great danger from a sudden rising of the
                <foreign xml:lang="la">Nervii</foreign> and other tribes (<bibl n="Caes. Gal. 5.24"
                >Caes. B. G. 5.24</bibl>-49). </note> I derived great pleasure from your letter
            describing the courage and dignity displayed (as you say) by Caesar in his extreme
            sorrow. You bid me finish the poem in his honour which I had begun; and although I have
            been diverted from it by business, and still more by my feelings, yet, since Caesar
            knows that I did begin something, I will return to my design, and will complete in these
            leisure days of the "supplications," <note n="2" anchored="true">Twenty days of <foreign
                xml:lang="la">supplicatio</foreign> had been decreed in honour of Caesar's campaigns
              of <date when="-0055">B.C. 55</date> (<bibl n="Caes. Civ. 4.38">Caes. B.C.
              4.38</bibl>). </note> during which I greatly rejoice that our friend Messalla and the
            rest are at last relieved from worry. In reckoning on him as certain to be consul with
            Domitius, you are quite in agreement with my own opinion. I will guarantee Messalla to
            Caesar: but Memmius Cherishes a hope, founded on Caesar's return to Italy, in which I
            think he is under a mistake. He is, indeed, quite out of it here. Scaurus, again, has
            been long ago thrown over by Pompey. The business has been put off: the <foreign
              xml:lang="la">comitia</foreign> postponed and postponed, till we may expect an
              <foreign xml:lang="la">interregnum</foreign>. The rumour of a dictator is not pleasing
            to the aristocrats; for myself, I like still less what they say. But the proposal, as a
            whole, is looked upon with alarm, and grows unpopular. Pompey says outright that he
            doesn't wish it: to me previously he used not personally to deny the wish. Hirrus seems
            likely to be the proposer. Ye gods ! what folly! <pb n="336"/> How in love with himself
            and without—a rival! He has Commissioned me to choke off Caelius Vinicianus, a man much
            attached to me. Whether Pompey wishes it or not, it is difficult to be sure. However, if
            it is Hirrus who makes the proposal, he will not convince people that he does not wish
            it. There is nothing else being talked about in politics just now; at any rate, nothing
            else is being done. The funeral of the son of Serranus Domesticus took place in very
            melancholy circumstances on the 23rd of November. His father delivered the funeral
            Oration which I composed for him. Now about Milo. Pompey gives him no support, and is
            all for Gutta, saying also that he will secure Caesar on his side. Milo is alarmed at
            this, and no wonder, and almost gives up hope if Pompey is created dictator. If he
            assists anyone who vetoes the dictatorship by his troop and bodyguard, <note n="1"
              anchored="true">His gladiators, which he kept in training for the games he was going
              to give in honour of a deceased friend. </note> he fears he may excite Pompey's
            enmity: if he doesn't do so, he fears the proposal may be carried by force. He is
            preparing games on a most magnificent scale, at a cost, I assure you, that no one has
            ever exceeded. It is foolish, on two or even three accounts, to give games that were not
            demanded—he has already given a magnificent show of gladiators : he cannot afford it: he
            is only an executor, and might have reflected that he is now an executor, not an aedile.
            That is about all I had to write. Take care of yourself, dearest brother. </p>

          <p> In regard to Gabinius, I had not to carry out any of the measures which you suggested
            with such affectionate solicitude. "May the earth swallow me rather, etc.! <note n="2"

                n="Hom. Il. 4.182">Hom. Il. 4.182</bibl>. </note> I acted with very great dignity
            and also with the greatest consideration. <pb n="337"/> I neither bore hardly on him nor
            helped him. I gave strong evidence, in other respects I did not stir. The disgraceful
            and mischievous result of the trial I bore with the utmost serenity. And this is the
            advantage which, after all that has happened, has accrued to me—that I am not even
            affected in the least by those evils in the state and the licentious conduct of the
            shameless, which used formerly to make me burst with indignation : for anything more
            abandoned than the men and the times in which we are living there cannot be.
            Accordingly, as no pleasure can possibly be got from politics, I don't know why I should
            lose my temper. Literature and my favourite studies, along with the retirement of my
            country houses, and above all our two boys, furnish my enjoyments. The one man who vexes
            me is Milo. But I hope an end will be put to my anxieties by his getting the consulship:
            and to obtain this for him I shall struggle as hard as I did for my own, and you, I am
            sure, will continue to give assistance from over there. In his case other things are all
            secure, unless it is snatched from his grasp by downright violence: it is about his
            means that I am frightened: <quote>
              <l>For he is now beyond all bearing mad,</l>

              51.8.355). The numerals seem doubtful. According to some MSS. the amount would be
              10,000,000. </note> to spend 1,000,000 sesterce on his games. His want of prudence in
            this one particular I shall put up with as well as I can, and you should be
            strong-minded enough to do the same. In mentioning the changes to be expected next year,
            I didn't mean you to understand me to refer to domestic alarms : the reference was
            wholly to the state of the Republic, in which, though not charged with any actual duty,
            I can scarcely discharge myself from all anxiety. Yet how cautious I would have you be
            in writing you may guess from the fact that I do not mention in my letters to you even
            open acts of disorder in the state, lest my letter should be intercepted and give
            offence to the feelings of anyone. Wherefore, as far as domestic affairs are concerned,
            I would have you be quite easy: in politics I know how anxious you always are. I can see
            that our friend Messalla will <pb n="338"/> be consul, if by means of an <foreign
              xml:lang="la">interrex</foreign>, without any prosecution, if by that of a dictator,
            without danger of conviction. He is not disliked by anyone. Hortensius's warm support
            will stand him in good stead. Gabinius's acquittal is looked upon as a general act of
            indemnity. <foreign xml:lang="fr">En passant</foreign>: nothing has, after all, been
            done as yet about a dictatorship. Pompey is out of town; Appius is intriguing darkly;
            Hirrus is paving the way: there are many tribunes calculated on to veto it: the people
            are indifferent: the leading men disinclined to it: I don't stir a finger. I am
            exceedingly obliged for your promises as to slaves, and I am indeed, as you say,
            shorthanded both at Rome and on my estates. But pray do nothing for my convenience
            unless it entirely suits your own, and your means. About the letter of Vatinius I
            laughed heartily. But though I know I am being watched by him, I can swallow his hatred
            and digest it too. You urge me to "finish": well, I have finished what, in my own
            opinion at least, is a very pretty "epic " on Caesar, but I am in search of a
            trustworthy letter-carrier, lest it should share the fate of your <title>Erigona</title>
            <note n="1" anchored="true">The tragedy written by Quintus and lost in transit. </note>
            —the only personage who has missed a safe journey from Gaul during Caesar's
            governorship. <milestone unit="para"/>What? because I had no good stone was I to pull
            down the whole building ?—a building which I like better every day of my life: the lower
            court especially and the chambers attached to it are admirable. As to Arcanum, it is a
            building worthy of Caesar, or, by heaven, of some one even more tasteful still. For your
            statues, <foreign xml:lang="la">palaestra</foreign>, fish-pond, and conduit are worthy
            of many Philotimuses, and quite above your Diphiluses. But I will visit them personally,
            as well as sending men to look after them and giving orders about them. As to the will
            of Felix, you will complain more when you know all. For the document which he believed
            himself to have sealed, in which your name was most certainly entered as heir to a
            twelfth, this, by a mistake of his own and of his slave Sicura, he did not seal: while
            the one which he did not intend to seal he did seal. But let it go hang, so long as we
            keep well! I am as devoted to your son Cicero as you can wish, and as he deserves, and
            as I am bound to be. However, I am letting him leave me, both to <pb n="339"/> avoid
            keeping him from his teachers, and because his mother is leaving, without whom I am very
            much alarmed as to the boy's large appetite. Yet, after all, we see a great deal of each
            other. I have now answered all your letters. Dearest and best of brothers, good-bye.

            <milestone unit="section" n="1"/> Though I have no doubt that many messengers,<note
              anchored="true">Quintus Cicero was praetor in <date when="-0062">B.C. 62</date>. In
                <date when="-0061">B.C. 61</date> (March) he went out to "<placeName
                key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>" as propraetor; his first year of office would be
              up in March, <date when="-0060">B.C. 60</date>, but his governorship was, as was very
              common, extended till March, <date when="-0059">B.C. 59</date>. Towards the end of
                <date when="-0060">B.C. 60</date> the senate seems to have arranged not to appoint
              his successor, that is, he would be left in office till about March, <date
                when="-0058">B.C. 58</date>. It is in view of this third year of office that Cicero
              writes this essay-letter to him on the duties of a provincial governor. Apparently
              Quintus bad faults of temper which had caused some scandals to reach <placeName
                key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. We have seen how he was one of the few who
              managed to quarrel with <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticus;</foreign> and in <date
                when="-0048">B.C. 48</date> we shill find how fiercely he resented the exercise of
              his brother's influence which had led him to take the losing side, which from his
              attachment to Caesar he may have been half inclined to think the wrong side. His
              constant squabbles with his wife (though the fault was evidently in great part hers)
              also go towards forming our conclusion about him that, with some ability and honesty,
              he was <foreign xml:lang="fr">un peu difficile</foreign>.</note> and even common
            rumour, with its usual speed, will anticipate this letter, and that you will already
            have heard from others that a third year has been added to my loss and your labour, yet
            I thought you ought to receive from me also the news of this tiresome circumstance. For
            not in one, but in several of my previous letters, in spite of others having given up
            the idea in despair, I gave you hope of being able at an early date to quit your
            province, not only that I might as <pb n="71"/> long as possible cheer you with a
            pleasurable belief, but also because I and the praetors took such pains in the matter,
            that I felt no misgiving as to the possibility of its being arranged. As it is, since
            matters have so turned out that neither the praetors by the weight of their influence,
            nor I by my earnest efforts, have been able to prevail, it is certainly difficult not to
            be annoyed, yet our minds, practised as they are in conducting and supporting business
            of the utmost gravity, ought not to be crushed or weakened by vexation. And since men
            ought to feel most vexed at what has been brought upon them by their own fault, it is I
            who ought in this matter to be more vexed than you. For it is the result of a fault on
            my part, against which you had protested both in conversation at the moment of your
            departure, and in letters since, that your successor was not named last year. In this,
            while consulting for the interests of our allies, and resisting the shameless conduct of
            some merchants, and while seeking the increase of our reputation by your virtues, I
            acted unwisely, especially as I made it possible for that second year to entail a third.
            And as I confess the mistake to have been mine, it lies with your wisdom and kindness to
            remedy it, and to see that my imprudence is turned to advantage by your careful
            performance of your duties. And truly, if you exert yourself in every direction to earn
            men's good word, not with a view to rival others, but henceforth to surpass yourself, if
            you rouse your whole mind and your every thought and care to the ambition of gaining a
            superior reputation in all respects, believe me, one year added to your labour will
            bring us, nay, our posterity also, a joy of many years' duration. Wherefore I begin by
            entreating you not to let your soul shrink and be cast down, nor to allow yourself to be
            overpowered by the magnitude of the business as though by a wave; but, on the contrary,
            to stand upright and keep your footing, or even advance to meet the flood of affairs.
            For you are not administering a department of the state, in which fortune reigns
            supreme, but one in which a well-considered policy and an attention to business are the
            most important things. But if I had seen you receiving the prolongation of a command in
            a great and dangerous war, I should have trembled in spirit, because I should have <pb
              n="72"/> known that the dominion of fortune over us had been at the same time
            prolonged. As it is, however, a department of the state has been entrusted to you in
            which fortune occupies no part, or, at any rate, an insignificant one, and which appears
            to me to depend entirely on your virtue and self-control. We have no reason to fear, as
            far as I know, any designs of our enemies, any actual fighting in the field, any revolts
            of allies, any default in the tribute or in the supply of corn, any mutiny in the army:
            things which have very often befallen the wisest of men in such a way, that they have
            been no more able to get the better of the assault of been granted profound peace, a
            dead calm: yet if the pilot fortune, than the best of pilots a violent tempest. You have
            falls asleep, it may even so overwhelm him, though if he keeps awake it may give him
            positive pleasure. For your province consists, in the first place, of allies of a race
            which; of all the world, is the most civilized; and, in the second place, of Citizens,
            who, either as being <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign> are very closely
            connected with me, or, as being traders who have made money, think that they owe the
            security of their property to my consulship. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But it
            may be said that among even such men as these there occur serious disputes, many
            wrongful acts are committed, and hotly contested litigation is the result. As though I
            ever thought that you had no trouble to contend with! I know that the trouble is
            exceedingly great, and such as demands the very greatest prudence; but remember that it
            is prudence much more than fortune on which, in my opinion, the result of your trouble
            depends. For what trouble is it to govern those over whom you are set, if you do but
            govern yourself? That may be a great and difficult task to others, and indeed it is most
            difficult: to you it has always been the easiest thing in the world, and indeed ought to
            be so, for your natural disposition is such that, even without discipline, it appears
            capable of self-control; whereas a discipline has, in fact, been applied that might
            educate the most faulty of characters. But while you resist, as you do, money, pleasure,
            and every kind of desire yourself, there will, I am to be told, be a risk of your not
            being able to suppress some fraudulent banker or some rather over-extortionate
            tax-collector! For as to the Greeks, they will think, as they behold the innocence of
              <pb n="73"/> your life, that one of the heroes of their history, or a demigod from
            heaven, has come down into the province. And this I say, not to induce you to act thus,
            but to make you glad that you are acting or have acted so. It is a splendid thing to
            have been three years in supreme power in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>
            without allowing statue, picture, plate, napery, slave, anyone's good looks, or any
            offer of money—all of which are plentiful in your province—to cause you to swerve from
            the most absolute honesty and purity of life. What can be imagined so striking or so
            desirable as that a virtue, a command over the passions, a self-control such as yours,
            are not remaining in darkness and obscurity, but have been set in the broad daylight of
              <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, before the eyes of a famous province,
            and in the hearing of all nations and peoples? That the inhabitants are not being ruined
            by your progresses, drained by your charges, agitated by your approach? That there is
            the liveliest joy, public and private, wheresoever you come, the city regarding you as a
            protector and not a tyrant, the private house as a guest and not a plunderer? <milestone
              unit="section" n="3"/></p>
          <p>But in these matters I am sure that mere experience has by this time taught you that it
            is by no means sufficient to have these virtues yourself, but that you must keep your
            eyes open and vigilant, in order that in the guardianship of your province you may be
            considered to vouch to the allies, the citizens, and the state, not for yourself alone,
            but for all the subordinates of your government. However, you have in the persons of
            your <foreign xml:lang="la">legati</foreign> men likely to have a regard for their own
            reputation. Of these in rank, position, and age Tubero is first; who, I think,
            particularly as he is a writer of history, could select from his own Annals many whom he
            would like and would be able to imitate. Allienus, again, is ours, as well in heart and
            affection, as in his conformity to our principles. I need not speak of Gratidius: I am
            sure that, while taking pains to preserve his own reputation, his fraternal affection
            for us makes him take pains for ours also. <note n="1" anchored="true">Of the persons
              mentioned, L. Aelius <foreign xml:lang="la">Tubero</foreign> is elsewhere praised as a
              man of learning (<bibl n="Cic. Lig. 10">pro Lig. § 10</bibl>); A. Allienus (praetor
                <date when="-0049">B.C. 49</date>) was a friend and Correspondent; M. Gratidius is
              mentioned in <bibl n="Cic. Flac. 49">pro Flacco, § 49</bibl>, as acting in a judicial
              capacity, and was perhaps a cousin of Cicero's. </note> Your quaestor is not of your
            own selection, but the one assigned you by lot. He is bound both to act with propriety
              <pb n="74"/> of his own accord, and to conform to the policy and principles which you
            lay down. But should any one of these adopt a lower standard of conduct, you should
            tolerate such behaviour, if it goes no farther than a breach, in his private capacity,
            of the rules by which he was bound, but not if it goes to the extent of employing for
            gain the authority which you granted him as a promotion. For I am far from thinking,
            especially since the moral sentiments of the day are so much inclined to excessive
            laxity and self-seeking, that you should investigate every case of petty misconduct, and
            thoroughly examine every one of these persons; but that you should regulate your
            confidence by the trustworthiness of its recipient. And among such persons you will have
            to vouch for those whom the Republic has itself given you as companions and assistants
            in public affairs, at least within the limits which I have before laid down. <milestone
              unit="section" n="4"/></p>
          <p>In the case, however, of those of your personal staff or official attendants whom you
            have yourself selected to be about you—who are usually spoken of as a kind of praetor's
            cohort—we must vouch, not only for their acts, but even for their words. But those you
            have with you are the sort of men of whom you may easily be fond when they are acting
            rightly, and whom you may very easily check when they show insufficient regard for your
            reputation. By these, when you were raw to the work, your frank disposition might
            possibly have been deceived—for the better a man is the less easily does he suspect
            others of being bad—now, however, let this third year witness an integrity as perfect as
            the two former, but still more wary and vigilant. Listen to that only which you are
            supposed to listen to; don't let your ears be open to whispered falsehoods and
            interested suggestions. Don't let your signet ring be a mere implement, but, as it were,
            your second self: not the minister of another's will, but a witness of your own. Let
            your marshal hold the rank which our ancestors wished him to hold, who, looking upon
            this place as not one of profit, but of labour and duty, scarcely ever conferred it upon
            any but their freedmen, whom they indeed controlled almost as absolutely as their
            slaves. Let the lictor be the dispenser of your clemency, not his own; and let the
            fasces and axes which they carry before you constitute ensigns rather of rank than of
            power. Let it, in fact, <pb n="75"/> be known to the whole province that the life,
            children, fame, and fortunes of all over whom you preside are exceedingly dear to you.
            Finally, let it be believed that you will, if you detect it, be hostile not only to
            those who have accepted a bribe, but to those also who have given it. And, indeed, no
            one will give anything, if it is made quite clear that nothing is usually obtained from
            you through those who pretend to be very influential with you. Not, however, that the
            object of this discourse is to make you over-harsh or suspicious towards your staff. For
            if any of them in the course of the last two years has never fallen under suspicion of
            rapacity, as I am told about Caesius and Chaerippus and Labeo—and think it true, because
            I know them—there is no authority, I think, which may not be entrusted to them, and no
            confidence which may not be placed in them with the utmost propriety, and in anyone else
            like them. But if there is anyone of whom you have already had reason to doubt, or
            concerning whom you have made some discovery, in such a man place no confidence, intrust
            him with no particle of your reputation. V. If, however, you have found in the province
            itself anyone, hitherto unknown to us, who has made his way into intimacy with you, take
            care how much confidence you repose in him; not that there may not be many good
            provincials, but, though we may hope so, it is risky to be positive. For everyone's real
            character is covered by many wrappings of pretence and is concealed by a kind of veil:
            face, eyes, expression very often lie, speech most often of all. Wherefore, how can you
            expect to find in that class <note n="1" anchored="true">The class of Romans who have
              practically become provincials. </note> any who, while foregoing for the sake of money
            all from which we can scarcely tear ourselves away, <note n="2" anchored="true"
                ><placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and its society and interests.
            </note> will yet love you sincerely and not merely pretend to do so from interested
            motives? I think, indeed, it is a hard task to find such men, especially if we notice
            that the same persons care nothing for almost any man out of office, yet always with one
            consent show affection for the praetors. But of this class, if by chance you have
            discovered any one to be fonder of you—for it may so happen—than of your office, such a
            man indeed gladly admit upon <pb n="76"/> your list of friends: but if you fail to
            perceive that, there is no Class of people you must be more on your guard against
            admitting to intimacy, just because they are acquainted with all the ways of making
            money, do everything for the sake of it, and have no consideration for the reputation of
            a man with whom they are not destined to pass their lives. And even among the Greeks
            themselves you must be on your guard against admitting close intimacies, except in the
            case of the very few, if such are to be found, who are worthy of ancient <placeName
              key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>. As things now stand, indeed, too many of them
            are untrustworthy, false, and schooled by long servitude in the arts of extravagant
            adulation. My advice is that these men should all be entertained with courtesy, but that
            close ties of hospitality or friendship should only be formed with the best of them:
            excessive intimacies with them are not very trustworthy—for they do not venture to
            oppose our wishes—and they are not only jealous of our countrymen, but of their own as
            well. VI. And now, considering the caution and care that I would show in matters of this
            kind—in which I fear I may be somewhat over-severe—what do you suppose my sentiments are
            in regard to slaves? Upon these we ought to keep a hold in all places, but especially in
            the provinces. On this head many rules may be laid down, but this is at once the
            shortest and most easily maintained—that they should behave during your progresses in
              <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> as though you were travelling on the
            Appian way, and not suppose that it makes any difference whether they have arrived at
              <placeName key="tgn,7002359">Tralles</placeName> or <placeName key="perseus,Formiae"
              >Formiae</placeName>. But if, again, any one of your slaves is conspicuously
            trustworthy, employ him in your domestic and private affairs; but in affairs pertaining
            to your office as governor, or in any department of the state, do not let him lay a
            finger. For many things which may, with perfect propriety, be in-trusted to slaves, must
            yet not be so entrusted, for the sake of avoiding talk and hostile remark. But my
            discourse, I know not how, has slipped into the didactic vein, though that is not what I
            proposed to myself originally. For what right have I to be laying down rules for one
            who, I am fully aware, in this subject especially, is not my inferior in wisdom, while
            in experience he is even my superior? Yet, after all, if your actions had the additional
            weight of my approval, I <pb n="77"/> thought that they would seem more satisfactory to
            yourself. Wherefore, let these be the foundations on which your public character rests:
            first and foremost your own honesty and self-control, then the scrupulous conduct of all
            your staff, the exceedingly cautious and careful selection in regard to intimacies with
            provincials and Greeks, the strict and unbending government of your slaves. These are
            creditable even in the conduct of our private and everyday business: in such an
            important government, where morals are so debased and the province has such a corrupting
            influence, they must needs seem divine. Such principles and conduct on your part are
            sufficient to justify the strictness which you have displayed in some acts of
            administration, owing to which I have encountered certain personal disputes with great
            satisfaction, unless, indeed, you suppose me to be annoyed by the complaints of a fellow
            like Paconius—who is not even a Greek, but in reality a Mysian or Phrygian—or by the
            words of Tuscenius, a madman and a knave, from whose abominable jaws you snatched the
            fruits of a most infamous piece of extortion with the most complete justice. <milestone
              unit="section" n="7"/></p>
          <p>These and similar instances of your strict administration in your province we shall
            find difficulty in justifying, unless they are accompanied by the most perfect
            integrity: wherefore let there be the greatest strictness in your administration of
            justice, provided only that it is never varied from favour, but is kept up with
            impartiality. But it is of little avail that justice is administered by yourself with
            impartiality and care, unless the same is done by those to whom you have entrusted any
            portion of this duty. And, indeed, in my view there is no very great variety of business
            in the government of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>: the entire province
            mainly depends on the administration of justice. In it we have the whole theory of
            government, especially of provincial government, clearly displayed: all that a governor
            has to do is to show consistency and firmness enough, not only td resist favouritism,
            but even the suspicion of it. To this also must be added courtesy in listening to
            pleaders, consideration in pronouncing a decision, and painstaking efforts to convince
            suitors of its justice, and to answer their arguments. It is by such habits that C.
            Octavius has recently made himself <pb n="78"/> very popular; <note n="1"
              anchored="true">Father of Augustus, governor of <placeName key="tgn,7006667"

              to his praetorship (<date when="-0061">B.C. 61</date>) at <placeName
                key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; at any rate, as well as to his conduct in

            first time, <note n="2" anchored="true">Reading <foreign xml:lang="la">primum</foreign>;
              others <foreign xml:lang="la">primus</foreign>, "his head <foreign xml:lang="la"
                >lictor</foreign>." </note> the lictor did not interfere, and the marshal kept
            silence, while every suitor spoke as often and as long as he chose. In which conduct he
            would perhaps have been thought over-lax, had it not been that this laxity enabled him
            to maintain the following in stance of severity. The partisans of Sulla were forced to
            restore what they had taken by violence and terrorism. Those who had made inequitable
            decrees; while in office, were now as private citizens forced to submit to the
            principles they had established. This strictness on his part would have been thought
            harsh, had it not been rendered palatable by many sweetening influences of courtesy. But
            if this gentleness was sufficient to make him popular at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
              >Rome</placeName>, where there is such haughtiness of spirit, such unrestrained
            liberty, such unlimited licence of individuals, and, in fine, so many magistrates, so
            many means of obtaining protection, such vast power in the hands of the popular
            assembly, and such influence exercised by the senate, how welcome must a praetor's
            courtesy be in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, in which there is such a
            numerous body of citizens and allies, so many cities, so many communities, all hanging
            on one man's nod, and in which there are no means of protection, no one to whom to make
            a complaint, no senate, no popular assembly! Wherefore it requires an exalted character,
            a man who is not only equitable from natural impulse, but who has also been trained by
            study and the refinements of a liberal education, so to conduct himself while in the
            possession of such immense power, that those over whom he rules should not feel the want
            of any other power. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/></p>
          <p>Take the case of the famous Cyrus, portrayed by Xenophon, not as an historical
            character, but as a model of righteous government, the serious dignity of whose
            character is represented by that philosopher as combined with a peculiar courtesy. And,
            indeed, it is not without reason that our hero Africanus used perpetually to have those
            books in his hands, for there is no duty pertaining to a careful and equitable governor
            which is not to be found in them. Well, if he <pb n="79"/> cultivated those qualities,
            though never destined to be in a private station, how carefully ought those to maintain
            them to whom power is given with the understanding that it must be surrendered, and
            given by laws under whose authority they must once more come? In my opinion all who
            govern others are bound to regard as the object of all their actions the greatest
            happiness of the governed. That this is your highest object, and has been so since you
            first landed in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, has been published abroad
            by Consistent rumour and the conversation of all. It is, let me add, not only the duty
            of one who governs allies and citizens, but even of one who governs slaves and dumb
            animals, to serve the interests and advantage of those under him. In this point I notice
            that everyone agrees that you take the greatest pains: no new debt is being contracted
            by the states, while many have been relieved by you from a heavy and long-standing one.
            Several cities that had become dilapidated and almost deserted—of which one was the most
            famous state in <placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName>, the other in <placeName
              key="tgn,7002358">Caria</placeName>, Samus and Halicarnassus—have been given a new
            life by you: there is no party fighting, no civil strife in the towns: you take care
            that the government of the states is administered by the best class of citizens:
            brigandage is abolished in <placeName key="tgn,7016748">Mysia</placeName>; murder
            suppressed in many districts; peace is established throughout the province; and not only
            the robberies usual on highways and in country places, but those more numerous and more
            serious ones in towns and temples, have been completely stopped: the fame, fortunes, and
            repose of the rich have been relieved of that most oppressive instrument of praetorial
            rapacity-vexatious prosecution; the expenses and tribute of the states are made to fall
            with equal weight on all who live in the territories of those states: access to you is
            as easy as possible: your ears are open to the complaints of all: no man's want of means
            or want of friends excludes him, I don't say from access to you in public and on the
            tribunal, but -even from your house and chamber: in a word, throughout your government
            there is no harshness or cruelty-everywhere clemency, mildness, and kindness reign
            supreme. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/></p>
          <p>What an immense benefit, again, have you done in having liberated <placeName
              key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> from the tribute exacted by the aediles, a measure
            which cost me some violent controversies! For <pb n="80"/> if one of our nobles
            complains openly that by your edict, "No moneys shall be voted for the games," you have
            robbed him of 200 sestertia, what a vast sum of money would have been paid, had a grant
            been made to the Credit of every magistrate who held games, as had become the regular
            custom! However, I stopped these Complaints by taking up this position—what they think
            of it in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> I don't know, in <placeName
              key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> it meets with no little approval and praise—I
            refused to accept a sum of money which the states had decreed for a temple and monument
            in our honour, though they had done so with the greatest enthusiasm in view both of my
            services and of your most valuable benefactions; and though the law contained a special
            and distinct exception in these words, "that it was lawful to receive for temple or
            monument"; and though again the money was not going to be thrown away, but would be
            employed on decorating a temple, and would thus appear to have been given to the Roman
            people and gift in its favour, I determined that I must not accept it, for the immortal
            Gods rather than to myself—yet, in spite of its having desert, law, and the wishes of
            those who offered the this reason among others, namely, to prevent those, to whom such
            an honour was neither due nor legal, from being jealous. Wherefore adhere with all your
            heart and soul to the policy which you have hitherto adopted—that of being devoted to
            those whom the senate and people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> have
            committed and entrusted to your honour and authority, of doing your best to protect
            them, and of desiring their greatest happiness. Even if the lot had made you governor of
            Africans, or Spaniards, or Gauls—uncivilized and barbarous nations—it would still have
            been your duty as a man of feeling to consult for their interests and advantage, and to
            have contributed to their safety. But when we rule over a race of men in which
            civilization not only exists, but from which it is believed to have spread to others, we
            are bound to repay them, above all things, what we received from them. For I shall not
            be ashamed to go so far—especially as my life and achievements have been such as to
            exclude any suspicion of sloth or frivolity—as to confess that, whatever I have
            accomplished, I have accomplished by means of those studies and principles which have
            been transmitted to us in Greek literature and schools of thought. Wherefore, over and
            above the <pb n="81"/> general good faith which is due to all men, I think we are in a
            special sense under an obligation to that nation, to put in practice what it has taught
            us among the very men by whose maxims we have been brought out of barbarism. <milestone

          <p>And indeed Plato, the fountain-head of genius and learning, thought that states would
            only be happy when scholars and philosophers began being their rulers, or when those who
            were their rulers had devoted all their attention to learning and philosophy. It was
            plainly this union of power and philosophy that in his opinion might prove the salvation
            of states. And this perhaps has at length fallen to the fortune of the whole empire:
            certainly it has in the present instance to your province, to have a man in supreme
            power in it, who has from boyhood spent the chief part of his zeal and time in imbibing
            the principles of philosophy, virtue, and humanity. Wherefore be careful that this third
            year, which has been added to your labour, may be thought a prolongation of prosperity
            to <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>. And since <placeName key="tgn,1000004"
              >Asia</placeName> was more fortunate in retaining you than I was in my endeavour to
            bring you back, see that my regret is softened by the exultation of the province. For if
            you have displayed the very greatest activity in earning honours such as, I think, have
            never been paid to anyone else, much greater ought your activity to be in preserving
            these honours. What I for my part think of honours of that kind I have told you in
            previous letters. I have always regarded them, if given indiscriminately, as of little
            value, if paid from interested motives, as worthless: if, however, as in this case, they
            are tributes to solid services on your part, I hold you bound to take much pains in
            preserving them. Since, then, you are exercising supreme power and official authority in
            cities, in which you have before your eyes the consecration and apotheosis of your
            virtues, in all decisions, decrees, and official acts consider what you owe to those
            warm opinions entertained of you, to those verdicts on your character, to those honours
            which have been rendered you. And what you owe will be to consult for the interests of
            all, to remedy men's misfortunes, to provide for their safety, to resolve that you will
            be both called and believed to be the "father of <placeName key="tgn,1000004"
              >Asia</placeName>." <milestone unit="section" n="11"/></p>
          <p>However, to such a resolution and deliberate policy on your part the great obstacle are
            the <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign>: for, if <pb n="82"/> we oppose them, we
            shall alienate from ourselves and from the Republic an order which has done us most
            excellent service, and which has been brought into sympathy with the Republic by our
            means; if, on the other hand, we comply with them in every case, we shall allow the
            complete ruin of those whose interests, to say nothing of their preservation, we are
            bound to consult. This is the one difficulty, if we look the thing fairly in the face,
            in your whole government. For disinterested conduct on one's own part, the suppression
            of all inordinate desires, the keeping a check upon one's staff, courtesy in hearing
            causes, in listening to and admitting suitor—all this is rather a question of credit
            than of difficulty: for it does not depend on any special exertion, but rather on a
            mental resolve and inclination. But how much bitterness of feeling is caused to allies
            by that question of the <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign> we have had reason to
            know in the case of citizens who, when recently urging the removal of the port-dues in
              <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, did not complain so much of the dues
            themselves, as of certain extortionate conduct on the part of the collectors. Wherefore,
            after hearing the grievances of citizens in <placeName key="tgn,1000080"
              >Italy</placeName>, I can comprehend what happens to allies in distant lands. To
            conduct oneself in this matter in such a way as to satisfy the <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >publicani</foreign> especially when contracts have been undertaken at a loss, and yet
            to preserve the allies from ruin, seems to demand a virtue with something divine in it,
            I mean a virtue like yours. To begin with, that they are subject to tax at all, which is
            their greatest grievance, ought not to be thought so by the Greeks, because they were so
            subject by their own laws without the Roman government. Again, they cannot despise the
            word <foreign xml:lang="la">publicanus</foreign>, for they have been unable to pay the
            assessment according to Sulla's poll-tax without the aid of the publican. But that Greek
              <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign> are not more considerate in exacting the
            payment of taxes than our own may be gathered from the fact that the Caunii, and all the
            islands assigned to the Rhodians by Sulla, recently appealed to the protection of the
            senate, and petitioned to be allowed to pay their tax to us rather than to the Rhodians.
            Wherefore neither ought those to revolt at the name of a <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >publicanus</foreign> who have always been subject to tax, nor those to despise it who
            have been unable to make up the tribute by themselves, <pb n="83"/> nor those to refuse
            his services who have asked for them. At the same time let <placeName key="tgn,1000004"
              >Asia</placeName> reflect on this, that if she were not under our government, there is
            no calamity of foreign war or internal strife from which she would be free. And since
            that government cannot possibly be maintained without taxes, she should be content to
            purchase perpetual peace and tranquillity at the price of a certain proportion of her
            products. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/></p>
          <p>But if they will fairly reconcile themselves to the existence and name of publican, all
            the rest may be made to appear to them in a less offensive light by your skill and
            prudence. They may, in making their bargains with the <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >publicani</foreign>, not have regard so much to the exact conditions laid down by the
            censors as to the convenience of settling the business and freeing themselves from
            farther trouble. You also may do, what you have done splendidly and are still doing,
            namely, dwell on the high position of the <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign>,
            and on your obligations to that order, in such a way as—putting out of the question all
            considerations of your <foreign xml:lang="la">imperium</foreign> and the power of your
            official authority and dignity—to reconcile the Greeks with the <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >publicani</foreign>; and to beg of those, whom you have served eminently well, and
            who owe you everything, to suffer you by their compliance to maintain and preserve the
            bonds which unite us with the <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign>. But why do I
            address these exhortations to you, who are not only capable of carrying them out of your
            own accord without anyone's instruction, but have already to a great extent thoroughly
            done so? For the most respectable and important companies do not cease offering me
            thanks daily, and this is all the more gratifying to me because the Greeks do the same.
            Now it is an achievement of great difficulty to unite in feeling things which are
            opposite in interests, aims, and, I had almost said, in their very nature. But I have
            not written all this to instruct you—for your wisdom requires no man's instruction—but
            it has been a pleasure to me while writing to set down your virtues, though I have run
            to greater length in this letter than I could have wished, or than I thought I should.
              <milestone unit="section" n="13"/></p>
          <p>There is one thing on which I shall not cease from giving you advice, nor will I, as
            far as in me lies, allow your praise to be spoken of with a reservation. For all who <pb
              n="84"/> come from your province do make one reservation in the extremely high praise
            which they bestow on your virtue, integrity, and kindness—it is that of sharpness of
            temper. That is a fault which, even in our private and everyday life, seems to indicate
            want of solidity and strength of mind; but nothing, surely, can be more improper than to
            combine harshness of temper with the exercise of supreme power. Wherefore I will not
            undertake to lay before you now what the greatest philosophers say about anger, for I
            should not wish to be tedious, and you can easily ascertain it yourself from the
            writings of many of them: but I don't think I ought to pass over what is the essence of
            a letter, namely, that the recipient should be informed of what he does not know. Well,
            what nearly everybody reports to me is this: they usually say that, as long as you are
            not out of temper, nothing can be pleasanter than you are, but that when some instance
            of dishonesty or wrong-headedness has stirred you, your temper rises to such a height
            that no one Can discover any trace of your usual kindness. Wherefore, since no mere
            desire for glory, but circumstances and fortune have brought us upon a path of life
            which makes it inevitable that men will always talk about us, let us be on our guard, to
            the utmost of our means and ability, that no glaring fault may be alleged to have
            existed in us. And I am not now urging, what is perhaps difficult in human nature
            generally, and at our time of life especially, that you should change your disposition
            and suddenly pluck out a deeply-rooted habit, but I give you this hint: if you cannot
            completely avoid this failing, because your mind is surprised by anger before cool
            calculation has been able to prevent it, deliberately prepare yourself beforehand, and
            daily reflect on the duty of resisting anger, and that, when it moves your heart most
            violently, it is just the time for being most careful to restrain your tongue. And that
            sometimes seems to me to be a. greater virtue than not being angry at all. For the
            latter is not always a mark of superiority to weakness, it is sometimes the result of
            dullness; but to govern temper and speech, however angry you may be, or even to hold
            your tongue and keep your indignant feelings and resentment under control, although it
            may not be a proof of perfect wisdom, yet requires no ordinary force of character. And,
              <pb n="85"/> indeed, in this respect they tell me that you are now much more gentle
            and less irritable. No violent outbursts of indignation on your part, no abusive words,
            no insulting language are reported to me: which, while quite alien to culture and
            refinement, are specially unsuited to high power and place. For if your anger is
            implacable, it amounts to extreme harshness; if easily appeased, to extreme weakness.
            The latter, however, as a choice of evils, is, after all, preferable to harshness.
              <milestone unit="section" n="14"/></p>
          <p>But since your first year gave rise to most talk in regard to this particular
            complaint—I believe because the wrong-doing, the covetousness, and the arrogance of men
            came upon you as a surprise, and seemed to you unbearable-while your second year was
            much milder, because habit and refection, and, as I think, my letters also, rendered you
            more tolerant and gentle, the third ought to be so completely reformed, as not to give
            even the smallest ground for anyone to find fault. And here I go on to urge upon you,
            not by way of exhortation or admonition, but by brotherly entreaties, that you would set
            your whole heart, care, and thought on the gaining of praise from everybody and from
            every quarter. If, indeed, our achievements were only the subject of a moderate amount
            of talk and commendation, nothing eminent, nothing beyond the practice of others, would
            have been demanded of you. As it is, however, owing to the brilliancy and magnitude of
            the affairs in which we have been engaged, if we do not obtain the very highest
            reputation from your province, it seems scarcely possible for us to avoid the most
            violent abuse. Our position is such that all loyalists support us, but demand also and
            expect from us every kind of activity and virtue, while all the disloyal, seeing that we
            have entered upon a lasting war with them, appear contented with the very smallest
            excuse for attacking us. Wherefore, since fortune has allotted to you such a theatre as
              <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, completely packed with an audience, of
            immense size, of the most refined judgment, and, moreover, naturally so capable of
            conveying sound, that its expressions of opinion and its remarks reach <placeName
              key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, put out all your power, I beseech you, exert all
            your energies to appear not only to have been worthy of the part we played here, but to
            have surpassed everything done there by your high qualities. <pb n="86"/>
            <milestone unit="section" n="15"/></p>
          <p>And since chance has assigned to me among the magistracies the Conduct of public
            business in the city, to you that in a province, if my share is inferior to no one's,
            take care that yours surpasses others. At the same time think of this: we are not now
            working for a future and prospective glory, but are fighting in defence of what has been
            already gained; which indeed it was not so much an object to gain as it is now our duty
            to defend. And if anything in me could be apart from you, I should desire nothing more
            than the position which I have already gained. The actual fact, however, is that unless
            all your acts and deeds in your province correspond to my achievements, I shall think
            that I have gained nothing by those great labours and dangers, in all of which you have
            shared. But if it was you who, above all others, assisted me to gain a most splendid
            reputation, you will certainly also labour more than others to enable me to retain it.
            You must not be guided by the opinions and judgments of the present generation only, but
            of those to come also: and yet the latter will be a more candid judgment, for it will
            not be influenced by detraction and malice. Finally, you should think of this—that you
            are not seeking glory for yourself alone (and even if that were the case, you still
            ought not to be careless of it, especially as you had determined to consecrate the
            memory of your name by the most splendid monuments), but you have to share it with me,
            and to hand it down to our children. In regard to which you must be on your guard lest
            by any excess of carelessness you should seem not only to have neglected your own
            interests, but to have begrudged those of your family also. <milestone unit="section"

          <p>And these observations are not made with the idea of any speech of mine appearing to
            have roused you from your sleep, but to have rather "added speed to the runner. For you
            will continue to compel all in the future, as you have compelled them in the past, to
            praise your equity, self-control, strictness, and honesty. But from my extreme affection
            I am possessed with a certain insatiable greed for glory for you. However, I am
            convinced that, as <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> should now be as
            well-known to you as each man's own house is to himself, and since to your supreme good
            sense such great experience has now been added, there is nothing that affects reputation
            which you do not know as well as possible yourself, and <pb n="87"/> which does not
            daily occur to your mind without anybody's exhortation. But I, who when I read your
            writing seem to hear your voice, and when I write to you seem to be talking to you, am
            therefore always best pleased with your longest letter, and in writing am often somewhat
            prolix myself. My last prayer and advice to you is that, as good poets and painstaking
            actors always do, so you should be most attentive in the last scenes and conclusion of
            your function and business, so that this third year of your government, like a third act
            in a play, may appear to have been the most elaborated and most highly finished. You
            will do that with more ease if you will think that I, whom you always wished to please
            more than all the world besides, am always at your side, and am taking part in
            everything you say and do. It remains only to beg you to take the greatest care of your
            health, if you wish me and all your friends to be well also. Farewell. </p>

          <p> Statius arrived at my house on the 25th October. His arrival gave me uneasiness,
            because you said in your letter that you would be plundered by your household in his
            absence. However, I thought it a very happy circumstance that he anticipated the
            expectation of his arrival, and the company that would have assembled to meet him, if he
            had <pb n="126"/> left the province with you, and had not appeared before. For people
            have exhausted their remarks, and many observations have been made and done with of the
            "Nay, but I looked for a mighty man" <note n="1" anchored="true">
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)ll' ai)ei]\ tina fw=ta me/gan kai\ kalo\n
                e)de/gmhn</foreign> "but I ever expected some big and handsome man" (<bibl
                n="Hom. Od. 9.513">Hom. Od. 9.513</bibl>). Statius had been manumitted by Quintus
              Cicero, and there had been much talk about it, as we have already heard. See XLIV, p.
              109, and XLV, </note> kind, which I am glad to have all over before you come. But as
            for the motive for your sending him—that he might clear himself with me—that was not at
            all necessary. For, to begin with, I had never suspected him, nor in what I wrote to you
            about him was I expressing my own judgment; but since the interest and safety of all of
            us who take part in public business depends, not on truth alone, but on report also, I
            wrote you word of what people were saying, not what I thought myself. How prevalent and
            how formidable that talk was Statius ascertained himself on his arrival. For he was
            present when certain persons at my house gave vent to some complaints on that very
            subject, and had the opportunity of perceiving that the observations of the malevolent
            were being directed at himself especially. But it used to annoy me most when I was told
            that he had greater influence with you, than your sober time of life and the wisdom of a
            governor required. How many people, do you suppose, have solicited me to give them a
            letter of introduction to Statius? How often, do you suppose, has he himself, while
            talking without reserve to me, made such observations as, "I never approved of that," "I
            told him so," "I tried to persuade him," "I warned him not to"? And even if these things
            show the highest fidelity, as I believe they do, since that is your judgment, yet the
            mere appearance of a freedman or slave enjoying such influence cannot but lower your
            dignity: and the long and short of it is—for I am in duty bound not to say anything
            without good grounds, nor to keep back anything from motives of policy—that Statius has
            supplied all the material for the gossip of those who wished to decry you; that formerly
            all that could be made out was that certain persons were. angry at your strictness; but
            that after his manumission the angry had something to talk about. <pb n="127"/>
            <milestone unit="para"/>Now I will answer the letters delivered to me by L. Caesius,
            whom, as I see you wish it, I will serve in every way I can. One of them is about Zeuxis
            of Blaundus, whom you say was warmly recommended to you by me though a most notorious
            matricide. In this matter, and on this subject generally, please listen to a short
            statement, lest you should by chance be surprised at my having become so conciliatory
            towards Greeks. Seeing, as I did, that the complaints of Greeks, because they have a
            genius for deceit, were allowed an excessive weight, whenever I was told of any of them
            making complaint of you, I appeased them by every means in my power. First, I pacified
            the Dionysopolitans, who were very bitter: whose chief man, Hermippus, I secured not
            only by my conversation, but by treating him as a friend. I did the same to Hephaestus
            of <placeName key="tgn,7017535">Apameia</placeName>; the same to that most untrustworthy
            fellow, Megaristus of Antandrus; the same to Nicias of <placeName key="perseus,Smyrna"
              >Smyrna</placeName>; I also embraced with all the courtesy I possessed the most
            trumpery of men, even Nymphon of <placeName key="perseus,Colophon">Colophon</placeName>.
            And all this I did from no liking for these particular people, or the nation as a whole:
            I was heartily sick of their fickleness and obsequiousness, of feelings that are not
            affected by our kindness, but by our position. <milestone unit="para"/>But to return to
            Zeuxis. When he was telling me the same story as you mention in your letter about what
            M. Cascellius had said to him in conversation, I stopped him from farther talk, and
            admitted him to my society. I cannot, however, understand your virulence when you say
            that, having sewn up in the parricide's-sack two Mysians at <placeName
              key="perseus,Smyrna">Smyrna</placeName>, you desired to display a similar example of
            your severity in the upper part of your province, and that, therefore, you had wished to
            inveigle Zeuxis into your hands by every possible means. For if he had been brought into
            court, he ought perhaps not to have been allowed to escape: but there was no necessity
            for his being hunted out and inveigled by soft words to stand a trial, as you say in
            your letter—especially as he is one whom I learn daily, both from his fellow citizens
            and from many others, to be a man of higher character than you would expect from such an
            obscure town as his. <note n="1" anchored="true">Reading <foreign xml:lang="la">quam pro

                >pro</foreign> (mistaken for <foreign xml:lang="la">prope</foreign>) were once
              changed, the case of <foreign xml:lang="la">civitate</foreign> would follow. Prof.
              Tyrrell, who writes the town Blandus, would read <foreign xml:lang="la"
                >molliorem</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="la">nobiliorem</foreign>, and imagines a
              pun on the meaning of <foreign xml:lang="la">Blandius</foreign>. But the name of the

              and Cicero, though generally punning on names, would hardly do so here, where he is
              making a grave excuse. </note> But, you will say, it is only Greeks <pb n="128"/> to
            whom I am indulgent. What! did not I do everything to appease L. Caecilius? What a man!
            how irritable! how violent! In fact, who is there except Tuscenius, <note n="1"
              anchored="true">Whom he called (Letter XXIX) "a madman and a knave." </note> whose
            case admitted of no cure, have I not softened? See again, I have now on my hands a
            shifty, mean fellow, though of equestrian rank, called Catienus: even he is going to be
            smoothed down. I don't blame you for having been somewhat harsh to his father, for I am
            quite sure you have acted with good reason: but what need was there of a letter of the
            sort which you sent to the man himself? "That the man was rearing the cross for himself
            from which you had already pulled him off once; that you would take care to have him
            smoked to death, and would be applauded by the whole province for it." Again, to a man
            named C. Fabius—for that letter also T. Catienus is handing round—"that you were told
            that the kidnapper Licinius, with his young kite of a son, was collecting taxes." And
            then you go on to ask Fabius to burn both father and son alive if he can; if not, to
            send them to you, that they may be burnt to death by legal sentence. That letter sent by
            you in jest to C. Fabius, if it really is from you, exhibits to ordinary readers a
            violence of language very injurious to you. <milestone unit="para"/>Now, if you will
            refer to the exhortations in all my letters, you will perceive that I have never found
            fault with you for anything except harshness and sharpness of temper, and occasionally,
            though rarely, for want of caution in the letters you write. In which particulars,
            indeed, if my influence had had greater weight with you than a somewhat excessive
            quickness of disposition, or a certain enjoyment in indulging temper, or a faculty for
            epigram and a sense of humour, we should certainly have had no cause for
            dissatisfaction. And don't you suppose that I feel no common vexation when I am told how
            Vergilius is esteemed, and your neighbour <pb n="129"/> C. Octavius? <note n="1"

            And that is just the sting of the matter, that though the men I have named are not more
            blameless than yourself, they yet outdo you in the art of winning favour, though they
            know nothing of Xenophon's Cyrus or Agesilaus; from which kings, in the exercise of
            their great office, no one ever heard an irritable word. But in giving you this advice,
            as I have from the first, I am well aware how much good I have done. <note n="2"
              anchored="true">I have endeavoured to leave the English as ambiguous as the Latin.
              Cicero may mean that he has done some good, for at the end of Letter XXIX he says that
              Quintus has improved in these points, and had been better in his second than in his
              first year. On the other hand, the context here seems rather to point to the meaning
              "how little good I have done"—impatiently dismissing the subject of temper. </note>
            <milestone unit="para"/>Now, however, as you are about to quit your province, pray do
            leave behind you—as I think you are now doing—as pleasant a memory as possible. You have
            a successor of very mild manners; in other respects, on his arrival, you will be much
            missed. In sending letters of requisition, as I have often told you, you have allowed
            yourself to be too easily persuaded. Destroy, if you can, all such as are inequitable,
            or contrary to usage, or contradictory to others. Statius told me that they were usually
            put before you ready written, read by himself, and that, if they were inequitable, he
            informed you of the fact: but that before he entered your service there had been no
            sifting of letters; that the result was that there were volumes containing a selection
            of letters, which were usually adversely criticised. <note n="3" anchored="true">These
              "requisitionary letters" were granted by a provincial governor to certain persons
              requiring supplies, payment of debts, or legal decisions in their favour in the
              provinces, or other privileges, and, if carelessly granted, were open to much abuse.
              Cicero, in his own government of <foreign xml:lang="la">Cilicia</foreign>, boasted
              that he had signed none such in six months. The ill-wishers of Quintus had apparently
              got hold of a number of these letters signed by him (having been first written out by
              the suitors themselves and scarcely glanced at by him), and a selection of them
              published to prove his injustice or carelessness. </note> On this subject I am not
            going to give you any advice at this time of day, for <pb n="130"/> it is too late; and
            you cannot but be aware that I have often warned you in various ways and with precision.
            But I have, on a hint from Theopompus, entrusted him with this message to you: do see by
            means of persons attached to you, which you will find no difficulty in doing, that the
            following classes of letters are destroyed—first, those that are inequitable; next,
            those that are contradictory; then those expressed in an eccentric or unusual manner;
            and lastly, those that contain reflections on anyone. I don't believe all I hear about
            these matters, and if, in the multiplicity of your engagements, you have let certain
            things escape you, now is the time to look into them and weed them out. I have read a
            letter said to have been written by your nomenclator Sulla himself, which I cannot
            approve: I have read some written in an angry spirit. But the subject of letters comes
            in pat: for while this sheet of paper was actually in my hands, L. Flavius,
            praetor-designate and a very intimate friend, came to see me. He told me that you had
            sent a letter to his agents, which seemed to me most inequitable, prohibiting them from
            taking anything from the estate of the late L. Octavius Naso, whose heir L. Flavius is,
            until they had paid a sum of money to C. Fundanius; and that you had sent a similar
            letter to the Apollonidenses, not to allow any payment on account of the estate of the
            late Octavius till the debt to Fundanius had been discharged. It seems to me hardly
            likely that you have done this; for it is quite unlike your usual good sense. The heir
            not to take anything? What if he disowns the debt? What if he doesn't owe it at all?
            Moreover, is the praetor wont to decide whether a debt is due ? <note n="1"
              anchored="true">The governor of a province would stand in such a matter in the place
              of the praetor in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, i.e., he would
              decide on questions of law, not of fact, as, whether a debt was due or not. However,
              Quintus perhaps only erred in the form of his injunction. He might forbid the
              deceased's estate being touched till the question of Fundanius's debt was decided; but
              in his letter he assumed (as he had no right to do) that the claim was good.
              Substantially it seems to me that Quintus was right, and certainly in his appeal to
              him Cicero does not follow his own injunction to disregard personal feelings. </note>
            Don't I, again, wish well to Fundanius? Am I not his friend? Am I not touched with
            compassion? No one more so: but in certain matters the course of law is so clear as to
            leave no place for personal feeling. And Flavius told me that expressions were used in
            the letter, <pb n="131"/> which he said was yours, to the effect that you would "either
            thank them as friends, or make yourself disagreeable to them as enemies." In short, he
            was much annoyed, complained of it to me in strong terms, and begged me to write to you
            as seriously as I could. This I am doing, and I do strongly urge you again and again to
            withdraw your injunction to Flavius's agents about taking money from the estate, and not
            to lay any farther injunction on the Apollonidenses contrary to the rights of Flavius.
            Pray do everything you can for the sake of Flavius and, indeed, of Pompey also. I would
            not, upon my honour, have you think me liberal to him at the expense of any inequitable
            decision on your part: but I do entreat you to leave behind you some authority, and some
            memorandum of a decree or of a letter under your hand, so framed as to support the
            interests and cause of Flavius. For the man, who is at once very attentive to me, and
            tenacious of his own rights and dignity, is feeling extremely hurt that he has not
            prevailed with you either on the grounds of personal friendship or of legal right; and,
            to the best of my belief, both Pompey and Caesar have, at one time or another, commended
            the interests of Flavius to you, and Flavius has written to you personally, and
            certainly I have. Wherefore, if there is anything which you think you ought to do at my
            request, let it be this. If you love me, take every care, take every trouble, and insure
            Flavius's cordial thanks both to yourself and myself. I cannot use greater earnestness
            in making any request than I use in this. <milestone unit="para"/>As to what you say
            about Hermias, it has been in truth a cause of much vexation to me. I wrote you a letter
            in a rather unbrotherly spirit, which I dashed off in a fit of anger and now wish to
            recall, having been irritated by what Lucullus's freedman told me, immediately after
            hearing of the bargain. For this letter, which was not expressed in a brotherly way, you
            ought to have brotherly feeling enough to make allowance. As to Censorinus, Antonius,
            the Cassii, Scaevola—I am delighted to hear from you that you possess their friendship.
            The other contents of that same letter of yours were expressed more strongly than I
            could have wished, such as your "with my ship at least well trimmed" <note n="1"
              anchored="true">
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">o)rqa\n ta\n nau=n</foreign>. Quintus had written, it seems,
              defiantly about the slanders afloat against him, and had quoted two Greek proverbial
              sayings. The first is found in Stobaeus, 108 (extract from <foreign xml:lang="la"
                >Teles</foreign>): "It was a fine saying of the pilot, 'At least, Poseidon, a ship
              well trimmed,'" i.e., if you sink my ship, she shall at least go down with honour.
              Quintus means, "whatever my enemies may do afterwards, I will keep my province in a
              sound state as long as I am here." </note> and your "die <pb n="132"/> once for all."
              <note n="1" anchored="true">
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">a(/pac qanei=n</foreign>, perhaps "Better to <foreign

              </quote> But I don't feel sure that this is the passage alluded to. </note> You will
            find those expressions to be unnecessarily strong. My scoldings have always been very
            full of affection. They mention certain things for complaint, <note n="2"
              anchored="true">Reading <foreign xml:lang="la">queruntur</foreign> for <foreign
                xml:lang="la">quae sunt</foreign>. </note> but these are not important, or rather,
            are quite insignificant. For my part, I should never have thought you deserving of the
            least blame in any respect, considering the extreme purity of your conduct, had it not
            been that our enemies are numerous. Whatever I have written to you in a tone of
            remonstrance or reproach I have written from a vigilant caution, which I maintain, and
            shall maintain; and I shall not cease imploring you to do the same. Attalus of Hypaepa
            has begged me to intercede with you that you should not prevent his getting the money
            paid which has been decreed for a statue of Q. Publicius. In which matter I both ask as
            a favour and urge as a duty, that you should not consent to allow the honour of a man of
            his character, and so close a friend of mine, to be lowered or hindered by your means.
            Furthermore, Licinius, who is known to you, a slave of my friend Aesopus, has run away.
            He has been at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, living in the house
            of Patron the Epicurean as a free man. Thence he has made his way to <placeName
              key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>. Afterwards a certain Plato of Sardis, who is often
            at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and happened to be at <placeName
              key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> at the time that Licinius arrived there,
            having subsequently learnt by a letter from Aesopus that he was an escaped slave,
            arrested the fellow, and put him into confinement at <placeName key="tgn,7002499"
              >Ephesus</placeName>; but whether into the public prison, or into a slave mill, we
            could not clearly make out from his letter. But since he is at <placeName
              key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>, I should be obliged if you would trace him in
            any manner open to you, and with all care <pb n="133"/> either [send him] or bring him
            home with you. Don't take into consideration the fellow's value: such a good-for-nothing
            is worth very little; but Aesopus is so much vexed at his slave's bad conduct and
            audacity, that you can do him no greater favour than by being the means of his
            recovering him. <milestone unit="para"/>Now for the news that you chiefly desire. We
            have so completely lost the constitution that Cato, <note n="1" anchored="true">Gaius
                <foreign xml:lang="la">Cato</foreign>, tribune <date when="-0056">B.C. 56</date>.
            </note> a young man of no sense, but yet a Roman citizen and a Cato, scarcely got off
            with his life because, having determined to prosecute Gabinius for bribery, when the
            praetors could not be approached for several days, and refused to admit anyone to their
            presence, he mounted the rostra in public meeting and called Pompey an "unofficial
            dictator." No one ever had a narrower escape of being killed. From this you may see the
            state of the whole Republic. People, however, show no inclination to desert my cause.
            They make wonderful professions, offers of service, and promises: and, indeed, I have
            the highest hopes and even greater spirit—so that I hope to get the better in the
            struggle, and feel confident in my mind that, in the present state of the Republic, I
            need not fear even an accident. However, the matter stands thus: if Clodius gives notice
            of an action against me, the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>
            will rush to my support, so that I shall come off with many times greater glory than
            before; but if he attempts the use of violence, I hope, by the zeal not only of friends
            but also of opponents, to be able to meet force with force. All promise me the aid of
            themselves, their friends, clients, freedmen, slaves, and, finally, of their money. Our
            old regiment of loyalists is warm in its zeal and attachment to me. If there were any
            who had formerly been comparatively hostile or lukewarm, they are now uniting themselves
            with the loyalists from hatred to these despots. Pompey makes every sort of promise, and
            so does Caesar: but my confidence in them is not enough to induce me to drop any of my
            preparations. The tribunes-designate are friendly to us. The consuls-designate make
            excellent professions. Some of the new praetors are very friendly and very brave
            citizens-Domitius, Nigidius, Memmius, <pb n="134"/> Lentulus <note n="1" anchored="true"

            feeling to send slaves to you without a letter? Or even that I did not wish to see you?
            I to be angry with you! Is it possible for me to be angry with you? Why, one would think
            that it was you that brought me low! Your enemies, your unpopularity, that miserably
            ruined me, and not I that unhappily ruined you! The fact is, the much-praised consulate
            of mine has deprived me of you, of children, country, fortune; from you I should hope it

            my fall and fear for your own, regret, mourning, desertion. Not wish to see you? The
            truth is rather that I was unwilling to be seen by you. For you would not have seen your
            brother-not the brother you had left, not the brother you knew, not him to whom you had
            with mutual tears bidden farewell as he followed you on your departure for your
            province: not a trace even or faint image of him, but rather what I may call the
            likeness of a living corpse. And oh that you had sooner seen me or heard of me as a
            corpse! Oh that I could have left you to survive, not my life merely, but my
            undiminished rank! But I call all the gods to witness that the one argument which
            recalled me from death was, that all declared that to some extent your life depended
            upon mine. In which matter I made an error and acted Culpably. For if I had died, that
            death itself would have given clear evidence of my fidelity and love to you. As it is, I
            have allowed you to be deprived of my aid, though I am alive, and with me still living
            to need the help of others; and my voice, of all others, to fail when dangers threatened
            my family, which had so often been successfully used in the defence of the merest
            strangers. For as to the slaves coming to you without a letter, the real reason (for you
            see that it was not anger) was a deadness of my faculties, and a seemingly endless
            deluge of tears and sorrows. How many tears do you suppose these very words have Cost
            me? As many as I know they will cost you to read them! Can I ever refrain from thinking
            of you or ever think of you without tears? For when I miss you, is it only a brother
            that I miss? Rather it is a brother of almost my own age in the charm of his
            companionship, a son in his consideration for my wishes, a father in the wisdom of his
            advice! What pleasure did I ever have without you, or you without me? And what must my
            case be when at the same time I miss a daughter: How affectionate! how modest! how
            clever! The express image of my face, of my speech, of my very soul! Or again a son, the
            prettiest boy, the very joy of my heart? Cruel inhuman monster that I am, I dismissed
            him from my arms better schooled in the world than I could have wished: for the poor
            child began to understand <pb n="150"/> what was going on. So, too, your own son, your
            own image, whom my little Cicero loved as a brother, and was now beginning to respect as
            an elder brother! Need I mention also how I refused to allow my unhappy wife—the truest
            of helpmates—to accompany me, that there might be some one to protect the wrecks of the
            calamity which had fallen on us both, and guard our common children? Nevertheless, to
            the best of my ability, I did write a letter to you, and gave it to your freedman
            Philogonus, which, I believe, was delivered to you later on; and in this I repeated the
            advice and entreaty, which had been already transmitted to you as a message from me by
            my slaves, that you should go on with your journey and hasten to <placeName
              key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. For, in the first place, I desired your
            protection, in case there were any of my enemies whose cruelty was not yet satisfied by
            my fall. In the next place, I dreaded the renewed lamentation which our meeting would
            cause : while I could not have borne your departure, and was afraid of the very thing
            you mention in your letter—that you would be unable to tear yourself away. For these
            reasons the supreme pain of not seeing you—and nothing more painful or more wretched
            could, I think, have happened to the most affectionate and united of brothers-was a less
            misery than would have been such a meeting followed by such a parting. Now, if you can,
            though I, whom you always regarded as a brave man, cannot do so, rouse yourself and
            collect your energies in view of any contest you may have to confront. I hope, if my
            hope has anything to go upon, that your own spotless character and the love of your
            fellow citizens, and even remorse for my treatment, may prove a certain protection to
            you. But if it turns out that you are free from personal danger, you will doubtless do
            whatever you think can be done for me. In that matter, indeed, many write to me at great
            length and declare that they have hopes; but I personally cannot see what hope there is,
            since my enemies have the greatest influence, while my friends have in some cases
            deserted, in others even betrayed me, fearing perhaps in my restoration a censure on
            their own treacherous conduct. But how matters stand with you I would have you ascertain
            and report to me. In any case I shall continue to live as long as you shall need me, in
            view of any danger you may <pb n="151"/> have to undergo: longer than that I cannot go
            on in this kind of life. For there is neither wisdom nor philosophy with sufficient
            strength to sustain such a weight of grief. I know that there has been a time for dying,
            more honourable and more advantageous; and this is not the only one of my many
            omissions, which, if I should choose to bewail, I should merely be increasing your
            sorrow and emphasizing my own stupidity. But one thing I am not bound to do, and it is
            in fact impossible-remain in a life so wretched and so dishonoured any longer than your
            necessities, or some well-grounded hope, shall demand. For I, who was lately supremely
            blessed in brother, children, wife, wealth, and in the very nature of that wealth, while
            in position, influence, reputation, and popularity, I was inferior to none, however
            distinguished—I cannot, I repeat, go on longer lamenting over myself and those dear to
            me in a life of such humiliation as this, and in a state of such utter ruin. Wherefore,
            what do you mean by writing to me about negotiating a bill of exchange? As though I were
            not now wholly dependent on your means! And that is just the very thing in which I see
            and feel, to my misery, of what a culpable act I have been guilty in squandering to no
            purpose the money which I received from the treasury in your name, <note n="1"
              anchored="true">See pp. 92, 107. </note> while you have to satisfy your creditors out
            of the very vitals of yourself and your son. However, the sum mentioned in your letter
            has been paid to M. Antonius, and the same amount to Caepio. For me the sum at present
            in my hands is sufficient for what I contemplate doing. For in either case-whether I am
            restored or given up in despair—I shall not want any more money. For yourself, if you
            are molested, I think you should apply to Crassus and Calidius. I don't know how far
            Hortensius is to be trusted. Myself, with the most elaborate pretence of affection and
            the closest daily intimacy, he treated with the most utter want of principle and the
            most consummate treachery, and Q. Arrius helped him in it: acting under whose advice,
            promises, and injunctions, I was left helpless to fall into this disaster. But this you
            will keep dark for fear they might injure you. Take care also—and it is on this account
            that I <pb n="152"/> think you should Cultivate Hortensius himself by means of
            Pomponius—that the epigram on the <foreign xml:lang="la">lex Aurelia</foreign>
            <note n="1" anchored="true">Quintus was a candidate in <date when="-0066">B.C. 66</date>

              would be likely to give offence. </note> attributed to you when Candidate for the
            aedileship is not proved by false testimony to be yours. For there is nothing that I am
            so afraid of as that, when people understand how much pity for me your prayers and your
            acquittal will rouse, they may attack you with all the greater violence. Messalla I
            reckon as really attached to you : Pompey I regard as still pretending only. But may you
            never have to put these things to the test! And that prayer I would have offered to the
            gods had they not ceased to listen to prayers of mine. However, I do pray that they may
            be content with these endless miseries of ours; among which, after all, there is no
            discredit for any wrong thing done-sorrow is the beginning and end, sorrow that
            punishment is most severe when our conduct has been most unexceptionable. As to my
            daughter and yours and my young Cicero, why should I recommend them to you, my dear
            brother? Rather I grieve that their orphan state will cause you no less sorrow than it
            does me. Yet as long as you are uncondemned they will not be fatherless. The rest, by my
            hopes of restoration and the privilege of dying in my fatherland, my tears will not
            allow me to write! Terentia also I would ask you to protect, and to write me word on
            every subject. Be as brave as the nature of the case admits. <placeName

          <p> I beg you, my dear brother, if you and all my family have been ruined by my single
            misfortune, not to attribute it to dishonesty and bad conduct on my part, rather than to
            shortsightedness and the wretched state I was in. I have committed no fault except in
            trusting those whom I believed to be bound by the most sacred obligation not to deceive
            me, or whom I thought to be even interested in not doing so. All my most intimate,
            nearest and dearest friends were either alarmed for themselves or jealous of me: the
            result was that all I lacked was good faith on the part of my friends and caution on my
            own. <note n="1" anchored="true">Reading <foreign xml:lang="la">defuit</foreign> for
                <foreign xml:lang="la">fuit</foreign>. </note> But if your own blameless character
            and the compassion of the world prove sufficient to preserve you at this juncture from
            molestation, you can, of course, observe whether any hope of restoration is left for me.
            For Pomponius, Sestius, and my son-in-law Piso have caused me as yet to stay at
              <placeName key="tgn,7011182">Thessalonica</placeName>, forbidding me, on account of
            certain impending movements, to increase my distance. But in truth I am awaiting the
            result more on account of their letters than from any firm hope of my own. For what can
            I hope with an enemy possessed of the most formidable power, with my detractors masters
            of the state, with friends unfaithful, with numbers of people jealous? However, of the
            new tribunes there is one, it is true, most warmly attached to me—Sestius—and I hope
            Curius, Milo, Fadius, <pb n="159"/> Fabricius; but still there is Clodius in violent
            opposition, who even when out of office will be able to stir up the passions of the mob
            by the help of that same gang, and then there will be found some one also to veto the
            bill. Such a state of things was not put before me when I was leaving <placeName
              key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, but I often used to be told that I was certain to
            return in three days with the greatest <foreign xml:lang="fr">>éclat</foreign>. "What
            made you go, then?" you will say. What, indeed! Many circumstances concurred to throw me
            off my balance—the defection of Pompey, the hostility of the consuls, and of the
            praetors also, the timidity of the <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign>, the armed
            bands. The tears of my friends prevented me seeking refuge in death, which would
            certainly have been the best thing for my honour, the best escape from unbearable
            sorrows. But I have written to you on this subject in the letter I gave to Phaetho. Now
            that you have been plunged into griefs and troubles, such as no one ever was before, if
            the compassion of the world can lighten our common misfortune, you will, it seems, score
            a success beyond belief! But if we are both utterly ruined—ah me-I shall have been the
            absolute destruction of my whole family, to whom I used to be at least no discredit! But
            pray, as I said in a previous letter to you, look into the business, test it thoroughly,
            and write to me with the candour which our situation demands, and not as your affection
            for me would dictate. I shall retain my life as long as I shall think that it is in your
            interest for me to do so, or that it ought to be preserved with a view to future hope.
            You will find Sestius most friendly to us, and I believe that Lentulus, the coming
            consul, will also be so for your sake. However, deeds are not so easy as words. You will
            see what is wanted and what the truth is. On the whole, supposing that no one takes
            advantage of your unprotected position and our common calamity, it is by your means, or
            not at all, that something may be effected. But even if your enemies have begun to annoy
            you, don't flinch: for you will be attacked by legal process, not by swords. However, I
            hope that this may not occur. I beg you to write me back word on all subjects, and to
            believe that though I have less spirit and resource than in old times, I have quite as
            much affection and loyalty. <pb n="160"/>

              superintendent of the corn-supply, to which office he had been appointed in August.
              The letter is written not earlier than the 10th of December, for the new tribunes for
                <date when="-0056">B.C. 56</date> have come into office, and not later than the
              16th, because on the 17th the Saturnalia began. Perhaps as the senate is summoned and
              presided over by <persName><surname>Lupus</surname></persName>, it is on the 10th, the
              day of his entrance upon office. </note>which you have already read I had sent off in
            the morning. But Licinius was polite enough to call on me in the evening after the
            senate had risen, that, in case of any business having been done there, I might, if I
            thought good, write an account of it to you. The senate was fuller than I had thought
            possible in the month of December just <pb n="199"/> before the holidays. Of us
            consulars there were P. Servilius, M. Lucullus, Lepidus, Volcatius, Glabrio: the two
            consuls-designate; the praetors. We were a really full house: two hundred in all. <note
              n="1" anchored="true">Full,"that is, for the time of year. A "full house" is elsewhere
              mentioned as between three and four hundred. </note>
            <persName><surname>Lupus</surname></persName> had excited some interest. <note n="2"
              anchored="true">P. Rutilius Lupus, one of the new tribunes. </note> He raised the
            question of the Campanian land in considerable detail. He was listened to in profound
            silence. You are not unaware what material that subject affords. He omitted none of the
            points which I had made in this business. <note n="3" anchored="true">This refers to
              Cicero's attempts to exempt the <foreign xml:lang="la">ager publicus</foreign> in
                <foreign xml:lang="la">Campania</foreign> from being divided (see Letter XXIV, p.
              55); and not only to his speeches against Rullus. It was because Caesar disregarded
              the ancient exception of this land from such distribution that Cicero opposed his
              bill, and refused to serve on the commission. </note> There were some sharp thrusts at
            Caesar, some denunciations of Gellius, some appeals to the absent Pompey. After
            concluding his speech at a late hour, he said that he would not ask for our votes lest
            he might burden us with a personal controversy; he quite understood the sentiments of
            the senate from the denunciations of past times and the silence on the present occasion.
            Milo spoke. Lupus begins the formula of dismissal, <note n="4" anchored="true">
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Nihil vos moramur</foreign> were the words used by the
              presiding magistrate, indicating that he had no more business to bring before the
              senate. If no one said anything, the senate was dismissed; but any magistrate, or
              magistrate-designate, could speak, and so continue the sitting up to nightfall, when
              the house stood adjourned. </note> when Marcellinus says: " Don't infer from our
            silence, Lupus, what we approve or disapprove of at this particular time. As far as I am
            concerned, and I think it is the same with the rest, I am only silent because I do not
            think it suitable that the case of the Campanian land should be debated in Pompey's
            absence." Then Lupus said that he would not detain the senate. <note n="5"

            serious tones of the Clodian incendiaries, massacres, and stonings, proposed a
            resolution that "Clodius himself should, under the superintendence of the praetor

          <p> It was not from the multiplicity of business, though I am very much engaged, but from
            a slight inflammation of the eyes that I was induced to dictate this letter, and not, as
            is my usual habit, write it with my own hand. And, to begin with, I wish to excuse
            myself to you on the very point on which I accuse yoti. For no one up to now has asked
            me "whether I have any commands for <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName>
            "—I think you often have people who say, "Have you any commands for <placeName

            about the debt of Lentulus and Sestius, I have spoken with Cincius. <note n="1"

            same time splendidly gratifying Pompey's wishes: but the detractors of Lentulus
            Contrived to talk the matter out by obstructive speeches. Then followed the comitial
            days, on which a meeting of the senate was impossible. What the villainy of the tribunes

            <dateline><placeName key="perseus,Rome">ROME</placeName>, 12 FEBRUARY</dateline>
          </opener>
          <p> I have already told you the earlier proceedings; now let me describe what was done
            afterwards. The legations were post-poned from the 1st of February to the 13th. On the
            former day our business was not brought to a settlement. On the 2nd of February Milo
            appeared for trial. Pompey came to support him. Marcellus spoke on being called upon by
            me. <note n="1" anchored="true">
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Milo</foreign> impeached by Clodius before the <foreign
                xml:lang="la">comitia tributa</foreign> for his employment of gladiators. Dio
              (xxxix. 18) says that Clodius thus impeached <foreign xml:lang="la">Milo</foreign>,
              not with any hope of securing his conviction against the powerful support of Cicero
              and Pompey, but to get the chance of insulting these latter. Marcellus was one of the
              candidates for the aedileship with Clodius. See Letter XCI. </note> We came off with
            flying colours. The case was adjourned to the 7th. Meanwhile (in the senate), the
            legations having been postponed to the i3th, the business of allotting the quaestors and
            furnishing the outfit of the praetors was brought before the house. But nothing was
            done, because many speeches were interposed denouncing the state of the Republic. Gaius
            Cato published his bill for the recall of Lentulus, whose son thereupon put on mourning.
            On the 7th Milo appeared. Pompey spoke, or rather wished to speak. For as soon as he got
            up Clodius's ruffians raised a shout, and throughout his whole speech he was
            interrupted, not only by hostile cries, but by personal abuse and insulting remarks.
            However, when he had finished his speech—for he shewed great courage in these
            circumstances, he was <pb n="214"/> not cowed, he said all he had to say, and at times
            had by his Commanding presence even secured silence for his words —well, when he had
            finished, up got Clodius. Our party received him with such a shout—for they had
            determined to pay him out—that he lost all presence of mind, power of speech, or control
            over his countenance. This went on up to two o'clock-Pompey having finished his speech
            at noon —and every kind of abuse, and finally epigrams of the most outspoken indecency
            were uttered against Clodius and Clodia. Mad and livid with rage Clodius, in the very
            midst of the shouting, kept putting questions to his claque: "Who was it who was
            starving the commons to death?" His ruffians answered, "Pompey." "Who wanted to be sent
            to <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>?" They answered, "Pompey."
            "Who did they wish to go?" They answered, "Crassus." The latter was present at the time
            with no friendly feelings to Milo. About three o'clock, as though at a given signal, the
            Clodians began spitting at our men. There was an outburst of rage. They began a movement
            for forcing us from our ground. Our men charged: his ruffians turned tail. Clodius was
            pushed off the rostra: and then we too made our escape for fear of mischief in the riot.
            The senate was summoned into the Curia: Pompey went home. However, I did not myself
            enter the senate-house, lest I should be obliged either to refrain from speaking on
            matters of such gravity, or in defending Pompey (for he was being attacked by Bibulus,
            Curio, Favonius, and Servilius the younger) should give offence to the loyalists. The
            business was adjourned to the next day. Clodius fixed the Quirinalia (17th of February)
            for his prosecution. On the 8th the senate met in the temple of Apollo, that Pompey
            might attend. Pompey made an impressive speech. That day nothing was concluded. On the
            9th in the temple of Apollo a decree passed the senate "that what had taken place on the
            7th of February was treasonable." On this day Cato warmly inveighed against Pompey, and
            throughout his speech arraigned him as though he were at the bar. He said a great deal
            about me, to my disgust, though it was in very laudatory terms. When he attacked
            Pompey's perfidy to me, he was listened to in profound silence on the part of my
            enemies. Pompey answered him boldly with a palpable allusion to Crassus, and said
            outright that "he would take <pb n="215"/> better precautions to protect his life than
            Mricanus had done, whom C. Carbo had assassinated." <note n="1" anchored="true">In <date
                when="-0129">B.C. 129</date>, after making a speech in favour of the claims of the

                >Scipio</foreign> Aemilianus, the younger Africanus, was found dead in his bed. The
              common report was that he had been assassinated by <foreign xml:lang="la"
                >Carbo</foreign>, or with his privity, but it was never proved (see <bibl
                n="Cic. Orat. 2.170"/><bibl n="Cic. Off. 2">de Orat. 2</bibl>.170). Cicero does not
              here assume the truth of the story he merely repeats Pompey's words. </note>
            Accordingly, important events appear to me to be in the wind. For Pompey understands
            what is going on, and imparts to me that plots are being formed against his life, that
            Gaius Cato is being supported by Crassus, that money is being supplied to Clodius, that
            both are backed by Crassus and Curio, as well as by Bibulus and his other detractors:
            that he must take extraordinary precautions to prevent being overpowered by that
            demagogue-with a people all but wholly alienated, a nobility hostile, a senate
            ill-affected, and the younger men corrupt. So he is making his preparations and
            summoning men from the country. On his part, Clodius is rallying his gangs: a body of
            men is being got together for the Quirinalia. For that occasion we are considerably in a
            majority, owing to the forces brought up by Pompey himself: and a large contingent is
            expected from Picenum and <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gallia</placeName>, to enable us
            to throw out Cato's bills also about 'Milo and Lentulus. On the ioth of February an
            indictment was lodged against Sestius for bribery by the informer Cn. Nerius, of the
            Pupinian tribe, and on the same day by a certain M. Tullius for <note n="2"

            at once, as I was bound to do, to his house, and put myself wholly at his service: and
            that was more than people expected, who thought that I had good cause for being angry
            with him. The result is that my extreme kindness and grateful disposition are made
            manifest both to Sestius himself and to all the world, and I shall be as good as my
            word. But this same informer Nerius also named Cn. Lentulus Vatia and C. Cornelius to
            the commissioners. <note n="3" anchored="true">

            that those who did not break off from them should be liable to the same penalty as those
            convicted of riot." On the 11th of February I spoke in defence of Bestia <note n="1"

            the course of my speech I came to the incident of Sestius, after receiving many wounds
            in the temple of Castor, having been preserved by the aid of Bestia. Here I took
            occasion to pave the way beforehand for a refutation of the charges which are being got
            up against Sestius, and I passed a well-deserved encomium upon him with the cordial
            approval of everybody. He was himself very much delighted with it. I tell you this
            because you have often advised me in your letters to retain the friendship of Sestius. I

          <p> Our friend Sestius was acquitted on the uth of March, and, what was of great
            importance to the Republic—that there should be no appearance of difference of opinion
            in a case of that sort—was acquitted unanimously. As to what I had often gathered from
            your letters, that you were anxious about—that I should not leave any loophole for abuse
            to an unfriendly critic on the score of my being ungrateful, if I did not treat with the
            utmost indulgence his occasional wrong-headedness—let me tell you that in this trial I
            established my character for being the most grateful of men. For in conducting the
            defence I satisfied in the fullest manner possible a man of difficult temper, and, what
            he above all things desired, I cut up Vatinius (by whom he was being openly attacked)
            just as I pleased, with the applause of gods and men. And, farther, when our friend

            hesitated to do so, and Macer, rising from Sestius's benches, declared that he would not

            confusion and thoroughly discredited. That most excellent boy, your son Quintus, is
            getting on splendidly with his education. I notice this the more because Tyrannio <note

              to recall Lentulus. </note> on whom, however, our friend Milo played a very pretty
            trick. For that defender of the employment of gladiators and beast-fighters had bought
            some beast-fighters from Cosconius and Pomponius, and had never appeared in public
            without them in their full armour. He could not afford to maintain <pb n="221"/> them,
            and accordingly had great difficulty in keeping them together. Milo found this out. He
            commissioned an individual, with whom he was not intimate, to buy this troop from Cato
            without exciting his suspicion. As soon as it had been removed, Racilius—at this time
            quite the only real tribune-revealed the truth, acknowledged that the men had been
            purchased for himself—for this is what they had agreed—and put up a notice that he
            intended to sell "Cato's troop." This notice caused much laughter. Accordingly, Lentulus
            has prevented Cato from going on with his laws, and also those who published bills of a
            monstrous description about Caesar, with no tribune to veto them. Caninius's proposal,
            indeed, about Pompey has died a natural death. For it is not approved of in itself, and
            our friend Pompey is also spoken of with great severity for the breach of his friendship
            with Publius Lentulus. He is not the man he was. The fact is that to the lowest dregs of
            the populace his support of Milo gives some offence, while the aristocrats are
            dissatisfied with much that he omits to do, and find fault with much that he does. This
            is the only point, however, in which I am not pleased with Marcellinus- that he handles
            him too roughly. Yet in this he is not going counter to the wishes of the senate:
            consequently I am the more glad towithdrawfrom the senate-house and from politics
            altogether. In the courts I have the same position as I ever had: never was my house
            more crowded. One untoward circumstance has occurred owing to Milo's rashness—the
            acquittal of Sext. Clodius <note n="1" anchored="true">A <foreign xml:lang="la"
                >scriba</foreign> or public clerk, and a client of the patrician Clodii. </note>
            -whose prosecution at this particular time, and by a weak set of accusers, was against
            my advice. In a most Corrupt panel his conviction failed by only three votes.
            Consequently the people clamour for a fresh trial, and he must surely be brought back
            into court. For people will not put up with it, and seeing that, though pleading before
            a panel of his own kidney, he was all but condemned, they look upon him as practically
            condemned. Even in this matter the unpopularity of Pompey was an obstacle in our path.
            For the votes of the senators were largely in his favour, those of the knights were
            equally divided, while the <foreign xml:lang="la">tribuni aerarii</foreign> voted for
            his condemntion. <pb n="222"/> But for this eon'rekmps I am consoled by the daily
            condemnations of my enemies, among whom, to my great delight, Servius <note n="1"
              anchored="true">Unknown. Cicero's words seem to imply that he nearly got convicted,
              but not quite. </note> got upon the rocks: the rest are utterly done for. Gaius Cato
            declared in public meeting that he would not allow the elections to be held, if he were
            deprived of the days for doing business with the people. Appius has not yet returned
            from his visit to Caesar. I am looking forward with extraordinary eagerness to a letter
            from you. Although I know the sea is still closed, yet they tell me that certain persons
            have, nevertheless, arrived from <placeName key="tgn,7001663">Olbia</placeName> full of
            your praises, and declaring you to be very highly thought of in the province. They said
            also that these persons reported that you intended to cross as soon as navigation became
            possible. That is what I desire: but although it is yourself, of course, that I most
            look forward to, yet meanwhile I long for a letter. Farewell, my dear brother. </p>

          <p> I have already sent you a letter containing the information of my daughter Tullia
            having been betrothed to Crassipes on the 4th of April, and other intelligence public
            and private. The following are the events since then. On the 5th of April, by a decree
            of the senate, a sum of money amounting to 40,000 sestertia (about £320,000) was voted
            to Pompey for the business of the corn-supply. But on the same day there was a vehement
            debate on the Campanian land, the senators making almost as much noise as a public
            meeting. The shortness of money and the high price of corn increased the exasperation.
            Nor will I omit the following: the members of the colleges of the Capitolini and the
            Mercuriales <note n="2" anchored="true">In <date when="-00357">B.C. 357</date> a

              consisted of men living on the Capitoline (<bibl n="Liv. 5.50">Livy, 5.50</bibl>). The
              Mercuriates were a "college" or company of merchants who celebrated the rite of the

            <pb n="223"/> expelled from their society a Roman knight named M. Furius Flaccus, a man
            of bad character: the expulsion took place when he was at the meeting, and though he
            threw himself at the feet of each member. On the 6th of April, the eve of my departure
            from town, I gave a betrothal party to Crassipes. That excellent boy, your and my
            Quintus, was not at the banquet owing to a very slight indisposition. On the 7th of
            April I visited Quintus and found him quite restored. He talked a good deal and with
            great feeling about the quarrels between our wives. What need I say more? Nothing could
            have been pleasanter. Pomponia, however, had some Complaints to make of you also: but of
            this when we meet. After leaving your boy I went to the site of your house: the building
            was going on with a large number of workmen. I urged the contractor Longilius to push
            on. He assured me that he had every wish to satisfy us. The house will be splendid, for
            it Can be better seen now than we could judge from the plan: my own house is also being
            built with despatch. On this day I dined with Crassipes. After dinner I went in my sedan
            to visit Pompey at his suburban villa. I had not been able to call on him in the daytime
            as he was away from home. However, I wished to see him, because I am leaving <placeName
              key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> tomorrow, and he is on the point of starting for
              <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName>. I found him at home and begged him
            to restore you to us as soon as possible. "Immediately," he said. He is going to start,
            according to what he said, on the uth of April, with the intention of embarking at
              <placeName key="tgn,7006074">Livorno</placeName> or <placeName key="perseus,Pisa"

          <p> How delighted I was to get your letter! It had been expected by me at first, it is
            true, only with longing, but recently with alarm also. And, in fact, let me tell you
            that this is the only letter which has reached me since the one brought me by your
            sailor and dated <placeName key="tgn,7001663">Olbia</placeName>. But let everything
            else, as you say, be reserved till we can talk it over together. One thing, however, I
            cannot put off: on the 15th of May the senate covered itself with glory by refusing
            Gabinius a <foreign xml:lang="la">supplicatio</foreign>. Procilius <note n="1"

            such a slight was never inflicted on anyone. Out of doors there is much applause. To me,
            gratifying as it is on its own account, it is even more so because it was done when I
            was not in the house. For it was an unbiassed <note n="2" anchored="true"><foreign

            senate, without any attack or exercise of influence on my part. The debate previously
            arranged for the 15th and 16th, namely, the question of the Campanian land, did not come
            on. In this matter I don't quite see my way. <note n="3" anchored="true"><foreign

          <p> I thought you would like my book: <note n="1" anchored="true">His poem "On his own
              Times."</note> that you like it as much as you say I am greatly delighted. As to your

              anchored="true">In his poem <title>de Consulatu suo</title>, the second book of which
                (<foreign xml:lang="la">Urania</foreign>) ends with a speech of Iupiter, who

            book, I do indeed remember it, and that whole passage was aimed at myself rather than at
            the rest of the world. Nevertheless, the day after you started I went long before
            daybreak with Vibullius to call on Pompey; and upon addressing him on the subject of the
            works and inscriptions in your honour, <note n="3" anchored="true">A statue in the
              temple of Tellus.</note> he answered me very kindly, gave me great hopes, said he
            would like to talk to Crassus about it, and advised me to do so too. I joined in
            escorting Crassus to his house on his assuming the consulate: he undertook the affair,
            and said that Clodius would at this juncture have something that wanted to get by means
            of himself and Pompey: he thought that, if I did not baulk Clodius's views, I might get
            what I wanted without any opposition. I left the matter entirely in his hands and told
            him that I would do exactly as he wished. Publius Crassus the younger was present at
            this conversation, who, as you know, is very warmly attached to me. What Clodius wants
            is an honorary mission (if not by decree of the senate, then by popular vote) to
              <placeName key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</placeName> or to Brogitarus, or to both.

              these favours.</note> There is a good deal of money in it. It is a thing I don't
            trouble myself about much, even if I don't get what I am trying to get. Pompey, however,
            has spoken <pb n="249"/> to Crassus. They seem to have taken the business in hand. If
            they carry it through, well and good: if not, let us return to my "Iupiter." On the 11th
            of February a decree passed the senate as to bribery on the motion of Afranius, against
            which I had spoken when you were in the house. To the loudly expressed disapprobation of
            the senate the consuls did not go on with the proposals of those who, while agreeing
            with Afranius's motion, added a rider that after their election the praetors were to
            remain private citizens for sixty days. <note n="1" anchored="true">The praetorian

              would have been liable if, as in ordinary years, they had been "praetors designate"

            essence of culture. But I did not like to invite a man of weak health to a villa
            practically without a roof, and which even now it would be a compliment to describe as
            unfinished. It would indeed be a special treat to me to have the enjoyment of him here
            also. For I assure you that the neighbourhood of Marius makes the sunshine of that other

          <p> Your note by its strong language has drawn out this letter. For as to what actually
            occurred on the day of your start, it supplied me with absolutely no subject for
            writing. But as when we are together we are never at a loss for something to say, so
            ought our letters at times to digress into loose chat. Well then, to begin, the liberty
            of the Tenedians has received short shrift, <note n="1" anchored="true">Lit. "has been
              beheaded with the axe of <foreign xml:lang="la">Tenes</foreign>," mythical founder and
              legislator of <foreign xml:lang="la">Tenedos</foreign>, whose laws were of Draconian
              severity. A <foreign xml:lang="la">legatio</foreign>from <foreign xml:lang="la"
                >Tenedos</foreign>, heard as usual in February, had asked that <foreign
                xml:lang="la">Tenedos</foreign> might be made a <foreign xml:lang="la">libera
                civitas</foreign>. </note> no one speaking for them except myself, Bibulus,
            Calidius, and Favonius. A complimentary reference to you was made by the legates from
              <placeName key="tgn,7002751">Magnesia</placeName> ad Sipylum, they saying that you
            were the man who alone <pb n="266"/> had resisted the demand of L. Sestius Pansa. <note

            days of this business in the senate, if anything occurs which you ought to know, or even
            if there is nothing, I will write you something every day. On the 12th I will not fail
            you or Pomponius. The poems of Lucretius are as you say—with many flashes of genius, yet
            very technical. <note n="2" anchored="true">Lucretius seems to have been now dead,
              according to Donatus 15 October (<date when="-0055">B.C. 55</date>), though the date
              is uncertain. I have translated the reading <foreign xml:lang="la">multi tamen
                artis</foreign>, which has been changed by some to <foreign xml:lang="la">multa

              fine poetical passages in the <foreign xml:lang="la">de Rerum Natura</foreign> and the
              mass of technical exposition of philosophy which must have repelled the "general
              reader" at all times. It suggests at once to Cicero to mention another poem on a
              similar subject, the <title>Empedoclea</title> of Sallustius, of which and its writer
              we know nothing. It was not the historian. </note> But when you return, ... if you
            succeed in reading the <title>Empedoclea</title> of Sallustius, I shall regard you as a

          <p> I am glad you like my letter: however, I should not even now have had anything to
            write about, if I had not received yours. For on the 12th, when Appius had got together
            a thinly-attended meeting of the senate, the cold was so great that he was compelled by
            the general clamour <note n="3" anchored="true">Retaining <foreign xml:lang="la">populi
                convicio</foreign>, and explaining <foreign xml:lang="la">populi</foreign> to have
              the general meaning of the crowd, including senators and spectators. Cicero uses
                <foreign xml:lang="la">populus</foreign> in this vague way elsewhere. </note> to
            dismiss us. As to the Commagenian, because I have blown that proposition to the winds,
            Appius makes wonderful advances to me both personally and through Pomponius; for he sees
            that if I adopt a similar style of discussion in the other business, February will not
            bring him anything in. And <pb n="267"/> certainly I did chaff him pretty well, and not
            only wrenched from his grasp that petty township of his—situated in the territory of
              <placeName key="tgn,7017540">Zeugma</placeName> on the <placeName key="tgn,1123842"

                >Euphrates</placeName>, part of the Roman province of <placeName key="tgn,1000140"
                >Syria</placeName>, and close to the frontier of <foreign xml:lang="la"
                >Commagene</foreign>. Antiochus had asked that some stronghold should be reckoned as
              his rather than as belonging to the province. </note> —but also raised a loud laugh by
            my satire on the man's purple-edged toga, which he had been granted when Caesar was
            consul. <note n="2" anchored="true">Appius, he insinuates, hoped to make money by

              some position with a shadow of Roman' <foreign xml:lang="la">imperium</foreign>, while
              at the same time conveying a compliment to the Roman suzerainty. See Polyb. xxvi;
              30.26; <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 60">Suet. Aug. 60</bibl>. </note> "His wish," said I, "for

              xml:lang="la">toga praetexta</foreign>, will you allow the Commagenian to do so?" You
            see the style of chaff, and the line I took. I spoke at length against the petty
            princeling, with the result that he was utterly laughed out of court. Alarmed by this
            exhibition, as I said, Appius is making up to me For nothing could be easier than to
            explode the rest of his proposals. But I will not go so far as to trip him up, lest he
            appeal to the god of hospitality, and summon all his Greeks—it is they who make us
            friends again. I will do what Theopompus wants. I had forgotten to write to you about
            Caesar: for I perceive what sort of letter you have been expecting. But the fact is, he
            has written word to Balbus that the little packet of letters, in which mine and Balbus's
            were packed, had been so drenched with rain that he was not even aware that there was a
            letter from me. He had, however, made out a few words of Balbus's letter, to which he
            answered as follows: "I perceive that you have written something about Cicero, which I
            have not fully made out: but, as far I could guess, it was of a kind that I thought was
            more to be wished than hoped for." Accordingly, I afterwards sent Caesar a duplicate
            copy of the letter. Don't be put off by that passage <pb n="268"/> about his want of
            means. In answer to it I wrote back saying that he must not stop payment from any
            reliance on my money chest, and descanted playfully on that subject, in familiar terms
            and yet without derogating from my dignity. His good feeling towards us, however,
            according to all accounts, is marked. The letter, indeed, on the point of which you
            expect to hear, will almost coincide with your return : <note n="1" anchored="true"
              >Quintus was expecting, what he got, the offer of serving under Caesar as <foreign

              in the deserted state of the Consul Appius's house, which in all probability will miss
              its usual bevy of callers. This explanation—put forward by Prof. Tyrrell—is not wholly

              the letter of Quintus. But he seems to have used the expression for something
              incongruous either in politics, or in regard to his contemplated services with Caesar.
            </note> made me laugh, and I am very glad that you are in a cheerful frame of mind and
            ready for a joke. As to Pompey, I agree with you, or rather you agree with me. For, as
            you know, I have long been singing the praises of your Caesar. Believe me, he is very
            close to my heart, and I am not going to let him slip from his place. Now for the
            history of the Ides (13th). It was Caelius's tenth day. <note n="2" anchored="true">I.e.
              the day he had to appear for trial, usually fixed by the praetor on the tenth day from
              the notice of prosecution. Caelius had been acquitted in <date when="-0056">B.C.
                56</date>, when Cicero defended him; this second trial appears to have in some way
              fallen through. The praetor Domitius is said to be Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus, son of
              Lucius, but he was much too young to have been praetor this year. The former trial of
              Caelius (<date when="-0056">B.C. 56</date>) had been before Cn. Domitius Calvinus,
              hence a difficulty about this passage. For the praetor Domitius of this year is not
              known. Domitius Calvinus was praetor <date when="-0056">B.C. 56</date>. </note>
            Domitius had not obtained a full panel. I am afraid that foul ruffian, Servius Pola,
            will appear for the prosecution. For our friend Caelius has a dead set made at him by
            the Clodian gens. There is nothing certain as yet, but I am afraid. On the same day
            there was a full house for the case of the Tyrians: the <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >publicani</foreign> of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> appeared in <pb
              n="271"/> large numbers against them. Gabinius was abused roundly : <note n="1"
              anchored="true">The <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign> of <placeName
                key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> were enraged with Gabinius for neglecting his
              province while going to <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, thus allowing
              the pirates so to plunder that they could not collect enough dues to recoup them for
              their bargain to the state (<bibl n="TLG385.1 39.59">Dio, 39.59</bibl>). </note> the
              <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign> were also denounced by (the consul)
            Domitius for having escorted him on his start on horseback. Our friend Lucius Lamia was
            somewhat insolent: for on Domitius saying, "It is your fault, equites of <placeName
              key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, that such things have happened: for you give
            verdicts laxly," he said, "Yes, we give verdicts, but you senators give evidence of
            character." <note n="2" anchored="true">L. Aelius <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Lamia</foreign>, an <foreign xml:lang="la">eques</foreign>, appears to have been one
              of the deputation of <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign> who attended the
              senate to accuse Gabinius. </note> Nothing was done that day: the house stood
            adjourned at nightfall. On the comitial days which follow the Quirinalia (17th
            February), Appius holds the view that he is not prevented by the <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >lex Pupia</foreign> from holding a meeting of the senate, and that by the <foreign
              xml:lang="la">lex Gabinia</foreign> he is even compelled to have a meeting for the
            legations from the 1st of February to the 1st of March. <note n="3" anchored="true">The
              praetorian elections were again postponed from the previous year to the early months
              of <date when="-0054">B.C. 54</date>. Appius Claudius found means to put them off till
              March by holding meetings of the senate each day—the electoral <foreign xml:lang="la"
                >comitia</foreign> not being able to meet on the same day as the senate. </note> And
            so the elections are supposed to be put off till March. Nevertheless, on these comitial
            days the tribunes say that they will bring forward the case of Gabinius. <note n="4"
              anchored="true">The tribune C. Memmius was prosecuting Gabinius (Letter CXLVII). The

            on. Yes, do as you say in your letter, what, even if you had not said so, I know you do
            with the greatest care—digest, follow up, and carry out my instructions. For my part,
            when I get to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, I will let no
            letter-carrier of Caesar go without a letter for you. During these days you must excuse
            me: there has been no one to whom I could deliver a letter until the present bearer M.
            Orfius, a Roman knight, a man that is my friend as well from personal consideration as
            because he comes from the <foreign xml:lang="la">municipium</foreign> of <placeName

            a man in a brilliant position in his own town and looked up to even beyond it. Pray
            attach him to yourself by your liberal treatment of him: he is a military tribune in

          </opener>
          <p> On the 2nd of June, the day of my return to <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
              >Rome</placeName>, I received your letter dated <placeName key="perseus,Placentia"
              >Placentia</placeName>: then next day another dated Blandeno, along with a letter from
            Caesar filled full of courteous, earnest, and pleasant expressions. These expressions
            are indeed valuable, or rather <foreign xml:lang="la">most</foreign> valuable, as
            tending very powerfully to secure our reputation and exalted position in the state. But
            believe me—for you know my heart—that what I value most in all this I already possess,
            that is, first of all, your active contribution to our common position; and, secondly,
            all that warm affection of Caesar for me, which I prefer to all the honours which he
            desires me to expect at his hands. His letter too, despatched at the same time as your
            own—which begins by saying what pleasure your arrival and the renewed memory of our old
            affection had given him, and goes on to say that he will take care that, in the midst of
            my sorrow and regret at losing you, I shall have reason to be <pb n="277"/> glad that
            you are with him of all people—gave me extraordinary delight. Wherefore you, of course,
            are acting in a truly brotherly spirit when you exhort me, though, by heaven, I am now
            indeed forward enough to do so, to concentrate all my attentions upon him alone. Yes, I
            will do so, indeed, with a burning zeal: and perhaps I shall manage to accomplish what
            is frequently the fortune of travellers when they make great haste, who, if they have
            got up later than they intended, have, by increasing their speed, arrived at their
            destination sooner than if they had waked up before daylight. Thus I, since I have long
            overslept myself in cultivating that great man, though you, by heaven, often tried to
            wake me up, will make up for my slowness with horses and (as you say he likes my poem) a
            poet's chariots. Only let me have <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName> to
            paint in colours supplied by yourself, but with my own brush. But what am I saying? What
            prospect of leisure have I, especially as I remain at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
              >Rome</placeName> in accordance with his request? But I will see. For perhaps, as
            usual, my love for you will overcome all difficulties. For my having sent Trebatius to
            him he even thanks me in very witty and polite terms, remarking that there was no one in
            the whole number of his staff who knew how to draw up a recognizance. I have asked him
            for a tribuneship for M. Curtius—since Domitius (the consul) would have thought that he
            was being laughed at, if my petition had been addressed to him, for his daily assertion
            is that he hasn't the appointment of so much as a military tribune: he even jested in
            the senate at his colleague Appius as having gone to visit Caesar, <note n="1"
              anchored="true">At <foreign xml:lang="la">Luca</foreign> in the year <date
                when="-0056">B.C. 56</date>. </note> that he might get from him at least one
            tribuneship. But my request was for next year, for that was what Curtius wished.
            Whatever line you think I ought to take in politics and in treating my opponents, be
            sure I shall take, and shall be "gentler than any ear-lap." Affairs at <placeName
              key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> stand thus: there is some hope of the elections
            taking place, but it is an uncertain one. There is some latent idea of a dictatorship,
              <note n="2" anchored="true">
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Comitia habendi causa</foreign>. No such had been appointed
              since <date when="-0202">B.C. 202</date>, and the irregular dictatorship of <foreign

              distasteful. Pompey was understood to wish for the appointment, now and later on. See

          <p> Well! this time I'll use a good pen, well-mixed ink, and superfine paper. For you say
            you could hardly read my previous letter, for which, my dear brother, the reason was
            none of those which you suppose. For I was not busy, nor agitated, nor out of temper
            with some one: but it is always my way to take the first pen that turns up and use it as
            if it were a good one. But now attend, best and dearest of brothers, to my answer to
            what you wrote in this same short letter in such a very business-like way. On this
            subject you beg that I should write back to you with brotherly candour, without
            concealment, or reserve, or consideration for your feelings—I mean whether you are to
            hasten home, as we had talked of, or to stay where you are, if there is any excuse for
            doing so, in order to extricate yourself from your embarrassments. If, my dear Quintus,
            it were some small matter on which you were asking my opinion, though I should have left
            it to you to do what you chose, I should yet have shewn you what mine was. But on this
            subject your question amounts to this—what sort of year I expect the next to be? Either
            quite undisturbed as far as we are concerned, or at any rate one that will find us in
            the highest state of preparation for defence. This is shewn by the daily throng at my
            house, my reception in the forum, the cheers which greet me in the theatre. My friends
            feel no anxiety, because they know the strength of my position in my hold upon the
            favour <pb n="279"/> both of Caesar and Pompey. These things give me entire confidence.
            But if some furious outbreak of that madman occurs, everything is ready for crushing
            him. This is my feeling, my deliberate opinion: I write to you with entire confidence. I
            bid you have no doubts, and I do so with no intention of pleasing you, but with
            brotherly frankness. Therefore, while I should wish you to come at the time you
            arranged, for the sake of the pleasure we should have in each other's society, yet I
            prefer the course you yourself think the better one. I, too, think these objects of
            great importance—ample means for yourself and extrication from your load of debt. Make
            up your mind to this, that, free from embarrassments, we should be the happiest people
            alive if we keep well. For men of our habits the deficiency is small, and such as can be
            supplied with the greatest ease, granted only that we keep our health. <milestone
              unit="para"/>There is an enormous recrudescence of bribery. Never was there anything
            equal to it. On the 15th of July the rate of interest rose from four to eight per cent,
            owing to the compact made by Memmius with the consul Domitius : <note n="1"
              anchored="true">For the nature of this compact, see p.300. </note> I wish Scaurus
            could get the better of it. Messalla is very shaky. I am not exaggerating—they arrange
            to offer as much as 10,000 sestertia for the vote of the first century. The matter is a
            burning scandal. The candidates for the tribuneship have made a mutual compact—having
            deposited 500 sestertia apiece with Cato, they agree to conduct their canvass according
            to his direction, with the understanding that anyone offending against it is to be
            condemned by him. If this election then turns out to be pure, Cato will have been of
            more avail than all laws and jurors put together. <pb n="280"/>

          <p> When you receive a letter from me by the hand of an amanuensis, you may be sure that I
            have not even a little leisure; when by my own—a little. For let me tell you that in
            regard to causes and trials in court, I have never been closer tied, and that, too, at
            the most unhealthy season of the year, and in the most oppressively hot weather. But
            these things, since you so direct me, I must put up with, and must not seem to have come
            short of the ideas and expectations which you and Caesar entertain of me, especially
            since, even if it were somewhat difficult not to do that, I am yet likely from this
            labour to reap great popularity and <pb n="290"/> prestige. Accordingly, as you wish me
            to do, I take great pains not to hurt anyone's feelings, and to secure being liked even
            by those very men who are vexed at my close friendship with Caesar, while by those who
            are impartial, or even inclined to this side, I may be warmly courted and loved. When
            some very violent debates took place in the senate on the subject of bribery for several
            days, because the candidates for the consulship had gone to such lengths as to be past
            all bearing, I was not in the house. I have made up my mind not to attempt any Cure of
            the political situation without powerful protection. The day I write this Drusus has
            been acquitted on a charge of collusion by the <foreign xml:lang="la">tribuni
              aerarii</foreign>, in the grand total by four votes, for the majority of senators and
            equites were for condemnation. On the same day I am to defend Vatinius. That is an easy
            matter. The <foreign xml:lang="la">comitia</foreign> have been put off to September.
            Scaurus's trial will take place immediately, and I shall not fail to appear for him. I
            don't like your "Sophoclean Banqueters" at all, though I see that you played your part
            with a good grace. <note n="1" anchored="true">In the "Banqueters" (<foreign
                xml:lang="grc">su/ndeipnoi</foreign>) of Sophocles, Achilles is excluded from a

              occurred to Quintus in camp. </note> I come now to a subject which, perhaps, ought to
            have been my first. How glad I was to get your letter from <placeName key="tgn,7008653"
              >Britain</placeName>! I was afraid of the ocean, afraid of the coast of the island.
            The other parts of the enterprise I do not underrate; but yet they inspire more hope
            than fear, and it is the suspense rather than any positive alarm that renders me uneasy.
            You, however, I can see, have a splendid subject for description, topography, natural
            features of things and places, manners, races, battles, your commander himself—what
            themes for your pen! I will gladly, as you request, assist you in the points you
            mention, and will send you the verses you ask for, that is, "An owl to <placeName

            you are keeping me in the dark. Tell me, my dear brother, what Caesar thinks of my
            verses. For he wrote before to tell me he had read my first book. Of the first part, he
            said that he had never read anything better even in Greek: the rest, up to a particular
            passage, somewhat "careless " <note n="3" anchored="true">
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">r(a|qumo/tera</foreign>. </note> —that is his word. Tell me
            the truth—is it the subject-matter or <pb n="291"/> the "style" that he does not like?
            You needn't be afraid: I shall not admire myself one whit the less. On this subject
            speak like a lover of truth, and with your usual brotherly frankness. </p>

            <dateline>ARPINUM AND ROME, 28 SEPTEMBER</dateline>
          </opener>
          <p> After extraordinarily hot weather—I never remember greater heat—I have refreshed
            myself at <placeName key="perseus,Arpinum">Arpinum</placeName>, and enjoyed the extreme
            loveliness of the river during the days of the games, having left my tribesmen under the
            charge of Philotimus. <note n="1" anchored="true">That is, to get them seats at the
              games. See Letter XXVI, p.63. </note> I was at Arcanum on the 10th of September. There
            I found Mescidius and Philoxenus, and saw the water, for which they were making a course
            not far from your villa, running quite nicely, especially considering the extreme
            drought, and they said that they were going to collect it in much greater abundance.
            Everything is right with <placeName key="tgn,7017431">Herus</placeName>. In your
            Manilian property I came across Diphilus outdoing himself in dilatoriness. Still, he had
            nothing left to construct, except baths, and a promenade, and an aviary. I liked that
            villa very much, because its paved colonnade gives it an air of very great dignity. I
            never appreciated this till now that the colonnade <note n="2" anchored="true">The
                <foreign xml:lang="la">porticus</foreign> is a kind of cloister round the <foreign
                xml:lang="la">peristylium</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="la">atrium</foreign>.
            </note> itself has been all laid open, and the columns have been polished. It all
            depends—and this I will look to—upon the stuccoing being prettily done. The pavements
            seemed to be being well laid. Certain of the ceilings I did not like, and ordered them
            to be changed. As to the place in which they say that you write word that a small
            entrance hall is to be built—namely, in the colonnade—I liked it better as it is. For I
            did not think there was space sufficient for an entrance hall; nor is it usual to have
            one, except in those buildings which have a larger court; nor could it have bedrooms and
            apartments of that kind attached <pb n="292"/> to it. As it is, from the very beauty of
            its arched roof, it will serve as an admirable summer room. However, if you think
            differently, write back word as soon as possible. In the bath I have moved the hot
            chamber to the other corner of the dressing-room, because it was so placed that its
            steam-pipe was immediately under the bedrooms. A fair-sized bedroom and a lofty winter
            one I admired very much, for they were both spacious and well-situated—on the side of
            the promenade nearest to the bath. Diphilus had placed the columns out of the
            perpendicular, and not opposite each other. These, of course, he shall take down; he
            will learn some day to use the plumb-line and measure. On the whole, I hope Diphilus's
            work will be completed in a few months: for Caesius, who was with me at the time, keeps
            a very sharp lookout upon him. Thence I started straight along the <foreign
              xml:lang="la">via Vitularia</foreign> to your Fufidianum, the estate which we bought
            for you a few weeks ago at <placeName key="perseus,Arpinum">Arpinum</placeName> for
            100,000 sesterces. I never saw a shadier spot in summer-water springs in many parts of
            it, and abundant into the bargain. In short, Caesius thought that you would easily
            irrigate fifty <foreign xml:lang="la">jugera</foreign> of the meadow land. For my part,
            I can assure you of this, which is more in my line, that you will have a villa
            marvellously pleasant, with the addition of a fish-pond, spouting fountains, a <foreign
              xml:lang="la">palaestra</foreign>, and a shrubbery. I am told that you wish to keep
            this Bovillae estate. You will determine as you think good. Calvus said that, even if
            the control of the water were taken from you, and the right of drawing it off were
            established by the vendor, and thus an easement were imposed on that property, we could
            yet maintain the price in case we wished to sell. He said that he had agreed with you to
            do the work at three sesterces a foot, and that he had stepped it, and made it three
            miles. It seemed to me more. But I will guarantee that the money could nowhere be better
            laid out. I had sent for Cillo from <placeName key="perseus,Venafrum"
              >Venafrum</placeName>, but on that very day four of his fellow servants and
            apprentices had been crushed by the falling in of a tunnel at <placeName
              key="perseus,Venafrum">Venafrum</placeName>. On the 13th of September I was at
            Laterium. I examined the road, which appeared to me to be so good as to seem almost like
            a high road, except a hundred and fifty paces—for I measured it myself from the little
            bridge at the temple of Furina, in the direction of <placeName key="perseus,Satricum"
              >Satricum</placeName>. There they had put <pb n="293"/> down dust, not gravel (this
            shall be changed), and that part of the road is a very steep incline. But I understood
            that it could not be taken in any other direction, particularly as you did not wish it
            to go through the property of Locusta or Varro. The latter alone had made the road very
            well where it skirted his own property. Locusta hadn't touched it but I will call on him
            at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and think I shall be able to stir him
            up, and at the same time I shall ask M. Taurus, who is now at <placeName
              key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and whom I am told promised to allow you to do
            so, about making a watercourse through his property. I much approved of your steward
            Nicephorius, and I asked him what orders you had given about that small building at
            Laterium, about which you spoke to me. He told me in answer that he had himself
            contracted to do the work for sixteen sestertia, but that you had afterwards made many
            additions to the work, but nothing to the price, and that he had therefore given it up.
            I quite approve, by Hercules, of your making the additions you had determined upon;
            although the villa as it stands seems to have the air of a philosopher, meant to rebuke
            the extravagance of other villas. Yet, after all, that addition will be pleasing. I
            praised your landscape gardener: he has so covered everything with ivy, both the
            foundation-wall of the villa and the spaces between the columns of the walk, that, upon
            my word, those Greek statues seemed to be engaged in fancy gardening, and to be shewing
            off the ivy. Finally, nothing can be cooler or more mossy than the dressing-room of the
            bath. That is about all I have to say about country matters. The gardener, indeed, as
            well as Philotimus and Cincius are pressing on the ornamentation of your town house; but
            I also often look in upon it myself, as I can do without difficulty. Wherefore don't be
            at all anxious about that. <milestone unit="para"/>As to your always asking me about
            your son, of course I "excuse you"; but I must ask you to "excuse" me also, for I don't
            allow that you love him more than I do. And oh that he had been with me these last few
            days at <placeName key="perseus,Arpinum">Arpinum</placeName>, as he had himself set his
            heart on being, and as I had no less done! As to Pomponia, please write and say that,
            when I go out of town anywhere, she is to come with me and bring the boy. I'll do
            wonders with him, if I get him to myself when I am at leisure: for at <placeName
              key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> there is no time to breathe. You <pb n="294"/>
            know I formerly promised to do so for nothing. What do you expect with such a reward as
            you promise me? I now come to your letters which I received in several packets when I
            was at <placeName key="perseus,Arpinum">Arpinum</placeName>. For I received three from
            you in one day, and, indeed, as it seemed, despatched by you at the same time—one of
            considerable length, in which your first point was that my letter to you was dated
            earlier than that to Caesar. Oppius at times cannot help this: the reason is that,
            having settled to send letter-carriers, and having received a letter from me, he is
            hindered by something turning up, and obliged to despatch them later than he had
            intended; and I don't take the trouble to have the day altered on a letter which I have
            once handed to him. You write about Caesar's extreme affection for us. This affection
            you must on your part keep warm, and I for mine will endeavour to increase it by every
            means in my power. About Pompey, I am carefully acting, and shall continue to act, as
            you advise. That my permission to you to stay longer is a welcome one, though I grieve
            at your absence and miss you exceedingly, I am yet partly glad. What you can be thinking
            of in sending for such people as Hippodamus and some others, I do not understand. There
            is not one of those suburban estate. However, there is no reason for your fellows that
            won't expect a present from you equal to a classing my friend Trebatius with them. I
            sent him to Caesar, and Caesar has done all I expected. If he has not done quite what
              <emph>he</emph> expected himself, I am not bound to make it up to him, and I in like
            manner free and absolve you from all claims on his part. Your remark, that you are a
            greater favourite with Caesar every day, is a source of undying satisfaction to me. As
            to Balbus, who, as you say, promotes that state of things, he is the apple of my eye. I
            am indeed glad that you and my friend Trebonius like each other. As to what you say
            about the military tribuneship, I, indeed, asked for it definitely for Curtius, and
            Caesar wrote back definitely to say that there was one at Curtius's service, and chided
            me for my modesty in making the request. If I have asked one for anyone else—as I told
            Oppius to write and tell Caesar—I shall not be at all annoyed by a refusal, since those
            who pester me for letters <emph>are</emph> annoyed at a refusal from me. I like Curtius,
            as I have told him, not only <pb n="295"/> because you asked me to do so, but from the
            character you gave of him; for from your letter I have gathered the zeal he shewed for
            my restoration. As for the British expedition, I conclude from your letter that we have
            no occasion either for fear or exultation. As to public affairs, about which you wish
            Tiro to write to you, I have written to you hitherto somewhat more carelessly than
            usual, because I knew that all events, small or great, were reported to Caesar. I have
            now answered your longest letter. <milestone unit="para"/>Now hear what I have to say to
            your small one. The first point is about Clodius's letter to Caesar. In that matter I
            approve of Caesar's policy, in not having given way to your request so far as to write a
            single word to that Fury. The next thing is about the speech of Calventius "Marius."
              <note n="1" anchored="true">Calventius is said to stand for L. Calpurnius <foreign
                xml:lang="la">Piso</foreign> Caesoninus, the <foreign xml:lang="la">consul</foreign>
              of <date when="-0058">B.C. 58</date>, against whom Cicero's speech was spoken in <date
                when="-0055">B.C. 55</date> in the senate. He calls him Calventius from his maternal
              grandfather, and Marius because—as he had said, in the speech, 20—he had himself gone
              into exile rather than come to open fight with him; just as Q. Metellus had done in
                <date when="-0100">B.C. 100</date>, when, declining to take the oath to the agrarian
              law of Saturninus, rather than fight Marius, who had taken the oath, he went into
              exile. This seems rather a roundabout explanation; but no better has been proposed,
              and, of course, Quintus, who had lately read the speech, would be able better to
              understand the allusion. </note> I am surprised at your saying that you think I ought
            to answer it, particularly as, while no one is likely to read that speech, unless I
            write an answer to it, every schoolboy learns mine against him as an exercise. My books,
            all of which you are expecting, I have begun, but I cannot finish them for some days
            yet. The speeches for Scaurus and Plancius which you clamour for I have finished. The
            poem to Caesar, which I had begun, I have cut short. I will write what you ask me for,
            since your poetic springs are running dry, as soon as I have time. <milestone
              unit="para"/>Now for the third letter. It is very pleasant and welcome news to hear
            from you that Balbus is soon coming to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>,
            and so well accompanied! <note n="2" anchored="true">I.e., with money. </note> and will
            stay with me continuously till the 15th of May. As to your exhorting me in the same
            letter, as in many previous ones, to ambition and labour, I shall, of course, do as you
            say: but when am I to enjoy any real life? <milestone unit="para"/>Your fourth letter
            reached me on the 13th of September, <pb n="296"/> dated on the 10th of August from
              <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>. In it there was nothing new except
            about your <title>Erigona</title>, and if I get that from Oppius I will write and tell
            you what I think of it. I have no doubt I shall like it. <note n="1" anchored="true"
              >This tragedy of Quintus's never reached Cicero. It was lost in transit. Perhaps no
              great loss. </note> Oh yes I had almost forgotten to remark as to the man who, you say
            in your letter, had written to Caesar about the applause given to Milo—I am not
            unwilling that Caesar should think that it was as warm as possible. And in point of fact
            it was so, and yet that applause, which is given to him, seems in a certain sense to be
            given to me. <note n="2" anchored="true">
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Milo</foreign> was aedile and had just given some splendid
              games. </note>
            <milestone unit="para"/>I have also received a very old letter, but which was late in
            coming into my hands, in which you remind me about the temple of Tellus and the
            colonnade of Catulus. Both of these matters are being actively carried out. At the
            temple of Tellus I have even got your statue placed. So, again, as to your reminder
            about a suburban villa and gardens, I was never very keen for one, and now my town house
            has all the charm of such a pleasure-ground. On my arrival in Rome on the 18th of
            September I found the roof on your house finished: the part over the sitting-rooms,
            which you did not wish to have many gables, now slopes gracefully towards the roof of
            the lower colonnade. Our boy, in my absence, did not cease working with his rhetoric
            master. You have no reason for being anxious about his education, for you know his
            ability, and I see his application. Everything else I take it upon myself to guarantee,
            with full consciousness that I am bound to make it good. <milestone unit="para"/>As yet
            there are three parties prosecuting Gabinius: first, L. Lentulus, son of the <foreign
              xml:lang="la">flamen</foreign>, who has entered a prosecution for <foreign
              xml:lang="fr">lèse majesté</foreign>; <note n="3" anchored="true">
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Majestas</foreign>. He would be liable to this charge, under a
              law of Sulla's, for having left his province to interfere in Egypt. </note> secondly,
            Tib. Nero, with good names at the back of his indictment; thirdly, C. Memmius the
            tribune in conjunction with L. Capito. He came to the walls of the city on the 19th of
            September, undignified and neglected to the last degree. But in the present state of the
            law courts I do not venture to be confident of anything. As Cato is unwell, he has not
            yet been formally indicted for extortion. Pompey <pb n="297"/> is trying hard to
            persuade me to be reconciled to him, but as yet he has not succeeded at all, nor, if I
            retain a shred of liberty, will he succeed. I am very anxious for a letter from you. You
            say that you have been told that I was a party to the Coalition of the consular
            candidates—it is a lie. The compacts made in that coalition, afterwards made public by
            Memmius, were of such a nature that no loyal man ought to have been a party to them ;
              <note n="1" anchored="true">See p.300. </note> nor at the same time was it possible
            for me to be a party to a coalition from which Messalla was excluded, who is thoroughly
            satisfied with my conduct in every particular, as also, I think, is Memmius. To Domitius
            himself I have rendered many services, which he desired and asked of me. I have put
            Scaurus under a heavy obligation by my defence of him. It is as yet very uncertain both
            when the elections will be and who will be consuls. <milestone unit="para"/>Just as I
            was folding up this epistle letter-carriers arrived from you and Caesar (20th September)
            after a journey of twenty days. How anxious I was! How painfully I was affected by
            Caesar's most kind letter! <note n="2" anchored="true">Apparently referring to the death
              of his daughter Iulia. </note> But the kinder it was, the more sorrow did his loss
            occasion me. But to turn to your letter. To begin with, I reiterate my approval of your
            staying on, especially as, according to your account, you have consulted Caesar on the
            subject. I wonder that Oppius has anything to do with Publius, for I advised against it.
            Farther on in your letter you say that I am going to be made <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >legatus</foreign> to Pompey on the 13th of September: I have heard nothing about it,
            and I wrote to Caesar to tell him that neither Vibullius nor Oppius had delivered his
            message to Pompey about my remaining at home. Why, I know not. However, it was I who
            restrained Oppius from doing so, because it was Vibullius who should take the leading
            part in that matter: for with him Caesar had communicated personally, with Oppius only
            by letter. I indeed can have no "second thoughts " <note n="3" anchored="true">
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">deute/ras fronti/das</foreign> from <bibl n="Eur. Hipp. 436"

                sofw/terai</foreign>. </note> in matters connected with Caesar. He comes next after
            you and our children in my regard, and not much after. I think I act in this with
            deliberate <pb n="298"/> judgment, for I have by this time good cause for it, yet warm
            personal feeling no doubt does influence me also. <milestone unit="para"/>Just as I had
            written these last words—which are by my own hand—your boy came in to dine with me, as
            Pomponia was dining out. He gave me your letter to read, which he had received shortly
            before—a truly Aristophanic mixture of jest and earnest, with which I was greatly
            charmed. <note n="1" anchored="true">Or, "as kindly and critical at once as <foreign
                xml:lang="la">Aristophanes</foreign> (of Byzantium), "as though Quintus had written
              a Caxtonian criticism of his son's style. </note> He gave me also your second letter,
            in which you bid him cling to my side as a mentor. How delighted he was with those
            letters! And so was I. Nothing could be more attractive than that boy, nothing more
            affectionate to me !—This, to explain its being in another handwriting, I dictated to
            Tiro while at dinner. <milestone unit="para"/>Your letter gratified Annalis very much,
            as shewing that you took an active interest in his concerns, and yet assisted him with
            exceedingly candid advice. Publius Servilius the elder, from a letter which he said he
            had received from Caesar, declares himself highly obliged to you for having spoken with
            the greatest kindness and earnestness of his devotion to Caesar. After my return to Rome
            from Arpinum I was told that Hippodamus had started to join you. I cannot say that I was
            surprised at his having acted so discourteously as to start to join you without a letter
            from me: I only say this, that I was annoyed. For I had long resolved, from an
            expression in your letter, that if I had anything I wished conveyed to you with more
            than usual care, I should give it to him : for, in truth, into a letter like this, which
            I send you in an ordinary way, I usually put nothing that, if it fell into certain
            hands, might be a source of annoyance. I reserve myself for Minucius and Salvius and
            Labeo. Labeo will either be starting late or will stay here altogether. Hippodamus did
            not even ask me whether he could do anything for me. T. Penarius sends me a kind letter
            about you: says that he is exceedingly charmed with your literary pursuits,
            conversation, and above all by your dinners. He was always a favourite of mine, and I
            see a good deal of his brother. Wherefore continue, as you have begun, to admit the
            young man to your intimacy. <pb n="299"/> From the fact of this letter having been in
            hand during many days, owing to the delay of the letter-carriers, I have jotted down in
            it many various things at odd times, as, for instance, the following. Titus Anicius has
            mentioned to me more than once that he would not hesitate to buy a suburban property for
            you, if he found one. In these remarks of his I find two things surprising: first, that
            when you write to him about buying a suburban property, you not only don't write to me
            to that effect, but write even in a contrary sense; and, secondly, that in writing to
            him you totally forget his letters which you shewed me at Tusculum, and as totally the
            rule of Epicharmus, "Notice how he has treated another": <note n="1" anchored="true">
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">gnw=qi pw=s a)/llw| ke/xrhtai</foreign>. </note> in fact, that
            you have quite forgotten, as I think, the lesson conveyed by the expression of his face,
            his conversation, and his spirit. But this is your concern. As to a suburban property,
            be sure to let me know your wishes, and at the same time take care that that fellow
            doesn't get you into trouble. What else have I to say? Anything? Yes, there is this:
            Gabinius entered the city by night on the 27th of September, and today, at two o'clock,
            when he ought to have appeared on his trial for <foreign xml:lang="fr">lèse
              majesté</foreign>, in accordance with the edict of C. Alfius, he was all but crushed
            to the earth by a great and unanimous demonstration of the popular hatred. Nothing could
            exceed his humiliating position. However, Piso comes next to him. So I think of
            introducing a marvellous episode into my second book <note n="2" anchored="true">Of his
              poem "On his own Times." <foreign xml:lang="la">Piso</foreign> in Macedonia, where he
              had been unsuccessful with border tribes: Gabinius in going to Egypt to support
              Ptolemy. He left many of his soldiers there. </note> —Apollo declaring in the council
            of the gods what sort of return that of the two commanders was to be, one of whom had
            lost, and the other sold his army. From Britain I have a letter of Caesar's dated the
            1st of September, which reached me on the 27th, satisfactory enough as far as the
            British expedition is concerned, in which, to prevent my wondering at not getting one
            from you, he tells me that you were not with him when he reached the coast. To that
            letter I made no reply, not even a formal congratulation, on account of his mourning.
            Many, many wishes, dear brother, for your health. <pb n="300"/>

          <p> In the evening of the 10th of October Salvius started on board ship for Ostia with the
            things you wished sent to you from home. On that same day Memmius <note n="4"
              anchored="true">C. Memmius, a tribune of this year, not the same as the C. Memmius
              Gemellus of the last letter. </note> gave Gabinius such a splendid warming in public
            meeting that Calidius couldn't say a word for him. Tomorrow (which is strictly the day
            after tomorrow, for I am writing before daybreak) there is a trial before Cato for the
            selection of his prosecutor between Memmius, Tiberius Nero, and Gaius and Lucius, sons
            of M. Antonius. I think the result will be in favour of Memmius, though a strong case is
            being made out for Nero. In short, he is in a fairly tight fix, unless our friend
            Pompey, to the disgust of gods and men, upsets the whole concern. Let me give you a
            specimen of the fellow's impudence, and extract something amusing from the public
            disasters. Gabinius having given out wherever he came that he was demanding a triumph,
            and having suddenly, the <pb n="304"/> excellent general! invaded the city of his
            enemies by night, <note n="1" anchored="true">Referring to the fact that Gabinius, on
              his arrival outside Rome, without the usual procession of friends which met a
              returning proconsul, skulked about till nightfall, not venturing to enter Rome (the
              city of his enemies!) in daylight. By entering Rome he gave up his <foreign
                xml:lang="la">imperium</foreign> and could no longer ask a triumph. </note> did not
            venture to enter the senate. Meanwhile, exactly on the tenth day, on which he was bound
            to report the number of the enemy and of his own soldiers who had been killed, he slunk
            into the house, which was very thinly attended. When he made as if to go out, he was
            stopped by the consuls. The <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign> were introduced.
            The fellow was assailed on every side, and my words stinging him more than all, he lost
            patience, and in a voice quivering with anger called me "Exile." Thereupon—Heavens I
            never had such a compliment paid me in all my life —the senate rose up to a man with a
            loud shout and made a menacing movement in his direction : the <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >publicani</foreign> made an equal noise and a similar movement. In fine, they all
            behaved exactly as you would have done. It is the leading topic of conversation out of
            the house. However, I refrain from prosecuting, with difficulty, by Hercules ! yet
            refrain I do : either because I don't want to quarrel with Pompey—the impending question
            of Milo is enough in that direction—or because we have no jurors worthy of the name. I
            fear a fiasco: besides, there is the ill-will of certain persons to me, and I am afraid
            my conducting the prosecution might give him some advantage: besides, I do not despair
            of the thing being done both without me and yet partly through my assistance. All the
            candidates for the consulships have had prosecutions for bribery lodged against them:
            Domitius Calvinus by Memmius (the tribune), Memmius (the candidate) by Q. Acutius, an
            excellent young man and a good lawyer, Messalla by Q. Pompeius, Scaurus by Triarius. The
            affair causes great commotion, because it is a plain alternative between shipwreck for
            the men concerned or for the laws. Pressure is being applied to prevent the trials
            taking place. It looks like an <foreign xml:lang="la">interregnum</foreign> again. The
            consuls desire to hold the <foreign xml:lang="la">comitia</foreign>: the accused don't
            wish it, and especially Memmius, because he hopes that Caesar's approach <note n="2"
              anchored="true">Caesar was accustomed to come to North Italy (<foreign xml:lang="la"
                >Gallia Cisalpina</foreign>) for the winter to <foreign xml:lang="la"
                >Ravenna</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="la">Luca</foreign>, and there he could be
              communicated with and exercise great influence. </note>
            <pb n="305"/> may secure him the consulship. But he is at a very low ebb. Domitius, with
            Messalla as his colleague, I think is a certainty. Scaurus has lost his chance. Appius
            declares that he will relieve Lentulus even without a curiate law, <note n="1"
              anchored="true">That is, he would go to his province of <foreign xml:lang="la"
                >Cilicia</foreign> on the strength of his nomination or allotment by the senate.
              There was some doubt as to the question whether such allotment did not give <foreign
                xml:lang="la">imperium</foreign> even without a <foreign xml:lang="la">lex
                curiata</foreign>. Besides, the <foreign xml:lang="la">consul</foreign> had already
                <foreign xml:lang="la">imperium</foreign>, and he might consider it to be
              uninterrupted if he left Rome immediately. However, as there was always an interval
              between the end of the consulship and the quitting Rome <foreign xml:lang="la"
                >paludatus</foreign>, the <foreign xml:lang="la">lex</foreign>
              <foreign xml:lang="la">curiata</foreign> had generally been considered necessary
                (<bibl n="Caes. Civ. 1.6">Caes. B.C. 1.6</bibl>). After <date when="-0052">B.C.
                52</date> the <foreign xml:lang="la">lex Pompeia</foreign> enacted a five years'
              interval, when, of course, a law would be necessary. </note> and, indeed, he
            distinguished himself amazingly that day (I almost forgot to mention it) in an attack
            upon Gabinius. He accused him of <foreign xml:lang="fr">lèse majesté</foreign>, and gave
            the names of his witnesses without Gabinius answering a word. That is all the public
            news. At home all is well : your house itself is being proceeded with by the contractors
            with fair expedition. </p>

          <p> The writing of an amanuensis must shew you the amount of my engagements. I assure you
            that no day passes without my appearing for the defence of some one. Accordingly, all
            composition or reflexion I reserve for the hour of my walk. So stands my business:
            matters at home, however, are everything I could wish. Our boys are well, diligent in
            their studies, and affectionate to me and each other. The decoration of both of our
            houses is still in hand: but your rural works at Arcanum and Laterium are now completed.
            For the rest, as to the water and the road, I went into the case thoroughly, in a
            certain letter of mine, without Omitting anything. <pb n="306"/> But, in truth, the
            anxiety which is now giving me great uneasiness and pain is that for a period of fifty
            days I have heard nothing from you or from Caesar—nothing has found its way from those
            parts, either in the shape of a letter, or even of a rumour. Moreover, both the sea and
            land out there make me uneasy, and I never cease imagining, as one does when one's
            affections are deeply involved, all that I least desire. Wherefore I do not, indeed, for
            the present ask you to write me an account of yourself and your doings, for that you
            never omit doing when possible, but I wish you to know this—that I have scarcely ever
            been so anxious for anything as at the moment of writing I am for a letter from you. Now
            for what is going on in politics. One day after another for the <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >comitia</foreign> is struck out by notices of bad omens, to the great satisfaction of
            all the loyalists: so great is the scandal in which the consuls are involved, owing to
            the suspicion of their having bargained for a bribe from the candidates. The four
            candidates for the consulship are all arraigned : their cases are difficult of defence,
            but I shall do my best to secure the safety of our friend Messalla—and that is
            inseparable from the acquittal of the others. Publius Sulla has accused Gabinius of
            bribery—his stepson Memmius his cousin Caecilius, and his son Sulla backing the
            indictment. L. Torquatus put in his claim to the conduct of the prosecution, and, to
            everybody's satisfaction, failed to establish it. You ask, "What will become of
            Gabinius?" We shall know in three days' time about the charge of <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >lèse majesté</foreign>. In that case he is at a disadvantage from the hatred
            entertained by all classes for him; witnesses against him as damaging as can be:
            accusers in the highest degree inefficient: the panel of jurors of varied character: the
            president a man of weight and decision—Alfius: Pompey active in soliciting the jurors on
            his behalf. What the result will be I don't know; I don't see, however, how he can
            maintain a position in the state. I shew no rancour in promoting his destruction, and
            await the result with the utmost good temper. That is nearly all the news. I will add
            this one item: your boy (who is mine also) is exceedingly devoted to his rhetoric master
            Paeonius, a man, I think, of great experience in his profession, and of very good
            character. But you are aware that my method of instruction aims at a somewhat more <pb
              n="307"/> scholarly and philosophical style. <note n="1" anchored="true">
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">qetikw/teron</foreign>. From <foreign xml:lang="grc"

                <foreign xml:lang="grc">qetika/</foreign> of subjects suited to such theses. </note>
            Accordingly I, for my part, am unwilling that his course of training should be
            interrupted, and the boy himself seems to be more drawn to that declamatory style, and
            to like it better; and as that was the style in which I was myself initiated, let us
            allow him to follow in my path, for I feel sure it will eventually bring him to the same
            point; nevertheless, if I take him with me somewhere in the country, I shall guide him
            to the adoption of my system and practice. For you have held out before me a great
            reward, which it certainly shall not be my fault if I fail to fully obtain. I hope you
            will write and tell me most carefully in what district you are going to pass the winter,
            and what your prospects are. </p>

          <p> Gabinius has been acquitted. Nothing could be more absolutely futile than his accuser,
            Lentulus, and the backers of the indictment, or more corrupt than the jury. Yet, after
            all, had it not been for incredible exertions and entreaties on Pompey's part, and even
            an alarming rumour of a dictatorship, he would not have been able to answer even
            Lentulus; for even as it was, with such an accuser and such a jury, he had thirty-two
            votes out of seventy recorded against him. This trial is altogether so scandalous, that
            he seems certain to be convicted in the other suits, especially in that for extortion.
            But you must see that the Republic, the senate, the law courts are mere ciphers, and
            that not one of us has any constitutional position at all. What else should I tell you
            about the jurors? Two men of praetorian rank were on the panel—Domitius Calvinus, who
            voted for acquittal so openly that everybody could see; and Cato, who, as soon as the
            voting tablets had <pb n="308"/> been counted, withdrew from the ring of people, and was
            the first to tell Pompey the news. Some people—for instance, Sallust—say that I ought to
            have been the prosecuting counsel. Was I to have exposed myself to such a jury as this?
            What would have been my position, if he had escaped when I conducted the case? But there
            were other considerations which influenced me. Pompey would have looked upon it as a
            contest with me, not for that man's safety, but for his own position: he would have
            entered the city; <note n="1" anchored="true">Pompey was outside the <foreign
                xml:lang="la">pomerium</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="la">ad Romam</foreign>) as
              having <foreign xml:lang="la">imperium</foreign>. </note> it would have become a
            downright quarrel; I should have seemed like a Pacideianus matched with the Samnite
            Aeserninus <note n="2" anchored="true">Two gladiators, one incomparably superior to the
              other. </note> —he would, perhaps, have bitten off my ear, <note n="3" anchored="true"
              >A proverbial expression, cp. "snapped my nose off." </note> and at least he would
            have become reconciled to Clodius. For my part, especially if you do not disapprove of
            it, I strongly approve my own policy. That great man, though his advancement had been
            promoted by unparalleled exertions on my part, and though I owed him nothing, while he
            owed me all, yet could not endure that I should differ from him in politics—to put it
            mildly—and, when in a less powerful position, shewed me what he could do against me when
            in my zenith. At this time of day, when I don't even care to be influential, and the
            Republic certainly has no power to do anything, while he is supreme in everything, was I
            to enter upon a contest with him? For that is what I should have had to have done. I do
            not think that you hold me bound to have undertaken it. "Then, as an alternative," says
            the grave Sallust, "you should have defended him, and have made that concession to
            Pompey's earnest wish, for he begged you very hard to do so." An ingenious friend is
            Sallust, to give me the alternative of a dangerous quarrel or undying infamy! I,
            however, am quite pleased with the middle course which I have steered; and another
            gratifying circumstance is that, when I had given my evidence with the utmost solemnity,
            in accordance with my honour and oath, the defendant said that, if he retained his right
            to remain in the city, he would repay me, and did not attempt to cross-question me.
              <milestone unit="para"/>As to the verses which you wish me to compose, it is true <pb
              n="309"/> that I am deficient in industry in regard to them, which requires not only
            time, but also a mind free from all anxiety, but I am also wanting in inspiration. For I
            am not altogether without anxiety as to the coming year, though without fear. At the
            same time, and, upon my word, I speak without irony, I consider you a greater master of
            that style of writing than myself. As to filling up your Greek library, effecting
            interchanges of books, and purchasing Latin books, I should be very glad that your
            wishes should be carried out, especially as they would be very useful to me. But I have
            no one to employ for myself in such a business: for such books as are really worth
            getting are not for sale, and purchases cannot be effected except by an agent who is
            both well-informed and active. However, I will give orders to Chrysippus and speak to
            Tyrannio. I will inquire what Scipio has done about the treasury. I will see that what
            seems to be the right thing is done. As to Ascanio, do what you like: I shall not
            interfere. As to a suburban property, I commend your not being in a hurry, but I advise
            your having one. I write this on the 24th of October, the day of the opening of the
            games, on the point of starting for my Tusculan villa, and taking my dear young Cicero
            with me as though to school (a school not for sport, but for learning), since I did not
            wish to be at any greater distance from town, because I purposed supporting Pomptinus's

          <p> You ask me what I have done about the books which I begun to write when in my Cuman
            villa: I have not been idle and am not being idle now; but I have frequently changed the
            whole plan and arrangement of the work. I had already completed two books, in which I
            represented a conversation taking place on the Novendialia held in the consulship of
            Tuditanus and Aquilius, <note n="1" anchored="true">
              <date when="-00129">B.C. 129</date>. The <foreign xml:lang="la">Novendialia</foreign>
              was a nine days' festival on the occasion of some special evil omens or prodigies; for
              an instance (in <date when="-00202">B.C. 202</date>), see Livy, 30, 38. The book
              referred to is that "On the Republic." </note> between Africanus, shortly before his
            death, and Laelius, Philus, Manilius, P. Rutilius, Q. Tubero, and Laelius's sons-in-law,
            Fannius and Scaevola; a conversation which was extended to nine days and the same number
            of books "On the best Constitution of the State" and "On the best Citizen." The work was
            excellently composed, and the rank of the speakers added considerable weight to the
            style. But when these books were read to me in the presence of Sallustius at Tusculum,
            it was suggested to me by him that a discourse on such subjects would come with much
            greater force if I were myself the speaker on the Republic, especially as I was a no
            mere Heraclides Ponticus, <note n="2" anchored="true">I.e., a mere theorist like
                <foreign xml:lang="la">Heraclides</foreign> Ponticus, a pupil of Plato's, whose work
              "On Constitutions" still exists. </note> but an ex-consul, and one who had been
            engaged in the most important affairs in the state: that when I put them in the mouth of
            men of such ancient date they would have an air of unreality: that I had shewn good
            taste in my books about the science of rhetoric in keeping the dialogue of the orators
            apart from myself, and yet had attributed it to men whom I had personally seen: and,
            finally, that Aristotle delivers in the first person his essays "On the Republic "and
            "On the Eminent Man." I was influenced the more by this from the fact that I was unable
            to touch on <pb n="329"/> the most important commotions in our state, because they were
            subsequent to the age of the speakers. Moreover, my express object then was not to
            offend anyone by launching into the events of my own time: as it is, I shall avoid that
            and at the same time be the speaker with you. Nevertheless, when I come to Rome I will
            send you the dialogues as they originally stood. For I fancy that those books will
            convince you that they have not been abandoned by me without some chagrin. <milestone
              unit="para"/>I am extremely gratified by Caesar's affection of which you write to me.
            The offers which he holds out I do not much reckon on, nor have I any thirst for honours
            or longing for glory; and I look forward more to the continuation of his kindness than
            to the fulfillment of his promises. Still, I live a life so prominent and laborious that
            I might seem to be expecting the very thing that I deprecate. As to your request that I
            should compose some verses, you could hardly believe, my dear brother, how short of time
            I am: nor do I feel much moved in spirit to write poetry on the subject you mention. Do
            you really come to me for disquisitions on things that I can scarcely conceive even in
            imagination—you who have distanced everybody in that style of vivid and descriptive
            writing? Yet I would have done it if I could, but, as you will assuredly not fail to
            notice, for writing poetry there is need of a certain freshness of mind of which my
            occupations entirely deprive me. I withdraw myself, it is true, from all political
            anxiety and devote myself to literature; still, I will hint to you what, by heaven, I
            specially wished to have concealed from you. It cuts me to the heart, my dearest
            brother, to the heart, to think that there is no Republic, no law courts, and that my
            present time of life, which ought to have been in the full bloom of senatorial dignity,
            is distracted with the labours of the forum or eked out by private studies, and that the
            object on which from boyhood I had set my heart, <quote>
              <l>Far to excel, and tower above the crowd,</l>
            </quote>
            <note n="1" anchored="true">Hom. 51.6.208. </note> is entirely gone: that my opponents
            have in some cases been left unattacked by me, in others even defended: that <pb n="330"
            /> not only my sympathies, but my very dislikes, are not free: and that Caesar is the
            one man in the world who has been found to love me to my heart's Content, or even, as
            others think, the only one who was inclined to do so. However, there is none of all
            these vexations of such a kind as to be beyond the reach of many daily consolations; but
            the greatest of consolations will be our being together. As it is, to those other
            sources of vexation there is added my very deep regret for your absence. If I had
            defended Gabinius, which Pansa thought I ought to have done, I should have been quite
            ruined: those who hate him—and that is entire orders—would have begun to hate me for the
            sake of their hatred for him. I confined myself, as I think with great dignity, to doing
            only that which all the world saw me do. And to sum up the whole case, I am, as you
            advise, devoting all my efforts to tranquillity and peace. As to the books: Tyrannio is
            a slow-coach : I will speak to Chrysippus, but it is a laborious business and requires a
            man of the utmost industry. I find it in my own case, for, though I am as diligent as
            possible, I get nothing done. As to the Latin books, I don't know which way to turn—they
            are copied and exposed for sale with such a quantity of errors! However, whatever can
            possibly be done I will not neglect to do. Gaius Rebilus, as I wrote to you before, is
            at Rome. He solemnly affirms his great obligations to you, and reports well of your
            health. <note n="1" anchored="true">Reading <foreign xml:lang="la">qui omnia adiurat

            I think the question of the treasury was settled in my absence. When you speak of having
            finished four tragedies in sixteen days, I presume you are borrowing from some one else?
            And do <emph>you</emph> deign to be indebted to others after writing the

            discourage vanity: it means also that we should be aware of our own qualities. But pray

          <p> At Rome, and especially on the Appian road as far as the temple of Mars, there is a
            remarkable flood. The promenade of Crassipes has been washed away, pleasure grounds, a
            great number of shops. There is a great sheet of water right up to the public fish-pond.

          <p> The earlier of your two letters is full of irritability and complainings, and you say
            you gave another of the same sort the day before to Labienus, who has not yet
            arrived—but I have nothing to say in answer to it, for your more recent letter has
            obliterated all trace of vexation from my mind. I will only give you this hint and make
            this request, that in the midst of your vexations and labours you should recall what our
            notion was as to your going to Caesar. For our object was not the acquisition of certain
            small and unimportant gains. For what was there of that kind which we should have
            thought worth the price of our separation? What we sought was the strongest possible
            security for the maintenance of our entire political position by the countenance of a
            man of the highest character and most commanding influence. Our interest is not so much
            in the acquisition of sums of money, as in the realization of this hope: all else that
            you get is to be regarded only as a security against actual loss. <note n="1"
              anchored="true">Cicero means, "the substantial gain to be got from your serving under
              Caesar in Gaul is the securing of his protection in the future : all other gains, such
              as money etc., are merely to be regarded as securing you from immediate loss in thus
              going to Gaul: they don't add anything fresh to our position and prospects." </note>
            Wherefore, if you will frequently turn your thoughts back upon what we originally
            proposed to ourselves and hoped to do, you will bear with less impatience the labours of
            military service of which you speak and the <pb n="335"/> other things which annoy you,
            and, nevertheless, will resign them whenever you choose. But the right moment for that
            step is not yet come, though it is now not far off. Furthermore, I give you this
            hint—don't commit anything at all to writing, the publication of which would be annoying
            to us. There are many things that I would rather not know than learn at some risk. I
            shall write at greater length to you with a mind less preoccupied, when my boy Cicero
            is, as I hope he will be, in a good state of health. Pray be careful to let me know to
            whom I should give the letter which I shall then send you—to Caesar's letter-carriers,
            for him to forward them direct to you, or to those of Labienus? For where your Nervii
            dwell, and how far off, I have no idea. <note n="1" anchored="true">Quintus had his
              winter quarters among the <foreign xml:lang="la">Nervii</foreign>, in a town near the
              modern Charleroi. In this winter he was in great danger from a sudden rising of the
                <foreign xml:lang="la">Nervii</foreign> and other tribes (<bibl n="Caes. Gal. 5.24"
                >Caes. B. G. 5.24</bibl>-49). </note> I derived great pleasure from your letter
            describing the courage and dignity displayed (as you say) by Caesar in his extreme
            sorrow. You bid me finish the poem in his honour which I had begun; and although I have
            been diverted from it by business, and still more by my feelings, yet, since Caesar
            knows that I did begin something, I will return to my design, and will complete in these
            leisure days of the "supplications," <note n="2" anchored="true">Twenty days of <foreign
                xml:lang="la">supplicatio</foreign> had been decreed in honour of Caesar's campaigns

              4.38</bibl>). </note> during which I greatly rejoice that our friend Messalla and the
            rest are at last relieved from worry. In reckoning on him as certain to be consul with
            Domitius, you are quite in agreement with my own opinion. I will guarantee Messalla to
            Caesar: but Memmius Cherishes a hope, founded on Caesar's return to Italy, in which I
            think he is under a mistake. He is, indeed, quite out of it here. Scaurus, again, has
            been long ago thrown over by Pompey. The business has been put off: the <foreign
              xml:lang="la">comitia</foreign> postponed and postponed, till we may expect an
              <foreign xml:lang="la">interregnum</foreign>. The rumour of a dictator is not pleasing
            to the aristocrats; for myself, I like still less what they say. But the proposal, as a
            whole, is looked upon with alarm, and grows unpopular. Pompey says outright that he
            doesn't wish it: to me previously he used not personally to deny the wish. Hirrus seems
            likely to be the proposer. Ye gods ! what folly! <pb n="336"/> How in love with himself
            and without—a rival! He has Commissioned me to choke off Caelius Vinicianus, a man much
            attached to me. Whether Pompey wishes it or not, it is difficult to be sure. However, if
            it is Hirrus who makes the proposal, he will not convince people that he does not wish
            it. There is nothing else being talked about in politics just now; at any rate, nothing
            else is being done. The funeral of the son of Serranus Domesticus took place in very
            melancholy circumstances on the 23rd of November. His father delivered the funeral
            Oration which I composed for him. Now about Milo. Pompey gives him no support, and is
            all for Gutta, saying also that he will secure Caesar on his side. Milo is alarmed at
            this, and no wonder, and almost gives up hope if Pompey is created dictator. If he
            assists anyone who vetoes the dictatorship by his troop and bodyguard, <note n="1"
              anchored="true">His gladiators, which he kept in training for the games he was going
              to give in honour of a deceased friend. </note> he fears he may excite Pompey's
            enmity: if he doesn't do so, he fears the proposal may be carried by force. He is
            preparing games on a most magnificent scale, at a cost, I assure you, that no one has
            ever exceeded. It is foolish, on two or even three accounts, to give games that were not
            demanded—he has already given a magnificent show of gladiators : he cannot afford it: he
            is only an executor, and might have reflected that he is now an executor, not an aedile.
            That is about all I had to write. Take care of yourself, dearest brother. </p>

          <p> In regard to Gabinius, I had not to carry out any of the measures which you suggested
            with such affectionate solicitude. "May the earth swallow me rather, etc.! <note n="2"

            and also with the greatest consideration. <pb n="337"/> I neither bore hardly on him nor
            helped him. I gave strong evidence, in other respects I did not stir. The disgraceful
            and mischievous result of the trial I bore with the utmost serenity. And this is the
            advantage which, after all that has happened, has accrued to me—that I am not even
            affected in the least by those evils in the state and the licentious conduct of the
            shameless, which used formerly to make me burst with indignation : for anything more
            abandoned than the men and the times in which we are living there cannot be.
            Accordingly, as no pleasure can possibly be got from politics, I don't know why I should
            lose my temper. Literature and my favourite studies, along with the retirement of my
            country houses, and above all our two boys, furnish my enjoyments. The one man who vexes
            me is Milo. But I hope an end will be put to my anxieties by his getting the consulship:
            and to obtain this for him I shall struggle as hard as I did for my own, and you, I am
            sure, will continue to give assistance from over there. In his case other things are all
            secure, unless it is snatched from his grasp by downright violence: it is about his
            means that I am frightened: <quote>
              <l>For he is now beyond all bearing mad,</l>
            </quote>

              51.8.355). The numerals seem doubtful. According to some MSS. the amount would be
              10,000,000. </note> to spend 1,000,000 sesterce on his games. His want of prudence in
            this one particular I shall put up with as well as I can, and you should be
            strong-minded enough to do the same. In mentioning the changes to be expected next year,
            I didn't mean you to understand me to refer to domestic alarms : the reference was
            wholly to the state of the Republic, in which, though not charged with any actual duty,
            I can scarcely discharge myself from all anxiety. Yet how cautious I would have you be
            in writing you may guess from the fact that I do not mention in my letters to you even
            open acts of disorder in the state, lest my letter should be intercepted and give
            offence to the feelings of anyone. Wherefore, as far as domestic affairs are concerned,
            I would have you be quite easy: in politics I know how anxious you always are. I can see
            that our friend Messalla will <pb n="338"/> be consul, if by means of an <foreign
              xml:lang="la">interrex</foreign>, without any prosecution, if by that of a dictator,
            without danger of conviction. He is not disliked by anyone. Hortensius's warm support
            will stand him in good stead. Gabinius's acquittal is looked upon as a general act of
            indemnity. <foreign xml:lang="fr">En passant</foreign>: nothing has, after all, been
            done as yet about a dictatorship. Pompey is out of town; Appius is intriguing darkly;
            Hirrus is paving the way: there are many tribunes calculated on to veto it: the people
            are indifferent: the leading men disinclined to it: I don't stir a finger. I am
            exceedingly obliged for your promises as to slaves, and I am indeed, as you say,
            shorthanded both at Rome and on my estates. But pray do nothing for my convenience
            unless it entirely suits your own, and your means. About the letter of Vatinius I
            laughed heartily. But though I know I am being watched by him, I can swallow his hatred
            and digest it too. You urge me to "finish": well, I have finished what, in my own
            opinion at least, is a very pretty "epic " on Caesar, but I am in search of a
            trustworthy letter-carrier, lest it should share the fate of your <title>Erigona</title>
            <note n="1" anchored="true">The tragedy written by Quintus and lost in transit. </note>
            —the only personage who has missed a safe journey from Gaul during Caesar's
            governorship. <milestone unit="para"/>What? because I had no good stone was I to pull
            down the whole building ?—a building which I like better every day of my life: the lower
            court especially and the chambers attached to it are admirable. As to Arcanum, it is a
            building worthy of Caesar, or, by heaven, of some one even more tasteful still. For your
            statues, <foreign xml:lang="la">palaestra</foreign>, fish-pond, and conduit are worthy
            of many Philotimuses, and quite above your Diphiluses. But I will visit them personally,
            as well as sending men to look after them and giving orders about them. As to the will
            of Felix, you will complain more when you know all. For the document which he believed
            himself to have sealed, in which your name was most certainly entered as heir to a
            twelfth, this, by a mistake of his own and of his slave Sicura, he did not seal: while
            the one which he did not intend to seal he did seal. But let it go hang, so long as we
            keep well! I am as devoted to your son Cicero as you can wish, and as he deserves, and
            as I am bound to be. However, I am letting him leave me, both to <pb n="339"/> avoid
            keeping him from his teachers, and because his mother is leaving, without whom I am very
            much alarmed as to the boy's large appetite. Yet, after all, we see a great deal of each
            other. I have now answered all your letters. Dearest and best of brothers, good-bye.
