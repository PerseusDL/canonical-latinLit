              <placeName key="tgn,2068515">Cicero</placeName>, now in his thirty-ninth year, in the
            midst of his official career. He had already been quaestor (<date when="-0075">B.C.
              75</date>) and aedile (<date when="-0069">B.C. 69</date>), and was looking forward to
            his election to the praetorship in the next year (<date when="-0067">B.C. 67</date>). He
            had already risen almost to the highest place in his profession as advocate, and had
            partly delivered, partly published his great indictment of Verres only a year ago. He is
            married to Terentia (<date when="-0080">B.C. 80</date>), and has one daughter, Tullia or
            Tulliola, born on August 5, probably the next year (<date when="-0079">B.C. 79</date>).
            His intimacy with T. Pomponius Atticus (three years his senior), perhaps begun at
            school, had lasted at least eleven years, from the time when he met him at <placeName
              key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName> (<date when="-0079">B.C. 79</date>), and with him
            had been initiated in the Eleusinian mysteries (de Leg. 2.). There too they had both
            seen much of the writer's cousin <persName><surname>Lucius</surname></persName>, whose
            death he deplores in this letter (<bibl n="Cic. Fin. 5.1">de Fin. 5.1</bibl>). Atticus

        <p> We are such intimate friends that more than almost anyone else you can appreciate the
          grief as well as the actual public and private loss that the death of my cousin Lucius is
          to me. There is absolutely no gratification which any human being can receive from the
          kindly character of another that I have not been accustomed to receive from him. I am
          sure, therefore, that you will share my grief. For, in the first place, whatever affects
          me affects you; and in the second place, you have yourself lost in him a friend and
          connexion of the highest character and most obliging <pb n="2"/> disposition, who was
          attached to you from personal inclination, as well as from my conversation. <milestone
            unit="para"/>As to what you say in your letter about your sister, <note n="1"
            anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Pomponia</foreign>, married to Cicero's younger brother Quintus.
            We shall frequently hear of this unfortunate marriage. Quintus was four years younger
            than his brother, who had apparently arranged the match, and felt therefore perhaps
            somewhat responsible for the result (<bibl n="Nep. Att. 5">Nep. Att. 5</bibl>). </note>
          she will herself bear me witness what pains I have taken that my brother Quintus should
          show her proper affection. Thinking him somewhat inclined to be angry with her, I wrote to
          him in such a way as I thought would not hurt his feelings as a brother, while giving him
          some good advice as my junior, and remonstrating with him as being in the wrong. The
          result is that, from frequent letters since received from him, I feel confident that
          everything is as it ought and as we should wish it to be. <milestone unit="para"/>As to
          the frequency of my letters you have no ground for your complaint. The fact is our good
          sister Pomponia never informed me of there being a courier ready to take a letter.
          Farthermore, I never chanced to know of anyone going to <placeName key="tgn,7002705"
            >Epirus</placeName>, <note n="2" anchored="true">

              >Corfu</placeName>. </note> and I was not till recently informed of your being at
            <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. <milestone unit="para"/>Again, as to
          the business of Acutilius which you had left in my hands. I had settled it on my first
          visit to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> after your departure. But it
          turned out that, in the first place, there was no urgency in the matter, and, in the
          second place, as I felt confidence in your judgment, I preferred that Peducaeus <note
            n="3" anchored="true">This is probably Sext. Peducaeus the younger, an intimate friend
            of <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign> (<bibl n="Nep. Att. 21">Nep. Att.
            21</bibl>); his father had been praetor in <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
              >Sicily</placeName> when Cicero was quaestor (<date when="-0076">B.C. 76</date>-<date
              when="-0075">B.C. 75</date>), the son was afterwards a partisan of Caesar in the Civil
            War, governor of <foreign xml:lang="la">Sardinia</foreign>, <date when="-0048">B.C.
              48</date>, and propraetor in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, <date
              when="-0039">B.C. 39</date>. </note> rather than myself should advise you by letter on
          the subject. For having submitted my ears to Acutilius for several days (and I think you
          know his style), I should scarcely have regarded it as a hardship to write you a letter
          describing his grumblings after patiently enduring the bore (and it was rather a bore, I
          can tell you) of hearing them. Moreover, though you find fault with me, allow me to
          observe that I have had only one letter from <pb n="3"/> you, though you had greater
          leisure for writing, and more opportunity of sending letters. <milestone unit="para"/>As
          to what you say in your letter, " Even if anyone is inclined to be offended with you, I
          ought to bring him to a better mind "—I understand to what you allude, and I have not
          neglected the matter. But the truth is that the extent of his displeasure is something
          surprising. However, I have not omitted to say anything there was to say in your behalf:
          but on what points I am to hold out your wishes, I consider, ought to be my guide. If you
          will write me word distinctly what they are, you will find that I have had no desire to be
          more exacting, and in the future shall be no more yielding, than you wish. <note n="1"
            anchored="true">The person alluded to is L. Lucceius, of whom we shall hear again. See
            Letters V, VII, VIII, CVIII. What his quarrel with <foreign xml:lang="la"

          <milestone unit="para"/>As to the business of Tadius. He tells me that you have written
          him word that there was no need of farther trouble, since the property is secured by
          prescription. I am surprised that you do not know that in the case of a statutory wardship
          of an unmarried girl prescription cannot be pleaded. <note n="2" anchored="true"

          <milestone unit="para"/>I am glad you like your purchase in <placeName key="tgn,7002705"

          procure for me, only don't put yourself to any inconvenience. The truth is, there is no
          other place that gives me complete rest after all my worries and hard work. <milestone

        <p> All well at your house. Your mother and sister are regarded with affection by me and my
          brother Quintus. I have spoken to Acutilius. He says that he has not heard from his agent,
          and professes surprise that you should make any difficulty of his having refused to
          guarantee you against farther demands. As to the business of Tadius, the announcement in
          your letter that you have settled the matter Out of court I saw gratified and pleased him
          very much. That friend of mine <note n="2" anchored="true">Lucceius, as in the first
            letter and the next. </note> —a most excellent man, upon my honour, and most warmly
          attached to me—is very angry with you. If I could but know how much you care about it, I
          should be able to decide how much trouble I am to take in the matter. I have paid L.
          Cincius the 20,400 sesterces written <pb n="7"/> for the Megaric statues in accordance
          with your letter to me. As to your Hermae of Pentelic marble with bronze heads, about
          which you wrote to me—I have fallen in love with them on the spot. So pray send both them
          and the statues, and anything else that may appear to you to suit the place you know of,
          my passion, and your taste—as large a supply and as early as possible. Above all, anything
          you think appropriate to a gymnasium and terrace. I have such a passion for things of this
          sort that while I expect assistance from you, I must expect something like rebuke from
          others. If Lentulus has no vessel there, put them on board anyone you please. My pet
          Tulliola claims your present and duns me as your security. I am resolved, however, to
          disown the obligation rather than pay up for you. </p>

        <p> "Being in my Tusculan villa" (that's for your "being in the Ceramicus")—however, I being
          there, a courier sent by your sister arrived from <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
            >Rome</placeName> and delivered me a letter from you, announcing at the same time that
          the courier who was going to you started that very afternoon. The result is that, though I
          do send an answer, I am forced by the shortness of the time to write only these few words.
          First, as to softening my friend's feeling towards you, or even reconciling him outright,
          I pledge you my word to do so. Though I have been attempting it already on my own account,
          I will now urge the point more earnestly and press him closer, as I think I gather from
          your letter that you are so set upon it. This much I should like you to realize, that he
          is very deeply offended; but since I cannot see any serious ground for it, I feel
          confident that he will do as I wish and yield to my influence. As for my statues and
          Hermeracles, pray put them on board, as you say in your letter, at your very <pb n="8"/>
          earliest convenience, and anything else you light upon that may seem to you appropriate to
          the place you know of, especially anything you think suitable to a palaestra and
          gymnasium. I say this because I am sitting there as I write. so that the very place itself
          reminds me. Besides these, I commission you to get me some medallions to let into the
          walls of my little entrance-court, and two engraved stone-curbs. Mind you don't engage
          your library to anyone, however keen a lover you may find; for I am hoarding up my little
          savings expressly to secure that resource for my old age. As to my brother, I trust that
          all is as I have ever wished and tried to make it. There are many signs of that result—not
          least that your sister is <foreign xml:lang="fr">enceinte</foreign>. As for my election, I
          don't forget that I left the question entirely to you, and I have all along been telling
          our common friends that I have not only not asked you to come, but have positively
          forbidden you to do so, because I understood that it was much more important to you to
          carry through the business you have now in hand, than it is to me to have you at my
          election. I wish you therefore to feel as though you had been sent to where you are in my
          interests. Nay, you will find me feeling towards you, and hear of it from others, exactly
          as though my success were obtained not only in your presence, but by your direct agency.

        <p> I was doing so before spontaneously, and have been since greatly stirred by your two
          letters, with their earnest expressions to the same effect. Besides, Sallustius has been
          always at my side to prompt me to spare no pains to induce Lucceius to be reconciled to
          you. But after doing everything <pb n="9"/> that could be done, not only did I fail to
          renew his old feelings towards you, but I could not even succeed in eliciting the reason
          of his alienation. On his part, however, he keeps harping on that arbitration case of his,
          and the other matters which I knew very well before you left <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
            >Rome</placeName> were causing him offence. Still, he has certainly got something else
          fixed deeper in his mind; and this no letters from you, and no commissioning of me will
          obliterate as easily as you will do in a personal interview, I don't mean merely by your
          words, but by the old familiar expression of your face—if only you think it worth while,
          as you will if you will listen to me, and be willing to act with your habitual kindness.
          Finally, you need not wonder why it is that, whereas I intimated in my letters that I felt
          hopeful of his yielding to my influence, I now appear to have no such confidence; for you
          can scarcely believe how much more stubborn his sentiment appears to me than I expected,
          and how much more obstinate he is in this anger. However, all this will either be cured
          when you come, or will only be painful to the party in fault. <milestone unit="para"/>As
          to the sentence in your letter, "you suppose by this time I am praetor-elect," let me tell
          you that there is no class of people at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> so
          harassed by every kind of unreasonable difficulty as candidates for office; and that no
          one knows when the elections will be. <note n="1" anchored="true">The <foreign
              xml:lang="la">comitia</foreign> were twice postponed this year. Apparently the voting

            "thrice returned at the head of the poll by an unanimous vote" (<bibl n="Cic. Man. 2">de
              Imp. Pomp. § 2</bibl>). The postponement of the elections was probably connected with
            the struggles of the senate to hinder the legislation (as to bribery) of the Tribune,
            Gaius <foreign xml:lang="la">Cornelius</foreign> (<bibl n="TLG385.1 36.38">Dio,

          despatch at the earliest opportunity what you have bought for my "Academia." I am
          surprisingly delighted with the mere thought of that place, to say nothing of its actual
          occupation. Mind also not to let anyone else have your books. Reserve them, as you say in
          your letter, for me. I am possessed with the utmost longing for them, as I am with a
          loathing for affairs of every other kind, which you will find in an incredibly worse
          position than when you left them. <note n="2" anchored="true">The first allusion in these
            letters to the disturbed position of public affairs. See the passage of Dio quoted in

        <p> The state of things in regard to my candidature, in which I know that you are supremely
          interested, is this, as far as <pb n="13"/> can be as yet conjectured. The only person
          actually canvassing is P. Sulpicius Galba. <note n="1" anchored="true">One of the <foreign
              xml:lang="la">judices</foreign> rejected by <foreign xml:lang="la">Verres</foreign> on

          without reserve or disguise. In the general opinion this premature canvass of his is not
          unfavourable to my interests; for the voters generally give as a reason for their refusal
          that they are under obligations to me. So I hope my prospects are to a certain degree
          improved by the report getting about that my friends are found to be numerous. My
          intention was to begin my own canvass just at the very time that Cincius <note n="2"
            anchored="true">Agent of <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign>

          and Q. Cornificius. <note n="3" anchored="true">C. Antonius (uncle of M. Antonius) was

          disclaims it and has alleged as an excuse his health and his leading position at the bar.
          Catiline will certainly be a candidate, if you can imagine a jury finding that the sun
          does not shine at noon. As for Aufidius and Palicanus, <note n="5" anchored="true"

          you will expect to hear from me about them. Of the candidates for this year's election
          Caesar is considered certain. Thermus is looked upon as the rival of <placeName

          These latter are so weak both in friends and reputation that it seems <foreign

          else thinks so. What seems most to my interests is that Thermus should get <pb n="14"/> in
          with Caesar. For there is none of those at present canvassing who, if left over to my
          year, seems likely to be a stronger candidate, from the fact that he is Commissioner of
          the <foreign xml:lang="la">via Flaminia</foreign>, and when that has been finished, I

          </note> So much for that business. But there is a matter for which I am very anxious that
          you should forgive me. Your uncle Caecilius having been defrauded of a large sum of money
          by P. Varius, began an action against his cousin A. Caninius Satyrus for the property
          which (as he alleged) the latter had received from Varius by a collusive sale. He was
          joined in this action by the other creditors, among whom were
              <persName><surname>Lucullus</surname></persName> and P. Scipio, and the man whom they
          thought would be official receiver if the property was put up for sale, Lucius Pontius;
          though it is ridiculous to be talking about <pb n="15"/> a receiver at this stage in the
          proceedings. Caecilius asked me to appear for him against satyrus. Now, scarcely a day
          passes that Satyrus does not call at my house. The chief object of his attentions is L
          Domitius, <note n="1" anchored="true">L. Domitius Ahenobarbus, praetor in <date

            righting against Caesar. </note> but I am next in his regard. He has been of great
          service both to myself and to my brother Quintus in our elections. I was very much
          embarrassed by my intimacy with Satyrus as well as that with Domitius, on whom the success
          of my election depends more than on anyone else. I pointed out these facts to Caecilius;
          at the same time I assured him that if the case had been one exclusively between himself
          and Satyrus, I would have done what he wished. As the matter actually stood, all the
          creditors being concerned—and that too men of the highest rank, who without the aid of
          anyone specially retained by Caecilius, would have no difficulty in maintaining their
          common cause—it was only fair that he should have consideration both for my private
          friendship and my present situation. He seemed to take this somewhat less courteously than
          I could have wished or than is usual among gentlemen; and from that time forth 'he has
          entirely withdrawn from the intimacy with me, which was only of a few day's standing.

          that I have sent a freedman to look after our common interests. I felt exceedingly

          sort. Pray look into the whole matter, learn the truth, find out the author, and get the
          empty-headed idiot out of the Country, if you possibly can. Valerius mentions Cn. Plancius
          as the origin of this gossip. I trust you thoroughly to investigate and find out what is

        <p> I have now received three letters from you—one by the hands of M. Cornelius, which you
          gave him, I think, at Three Taverns; a second which your host at <placeName
            key="perseus,Canusium">Canusium</placeName> delivered to me; a third dated, according to

            board, and gave the letter to a carrier to take on shore, </note> They were all three,
          to use a phrase from the schools of rhetoric flavoured with the salt of learning, and
          illumined with the marks of affection. In these letters, indeed, I am urgently pressed by
          you to send answers, but what renders me rather dilatory in this respect is the difficulty
          of finding a trustworthy carrier. How few of these gentry are able to convey a letter
          rather weightier than usual without lightening it by skimming its contents! Besides, I do
          not always care to <pb n="30"/> send <note n="1" anchored="true">A word lost in the text.
          </note> whenever anyone is starting for <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName>:
          for I suppose that, having offered victims before your Amaltheia, <note n="2"

          Accordingly, I don't venture to trust either Achaeans or Epirotes with a letter somewhat
          more outspoken than usual. Now some events have occurred since you left me worth my
          writing to you, but they must not be trusted to the risk of a letter being lost, opened,
          or intercepted. <milestone unit="para"/>Well, then, to begin with: I was not called upon
          to speak first, and the pacifier of the Allobroges <note n="3" anchored="true">C.
            Calpurnius <foreign xml:lang="la">Piso (consul</foreign>
            <date when="-0067">B.C. 67</date>), brother of the <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >consul</foreign> of the year, had been governor of <foreign xml:lang="la">Gallia
              Narbonensis</foreign> (<date when="-0066">B.C. 66</date>-65), and had suppressed a
            rising of the <foreign xml:lang="la">Allobroges</foreign>, the most troublesome tribe in
            the province, who were, in fact, again in rebellion. </note> was preferred to me, and
          though this met with some murmurs of disapprobation from the senate, I was not sorry it
          was done. For I am thereby freed from any obligation to show respect to an ill-conditioned
          man, and am at liberty to support my position in the Republic in spite of him. Besides,
          the second place has a dignity almost equal to that of <foreign xml:lang="la">princeps
            senatus</foreign>, and does not put one under too much of an obligation to the consul.
          The third called on was Catulus; the fourth, if you want to go still farther, Hortensius.
          The consul himself <note n="4" anchored="true">M. Pupius <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Piso</foreign>. </note> is a man of a small and ill-regulated mind, a mere buffoon of
          that splenetic kind which raises a laugh even in the absence of wit: it is his face rather
          than his facetiousness <note n="5" anchored="true">"By the expression of his face rather
            than the force of his expressions " (Tyrrell). </note> that causes merriment : he takes
          practically no part in public business, and is quite alienated from the Optimates. You
          need expect no service to the state from him, for he has not the will to do any, nor <pb
            n="31"/> fear any damage, for he hasn't the courage to inflict it. His colleague,
          however, treats me with great distinction, and is also a zealous supporter of the loyalist
          party. For the present their disagreement has not come to much; but I fear that this taint
          may spread farther. For I suppose you have heard that when the state function was being
          performed in Caesar's house a man in woman's dress got in, <note n="1" anchored="true">See
            p. 27, note 2. </note> and that the Vestals having performed the rite again, mention was
          made of the matter in the senate by Q. Cornificius—he was the first, so don't think that
          it was one of us consulars—and that on the matter being referred by a decree of the senate
          to the [Virgins and] pontifices, they decided that a sacrilege had been committed: that
          then, on a farther decree of the senate, the consuls published a bill: and that Caesar
          divorced his wife. On this question Piso, from friendship for P. Clodius, is doing his
          best to get the bill promulgated by himself (though in accordance with a decree of the
          senate and on a point of religion) rejected. Messalla as yet is strongly for severe
          measures. The loyalists hold aloof owing to the entreaties of Clodius : bands of ruffians
          are being got together: I myself, at first a stern Lycurgus, am becoming daily less and
          less keen about it: Cato is hot and eager. In short, I fear that between the indifference
          of the loyalists and the support of the disloyal it may be the cause of great evils to the
          Republic. However, your great friend <note n="2" anchored="true">Pompey. </note> —do you
          know whom I mean ?—of whom you said in your letter that, "not venturing to blame me, he
          was beginning to be complimentary," is now to all appearance exceedingly fond of me,
          embraces me, loves and praises me in public, while in secret (though unable to disguise
          it) he is jealous of me. No good-breeding, no straightforwardness, no political morality,
          no distinction, no courage, no liberality! But on these points I will write to you more
          minutely at another time; for in the first place I am not yet quite sure about them, and
          in the next place I dare not entrust a letter on such weighty matters to such a casual
          nobody's son as this messenger. <milestone unit="para"/>The praetors have not yet drawn

            apparently some other works of Cicero's in hand, for which he had sent him some
            "queries." </note> I had already noticed the mistake in the date, 3rd of December. The
          points in my speeches which you praise, believe me, I liked very much myself, but did not
          venture to say so before. Now, however, as they have received your approval, I think them
          much more "Attic" than ever. To the speech in answer to Metellus. <note n="2"

          Antonius's house for 3,400 sestertia. What is that to me? you will say. Why, thus much.
          The price has convinced people that I made no bad bargain, and they begin to understand
          that in making a purchase a man may properly use his friends' means to get what suits his
          position. The Teucris affair drags on, yet I have hopes. Pray settle the business you have

        </opener>
        <p> I fear it may seem affectation to tell you how occupied I have been; but I am so
          distracted with business that I have only just found time for this short letter, and that
          has been <pb n="33"/> stolen from the most urgent engagements. I have already described to
          you Pompey's first public speech—it did not please the poor, nor satisfy the disloyal, nor
          find favour with the wealthy, nor appear sound to the loyalists; accordingly, he is down
          in the world. <note n="1" anchored="true">The letter giving this description is lost. I
            think <foreign xml:lang="la">frigebat</foreign> is epistolary imperfect—"he is in the
            cold shade," not, "it fell flat." </note> Presently, on the instigation of the consul
          Piso, that most insignificant of tribunes, Fufius, brought Pompey on to the platform. The
          meeting was in the <foreign xml:lang="la">circus Flaminius</foreign>, and there was in the
          same place that day a crowd of market people—a kind of <foreign xml:lang="fr">tiers
            état</foreign>. <note n="2" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">panh/guris</foreign>. Cicero uses the word (an honourable one in
            Greek) contemptuously of the rabble brought together at a market. </note> He asked him
          to say whether he approved of the jurymen being selected by the praetor, to form a panel
          for the praetor himself to employ. That was the regulation made by the senate in the
          matter of Clodius's sacrilege. Thereupon Pompey made a highly "aristocratic" speech, and
          replied (and at great length) that in all matters the authority of the senate was of the
          greatest weight in his eyes and had always been so. Later on the consul Messalla in the
          senate asked Pompey his opinion as to the sacrilege and the bill that had been published.
          His speech in the senate amounted to a general commendation of all decrees of the house,
          and when he sat down he said to me, "I think my answer covers your case also." <note n="3"
            anchored="true">Pompey's general commendation of the decrees of the senate would include
            those regarding the <foreign xml:lang="la">Catiline</foreign> conspirators, and he
            therefore claimed to have satisfied Cicero. </note> When Crassus observed that Pompey
          had got a cheer from the idea in men's minds that he approved my consulship, he rose also
          to. his feet and delivered a speech in the most complimentary terms on my consulship,
          going so far as to say that he owed it to me that he was still a senator, a citizen, nay,
          a free man; and that he never beheld wife, home, or country without beholding the fruits
          of my conduct. In short: that whole topic, which I am wont to paint in various colours in
          my speeches (of which you are the Aristarchus), the fire, the sword—you know my
          paint-pots—he elaborated to the highest pitch. I was sitting next to Pompey. I noticed
          that he was agitated, either at Crassus earning the gratitude which he had himself
          neglected, or to think that my achievements <pb n="34"/> were, after all, of such
          magnitude that the senate was so glad to hear them praised, especially by a man who was
          the less under an obligation to praise me, because in everything I ever wrote <note n="1"
            anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Meis omnibus litteris</foreign>, the MS. reading. Prof. Tyrrell's
            emendation, <foreign xml:lang="la">orationibus meis, omnibus litteris</foreign>, "in my
            speeches, every letter of them," seems to me even harsher than the MS., a gross
            exaggeration, and doubtful Latin. <foreign xml:lang="la">Meis litteris</foreign> is well
            supported by <foreign xml:lang="la">literae forenses et senatoriae</foreign> of <bibl
              n="Cic. Off. 2.3">de Off. 2.3</bibl>, and though it is an unusual mode of referring to
            speeches, we must remember that they were now published and were "literature." The
            particular reference is to the speech <title>pro Imperio Pompeii</title>, in which,
            among other things, the whole credit of the reduction of Spartacus's gladiators is given
            to Pompey, whereas the brunt of the war had been borne by Crassus. </note> my praise of
          Pompey was practically a reflection on him. This day has brought me very close to Crassus,
          and yet in spite of all I accepted with pleasure any compliment—open or covert—from
          Pompey. But as for my own speech, good heavens! how I did "put it on" for the benefit of
          my new auditor Pompey! If I ever did bring every art into play, I did then—period,
          transition, enthymeme, deduction—everything. In short, I was cheered to the echo. For the
          subject of my speech was the dignity of the senate, its harmony with the equites, the
          unanimity of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, the dying embers of the
          conspiracy, the fall in prices, the establishment of peace. You know my thunder when these
          are my themes. It was so loud, in fact, that I may cut short my description, as I think
          you must have heard it even in <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName>. <milestone
            unit="para"/>The state of things at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> is
          this: the senate is a perfect Areopagus. You cannot conceive anything firmer, more grave,
          or more high-spirited. For when the day came for proposing the bill in accordance with the
          vote of the senate, a crowd of our dandies with their chin-tufts assembled, all the
          Catiline set, with Curio's girlish son at their head, and implored the people to reject
          it. Moreover, Piso the consul, who formally introduced the bill, spoke against it.
          Clodius's hired ruffians had filled up the entrances to the voting boxes. The voting
          tickets were so manipulated that no "ayes" were distributed. Hereupon imagine Cato
          hurrying to the rostra, delivering an admirable invective against the consul, if we can
          call that an ''invective" which was really a speech of the utmost weight and authority,
          and in fact containing the most salutary advice. <pb n="35"/> He is followed to the same
          effect by your friend Hortensius, and many loyalists besides, among whom, however, the
          contribution of Favonius was conspicuous. By this rally of the Optimates the <foreign
            xml:lang="la">comitia</foreign> is dissolved, the senate summoned. On the question being
          put in a full house—in spite of the opposition of Piso, and in spite of Clodius throwing
          himself at the feet of the senators one after the other—that the consuls should exhort the
          people to pass the bill, about fifteen voted with Curio, who was against any decree being
          passed; on the other side there were fully four hundred. So the vote passed. The tribune
          Fufius then gave in. <note n="1" anchored="true">Fufius, though Cicero does not say so,
            must have vetoed the decree, but in the face of such a majority withdrew his veto. The
            practice seems to have been, in case of tribunician veto, to take the vote, which
            remained as an <foreign xml:lang="la">auctoritas senatus</foreign>, but was not a
              <foreign xml:lang="la">senatus consultum</foreign> unless the tribune was induced to
            withdraw. </note> Clodius delivered some wretched speeches to the people, in which he
          bestowed some injurious epithets on Lucullus, Hortensius, C. Piso, and the consul
          Messalla; me he only charged with having "discovered" everything. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Comperisse</foreign>. See Letter XVII, note I, p. 28. </note> In
          regard to the assignation of provinces to the praetors, the hearing legations, and other
          business, the senate voted that nothing should be brought before it till the bill had been
          brought before the people. There is the state of things at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
            >Rome</placeName> for you. Yet pray listen to this one thing more which has surpassed my
          hopes. Messalla is a superlatively good consul, courageous, firm, painstaking; he praises,
          shows attachment to, and imitates me. That other one (Piso) is the less mischievous
          because of one vice—he is lazy, sleepy, unbusinesslike, an utter <foreign xml:lang="fr"
            >fainéant</foreign>, but in intention he is so disaffected that he has begun to loathe
          Pompey since he made the speech in which some praise was bestowed on the senate.
          Accordingly, he has alienated all the loyalists to a remarkable degree. And his action is
          not dictated by love for Clodius more than by a taste for a profligate policy and a
          profligate party. But he has nobody among the magistrates like himself, with the single
          exception of the tribune Fufius. The tribunes are excellent, and in Cornutus we have a
          quasi-Cato. Can I say more? <milestone unit="para"/>Now to return to private matters.

        <p> You ask me what has happened about the trial, the result of which was so contrary to the
          general expectation, and at the same time you want to know how I came to make a worse
          fight of it than usual. I will answer the last first. after the manner of Homer. <note
            n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">u(/steron pro/teron *(omh/rikw=s</foreign>. </note> The fact is
          that, so long as I had to defend the authority of the senate, <note n="2" anchored="true"
            >That is, the resolution of the senate, that the consuls should endeavour to get the
            bill passed. </note> I battled with such gallantry and vigour that there were shouts of
          applause and crowds round me in the house ringing with my praise. Nay, if you ever thought
          that I showed courage in political business, you certainly would have admired my conduct
          in that cause. For when the culprit had betaken himself to public meetings, and had made
          an invidious use of my name, immortal gods! What battles! What havoc! What sallies I made
          upon Piso, Curio, on the whole of that set! How I fell upon the old men for their
          instability, on the young for their profligacy! Again and again, so help me heaven! I
          regretted your absence not only as the supporter of my policy, but as the spectator also
          of my admirable fighting. However, when Hortensius hit on the idea of a law as to the
          sacrilege being proposed by the tribune Fufius, in which there was no difference from the
          bill of the consul except as to the kind of jurymen—on that point, however, the whole
          question turned—and got it carried by sheer fighting, because he had persuaded himself and
          others that he could not get an acquittal no matter who were the jurymen, I drew in my
          sails, seeing the neediness of the jurors, and gave no evidence beyond what was so
          notorious and well attested that I could not omit it. <note n="3" anchored="true">Cicero
            deposed to having seen Clodius in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> three
            hours after he swore that he was at <foreign xml:lang="la">Interamna</foreign> (ninety
            miles off), thus spoiling his alibi. </note> Therefore, if you ask <pb n="38"/> reason
          of the acquittal—to return at length to the former of the two questions —it was entirely
          the poverty and low character of the jury. But that this was possible was entirely the
          result of Hortensius's policy. In his alarm lest Fufius should veto the law which was to
          be proposed in virtue of a senatorial decree, he failed to see that it was better that the
          culprit should be left under a cloud of disgrace and dishonour than that he should be
          trusted to the discretion of a weak jury. But in his passionate resentment he hastened to
          bring the case into court, saying that a leaden sword was good enough to cut his throat.
          But if you want to know the history of the trial, with its incredible verdict, it was such
          that Hortensius's policy is now blamed by other people after the event, though I
          disapproved of it from the first. When the rejection of jurors had taken place, amidst
          loud cheers and counter-cheers—the accuser like a strict censor rejecting the most
          worthless, the defendant like a kind-hearted trainer of gladiators all the best—as soon as
          the jury had taken their seats, the loyalists at once began to feel distrust. There never
          was a seedier lot round a table in a gambling hell. Senators under a cloud, equites out at
          elbows, tribunes who were not so much made of money as "collectors" of it, according to
          their official title. <note n="1" anchored="true">The difficulty of this sentence is well
            known. The juries were now made up of three <foreign xml:lang="la"
            >decuriae</foreign>—senators, <foreign xml:lang="la">equites</foreign>, and <foreign
              xml:lang="la">tribuni aerarii</foreign>. But the exact meaning of <foreign
              xml:lang="la">tribuni aerarii</foreign> is not known, beyond the fact that they formed
            an <foreign xml:lang="la">ordo</foreign>, coming immediately below the <foreign
              xml:lang="la">equites</foreign>. Possibly they were old tribal officers who had the
            duty of distributing pay or collecting taxes (to which the translation supposes a
            punning reference), and as such were required to be of a <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >census</foreign> immediately below that of the <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >equites</foreign>. I do not profess to be satisfied, but I Cannot think that
            Professor Tyrrell's proposal makes matters much easier—<foreign xml:lang="la">tribuni
              non tam aerarii, ut appellantur, quam aerati</foreign>; for his translation of
              <foreign xml:lang="la">aerati</foreign> as "bribed" is not better supported, and is a
            less natural deduction than "moneyed." </note> However, there were a few honest men in
          the panel, whom he had been unable to drive off it by rejection, and they took their seats
          among their uncongenial comrades with gloomy looks and signs of emotion, and were keenly
          disgusted at having to rub elbows with such rascals. Hereupon, as question after question
          was referred to the panel in the preliminary proceedings, the severity of the decisions
          passes belief: there was no disagreement in <pb n="39"/> voting, the defendant carried
          none of his points, while the accuser got even more than he asked. He was triumphant. Need
          I say more? Hortensius would have it that he was the only one of us who had seen the
          truth. There was not a man who did not think it impossible for him to stand his trial
          without being condemned a thousand times over. Further, when I was produced as a witness,
          I suppose you have been told how the shouts of Clodius's supporters were answered by the
          jury rising to their feet to gather round me, and openly to offer their throats to P.
          Clodius in my defence. This seemed to me a greater compliment than the well-known occasion
          when your fellow citizens <note n="1" anchored="true">I.e., the Athenians. <foreign

            (Val. Max. II. x. i). </note> being as usual handed round, a Roman jury refused to look
          at them. The compliment paid me, I repeat, was much greater. Accordingly, as the jurymen
          were protecting me as the mainstay of the country, it was by their voices that the
          defendant was overwhelmed, and with him all his advocates suffered a crushing blow. Next
          day my house was visited by as great a throng as that which escorted me home when I laid
          down the consulship. Our eminent Areopagites then exclaimed that they would not come into
          court unless a guard was assigned them. The question was put to the whole panel: there was
          only one vote against the need of a guard. The question is brought before the senate: the
          decree is passed in the most solemn and laudatory terms : the jurymen are complimented:
          the magistrates are commissioned to carry it out: no one thought that the fellow would
          venture on a defence. "Tell me, ye Muses, now how first the fire befell !" <note n="3"

          whose <pb n="40"/> complimentary oration I have already mentioned to you in a letter. In
          two days' time, by the agency of a single slave, and one, too, from a school of
          gladiators, he settled the whole business—he summoned them to an interview, made a
          promise, offered security, paid money down. Still farther, good heavens, what a scandal!
          even favours from certain ladies, and introductions to young men of rank, were thrown in
          as a kind of <foreign xml:lang="fr">pourboire</foreign> to some of the jurors.
          Accordingly, with the loyalists holding completely aloof, with the forum full of slaves,
          twenty-five jurors were yet found so courageous that, though at the risk of their lives,
          they preferred even death to producing universal ruin. There were thirty-one who were more
          influenced by famine than fame. On seeing one of these latter Catulus said to him, "Why
          did you ask us for a guard? Did you fear being robbed of the money?" There you have, as
          briefly as I could put it, the nature of the trial and the cause of the acquittal.
            <milestone unit="para"/>Next you want to know the present state of public affairs and of
          my own. That settlement of the Republic—firmly established by my wisdom, as you thought,
          as I thought by God's—which seemed fixed on a sure foundation by the unanimity of all
          loyalists and the influence of my consulship—that I assure you, unless some God take
          compassion on us, has by this one verdict escaped from our grasp: if "verdict" it is to be
          called, when thirty of the most worthless and dissolute fellows in <placeName
            key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> for a paltry sum of money obliterate every principle
          of law and justice, and when that which every man—I had almost said every animal—knows to
          have taken place, a Thalna, a Plautus, and a Spongia, and other scum of that sort decide
          not to have taken place. However, to console you as to the state of the Republic,
          rascaldom is not as cheerful and exultant in its victory as the disloyal hoped after the
          infliction of such a wound upon the Republic. For they fully expected that when religion,
          morality, the honour of juries, and the prestige of the senate had sustained such a
          crushing fall, victorious profligacy and lawless lust would openly exact vengeance from
            <pb n="41"/> all the best men for the mortification which the strictness of my
          consulship had branded in upon all the worst. And it is once more I—for I do not feel as
          if I were boasting vaingloriously when speaking of myself to you, especially in a letter
          not intended to be read by others—it was I once more, I say, who revived the fainting
          spirits of the loyalists, cheering and encouraging each personally. Moreover, by my
          denunciations and invectives against those corrupt jurors I left none of the favourers and
          supporters of that victory a word to say for themselves. I gave the consul Piso no rest
          anywhere, I got him deprived of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, which had
          been already plighted to him, I revived the fainting spirit of the senate and recalled it
          to its former severity. I overwhelmed Clodius in the senate to his face, both in a set
          speech, very weighty and serious, and also in an interchange of repartees, of which I
          append a specimen for your delectation. The rest lose all point and grace without the
          excitement of the contest, or, as you Greeks call it, the <foreign xml:lang="grc"
            >a)gw/n</foreign>. Well, at the meeting of the senate on the 15th of May, being called
          on for my opinion, I spoke at considerable length on the high interests of the Republic,
          and brought in the following passage by a happy inspiration: "Do not, Fathers, regard
          yourselves as fallen utterly, do not faint, because you have received one blow. The wound
          is one which I cannot disguise, but which I yet feel sure should not be regarded with
          extreme fear: to fear would show us to be the greatest of cowards, to ignore it the
          greatest of fools. Lentulus was twice acquitted, so was Catiline, a third such criminal
          has now been let loose by jurors upon the Republic. You are mistaken, Clodius: it is not
          for the city but for the prison that the jurors have reserved you, and their intention was
          not to retain you in the state, but to deprive you of the privilege of exile. Wherefore,
          Fathers, rouse up all your courage, hold fast to your high calling. There still remains in
          the Republic the old unanimity of the loyalists: their feelings have been outraged, their
          resolution has not been weakened: no fresh mischief has been done, only what was actually
          existing has been discovered. In the trial of one profligate many like him have been
          detected."—But what am I about? I have copied almost a speech into a letter. I return to
          the duel of words. Up gets our dandified young <pb n="42"/> gentleman, and throws in my
          teeth my having been at <placeName key="perseus,Baiae">Baiae</placeName>. It wasn't true,
          but what did that matter to him? "It is as though you were to say," replied I, "that I had
          been in disguise!" "What business," quoth he, "has an Arpinate with hot baths?" "Say that
          to your patron," said I, "who Coveted the watering-place of an Arpinate." <note n="1"
            anchored="true">C. Curio, the elder, defended Clodius. He had bought the villa of Marius
            (a native of <foreign xml:lang="la">Arpinum</foreign>) at <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Baiae</foreign>. </note> For you know about the marine villa. "How long," said he,
          "are we to put up with this king?" "Do you mention a king," quoth I, "when Rex <note n="2"
            anchored="true">Q Marcius Rex married a sister of Clodius, and dying, left him no
            legacy. </note> made no mention of you?" He, you know, had swallowed the inheritance of
          Rex in anticipation. "You have bought a house," says he. "You would think that he said,"
          quoth I, "you have bought a jury." "They didn't trust you on your oath," said he. "Yes,"
          said I, "twenty-five jurors did trust me, thirty-one didn't trust you, for they took care
          to get their money beforehand." Here he was overpowered by a burst of applause and broke
          down without a word to say. <milestone unit="para"/>My own position is this: with the
          loyalists I hold the same place as when you left town, with the tagrag and bobtail of the
          City I hold a much better one than at your departure. For it does me no harm that my
          evidence appears not to have availed. Envy has been let blood without causing pain, and
          even more so from the fact that all the supporters of that flagitious proceeding confess
          that a perfectly notorious fact has been hushed up by bribing the jury. Besides, the
          wretched starveling mob, the blood-sucker of the treasury, imagines me to be high in the
          favour of Magnus—and indeed we have been mutually united by frequent pleasant intercourse
          to such an extent, that our friends the boon companions of the conspiracy, the young
          chin-tufts, speak of him in ordinary conversation as Gnaeus Cicero. Accordingly, both in
          the circus and at the gladiatorial games, I received a remarkable ovation without a single
          cat-call. There is at present a lively anticipation of the elections, in which, contrary
          to everybody's wishes, our friend Magnus is pushing the claims of Aulus's son; <note n="3"
            anchored="true">L. Afranius. </note> and in that matter his weapons are <pb n="43"/>
          neither his prestige nor his popularity, but those by which Philip said that any fortress
          could be taken—if only an ass laden with gold could make its way up into it. Furthermore,
          that precious consul, playing as it were second fiddle to Pompey, <note n="1"
            anchored="true">Reading <foreign xml:lang="la">deterioris histrionis similis</foreign>,
            "like an inferior actor." </note> is said to have undertaken the business and to have
          bribery agents at his house, which I don't believe. But two decrees have already passed
          the house of an unpopular character, because they are thought to be directed against the
          consul on the demand of Cato and Domitius <note n="2" anchored="true">Lucius Domitius
            Ahenobarbus, married to Cato's sister. Consul <date when="-0054">B.C. 54</date>. A

          allowed in magistrates' houses, and a second, that all who had bribery agents in their
          houses were guilty of treason. The tribune Lurco also, having entered on his office
          irregularly in view of the Aelian law, has been relieved from the provisions both of the
          Aelian and Fufian laws, in order to enable him to propose his law on bribery, which he
          promulgated with correct auspices though a cripple. <note n="3" anchored="true">Aufidius
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Lurco</foreign> had apparently proposed his law on bribery
            between the time of the notice of the elections (<foreign xml:lang="la"
              >indictio</foreign>) and the elections them-selves, which was against a provision of
            the <foreign xml:lang="la">leges Aelia et Fufia</foreign>. What his breach of the law
            was in entering on his office originally we do not know: perhaps some neglect of
            auspices, or his personal deformity. </note> Accordingly, the <foreign xml:lang="la"

          but, if he has paid, he is liable for life to pay 3,000 sesterces to each tribe. I
          remarked that P. Clodius had obeyed this law by anticipation, for he was accustomed to
          promise, and not pay. But observe! Don't you see that the consulship of which we thought
          so much, which Curio used of old to call an apotheosis, if this Afranius is elected, will
          become a mere farce and mockery? Therefore I think one should play the philosopher, as you

        </opener>
        <p> Your letter, in which you inclose copies of his letters, has made me realize that my
          brother Quintus's feelings have undergone many alternations, and that his opinions and
          judgments have varied widely from time to time. <note n="1" anchored="true">Cicero is
            evidently very anxious as to the misunderstanding between Quintus and his brother-in-law
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign>, caused, as he hints, or at any rate not
            allayed, by <foreign xml:lang="la">Pomponia</foreign>. The letter is very carefully
            written, without the familiar tone and mixture of jest and earnest common to most of the
            letters to <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign>. </note> This has not only caused me
          all the pain which my extreme affection for both of you was bound to bring, but it has
          also made me wonder what can have happened to cause my brother Quintus such deep offence,
          or such an extraordinary change of feeling. And yet I was already aware, as I saw that you
          also, when you took leave of me, were beginning to suspect, that there was some lurking
          dissatisfaction, that his feelings were wounded, and that certain unfriendly suspicions
          had sunk deep into his heart. On trying on several previous occasions, but more eagerly
          than ever after the allotment of his province, to assuage these feelings, I failed to
          discover on the one hand that the extent of his offence was so great as your letter
          indicates; but on the other I did not make as much progress in allaying it as I wished.
          However, I consoled myself with thinking that there would be no doubt of his seeing you at
            <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrachium</placeName>, or somewhere in your part of the
          country: and, if that happened, I felt sure and fully persuaded that everything would be
          made smooth between you, not only by conversation and mutual explanation, but by the very
          sight of each other in such an interview. For I need not say in writing to you, who know
          it quite well, how kind and sweet-tempered my brother is, as ready to forgive as he is
          sensitive in taking offence. But it most unfortunately happened that you did not see him
          anywhere. For the impression he had received from the artifices of <pb n="46"/> others had
          more weight with him than duty or relationship, or the old affection so long existing
          between you, which ought to have been the strongest influence of all. And yet, as to where
          the blame for this misunderstanding resides, I can more easily conceive than write: since
          I am afraid that, while defending my own relations, I should not spare yours. For I
          perceive that, though no actual wound was inflicted by members of the family, they yet
          could at least have cured it. But the root of the mischief in this case, which perhaps
          extends farther than appears, I shall more conveniently explain to you when we meet. As to
          the letter he sent to you from <placeName key="tgn,7011182">Thessalonica</placeName>,
            <note n="1" anchored="true">At the end of the <foreign xml:lang="la">via
              Egnatia</foreign>, which started from <foreign xml:lang="la">Dyrrachium</foreign>.
          </note> and about the language which you suppose him to have used both at <placeName
            key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> among your friends and on his journey, I don't know
          how far the matter went, but my whole hope of removing this unpleasantness rests on your
          kindness. For if you will only make up your mind to believe that the best men are often
          those whose feelings are most easily irritated and appeased, and that this quickness, so
          to speak, and sensitiveness of disposition are generally signs of a good heart and
          lastly—and this is the main thing—that we must mutually put up with each other's
          gaucheries (shall I call them?), or faults, or injurious acts, then these
          misunderstandings will, I hope, be easily smoothed away. I beg you to take this view, for
          it is the dearest wish of my heart (which is yours as no one else's can be) that there
          should not be one of my family or friends who does not love you and is not loved by you.
            <milestone unit="para"/>That part of your letter was entirely superfluous, in which you
          mention what opportunities of doing good business in the provinces or the city you let
          pass at other times as well as in the year of my consulship: for I am thoroughly persuaded
          of your unselfishness and magnanimity, nor did I ever think that there was any difference
          between you and me except in our choice of a career. Ambition led me to seek official
          advancement, while another and perfectly laudable resolution led you to seek an honourable
          privacy. In the true glory, which is founded on honesty, industry, and piety, I place
          neither myself nor anyone else above you. In affection towards myself, next to my brother
            <pb n="47"/> and immediate family, I put you first. For indeed, indeed I have seen and
          thoroughly appreciated how your anxiety and joy have corresponded with the variations of
          my fortunes. Often has your congratulation added a charm to praise, and your consolation a
          welcome antidote to alarm. Nay, at this moment of your absence, it is not only your
          advice—in which you excel—but the interchange of speech—in which no one gives me so much
          delight as you do—that I miss most, shall I say in politics, in which circumspection is
          always incumbent on me, or in my forensic labour, which I formerly sustained with a view
          to official promotion, and nowadays to maintain my position by securing popularity, or in
          the mere business of my family? In all these I missed you and our conversations before my
          brother left <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and still more do I miss them
          since. Finally, neither my work nor rest, neither my business nor leisure, neither my
          affairs in the forum or at home, public or private, can any longer do without your most
          consolatory and affectionate counsel and conversation. The modest reserve which
          characterizes both of us has often prevented my mentioning these facts; but on this
          occasion it was rendered necessary by that part of your letter in which you expressed a
          wish to have yourself and your character "put straight" and "cleared" in my eyes. Yet, in
          the midst of all this unfortunate alienation and anger, there is one fortunate
          circumstance—that your determination of not going to a province was known to me and your
          other friends, and had been at various times before distinctly expressed by yourself; so
          that your not being his guest may be attributed to your personal tastes and judgments, not
          to the quarrel and rupture between you. And so those ties which have been broken will be
          restored, and ours which have been so religiously preserved will retain all their old
          inviolability. <milestone unit="para"/>At <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> I
          find politics in a shaky condition; everything is unsatisfactory and foreboding change.
          For I have no doubt you have been told that our friends, the equites, are all but
          alienated from the senate. Their first grievance was the promulgation of a bill on the
          authority of the senate for the trial of such as had taken bribes for giving a verdict. I
          happened not to be in the house when that decree was passed, but when I found that the
          equestrian order was indignant at it, and yet refrained from openly saying so, I <pb
            n="48"/> remonstrated with the senate, as I thought, in very impressive language, and
          was very weighty and eloquent considering the unsatisfactory nature of my cause. But here
          is another piece of almost intolerable coolness on the part of the equites, which I have
          not only submitted to, but have even put in as good a light as possible! The companies
          which had contracted with the censors for <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>
          complained that in the heat of the competition they had taken the contract at an excessive
          price; they demanded that the contract should be annulled. I led in their support, or
          rather, I was second, for it was Crassus who induced them to venture on this demand. The
          case is scandalous, the demand a disgraceful one, and a confession of rash speculation.
          Yet there was a very great risk that, if they got no concession, they would be completely
          alienated from the senate. Here again I came to the rescue more than anyone else, and
          secured them a full and very friendly house, in which I, on the 1st and 2nd of December,
          delivered long speeches on the dignity and harmony of the two orders. The business is not
          yet settled, but the favourable feeling of the senate has been made manifest: for no one
          had spoken against it except the consul-designate, Metellus; while our hero Cato had still
          to speak, the shortness of the day having prevented his turn being reached. Thus I, in the
          maintenance of my steady policy, preserve to the best of my ability that harmony of the
          orders which was originally my joiner's work; but since it all now seems in such a crazy
          condition, I am constructing what I may call a road towards the maintenance of our power,
          a safe one I hope, which I cannot fully describe to you in a letter, but of which I will
          nevertheless give you a hint. I cultivate close intimacy with Pompey. I foresee what you
          will say. I will use all necessary precautions, and I will write another time at greater
          length about my schemes for managing the Republic. You must know that Lucceius has it in
          his mind to stand for the consulship at once; for there are said to be only two candidates
          in prospect. Caesar is thinking of coming to terms with him by the agency of Arrius, and
          Bibulus also thinks he may effect a coalition with him by means of C. Piso. <note n="1"
            anchored="true">The election in question is that to be held in <date when="-0060">B.C.
              60</date> for the consulship of <date when="-0059">B.C. 59</date>. Caesar and Bibulus
            were elected, and apparently were the only two candidates declared as yet. They were, of
            course, extremists, and Lucceius seems to reckon on getting in by forming a coalition
            with either one or the other, and so getting the support of one of the extreme parties,
            with the moderates, for himself. The bargain eventually made was between Lucceius and
            Caesar, the former finding the money. But the <foreign xml:lang="la">Optimates</foreign>
            found more, and carried Bibulus Arrius is Q. Arrius the orator (see Index). C. <foreign

              when="-0067">B.C. 67</date>. </note> You <pb n="49"/> smile? This is no laughing
          matter, believe me. What else shall I write to you? What? I have plenty to say, but must
          put it off to another time. If you mean to wait till you hear, let me know. For the moment
          I am satisfied with a modest request, though it is what I desire above everything—that you
          should come to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> as soon as possible.

            returning from his propraetorship in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>,
            found Pompey in difficulties with the senate (1) as to the confirmation <foreign

            East, (2) as to the assignation of lands to his veterans; and being met with opposition
            himself as to the triumph that he claimed, and his candidatureship for the consulship,
            he formed with Pompey and Crassus the agreement known as the first triumvirate. Cicero
            saw his favourite political object, the <foreign xml:lang="la">concordia
              ordinum</foreign>, threatened by any opposition to the triumvirate, which he yet
            distrusted as dangerous to the constitution. We shall find him, therefore, vacillating
            between giving his support to its policy or standing by the extreme Optimates. P.

        <p> Believe me there is nothing at this moment of which I stand so much in need as a man
          with whom to share all that causes me anxiety: a man to love me; a man of sense to whom I
          can speak without affectation, reserve, or concealment. <pb n="50"/> For my brother is
          away—that most open-hearted and affectionate of men. Metellus is not a human being, but <quote>
            <l>Mere sound and air, a howling wilderness.</l>
          </quote> While you, who have so often lightened my anxiety and my anguish of soul by your
          conversation and advice, who are ever my ally in public affairs, my confidant in all
          private business, the sharer in all my conversations and projects—where are you? So
          entirely am I abandoned by all, that the only moments of repose left me are those which
          are spent with my wife, pet daughter, and sweet little Cicero. For as to those friendships
          with the great, and their artificial attractions, they have indeed a certain glitter in
          the outside world, but they bring no private satisfaction. And so, after a crowded morning
            <foreign xml:lang="fr">levée</foreign>, as I go down to the forum surrounded by troops
          of friends, I can find no one out of all that crowd with whom to jest freely, or into
          whose ear I can breathe a familiar sigh. Therefore I wait for you, I long for you, I even
          urge on you to come for I have many anxieties, many pressing cares, of which I think, if I
          once had your ears to listen to me, I could unburden myself in the conversation of a
          single walk. And of my private anxieties, indeed, I shall conceal all the stings and
          vexations, and not trust them to this letter and an unknown letter-carrier. These,
          however—for I don't want you to be made too anxious—are not very painful: yet they are
          persistent and worrying, and are not put to rest by the advice or conversation of any
          friend. But in regard to the Republic I have still the same courage and purpose, though it
          has again and again of its own act eluded treatment. <note n="1" anchored="true">Reading
            (mainly with Schutz) <foreign xml:lang="la">animus praesens et voluntas, tamen etiam
              atque etiam ipsa medicinam refugit</foreign>. The verb <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >refugit</foreign> is very doubtful, but it gives nearly the sense required. Cicero is
            ready to be as brave and active as before, but the state will not do its part. It has,
            for instance, blundered in the matter of the law against judicial corruption. The senate
            offended the <foreign xml:lang="la">equites</foreign> by proposing it, and yet did not
            carry the law. I think <foreign xml:lang="la">animus</foreign> and <foreign
              xml:lang="la">voluntas</foreign> must refer to Cicero, not the state, to which in his
            present humour he would not attribute them. </note> For should I put briefly what has
          occurred since you left, you would certainly exclaim that the Roman empire cannot be
          maintained much longer. Well, after your <pb n="51"/> departure our first scene, I think,
          was the appearance of the Clodian scandal, in which having, as I thought, got an
          opportunity of pruning licentiousness and keeping our young men within bounds, I exerted
          myself to the utmost, and lavished all the resources of my intellect and genius, not from
          dislike to an individual, but from the hope of not merely correcting, but of completely
          curing the state. The Republic received a crushing blow when this jury was won over by
          money and the opportunity of debauchery. See what has followed we have had a consul
          inflicted upon us, whom none except us philosophers can look at without a sigh. What a
          blow that is ! Though a decree of the senate has been passed about bribery and the
          corruption of juries, no law has been carried; the senate has been harassed to death, the
          Roman knights alienated. So that one year has undermined two buttresses of the Republic,
          which owed their existence to me, and me alone; for it has at once destroyed the prestige
          of the senate and broken up the harmony of the orders. And now enter this precious year!
          It was inaugurated by the suspension of the annual rites of Iuventas ; <note n="1"
            anchored="true">The temple of <foreign xml:lang="la">Iuventas</foreign> was vowed by M.
            Livius after the battle of the Metaurus (<date when="-0207">B.C. 207</date>), and
            dedicated in <date when="-00191">B.C. 191</date> by C. Licinius Lucullus, games being
            established on the anniversary of its dedication (<bibl n="Liv. 21.62">Livy,
              21.62</bibl>; 36.36). It is suggested, therefore, that some of the <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Luculli</foreign> usually presided at these games, but on this occasion
            refused, because of the injury done by C. Memmius, who was curule aedile. </note> for
          Memmius initiated M. Lucullus's wife in some rites of his own! Our Menelaus, being annoyed
          at that, divorced his wife. Yet the old Idaean shepherd had only injured Menelaus; our
          Roman Paris thought Agamemnon as proper an object of injury as Menelaus. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">By Agamemnon and Menelaus Cicero means Lucius and Marcus Lucullus; the

            demand for a triumph, the latter he has now injured in the person of his wife. </note>
          Next there is a certain tribune named C. Herennius, whom you, perhaps, do not even
          know—and yet you may know him, for he is of your tribe, and his father Sextus used to
          distribute money to your tribesmen—this person is trying to transfer P. Clodius to the
          plebs, and is actually proposing a law to authorize the whole people to vote in Clodius's

          influence by promulgating (though only for form's sake) an identical bill about Clodius.
          But the son of Aulus, <note n="1" anchored="true">L. Afranius, the other <foreign

          has been promulgated by Flavius, a poor production enough, almost identical with that of
          Plotius. But meanwhile a genuine statesman is not to be found, even "in a dream." The man
          who could be one, my friend Pompey—for such he is, as I would have you know—defends his

          never risks his popularity by a word. The others you know without my telling you. They are
          such fools that they seem to expect that, though the Republic is lost, their fish-ponds
          will be safe. There is one man who does take some trouble, but rather, as it seems to me,
          with consistency and honesty, than with either prudence or
              ability—<persName><surname>Cato</surname></persName>. He has been for the last three
          months worrying those unhappy <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign>, who were
          formerly devoted to him, and refuses to allow of an answer being given them by the senate.
          And so we are forced to suspend all decrees on other subjects until the <foreign
            xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign> have got their answer. For the same reason I suppose
          even the business of the foreign embassies will be postponed. You now understand in what
          stormy water we are and as from what I have written to you in such strong terms you have a
          view also of what I have not written, come back to me, for it is time you did. And though
          the state of affairs to which I invite you is one to be avoided, yet let <pb n="53"/> your
          value for me so far prevail, as to induce you to come there even in these vexatious
          circumstances. For the rest I will take care that due warning is given, and a notice put
          up in all places, to prevent you being entered on the census as absent; and to get put on

            business, advisable, that he might be rated at the actual amount of his property, no

          short as yours usually are, should I easily beat you and be much the more regular in
          writing. But, in fact, it is only one more item in an immense and inconceivable amount of
          business, that I allow no letter to reach you from me without its containing some definite
          sketch of events and the reflections arising from it. And in writing to you, as a lover of

          </note> And while on this subject I cannot omit mentioning that when among the consulars
          my name was the first to come up in the ballot, a full meeting of the senate declared with
          one voice that I must be kept in the city. The same occurred to Pompey after me; so that
          we two appeared to be kept at home as pledges of the safety of the Republic. Why should I
          look for the "bravos" of others when I get these compliments at home? Well, the state of
          affairs in the city is as follows. The agrarian law is being vehemently pushed by the
          tribune Flavius, with the support of Pompey, but it has nothing popular about it except
          its supporter. From this law I, with the full assent of a public meeting, proposed to omit
          all clauses which adversely affected private rights. I proposed to except from its
          operation such public land as had been so in the consulship of P. Mucius and L.
          Calpurnius. <note n="5" anchored="true">
            <date when="-00133">B.C. 133</date>, the year before the agrarian law of Tiberius
            Gracchus. The law of Gracchus had not touched the public land in <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Campania</foreign> (the old territory of <foreign xml:lang="la">Capua</foreign>). The
            object of this clause (which appears repeatedly in those of <date when="-00120">B.C.
              120</date> and 111, see Bruns, <title>Fontes Iuris</title>, p. 72) is to confine the
            allotment of <foreign xml:lang="la">ager publicus</foreign> to such land as had become
            so subsequently, i.e., to land made "public" principally by the confiscations of
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Sulla</foreign>. </note> I proposed to confirm the titles of
          holders of those to whom Sulla had actually assigned lands. I proposed to retain the men
          of <placeName key="perseus,Volaterrae">Volaterrae</placeName> and Arretium—whose lands <pb
            n="55"/> Sulla had declared forfeited but had not allotted—in their holdings. There was
          only one section in the bill that I did not propose to omit, namely, that land should be
          purchased with this money from abroad, the proceeds of the new revenues for the next five
          years. <note n="1" anchored="true">That is, he proposed to hypothecate the <foreign
              xml:lang="la">vectigalia</foreign> from the new provinces formed by Pompey in the East
            for five years. </note> But to this whole agrarian scheme the senate was opposed,
          suspecting that some novel power for Pompey was aimed at. Pompey, indeed, had set his
          heart on getting the law passed. I, however, with the full approval of the applicants for
          land, maintained the holdings of all private owners—for, as you know, the landed gentry
          form the bulk of our party's forces—while I nevertheless satisfied the people and Pompey
          (for I wanted to do that also) by the purchase clause; for, if that was put on a sound
          footing, I thought that two advantages would accrue—the dregs might be drawn from the
          city, and the deserted portions of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> be
          repeopled. But this whole business was interrupted by the war, and has cooled off.
          Metellus is an exceedingly good consul, and much attached to me. That other one is such a
          ninny that he clearly doesn't know what to do with his purchase. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">The Consulship. The bribery at Afranius's election is asserted in Letter

          the fact that a certain Herennius, a tribune, and a fellow tribesman of yours—a fellow as
          unprincipled as he is needy—has now begun making frequent proposals for transferring P.
          Clodius to the plebs; he is vetoed by many of his colleagues. That is really, I think, all
          the public news. <milestone unit="para"/>For my part, ever since I won what I may call the
          splendid and immortal glory of the famous fifth of December <note n="3" anchored="true"
            >The day of the execution of the Catilinarian conspirators. </note> (though it was
          accompanied by the jealousy and hostility of many), I have never ceased to play my part in
          the Republic in the same lofty spirit, and to maintain the position I then inaugurated and
          took upon myself. But when, first, by the acquittal of Clodius I clearly perceived the
          insecurity and rotten state of the law courts; and, secondly, when I saw that it took so
          little to alienate my friends the <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign> from the
          senate—though with me personally they had no quarrel; <pb n="56"/> and, thirdly, that the
          rich (I mean your friends the fish-breeders) did not disguise their jealousy of me, I
          thought I must look out for some greater security and stronger support. So, to begin with,
          I have brought the man who had been too long silent on my achievements, Pompey himself, to
          such a frame of mind as not once only in the senate, but many times and in many words, to
          ascribe to me the preservation of this empire and of the world. And this was not so
          important to me—for those transactions are neither so obscure as to need and Pompey from a
          difference of opinion on these measures. testimony, nor so dubious as to need
          commendation—as to the Republic; for there were certain persons base enough to think that
          some misunderstanding would arise between me with him I have united myself in such close
          intimacy that both of us can by this union be better fortified in his own views, and more
          secure in his political position. However, the dislike of the licentious dandies, which
          had been roused against me, has been so far softened by a Conciliatory manner on my part,
          that they all combine to show me marked attention. In fine, while avoiding churlishness to
          anyone, I do not curry favour with the populace or relax any principle; but my whole
          course of conduct is so carefully regulated, that, while exhibiting an example of firmness
          to the Republic, in my own private concerns—in view of the instability of the loyalists,
          the hostility of the disaffected, and the hatred of the disloyal towards me—I employ a
          certain caution and circumspection, and do not allow myself, after all, to be involved in
          these new friendships so far but that the famous refrain of the cunning Sicilian
          frequently sounds in my ears: <note n="1" anchored="true">Epicharmus, twice quoted by

          <quote>
            <l>Keep sober and distrust these wisdom's sinews!</l>
          </quote> Of my course and way of life, therefore, you see, I think, what may be called a
          sketch or outline. Of your own business, however, you frequently write to me, but I cannot
          at the moment supply the remedy you require. For that decree of the senate was passed with
          the greatest unanimity on the part of the rank and file, <note n="2" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Pedarii</foreign> were probably those senators who had not held
            curule office. They were not different from the other senators in point of legal rights,
            but as the ex-magistrates were asked for their <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >sententia</foreign> first, they seldom had time to do anything but signify by word
            their assent to one or other motion, or to cross over to the person whom they intended
            to support. </note> though without the support of any of us consulars. For as to your
          seeing my name at <pb n="57"/> the foot of the decree, you can ascertain from the decree
          itself that the subject put to the vote at the time was a different one, and that this
          clause about "free peoples" was added without good reason. It was done by P. Servilius the
          younger, <note n="1" anchored="true">P. Servilius <foreign xml:lang="la">Vatia</foreign>
            Isauricus, son of the Conqueror of the Isaurians. As he had not yet been praetor, he
            would be called on after the <foreign xml:lang="la">consulares</foreign> and <foreign
              xml:lang="la">praetorii</foreign>. He then moved a new clause to the decree, and
            carried it. </note> who delivered his vote among the last, but it cannot be altered
          after such an interval of time. Accordingly, the meetings, which at first were crowded,
          have long ceased to be held. If you have been able, notwithstanding, by your insinuating
          address to get a trifle of money out of the Sicyonians, I wish you would let me know.
            <note n="2" anchored="true">The decree apparently prevented the recovery of debts from a
              <foreign xml:lang="la">libera civitas</foreign> in the Roman courts. <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign> would therefore have to trust to the regard of the
            Sicyonians for their credit. </note> I have sent you an account of my consulship written
          in Greek. If there is anything in it which to a genuine Attic like yourself seems to be
          un-Greek or unscholarly, I shall not say as Lucullus said to you (at <placeName
            key="tgn,7003928">Panhormus</placeName>, was it not?) about his own history, that he had
          interspersed certain barbarisms and solecisms for the express purpose of proving that it
          was the work of a Roman. No, if there is anything of that sort in my book, it will be
          without my knowledge and against my will. When I have finished the Latin version I will
          send it to you; and thirdly, you may expect a poem on the subject, for I would not have
          any method of celebrating my praise omitted by myself. In this regard pray do not quote
          "Who will praise his sire?" <note n="3" anchored="true">A son must be hard up for
            something to say for himself if he is always harping on his father's reputation ; and so
            must I, if I have nothing but my consulship. That seems the only point in the quotation.
            I do not feel that there is any reference to praise of his father in Cicero's own poem.
            There are two versions of the proverb: <foreign xml:lang="grc">ti/s pate/r' ai)nh/sei
              ei) mh\ kakodai/mones ui(oi/;</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ti/s pate/r'
              ai)nh/sei ei) mh\ eu)dai/mones ui(oi/;</foreign>
          </note> For if there is anything in the world to be preferred to this, let it receive its
          due meed of praise, and I mine of blame for not selecting another theme for my praise.
          However, what I write is not panegyric but history. My brother Quintus clears himself to
          me in a letter, and asserts that he has never said a disparaging word of you <pb n="58"/>
          to anyone. But this we must discuss face to face with the greatest care and earnestness:
          only do come to see me again at last! This Cossinius, to whom I intrust my letter, seems
          to me a very good fellow, steady, devoted to you, and exactly the sort of man which your

        </opener>
        <p> On my return to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> from my villa at
            <placeName key="perseus,Pompeii">Pompeii</placeName> on the 12th of May, our friend
          Cincius handed me your letter dated 13th February. It is this letter of yours which I will
          now proceed to answer. And first let me say how glad I am that you have fully understood
          my appreciation of you; <note n="1" anchored="true">Contained in Letter XXII, pp. 46-47.
          </note> and next how excessively rejoiced I am that you have been so extremely reasonable
          in regard to those particulars in which you thought <note n="2" anchored="true">Reading
              <foreign xml:lang="la">tibi</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="la">mihi</foreign>, as
            Prof. Tyrrell suggests. </note> that I and mine had behaved unkindly, or with
          insufficient consideration for your feelings: and this I regard as a proof of no common
          affection, and of the most excellent judgment and wisdom. Wherefore, since you have
          written to me in a tone so delightful, considerate, friendly and kind, that I not only
          have no call to press you any farther, but can never even hope to meet from you or any
          other man with so much gentleness and good nature, I think the very best course I can
          pursue is not to say another word on the subject in my letters. When we meet, if the
          occasion should arise, we will discuss it together. As to what you say about politics,
          your suggestions indeed <pb n="59"/> are both affectionate and wise, and the course you
          suggest does not differ substantially from my own policy—for I must neither budge an inch
          from the position imposed upon me by my rank, nor must I without forces of my own enter
          the lines of another, while that other, whom you mention in your letter, has nothing
          large-minded about him, nothing lofty, —nothing which is not abject and time-serving.
          However, the course I took was, after all, perhaps not ill-calculated for securing the
          tranquillity of my own life; but, by heaven, I did greater service to the Republic than,
          by suppressing the attacks of the disloyal, I did to myself, when I brought conviction
          home to the wavering mind of a man of the most splendid fortune, influence and popularity,
          and induced him to disappoint the disloyal and praise my acts. Now if I had been forced to
          sacrifice consistency in this transaction, I should not have thought anything worth that
          price; but the fact is that I have so worked the whole business, that I did not seem to be
          less consistent from my complacency to him, but that he appeared to gain in character by
          his approbation of me. In everything else I am so acting, and shall continue so to act, as
          to prevent my seeming to have done what I did do by mere chance. My friends the loyalists,
          the men at whom you hint, and that "<placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>"

          senate. For there is no one now to lay a complaint before it. Therefore, if you are
          waiting for that, you will find it a tedious business. Fight some other way if you can. At
          the time the decree was passed no one noticed who would be affected by it, and besides the
          rank and file of the senators voted in a great hurry for that clause. For cancelling the
          senatorial decree the time is not yet ripe, because there are none to complain of it, and
          because also many are glad to have it so, some from spite, some from a notion of its
          equity. Your friend Metellus is an admirable consul: I have only one fault to find with
          him—he doesn't receive the news from <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> of the
          restoration of peace with much pleasure. He wants a triumph, I suppose. I could have
          wished a little less of that sort of thing: in other respects he is splendid. But the son
          of Aulus behaves in such a way, that his consulship is not a consulship but a stigma on
          our friend Magnus. Of my writings I send you my consulship in Greek completed. I have
          handed that book to L. Cossinius. My Latin works I think you like, but as a Greek you envy
          this Greek book. If others write treatises on the subject I will send them to you, but I
          assure you that, as soon as they have read mine, somehow or other they become slack. To
          return to my own affairs, L. Papirius Paetus, an excellent man and an admirer of mine, has
          presented me with the books left him by Servius Claudius. As your friend Cincius told me
          that I could take them without breaking the <foreign xml:lang="la">lex Cincia</foreign>,
            <note n="2" anchored="true">The <foreign xml:lang="la">lex Cincia</foreign> (<date

          if he brought them to <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. Wherefore, as you
          love me, as you know that I love you, do try by means of friends, clients, guests, or even
          your freedmen or slaves, to prevent the loss of a single leaf. For I am in urgent need of
          the Greek books which I suspect, and of the Latin books which I know, that he left: and
          more and more every day I find repose in such studies every moment left to me from my
          labours in the forum. You will, I say, do me a very great favour, if you will be as
          zealous in this matter as you ever are in matters in which you suppose me to feel <pb
            n="61"/> strongly; and Paetus's own affairs I recommend to your kindness, for which he
          thanks you extremely. A prompt visit from yourself is a thing which I do not merely ask

        <p> On the 1st of June, as I was on my way to <placeName key="perseus,Antium"
            >Antium</placeName>, and eagerly getting out of the way of M. Metellus's gladiators,
          your boy met me, and delivered to me a letter from you and a history of my consulship
          written in Greek. <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <bibl n="Nep. Att. 18">Nep. Att. 18</bibl>. </note> This made me glad that I had some
          time before delivered to L. Cossinius a book, also written in Greek, on the same subject,
          to take to you. For if I had read yours first you might have said that I had pilfered from
          you. Although your essay (which I have read with pleasure) seemed to me just a trifle
          rough and bald, yet its very neglect of ornament is an ornament in itself, as women were
          once thought to have the best perfume who used none. My book, on the other hand, has
          exhausted the whole of Isocrates's unguent case, and all the paint-boxes of his pupils,
          and even Aristotle's colours. This, as you tell me in another letter, you glanced over at
            <placeName key="tgn,7010886">Corcyra</placeName>, and afterwards I suppose received it
          from Cossinius. <note n="2" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign> seems to have seen a copy belonging to some one
            else at <placeName key="tgn,7010886">Corfu</placeName>. Cicero explains that he had kept
            back Atticus's copy for revision. </note> I should not have ventured to send it to you
          until I had slowly and fastidiously revised it. However, Posidonius, in his letter of
          acknowledgment from <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>, says that as he read
          my memoir, which I had sent him with a view to his writing on the same subject with more
          elaboration, he was not only not incited to write, but absolutely made afraid to do so. In
          a word, I have routed the Greeks. Accordingly, as a general rule, those who were pressing
          me for material to work up, have now ceased to bother me. Pray, if you like the book, see
          to there being copies at <pb n="62"/>

          speeches, I will send you both those you ask for and some more also, since what I write to
          satisfy the studious youth finds favour, it seems, with you also. [For it suited my

          Demosthenes gained his reputation, and because it was by withdrawing from the mere
          controversial and forensic style of oratory that he acquired the character of a serious
          politician—to see that I too should have speeches that may properly be called
            <emph>consular</emph>. Of these are, first, one delivered on the 1st of January in the
          senate, a second to the people on the agrarian law, a third on Otho, a fourth for
          Rabirius, a fifth on the Sons of the Proscribed, a sixth when I declined a province in
          public meeting, a seventh when I allowed Catiline to escape, which I delivered the day
          after Catiline fled, a ninth in public meeting on the day that the Allobroges made their
          revelation, a tenth in the senate on the 5th of December. There are also two short ones,
          which may be called fragments, on the agrarian law. This whole cycle I will see that you
          have. And since you like my writings as well as my actions, from these same rolls you will
          learn both what I have done and what I have said—or you should not have asked for them,
          for I did not make you an offer of them.] <milestone unit="para"/>You ask me why I urge
          you to come home, and at the same time you intimate that you are hampered by business
          affairs, and yet say that you will nevertheless hasten back, not only if it is needful,
          but even if I desire it. Well, there is certainly no absolute necessity, yet I do think
          you might plan the periods of your tour somewhat more conveniently. Your absence is too
          prolonged, especially as you are in a neighbouring country, while yet I cannot enjoy your
          society, <pb n="63"/> nor you mine. For the present there is peace, but if my young friend
          Puncher's <note n="1" anchored="true">Pulchellus, i.e., P. Clodius <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Pulcher</foreign>, the diminutive of contempt. </note> madness found means to advance
          a little farther, I should certainly summon you from your present sojourn. But Metellus is
          offering him a splendid opposition and will continue to do so. Need I say more? He is a
          truly patriotic consul and, as I have ever thought, naturally an honest man. That person,
          however, makes no disguise, but avowedly desires to be elected tribune. But when the
          matter was mooted in the senate, I cut the fellow to pieces, and taunted him with his
          changeableness in seeking the tribuneship at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
            >Rome</placeName> after having given out at Hera, in <placeName key="tgn,7003122"
            >Sicily</placeName>, <note n="2" anchored="true">Where he had been as quaestor. Hera is
            said to be another name for <foreign xml:lang="la">Hybla</foreign>. Some read <foreign

          the aedileship; and went on to say that we needn't much trouble ourselves, for that he
          would not be permitted to ruin the Republic any more as a plebeian, than patricians like
          him had been allowed to do so in my consulship. Presently, on his saying that he had
          completed the journey from the straits in seven days, and that it was impossible for
          anyone to have gone out to meet him, and that he had entered the city by night, <note
            n="3" anchored="true">Clodius is showing off his modesty. It was usual for persons
            returning from a province to send messengers in front, and to travel deliberately, that
            their friends might pay them the compliment of going out to meet them. Entering the city
            after nightfall was another method of avoiding a public reception. See <bibl
              n="Suet. Aug. 53">Suet. Aug. 53</bibl>. </note> and making a great parade of this in a
          public meeting, I remarked that that was nothing new for him: seven days from <placeName
            key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>,
          three hours from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> to lnteramna ! <note n="4"

          No one went to meet him? neither did anyone on the other occasion, exactly when it should
          have been done! In short, I bring our young upstart to his bearings, not only by a set and
          serious speech, but also by repartees of this sort. Accordingly, I have come now to rally
          him and jest with him in quite a familiar manner. For instance, when we were escorting a
          candidate, he asked me "whether I had been accustomed to secure Sicilians places at the
          gladiatorial shows?" " No," said I. "Well, I intend to start the practice," said he, "as
          their new patron; but my sister, <note n="5" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Clodia</foreign>, wife of the <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >consul</foreign> Metellus. See p. 22, note. </note>
          <pb n="64"/> who has the control of such a large part of the consul's space, won't give me
          more than a single foot." "Don't grumble," said I, "about one of your sister's feet; you
          may lift the other also." A jest, you will say, unbecoming to a consular. I confess it,
          but I detest that woman—so unworthy of a consul. For <quote>
            <l>A shrew she is and with her husband jars,</l>
          </quote> and not only with Metellus, but also with Fabius, <note n="1" anchored="true">We
            don't know who this is; probably a <foreign xml:lang="it">cavaliere servente</foreign>
            of Clodia's. </note> because she is annoyed at their interference in this business.
            <note n="2" anchored="true">I.e., in the business of her brother Clodius's attempt to
            get the tribuneship. </note> You ask about the agrarian law: it has completely lost all
          interest, I think. You rather chide me, though gently, about my intimacy with Pompey. I
          would not have you think that I have made friends with him for my own protection; but
          things had come to such a pass that, if by any chance we had quarreled, there would
          inevitably have been violent dissensions in the state. And in taking precautions and
          making provision against that, I by no means swerved from my well-known loyalist policy,
          but my object was to make him more of a loyalist and induce him to drop somewhat of his
          time-serving vacillation: and he, let me assure you, now speaks in much higher terms of my
          achievements (against which many had tried to incite him) than of his own. He testifies
          that while he served the state well, I preserved it. What if I even make a better citizen
          of Caesar, <note n="3" anchored="true">Though Caesar has been mentioned before in regard
            to his <foreign xml:lang="la">candidature</foreign> for the consulship, and in
            connection with the Clodius Case, this is the first reference to him as a statesman. He
            is on the eve of his return from <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, and
            already is giving indication of his coalition with Pompey. His military success in
              <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> first clearly demonstrated his
            importance. </note> who has now the wind full in his sails—am I doing so poor a service
          to the Republic? Furthermore, if there was no one to envy me, if all, as they ought to be,
          were my supporters, nevertheless a preference should still be given to a treatment that
          would cure the diseased parts of the state, rather than to the use of the knife. As it is,
          however, since the knighthood, which I once stationed on the slope of <pb n="65"/> the
          Capitoline, <note n="1" anchored="true">During the meeting of the senate at the time of

          men think themselves in a seventh heaven, if there are bearded mullets in their fish-ponds
          that will come to hand for food, and neglect everything else, do not you think that I am
          doing no mean service if I secure that those who have the power, should not have the will,
          to do any harm? As for our friend Cato, you do not love him more than I do: but after all,
          with the very best intentions and the most absolute honesty, he sometimes does harm to the
          Republic. He speaks and votes as though he were in the Republic of Plato, not in the scum
          of Romulus. What could be fairer than that a man should be brought to trial who has taken
          a bribe for his verdict? Cato voted for this: the senate agreed with him. The equites
          declared war on the senate, not on me, for I voted against it. What could be a greater
          piece of impudence than the equites renouncing the obligations of their contract? Yet for
          the sake of keeping the friendship of the order it was necessary to submit to the loss.
          Cato resisted and carried his point. Accordingly, though we have now had the spectacle of

          end, however, as they were wont to do, the one which I approve. It is, indeed, a matter
          for profound refection. For I must either firmly oppose the agrarian law—which will
          involve a certain struggle, but a struggle full of glory—or I must remain altogether
          passive, which is about equivalent to retiring to Solonium <note n="1" anchored="true"

            >Antium</placeName>; or, lastly, I must actually assist the bill, which I am told Caesar
          fully expects from me without any doubt. For Cornelius has been with me (I mean Cornelius
          Balbus, <note n="2" anchored="true">The <foreign xml:lang="la">Cornelius</foreign> Balbus
            of <foreign xml:lang="la">Gades</foreign>, whose citizenship Cicero defended <date

          Caesar's intimate), and solemnly assured me that he meant to avail himself of my advice
          and Pompey's in everything, and intended to endeavour to reconcile Crassus with Pompey.
            <note n="3" anchored="true">Cicero was apparently not behind the scenes. The coalition
            with Pompey certainly, and with Crassus probably, had been already made and the terms
            agreed upon soon after the elections. If Cicero afterwards discovered this it must have
            shown him how little he could trust Pompey's show of friendship and Caesar's candour.
            Caesar desired Cicero's private friendship and public acquiescence, but was prepared to
            do without them. </note> In this last course there are the following advantages: a very
          close union with Pompey, and, if I choose, with Caesar also; a reconciliation with my
          political enemies, peace with the common herd, ease for my old age. But the conclusion of
          the third book of my own poem has a strong hold on me: <quote>

            history of the Republic, and also of Cicero particularly. It witnessed the working of
            the agreement entered into in the previous year between Pompey, Caesar, and Crassus, to
            secure their several objects, commonly called the First Triumvirate. The determined
            enmity of the consuls to each other, the high-handed conduct of Caesar in regard to the
            senate, his ultimate appointment to the unusual period of five years' government of the
            Gauls and <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName>, were so many blows at the
            old constitution; and scarcely less offensive to the Catonian Optimates were the
            agrarian laws passed in favour of Pompey's veterans, the forcing of his <foreign
              xml:lang="la">acta</foreign> through the senate, and the arrangement whereby he too
            was eventually to have the consulship again, and an extended period of provincial
            government. Cicero was distracted by hesitation. He had pinned his faith on Pompey's
            ultimate opposition to Caesar, and yet did not wholly trust him, and was fully aware of
            the unpracticable nature of Cato and the weakness of the Optimates. The triumvirs had an
            instrument for rendering him helpless in Clodius, but Cicero could not believe that they
            would use it, or that his services to the state could be so far forgotten as to make
            danger possible. We shall find him, then, wholly absorbed in the question as to how far
            he is to give into or oppose the triumvirs. It is not till the end of the year that he
            begins to see the real danger ahead. We have one extant <pb n="88"/> oration of this
              year-<title>pro Flacco</title>-which was not much to his credit, for Flaccus had
            evidently been guilty of extortion in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>. He
            also defended the equally guilty C. Antonius in a speech which brought upon him the
            vengeance of the triumvirs, but it is happily lost. </p>

        <p> As to my promise to you in a former letter that there should be some product of this
          country excursion, I cannot confirm it to any great extent: for I have become so attached
          to idleness that I cannot be torn from its arms. Accordingly, I either enjoy myself with
          books, of which I have a delightful stock at <placeName key="perseus,Antium"
            >Antium</placeName>, or I just count the waves—for the rough weather prevents my
          shrimping! From writing my mind positively recoils. For the geographical treatise, upon
          which I had settled, is a serious undertaking: so severely is Eratosthenes, whom I had
          proposed as my model, criticised by Serapio and Hipparchus: what think you will be the
          case if Tyrannio <note n="1" anchored="true">A captive brought by Lucullus, who became a
            friend of Cicero and tutor to his son and nephew. </note> is added to the critics? And,
          by Hercules, the subject is difficult of explanation and monotonous, and does not seem to
          admit of as much embellishment as I thought, and, in short—which is the chief point-any
          excuse for being idle seems to me a good one: for I am even hesitating as to settling at
            <placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName> and spending the rest of my life
          there, where, indeed, I would rather have been a duovir <note n="2" anchored="true">One of

          This, this is the place to play the statesman in For yonder, not only am I not allowed to
          do so, but I am sick of it besides. Accordingly, I will compose a book of secret memoirs

        <p> About the geography I will think again and again. But you ask for two of my speeches,
          one of which I did not care to write out because I had ended it abruptly, the other
          because I did not want to praise the man I did not like. But that, too, I will see about.
          At all events, something shall be forth-coming to prevent your thinking that I have been
          absolutely idle. I am quite delighted to hear what you tell me about <pb n="93"/> Publius;
          pray ferret out the whole story, and bring it to me you when come, and meanwhile write
          anything you may make out or suspect, and especially as to what he is going to do about
          the legation. For my part, before reading your letter, I was anxious that the fellow
          should go, not, by heaven, in order to avoid his impeachment—for I am wonderfully keen to
          try issues with him—but it seemed to me that, if he had secured any popularity by becoming
          a plebeian, he would thereby lose it. "Well, why did you transfer yourself to the Plebs?
          Was it to make a call on Tigranes? Tell me: do the kings of <placeName key="tgn,7006651"
            >Armenia</placeName> refuse to receive patricians?" In a word, I had polished up my
          weapons to teat this embassy of his to pieces. But if he rejects it, and thus moves the
          anger of those pro-posers and augurs of the <foreign xml:lang="la">lex curiata</foreign>,
            <note n="1" anchored="true">As he was a man <foreign xml:lang="la">sui iuris</foreign>,

              xml:lang="la">comitia curiata</foreign> (now represented by thirty lictors), which
            still retained this formal business. The ceremony required the presence of an augur and
            a pontifex to hold it. Cicero supposes Pompey and Caesar as intending to act in that
            capacity. Pompey, it seems, did eventually attend. </note> it will be a fine sight! By
          Hercules, to speak the truth, our friend Publius is being treated a little contemptuously!
          In the first place, though he was once the only man at Caesar's house, he is not now
          allowed to be one in twenty : <note n="2" anchored="true">One of the twenty commissioners

          miserable business, which might be very well done by a courier, is given to him, and his
          tribuneship deferred till it suits them. Irritate the fellow, I beg you, as much as you
          can. The one hope of safety is their mutual disagreement, the beginning of which I have
          got scent of from Curio. Moreover, Arrius is fuming at being cheated out of the
          consulship. Megabocchus and our blood-thirsty young men are most violently hostile. May
          there be added to this, I pray, may there be added, this quarrel about the augurate! I
          hope I shall often have some fine letters to send you on these subjects. But I want to

        <p> When I had been eagerly expecting a letter from you as usual till evening, lo and behold
          a message that slaves have come from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. I
          summon them: I ask if they have any letters. "No," say they. "What do you say," said I,
          "nothing from Pomponius?" Frightened to death by my voice and look, they confessed that
          they had received one, and that it had been lost on the journey. Need I say more? I was
          intensely annoyed. For no letter has come from you for the last few days without something
          in it important and entertaining. In these circumstances, if there was anything in the
          letter dated 15th April, worth telling, pray write at once, that I may not be left in
          ignorance; but if there was nothing but banter, repeat even that for my benefit. And let
          me inform you that young Curio has been to call on me. What he said about Publius agreed
          exactly with your letter. He himself, moreover, wonderfully "holds our proud kings in
          hate." <note n="1" anchored="true">A verse from Lucilius. "Young Curio" is the future

          young men generally were equally incensed, and could not put up with the present state of
          things. If there is hope in them, we are in a good way. My opinion is that we should leave
          things to take their course. I am devoting myself to my memoir. However, though you may

            risk of your thinking me a Epicurean and self-indulgent as Saufeius, I say," etc.
          </note> I am really the laziest fellow in the worid. But get into your head my several
          journeys, that.you may settle where you intend to come and see me. I intend to arrive at
          my Formian house on the Parilia (21st April). <pb n="96"/> Next, since you think that at

          and with less noise than I had thought, has the wheel of the Republic revolved more
          rapidly, anyhow, than it should have done owing to Cato's error, but still more owing to
          the unconstitutional conduct of those who have neglected the auspices, the Aelian law, the

            it gave them a hold on elections and legislation. Bibulus tried in vain to use these

            confirmed <foreign xml:lang="fr">en bloc</foreign>. The senate had made difficulties :
            but one of the fruits of the triumvirate was a measure for doing it. The <foreign

        <p> Are they going to deny that Publius has been made a plebeian? This is indeed playing the
          king, and is utterly intolerable. Let Publius send some men to witness and seal my
          affidavit: I will take an oath that my friend Gnaeus, <pb n="99"/> the colleague of
          Balbus, told me at <placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName> that he had been
          present as augur to take the auspices. Two delightful letters from you delivered at the
          same time! For which I do not know what I am to pay you by way of reward for good news.
          That I owe you for them I candidly confess. But observe the coincidence. I had just made
          my way from <placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName> on to the <foreign
            xml:lang="la">via Appia</foreign> at Three Taverns, <note n="1" anchored="true">Where
            the road from <foreign xml:lang="la">Antium</foreign> joins the <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Appia</foreign>. Cicero seems to be on his way to <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Formiae</foreign>, where he had intanded to arrive on the 21st. He must be going very

          meets me on his way from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. At the same piace
          and the same moment comes a slave from you with letters. The former asked me whether I
          hadn't heard the news? I said, "No." "Publius," says he, "is a candidate for the
          tribuneship." "You don't mean it?" "Yes, I do," says he, "and at daggers drawn with
          Caesar. His object is to rescind his acts." "What says Caesar?" said I. "He denies having
          proposed any <foreign xml:lang="la">lex</foreign> for his adoption." Then he poured forth
          about his own hatred, and that of Memmius and Metellus Nepos. I embraced the youth and
          said good-bye to him, hastening to your letters. A fig for those who talk about a "living
          voice"! What a much clearer view I got of what was going on from your letters than from
          his talk! About the current rumours of the day, about the designs of Publius, about
          "Iuno's" trumpet calls, about Athenio who leads his roughs, about his letter to Gnaeus,
          about the conversation of Theophanes and Memmius. Besides, how eager you have made me to
          hear about the "fast" dinner party which you mention! I am greedy in curiosity, yet I do
          not feel at all hurt at your not writing me a description of the symposium: I would rather
          hear it by word of mouth. As to your urging me to write something, my material indeed is
          growing, as you say, but the whole is still in a state of fermentation—"new wine in the
          autumn." when the liquor has settled down and become clarified, I shall know better what
          to write. And even if you cannot get it from me at once, you shall be the first to have
          it: only for some time you must keep it to yourself. You are quite right to like

        <p> How you rouse my curiosity as to what Bibulus says, as to your conversation with "Iuno,"
          and even as to your "fast" dinner party! Therefore make haste to come, for my ears are
          thirsty for news. However, there is nothing which I think is now more to be dreaded by me
          than that our dear Sampsiceramus, finding himself belaboured by the tongues of all, and
          seeing these proceedings easy to upset, should begin striking out. For myself, I have so
          completely lost all nerve, that I prefer a despotism, with the existing peace, to a state
          of war with the best hopes in the world. As to literary composition, to which you
          frequently urge me, it is impossible! My house is a basilica rather than a villa, owing to
          the crowds of visitors from <placeName key="perseus,Formiae">Formiae</placeName>. But
          (you'll say) do I really compare the Aemilian tribe to the crowd in a basilica? <note

            introducing a supposed objection. I can't, say you, compare the Aemilian tribe, the
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Formiani</foreign>, to a crowd in a court-house! They are not
            so bad as that, not so wasteful of time ! I take basilica to mean the saunterers in a
            basilica, as we might say "the park " for the company in it, "the exchange" for the
            brokers in it. I feel certain that Prof. Tyrrell is wrong in ascribing the words
              <foreign xml:lang="la">sed ... sunt</foreign> to a quotation from Atticus's letter.
            What is wanted is to remove the full stop after <foreign xml:lang="la">sunt</foreign>.
            The contrast Cicero is drawing is between the interruption to literary work of a crowd
            of visitors and of one or two individuals always turning up. The second is the worse—and
            here I think all workers will agree with him: the crowd of visitors (<foreign
              xml:lang="la">vulgus</foreign>) go at the regular hour, but individuals come in at all
            hours. </note> Well, I say nothing about the common ruck— <pb n="103"/> the rest of them
          don't bother me after ten o'clock: but C. Arrius is my next door neighbour, or rather, he
          almost lives in my house, and even declares that the reason for his not going to
            <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> is that he may spend whole days with me
          here philosophizing! And then, lo and behold, on my other side is Sebosus, that friend of

        <p> As you say, things are as shifting (I see) in public affairs as in your letter; still,
          that very variety of talk and opinion has a charm for me. For I seem to be at <placeName

          regular thing in questions of such importance, to hear something first on one side and
          then on the other. But what I can't make out is this—what he can possibly hit upon to
          settle the land question without encountering opposition. Again, as to Bibulus's firmness
          in putting off the <foreign xml:lang="la">comitia</foreign>, it only conveys the
          expression of his own views, without really offering any remedy for the state of the

          afford to miss him, especially if he shall elect to have a wrangle with me! -But,
          seriously, if anything of the sort occurs, you would, I am certain, hurry back. But even

          me. In the first place, from what you had said in your previous letter—"that you had heard
          from a friend of his <note n="1" anchored="true">Caesar. </note> that a proposal was going
          to be made which would satisfy everybody"—I had feared some very sweeping measure, but I
          don't think this is anything of the sort. In the next place, by way of consolation, I
          persuaded myself that the hope of a distribution of land is now all centred on the
          Campanian territory. <note n="2" anchored="true">The old territory of <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Capua</foreign> and the Stellatian Plain had been specially reserved
            from distribution under the laws of the <foreign xml:lang="la">Gracchi</foreign>, and
            this reservation had not been repealed in subsequent laws: <foreign xml:lang="la">ad
              subsidia reipublicae vectigalem relictum</foreign> (<bibl n="Suet. Jul. 20">Suet.
              Caes. 20</bibl>; cp. Cic. <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 2.101">Phil. 2.101</bibl>). </note> That
          land cannot support more than 5,000, 50 as to give ten <foreign xml:lang="la"
            >iugera</foreign> apiece : <note n="3" anchored="true">According to Suetonius 20,000
            citizens had allotments on the <foreign xml:lang="la">ager publicus</foreign> in
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Campania</foreign>. But Dio says (38.1) that the Campanian land
            was exempted by the <foreign xml:lang="la">lex Iulia</foreign> also. Its settlement was
            probably later, by colonies of Caesar's veterans. A <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >jugerum</foreign> is five-eighths of an acre. </note> the rest of the crowd of
          expectants must necessarily be alienated from them. Besides, if there is anything that
          more than another could inflame the feeling of the aristocrats, who are, I notice, already
          irritated, it is this; and all the more that with port-dues in <placeName
            key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> abolished, <note n="4" anchored="true">See Letter
            XXIX, p. 82. They were abolished <date when="-0060">B.C. 60</date>. </note> and the
          Campanian land divided, what home revenue is there except the five per cent. on
          manumissions? And even that, I think, it will only take a single trumpery harangue,
          cheered by our lackeys, to throw away <pb n="106"/> also. What our friend Gnaeus can be
          thinking of I can't imagine— <quote>
            <l>For still he blows, and with no slender pipe,</l>
            <l>But furious blasts by no mouth-band restrained</l>
          </quote> to be induced to countenance such a measure as that. For hitherto he has fenced
          with these questions: "he approved Caesar's laws, but Caesar must be responsible for his
          proceedings in carrying them"; "he himself was satisfied with the agrarian law"; "whether
          it could be vetoed by a tribune or no was nothing to do with him"; "he thought the time
          had come for the business of the Alexandrine king to be settled"; "it was no business of
          his to inquire whether Bibulus had been watching the sky on that occasion or no"; "as to
          the <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign> he had been willing to oblige that order";
          "what was going to happen if Bibulus came down to the forum at that time he could not have
          guessed." <note n="1" anchored="true">This and the mention of Caesar's "army" (a
            bodyguard) is explained by <bibl n="Suet. Jul. 20">Suet. Caes. 20</bibl>: "Having
            promulgated his agrarian law, Caesar expelled his colleague, Bibulus, by force of arms
            from the Forum when trying to stop proceedings by announcing bad omens .. , and finally
            reduced him to such despair that for the rest of his year of office he confined himself
            to his house and only announced his bad omens by means of edicts." Bibulus appears to
            have been hustled by the mob also. </note> But now, my Sampsiceramus, what will you say
          to this? That you have secured us a revenue from the Antilibanus and removed that from the
          Campanian land? Well, how do you mean to vindicate that? "I shall coerce you," says he,
          "by means of Caesar's army." You won't coerce me, by Hercules, by your army so much as by
          the ingratitude of the so-called <foreign xml:lang="la">boni</foreign> who have never made
          me any return, even in words, to say nothing of substantial rewards. But if I had put out
          my strength against that coterie, I should certainly have found some way of holding my own
          against them. As things are, in view of the controversy between your friend Dicaearchus
          and my friend Theophrastus—the former recommending the life of action, the latter the life
          of contemplation—I think I have already obeyed both. For as to Dicaearchus, I think I have
          satisfied his requirements; at present my eyes are fixed on the school which not only
          allows of my abstaining from business, but blames me for <pb n="107"/> not having always
          done so. Wherefore let me throw myself, my dear Titus, into those noble studies, and let
          me at length return to what I ought never to have left. As to what you say about Quintus's
          letter, when he wrote to me he was also "in front a lion and behind a ——." <note n="1"
            anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">pro/sqe le/wn o)/piqen de\ —.</foreign> Cicero leaves <foreign

              <foreign xml:lang="grc">dra/kwn, me/ssh de\ xi/maira</foreign> (Hom. 51.6.181). He
            means, of course, that Quintus is inconsistent. </note> I don't know what to say about
          it; for in the first lines of his letter he makes such a lamentation over his continuance
          in his province, that no one could help being affected: presently he calms down
          sufficiently to ask me to correct and edit his Annals. However, I would wish you to have
          an eye to what you mention, I mean the duty on goods transferred from port to port. He
          says that by the advice of his council he has referred the question to the senate. He
          evidently had not read my letter, in which after having considered and investigated the
          matter, I had sent him a written opinion that they were not payable. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">The question seems to be as to goods brought to a port and paying duty,
            and then, not finding a sale, being transferred to another port in the same province.
            The <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign> at the second port demanded the payment
            of a duty again, which Cicero decides against them. </note> If any Greeks have already

          think it right, explain to them my opinion on the subject. If, to save the good cause in
          the senate, I can retract, I will gratify the <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign>:
          but if not, to be plain with you, I prefer in this matter the interests of all <placeName
            key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> and the merchants; for it affects the latter also
          very seriously. I think it is a matter of great importance to us. But you will settle it.
          Are the quaestors, pray, still hesitating on the <foreign xml:lang="la"
            >cistophorus</foreign> question? <note n="3" anchored="true">Schutz takes this to mean,
            "Are the quaestors now doubting as to paying even <foreign xml:lang="la"

            the <foreign xml:lang="la">extremum</foreign> which Cicero advises Quintus to accept?
            Prof. Tyrrell, besides, points out that the quaestors could hardly refuse to pay

        <p> I QUITE agree with your letter. Sampsiceramus is getting up a disturbance. We have
          everything to fear. He is preparing a despotism and no mistake about it: For what else is
          the meaning of that sudden marriage union, <note n="1" anchored="true">The marriage of
            Pompey with Caesar's daughter Iulia. </note> the Campanian land affair, the lavish
          expenditure of money? If these measures were final, even then the mischief had been very
          great; but the nature of the case makes finality impossible. For how could these measures
          possibly give them any pleasure in themselves? They would never have gone so far as this
          unless they had been paving the way for other fatal steps. Immortal Gods !-But, as you
          say, at <placeName key="perseus,Arpinum">Arpinum</placeName> about the 10th of May we will
          not weep over these questions, lest the hard work and midnight oil I have spent over my
          studies shall turn out to have been wasted, but discuss them together calmly. For I am not
          so much consoled by a sanguine disposition as by philosophic "indifference," <note n="2"

          of reputation there is lurking in me—for it is well to know one's faults—is tickled by a
          certain pleasurable feeling. For it used to sting me to the heart to think that centuries
          hence the services of Sampsiceramus to the state would loom larger than my own. That
          anxiety, at least, is now put to rest. For he is so utterly fallen that, in comparison
          with him, Curius might seem to be standing erect after his fall. <note n="3"

        <p> I have received several letters from you, which showed me with what eagerness and
          anxiety you desired to know the news. We are bound hard and fast on every side, and are no
          longer making any difficulty as to being slaves, but fearing death and exile as though
          greater evils, though they are in fact much smaller ones. Well, this is the position-one
          unanimously groaned over, but not relieved by a word from anyone. The object, I surmise,
          of the men in power is to leave nothing for anyone to lavish. The only man who opens his
          mouth and openly disapproves is the young Curio. He is loudly cheered, and greeted in the
          forum in the most complimentary manner, and many other tokens of goodwill are bestowed on
          him by the loyalists; while Fufius <note n="2" anchored="true">See Letter XIX, p. 35.
          </note> is pursued with shouts, jeers, and hisses. From such circumstances it is not hope
          but indignation that is increased, for you see the citizens allowed to express their
          sentiments, but debarred from carrying them out with any vigour. And to omit details, the
          upshot is that there is now no hope, I don't say of private persons, but even of the
          magistrates being ever free again. Nevertheless, in spite of this policy of repression,
            <pb n="110"/> conversation, at least in society and at dinner tables, is freer than it
          was. Indignation is beginning to get the better of fear, though that does not prevent a
          universal feeling of despair. For this Campanian law <note n="1" anchored="true">I.e.,
            Caesar's agrarian law, by which some of the Campanian <foreign xml:lang="la">ager
              publicus</foreign> was to be divided. </note> contains a cause imposing an oath to be
          taken by candidates in public meeting, that they will not suggest any tenure of public
          land other than that provided in the Julian laws. All the others take the oath without
          hesitation: Laterensis <note n="2" anchored="true">M. Iuventius <foreign xml:lang="la"

          extraordinary virtue in retiring from his canvass for the tribuneship to avoid the oath.
          But I don't care to write any more about politics. I am dissatisfied with myself, and
          cannot write without the greatest pain. I hold my own position with some dignity,
          considering the general repression, but considering my achievements in the past, with less
          courage than I should like. I am invited by Caesar in a very gentlemanly manner to accept
          a legation, to act as legatus to himself, and even an "open votive legation" is offered
          me. But the latter does not give sufficient security, since it depends too much on the
          scrupulousness of Pulchellus <note n="3" anchored="true">Pulchellus, i.e., P. Clodius

              <foreign xml:lang="la">libera legatio</foreign>, a sinecure without any pretence of
            purpose, sometimes it was <foreign xml:lang="la">voti causa</foreign>, enabling a man to
            fullil some vow he was supposed to have made. It was naturally open to much abuse, and
            Cicero as <foreign xml:lang="la">consul</foreign> had passed a law for limiting it in
            time. Clodius would become tribune on 10 December, and this <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >libera legatio</foreign> would protect Cicero as long as it lasted, but it would not,
            he thinks, last long enough to outstay the tribuneship: if he went as <foreign

          better security and does not prevent my returning when I please. I am retaining the
          latter, but do not think I shall use it. However, nobody knows about it. I don't like
          running away; I am itching to fight. There is great warmth of feeling for me. But I don't
          say anything positive: you will please not to mention it. I am, in fact, very anxious <pb

        <p> I have many causes for anxiety, both from the disturbed state of politics and from the
          personal dangers with which I am threatened. They are very numerous; but nothing gives me
          more annoyance than the manumission of Statius: <note n="1" anchored="true">Statius, a

          know, nor indeed is there so much in the affair as you would think from the talk about it.
          For myself, I am positively incapable of being angry with those I love deeply. I only feel
          vexed, and that to a surprising degree. Other vexations are on really important matters.
          The threats of Clodius and the conflicts before me touch me only slightly. For I think I
          can either confront them with perfect dignity or decline them without any embarrassment.
          You will say, perhaps, "Enough of dignity, like the proverb, 'Enough of the oak' : <note

          and ages of men alike, as the present state of affairs. It is more so, by Hercules, than I
          could have wished, but not more than I had expected. Your <foreign xml:lang="la"

          people was shown as clearly as possible in the theatre and at the shows. For at the

          the actor Diphilus made a pert allusion to Pompey, in the words: <quote>
            <l>By our misfortunes thou art—Great.</l>
          </quote> He was encored countless times. When he delivered the line, <quote>
            <l>The time will come when thou wilt deeply mourn</l>
            <l>That self-same valour,</l>
          </quote> the whole theatre broke out into applause, and so on with the rest. For the
          verses do seem exactly as though they were written by some enemy of Pompey's to hit the
          time. "If neither laws nor customs can control," etc., caused great sensation and loud

          Curio. The latter received an ovation such as used to be given to Pompey when the
          constitution was still intact. Caesar was much annoyed. A despatch is said to have been

            so now. </note> There has been a great hubbub altogether. For my part, I should have
          preferred their doings being silently ignored; but that, I fear, won't be allowed. Men are
          indignant at what nevertheless must, it seems, be put up with. The whole people have
          indeed now one voice, but its strength depends rather on exasperation than anything to
          back it up. Furthermore, our Publius is threatening me: he is hostile, and a storm is
          hanging over my head which should bring you post haste to town. I believe that I am still
          firmly supported by the same phalanx of all loyal or even tolerably loyal men which
          supported me when consul. Pompey displays no common affection for me. He also asserts that
          Clodius is not going to say a word about me. In which he is not deceiving me, but is
          himself deceived. Cosconius having died, I am invited to fill his place. <note n="3"

            refer to some proverbial expression, "to be invited to a place at Pluto's table," or
            some such sentence. Cicero means that his acceptance would be equivalent to political
            extinction, either from the obscurity of Cosconius or the inconsistency of the
            proceeding. </note> That would indeed be a case of "invited to a dead man's place." I
          should have been beneath contempt in the eyes of the world, and nothing could be conceived
          less likely to secure that very "personal safety" of which you speak. For those
          commissioners are disliked by the loyalists, and so I should have retained my own
          unpopularity with the disloyal, with the addition of that attaching to others. Caesar
          wishes me to accept a legateship under him. This is a more honourable method of avoiding
          the danger. But I don't wish to avoid it. What do I want, then? Why, I prefer fighting.
          However, I have not made up my mind. Again I say, Oh that you were here! However, if it is
          absolutely necessary I will summon you. What else is there to say? What else? This, I
          think : I am certain that all is lost. For why mince matters any longer? But I write this

          of your "Amaltheia." About politics I will write briefly: for I am now afraid lest the
          very paper should betray me. Accordingly, in future, if I have anything more to write to
          you, I shall clothe it in covert language. For the present the state is dying of a novel
          disorder for although everybody disapproves of what has been done, complains, and is
          indignant about it, and though there is absolutely no difference of opinion on the
          subject, and people now speak openly and groan aloud, yet no remedy is applied: for we do
          not think resistance possible without a general slaughter, nor see what the end of
          concession is to be except ruin. Bibulus is exalted to the skies as far as admiration and
          affection go. His edicts and speeches are copied out and read. He has reached the summit
          of glory in a novel way. There is now nothing so popular as the dislike of the popular
          party. I have my fears as to how this will end. But if I ever see my way clearly in
          anything, I will write to you more explicitly. For yourself, if you love me as much as I
          am sure you do, take care to be ready to come in all haste as soon as I call for you. But
          I do my best, and shall do so, to make it unnecessary. I said I would call you Furius in
          my letters, but it is not necessary to change your name. I'll call myself Laelius and you
          Atticus, but I will use neither my own hand-writing nor seal, if the letter happens to be
          such as I should not wish to fall into the hands of a stranger. Diodotus is dead; he has
          left me perhaps 1,000 sestertia. Bibulus has postponed the elections to the 18th of
          October, in an edict expressed in the vein of Archilochus. <note n="1" anchored="true"

        <p> Why should I write to you on the Republic in detail? It is utterly ruined; and is, so
          far, in a worse state than when you left it, that then a despotism seemed to be oppressing
          it which was popular with the multitude, and though offensive to the loyalists, yet short
          of actual mischief; but now all on a sudden they have become so universally hated, that I
          tremble to think what will be the end of it. For we have had experience of those men's
          resentment and violence, who have ruined everything in their anger against Cato; yet they
          were employing such slow poisons, that it seemed as though our end might be painless. Now,
          however, I fear they have been exasperated by the hisses of the crowd, the talk of the
          respectable classes, and the murmurs of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>.
          For my part, I was in hopes, as I often used actually to say to you, that the wheel of the
          state chariot had made its revolution with scarcely any noise and leaving scarcely any
          visible rut; and it would have been so, if people could only have waited till the storm
          had blown over. But after sighing in secret for a long time they all began, first to
          groan, and at last to talk and shout. Accordingly, that friend of ours, unaccustomed to
          being unpopular, always used to an atmosphere of praise, and revelling in glory, now
          disfigured in body and broken in spirit, does not know which way to turn; sees that to go
          on is dangerous, to return a betrayal of vacillation; has the loyalists his enemies, the
          disloyal themselves not his friends. Yet see how soft-hearted I am. I could not refrain
          from tears when, on the 25th of July, I saw him making a speech on the edicts of Bibulus.
          The man who in old times had been used to bear himself in that place with the utmost
          confidence and dignity, surrounded by the warmest affection of the people, amidst
          universal favour—how humble, how cast down he was then! How ill-content with himself, to
          say <pb n="117"/> nothing of how unpleasing to his audience! Oh, what a spectacle! No one
          could have liked it but Crassus—no one else in the world! Not I, for considering his
          headlong descent from the stars, he seemed to me have lost his footing rather than to have
          been deliberately following a path; and, as Apelles, if he had seen his Venus, or
          Protogenes his <placeName key="tgn,7011267">Ialysus</placeName> daubed with mud, would, I
          presume, have felt great sorrow, so neither could I behold without great sorrow a man,
          portrayed and embellished with all the colours of my art, suddenly disfigured. Although no
          one thought, in view of the Clodius business, that I was bound to be his friend, yet so
          great was my affection for him, that no amount of injury was capable of making it run dry.
          The result is that those Archilochian edicts of Bibulus against him are so popular, that
          one can't get past the place where they are put up for the crowd of readers, and so deeply
          annoying to him-self that he is pining with vexation. To me, by Hercules, they are
          distressing, both because they give excessive pain to a man whom I have always loved, and
          because I fear lest one so impulsive and so quick to strike, and so unaccustomed to
          personal abuse, may, in his passionate resentment, obey the dictates of indignation and
          anger. I don't know what is to be the end of Bibulus. As things stand at present he is
          enjoying a wonderful reputation. For on his having postponed the comitia to October, as
          that is a measure which is always against the popular feeling, Caesar had imagined that
          the assembly could be induced by a speech of his to go to Bibulus's house; but after a
          long harangue full of seditious suggestions, he failed to extract a word from any-one. In
          short, they feel that they do not possess the cordial goodwill of any section: all the
          more must we fear some act of violence. Clodius is hostile to us. Pompey persists in
          asserting that he will do nothing against me. It is risky for me to believe that, and I am
          preparing myself to meet his attack. I hope to have the warmest feelings of all orders on
          my side. I have personally a longing for you, and circumstances also demand your presence
          at that time. I shall feel it a very great addition to my policy, to my courage, and, in a
          word, to my safety, if I see you in time. Varro does all I can expect. Pompey talks like
          an angel. I have hopes that I shall come off with flying colours, or at any <pb n="118"/>

          yourself, and what settlement you have come to with the Sicyonians. </p>

        <p> How I wished you had stayed at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>! I am sure
          you would have stayed if you had foreseen what was going to happen. For then we should
          have had no difficulty in keeping "Pulchellus" in order, or at least should have known
          what he was going to do. As things are, he darts about, talks like a madman, never sticks
          to anything: threatens now this one and now that: seems likely, in reality, to do whatever
          turns up. When he sees how unpopular the present state of things is, he seems to intend an
          attack upon the authors of it; but when he again recalls their power and armies, he
          transfers his hostility to the loyalists. Me personally he threatens at one time with
          violence, at another with impeachment. With him Pompey has remonstrated, and, as he tells
          me himself—for I have no other evidence—has urgently remonstrated, pointing out that he
          would himself lie under the extreme imputation of perfidy and unprincipled conduct, if any
          danger to me were created by the man whom he had himself armed by acquiescing in his
          becoming a plebeian: that both he and Appius <note n="1" anchored="true">Appius Claudius
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Pulcher</foreign>, elder brother of P. Clodius. </note> had
          pledged themselves in regard to me: if Clodius did not respect that, he should show such
          annoyance that everyone would understand that he valued my friendship above everything.
          Having said this and much else to the same effect, he told me that the fellow at first
          argued against it at great length and for a long time, but eventually gave way and
          declared that he would do nothing against his wishes. Nevertheless, he has not ceased
          since then speaking of me with the greatest bitterness. But even <pb n="119"/> if be had
          not done so, I should have felt no confidence in him, but should have been making every
          preparation, as in fact I am doing. As it is, I am so conducting myself that every day the
          affections of people towards me and the strength of my position are enhanced. I don't
          touch politics in any shape or way; I employ myself with the greatest assiduity in
          pleading causes and in my regular forensic business. <note n="1" anchored="true">The
            speeches known to us of this year are those for his colleague, C. Antonius, A. Thermus,
            and L. Flaccus. The two former are lost, but we know from his own account that he had
            not avoided touching on politics in the speech for Antonius, but had so offended Pompey
            and Caesar that they at once carried out the adoption of Clodius (<foreign xml:lang="la"
              >de Domo</foreign>, § 41). </note> And this I feel is extremely gratifying, not only
          to those who enjoy my services, but also to the people generally. My house is crowded; I
          am met by processions; the memory of my consulship is renewed; men's feelings are clearly
          shown: my hopes are so raised, that the struggle hanging over me seems at times one from
          which I need not shrink. Now is the time that I need your advice, your love and fidelity.
          Wherefore come post haste! Everything will be easy for me if I have you. I can carry on
          many negotiations through our friend Varro, which will be on firmer ground with you to
          back them up; a great deal can be elicited from Publius himself, and be brought to my
          knowledge, which cannot possibly be kept concealed from you; a great deal also—but it is
          absurd to enumerate particulars, when I want you for everything. I would like you to be
          convinced of this above all, that everything will be simplified for me if I see you: but
          it all turns on this coming to pass before he enters on his office. I think that if you
          are here while Crassus is egging on Pompey—as you can get out of Clodius himself, by the
          agency of "Iuno," <note n="2" anchored="true">

            must mean that while Crassus (whom he always regards as hostile to himself) is
            influencing Pompey, he cannot trust what Pompey says, and must look for real information
            elsewhere. </note> how far they are acting in good faith—we shall escape molestation, or
          at any rate not be left under a delusion. You don't stand in need of entreaties or urgency
          from me. You understand what my wish is, and what the hour and the importance of the
          business demand. As to politics, I can tell you nothing except that everybody <pb n="120"
          /> entertains the greatest detestation for those who are masters of everything. There is,
          however, no hope of a change. But, as you easily understand, Pompey himself is
          discontented and extremely dissatisfied with himself. I don't see Clearly what issue to
          expect: but Certainly such a state of affairs seems likely to lead to an outbreak of some
          sort. Alexander's books <note n="1" anchored="true">Alexander of <placeName

        <p> I don¹t think you have ever before read a letter of mine not written by my own hand. You
          will be able to gather from that how I am distracted with business. For as I had not a
          moment to spare and was obliged to take a walk in order to refresh my poor voice, I have
          dictated this while walking. The first thing, then, which I wish you to know is that our
          friend "Sampsiceramus² is exceedingly dissatisfied with his position, and desires to be
          restored to the place from which he has fallen; that he confides his annoyance to me, and
          is without disguise seeking for a remedy—which I don't think can be found. The second
          thing is that all on that side, whether promoters or mere hangers-on, are falling out of
          fashion, though no one opposes them: there never was a greater unanimity of feeling or
          talk everywhere. For myself (for I am sure you wish to know it) I take part in no
          political deliberations, and have devoted myself entirely to my forensic business and
          work. Thereby, as may easily be understood, I have frequent occasion to refer to my past
          achievements and to express my regret. But the brother of <pb n="121"/> our "Iuno" is
          giving utterance to all kinds of alarming threats, and, while disclaiming them to
          "Sampsiceramus," makes an open avowal and parade of them to others. Wherefore, loving me
          as much as I know you do, if you are asleep, wake up; if you are standing, start walking;
          if you are walking, set off running; if you are running, take wings and fly. You can
          scarcely believe how much I confide in your advice and wisdom, and above all in your
          affection and fidelity. The importance of the interests involved perhaps demands a long
          disquisition, but the close union of our hearts is contented with brevity. It is of very
          great importance to me that, if you can't be at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"

        </opener>
        <p> In the letter which I delivered to Numestius I begged you to come back, in the most
          urgent and vehement terms it was possible to use. To the speed which I then enjoined even
          add something if you possibly can. And yet do not be agitated, for I know you well, and am
          not ignorant of "how love is all compact of thought and fear." But the matter, I hope, is
          going to be less formidable in the end than it was at its beginning. That fellow Vettius,
          our old informer, promised Caesar, as far as I can make out, that he would secure young
          Curio being brought under some suspicion of guilt. Accordingly, he wormed his way into
          intimacy with the young man, and having, as is proved, often met him, at last went the
          length of telling him that he had resolved by the help of his slaves to make an attack
          upon Pompey and <pb n="122"/> assassinate him. Curio reported this to his father, the
          latter to Pompey. The matter was reported to the senate. Vettius, on being brought in, at
          first denied that he had ever had any appointment with Curio. However, he did not long
          stick to that, but immediately Claimed the protection of the state as giving information.
          There was a shout of "no" to this <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">reclamatum est.</foreign> The MSS. have <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >haud reclamatum est</foreign>, "it was not refused." </note> but he went on to state
          that there had been a confederacy of young men under the leadership of Curio, to which
          Paullus had at first belonged, and Q. Caepio (I mean Brutus <note n="2" anchored="true"
            >Marcus Iunius <foreign xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign>, the future assassin of Caesar,
            adopted by his uncle, Q. Servilius Caepio. The father of Lentulus was <foreign
              xml:lang="la">flamen Martialis</foreign> (L. Lentulus), <bibl n="Cic. Vat. 25">in Vat.
              § 25</bibl>. Paullus is L. Aemilius Paullus, <foreign xml:lang="la">consul</foreign>
            <date when="-0050">B.C. 50</date>. </note> ) and Lentulus, son of the flamen, with the
          privity of his father: that afterwards C. Septimius, secretary to Bibulus, had brought him
          a dagger from Bibulus. That made the whole thing ridiculous, as though Vettius would have
          been at a loss for a dagger unless the consul had given him one; and it was all the more
          scouted because on the 5th of May Bibulus had told Pompey to be on his guard against
          plots; on which occasion Pompey had thanked him. Young Curio, being brought into the
          senate, spoke in answer to the allegations of Vettius; and on this particular occasion the
          strongest thing against Vettius was his having said that the plan of the young men was to
          attack Pompey in the forum, with the help of Gabinius's gladiators, <note n="3"
            anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Cum gladiatoribus</foreign>. Others omit <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >cum</foreign>, in which case the meaning will be "at the gladiatorial shows of
            Gabinius." As some date is wanted, this is probably right. </note> and that in this the
          ring-leader was Paullus, who was ascertained to have been in <placeName key="tgn,7006667"
            >Macedonia</placeName> at that time. A decree of the senate is passed that " Vettius,
          having confessed to having 'worn a dagger,' <note n="4" anchored="true">Under the <foreign
              xml:lang="la">lex de sicariis</foreign> of <foreign xml:lang="la">Sulla</foreign>
            carrying a weapon with felonious intent was a capital crime, for which a man was tried
              <foreign xml:lang="la">inter sicarios</foreign>. See 2 Phil. §§ 8, 74. </note> should
          be cast into prison; that anyone releasing him would be guilty of treason to the state."
          The opinion generally held is that the whole affair had been arranged. Vettius was to be
          caught in the forum with a dagger, and his slaves also with weapons, and he was then to
          offer to lay an information; and <pb n="123"/> this would have been carried out, had not
          the Curios given Pompey previous information. Presently the decree of the senate was read
          in public assembly. Next day, however, Caesar—the man who formerly as praetor had bidden
          Q. Catulus <note n="1" anchored="true">Q. Lutatius Catulus, who died in the previous year,
              <date when="-0060">B.C. 60</date>, had been a keen opponent of Caesar, who tried to
            deprive him of the honour of dedicating the restored Capitoline temple, and beat him in
            the election of Pontifex Maximus. </note> speak on the ground below—now brought Vettius
          on to the rostra, and placed him on an elevation to which Bibulus, though consul, was
          prevented from aspiring. Here that fellow said exactly what he chose about public affairs,
          and, having come there primed and instructed, first struck Caepio's name out of his
          speech, though he had named him most emphatically in the senate, so that it was easy to
          see that a night and a nocturnal intercession <note n="2" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Servilia</foreign>, mother of <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Brutus</foreign>, was reported to be Caesar's mistress. As Cicero is insinuating that
            the whole affair was got up by Caesar to irritate Pompey with the <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >boni</foreign>, this allusion will be understood. </note> had intervened: next he
          named certain men on whom he had not cast even the slightest suspicion in the senate: L.
          Lucullus, by whom he said that C. Fannius was usually sent to him—the man who on a former
          occasion had backed a prosecution of Clodius; L. Domitius, whose house had been agreed on
          as the headquarters of the Conspirators. Me he did not name, but he said that "an eloquent
          consular, who lived near the consul, had said to him that there was need of some Servilius
          Ahala or Brutus being found." <note n="3" anchored="true">If Vettius did say this, he at
            any rate successfully imitated Cicero's manner. These names are always in his mouth. See
            2 Phil. §§ 26, 87 ; <foreign xml:lang="la">pro</foreign> Mil. §§ 8, 82, etc. For a
            farther discussion of Vettius, see Appendix B. </note> He added at the very end, on
          being recalled by Vatinius after the assembly had been dismissed, that he had been told by
          Curio that my son-in-law Piso was privy to these proceedings, as M. Laterensis also. At
          present Vettius is on trial for "violence" before Crassus Dives, <note n="4"
            anchored="true">Probably a praetor, not the triumvir. </note> and when condemned he
          intends to claim the impunity of an informer; and if he obtains that, there seem likely to
          be some prosecutions. I don't despise the danger, for I never despise any danger, but
          neither do I much fear it. People indeed show very great affection for me, but I am quite
          tired of life: such <pb n="124"/> a scene of misery is it all. It was only the other day
          that we were fearing a massacre, which the speech of that gallant old man Q. Considius
          prevented : <note n="1" anchored="true">Q Considius Gallus, who, according to Plutarch
              (<bibl n="Plut. Caes. 13">Plut. Caes. 13</bibl>), said in the senate that the
            attendance of senators was small because they feared a massacre. "What made you come,
            then?" said Caesar. "My age," he replied ; " I have little left to lose." </note> now
          this one, which we might have feared any day, has suddenly turned up. In short, nothing
          can be more unfortunate than I, or more fortunate than Catulus, both in the splendour of
          his life and in the time of his death. However, in the midst of these miseries I keep my
          spirit erect and undismayed, and maintain my position in a most dignified manner and with
          great caution. Pompey bids me have no anxiety about Clodius, and shows the most cordial
          goodwill to me in everything he says. I desire to have you to suggest my policy, to be the
          partner in my anxieties, and to share my every thought. Therefore I have commissioned
          Numestius to urge you, and I now entreat you with the same or, if possible, greater
          earnestness, to literally fly to us. I shall breathe again when I once see you. </p>

              L. Piso, A. Gabinius: LETTERS IN EXILE</note>We have no record in Cicero's
            correspondence of the final measures taken by Clodius against him. We find him when the
            correspondence for this year opens on his way to exile: all his boasts of staying and
            fighting have been thrown to the winds. Clodius, indeed, had not simply done what Cicero
            expected at the worst—impeached him. He had gone more systematically to work. Among
            other measures calculated to win popularity, he proposed a modification of the <foreign
              xml:lang="la">lex Aelia Fufia</foreign>, declaring it illegal for a magistrate to stop
            legislative comitia by "watching the sky." Thus freed from one hindrance, he next
            proposed and carried a law for the prosecution of any magistrate who had put a citizen
            to death without trial (<foreign xml:lang="la">qui indemnatos cives
            necavisset</foreign>). Cicero at once recognized his danger : if the people voted this
            law, a jury could scarcely fail to condemn. The triumvirs would do nothing. Pompey,
            after all his promises, avoided seeing Cicero as much as possible : Caesar offered him a
              <foreign xml:lang="la">legatio</foreign> again; and though he spoke against giving the
            law a retrospective effect, he could not consistently object to the law itself, and
            showed no sign of desiring to shelter Cicero, except on his consenting to leave
              <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. Cicero then adopted the course which
            was open to all citizens threatened with a prosecution—that of going away from Rome—and
            started apparently with the view of going to <placeName key="tgn,7005729"
              >Malta</placeName>. Whether it was wise or not, Cicero afterwards lamented having
            taken this course, and thought that he had better have braved the danger and stood his
            trial. It at any rate facilitated the next move of Clodius, who proposed and carried a
            bill forbidding Cicero "fire and water " within 500 (afterwards reduced to 400) miles of
              <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, and confiscating his property.
            Accordingly, Cicero had to go much farther than he had intended. He crossed from
              <placeName key="tgn,7004094">Brundisium</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7010750"
              >Dyrrachium</placeName>, and proceeded along the <foreign xml:lang="la">via
              Egnatia</foreign> to its terminus at <placeName key="tgn,7011182"
              >Thessalonica</placeName>, where he spent the autumn, <date when="-0058">B.C.
              58</date>. In November, <date when="-0058">B.C. 58</date>, he returned to <placeName
              key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrachium</placeName>, ready for the recall which he heard was
            imminent. Meanwhile his town house was destroyed, its site made a <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >templum</foreign>, and a statue of Liberty set up in it, and his villas at <placeName
              key="perseus,Tusculum">Tusculum</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Antium"
              >Antium</placeName> dismantled. The dangers of his position are not exaggerated in his
            letters, and may account for much of their melancholy tone. He had lost the protection
            of the laws, and any one of his many enemies meeting him might have killed him with
            practical impunity. He seems to have left <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>

          when I read the bill, then, indeed, I understood that there could be nothing more

        <p> I ARRIVED at <placeName key="tgn,7004094">Brundisium</placeName> on the 17th of April.
          On that day your slaves delivered me your letter, and some other slaves, on the next day
          but one, brought me another. As to your invitation and advice to stay at your house in
            <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName>, your kindness is most gratifying, and
          far from being a novelty. It is a plan that would have exactly suited my wishes, if I
          might have spent all my time there: for I loathe a crowd of visitors, I can scarcely bear
          the light, and that solitude, especially in a spot so familiar, would have been the
          reverse of disagreeable. But to put up there as a mere stage in my journey! In the first
          place it is far out of my way, and in the next it is only four days from Autronius and the
          rest, and in the third place you are not there. Had I been going to reside permanently, a
          fortified castle would have been an advantage, but to one only passing through it is
          unnecessary. Why, if I had not been afraid, I should have made for <placeName

          you Carry one point—that I should not lay violent hands upon myself: the other you cannot
          bring to pass—that I should not regret my policy and my continuance in life. For what is
          there to attach me to it, especially if the hope which accompanied me on my departure is
          nonexistent? I will not attempt to enumerate all the miseries into which I have fallen
          through the extreme injustice and unprincipled conduct, not so much of my enemies, as of
          those who were jealous of me, because I do not wish to stir up a fresh burst of grief in
          myself, or invite you to share the same sorrow. I say this deliberately—that no one was
          ever afflicted with so heavy a calamity, that no one had ever greater cause to wish for
          death; while I have let slip the time when I might have sought it most creditably.
          Henceforth death can never heal, it can only end my sorrow. <note n="1" anchored="true">"I
            have lost my chance of dying with honour ; henceforth death may end my grief, but cannot

          circumstances that you think may inspire me with a hope of a change: and though they are
          insignificant, yet, since you will have it so, let us have patience. In spite of what you
          say, you will catch us up if you make haste. For I will either come into <placeName

          distresses. I would indeed have written to you oftener, and at greater length, had it not
          been that sorrow, while it has affected all parts of my intellect, has above all entirely

        <p>I wrote to you at <placeName key="tgn,7004094">Brundisium</placeName>, when on the point
          of starting, the reasons for my not going to <placeName key="tgn,7002705"
            >Epirus</placeName>: namely, the proximity of <placeName key="tgn,7002733"
            >Achaia</placeName>, which was full of enemies of the most unscrupulous character, and
          secondly, the difficulty of leaving it when I wished to resume my journey. Added to this,
          while I was at <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrachium</placeName> two messages reached
          me: the first, that my brother was coming from <placeName key="tgn,7002499"
            >Ephesus</placeName> to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> by ship; the
          second, that he was coming through <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> by
          land. Accordingly, I sent a message to meet him at <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
            >Athens</placeName>, telling him to come thence to <placeName key="tgn,7011182"
            >Thessalonica</placeName>. I myself continued my journey, and arrived at <placeName
            key="tgn,7011182">Thessalonica</placeName> on the 23rd of May, but have no certain
          intelligence about his journey except that he had left <placeName key="tgn,7002499"
            >Ephesus</placeName> some time ago. At present I am feeling very nervous as to what
          steps are being taken at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. Although you say
          in one of your letters, dated the 15th of May, that you hear that he will be vigorously
          prosecuted, in another you say that things are calming down. But then the latter is dated
          a day before the former; which makes me all the more anxious. So while my own personal
          sorrow is every day tearing my heart and wearing out my strength, this additional anxiety
          indeed scarcely leaves me any life at all. However, the voyage itself was very difficult,
          and he perhaps, being uncertain where I was, has taken some other course. For my freedman
          Phaetho saw nothing of him. Phaetho was driven by the wind from <placeName

            >Macedonia</placeName>, and met me at <placeName key="perseus,Pella">Pella</placeName>.
          How formidable other circumstances are I am fully aware, and I don't know what to say to
          you. I fear everything, nor is there any misery which would not seem possible in my
          present unfortunate position. Miserable as I still am in the midst of my heavy trials and
          sorrows, now that this anxiety <pb n="146"/> is added to them, I remain at <placeName
            key="tgn,7011182">Thessalonica</placeName> in a state of suspense without venturing upon
          any step whatever. <milestone unit="para"/>Now to answer you. I have not seen Caecilius
          Trypho. I comprehend from your letter what you and Pompey have been saying. That any
          movement in politics is impending I Cannot see as Clearly as you either see, or perhaps
          only suggest for my Consolation. For, as the Case of Tigranes was passed over, all hope of
          a rupture is at an end. <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Tigranes</foreign>, a son of the king of <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Armenia</foreign>, was brought to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> by
            Pompey to adorn his triumph, and put under the care of Lucius Flavius. This prince was,
            for a bribe, released by Clodius by a trick, and the attempt to get him away led to a
            scuffle in which lives were lost. Pompey regarded this as a slight upon himself, and his
            partisan, the <foreign xml:lang="la">consul</foreign> Gabinius, attempted to prevent it.
            But both were hustled in the forum and treated with insults. The hope of a breach in the
            triumvirate arose from the supposition that Clodius had the support of Caesar in his
            high-handed proceeding (<bibl n="TLG385.1 38.30">Dio, 38.30</bibl>; <bibl
              n="Plut. Pomp. 48">Plut. Pomp. 48</bibl>; Ascon. 47). </note> You bid me thank Varro:

          till the <foreign xml:lang="la">acta</foreign>

          month of May reach me, I think I shall do as you suggest. But where to stay? I have not
          yet come to any decision. And indeed my mind is so uneasy about Quintus, that I can
          determine on nothing. However, I will let you know immediately. From the incoherent nature
          of my letters I think you will understand the agitation of my mind, caused not so much by
          my misery, though I have been overwhelmed by an in-credible and unparalleled calamity, as
          by the recollection of my blunder. For by whose unprincipled advice I was egged on and
          betrayed you certainly now perceive, <note n="4" anchored="true">The next letter shows
            that he means Hortensius. The blunder which he Complains of having committed, by the

          had perceived it before, and had not given your whole mind to lamentation along with me!
          Wherefore, when you are told that I am prostrate and unmanned with grief, consider that I
          am more distressed at my own folly than at the result of it, in having believed a man whom
          I did not think to be treacherous. My writing is impeded both by the <pb n="147"/>

        <p> My brother Quintus having quitted <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> before
          the 1st of May, and arrived at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> on the
          15th, he would have to make great haste to prevent proceedings being commenced against him
          in his absence, supposing there to be some one who was not content with the misfortunes we
          have already sustained. Accordingly, I preferred that he should hurry on to <placeName
            key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> rather than come to me; and at the same time—for I
          will tell you the truth, and it will give you a notion of the extent of my wretchedness—I
          could not make up my mind to see him, devotedly attached to me as he is, and a man of most
          tender feelings, or to obtrude upon him my miseries and ruin in all their wretchedness, or
          to endure their being seen by him. And I was besides afraid of what certainly would have
          happened—that he would not have had the resolution to leave me. I had ever before my eyes
          the time when he would either have to dismiss his lictors,' or be violently torn from my
          arms. The prospect of this bitter pain I have avoided by the other bitter pain of not
          seeing my brother. It is all you, who advised me to continue living, that have forced me
          into this distressful position. Accordingly, I am paying the penalty of my error. However,
          I am sustained by your letter, from which I easily perceive how high your own hopes are.
          This did give me some consolation, but only, after all, till you passed from the mention
          of Pompey Because, though a provincial governor retained his lictors till he reached
            <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, he was bound to go straight home or
          dismiss them. <pb n="148"/> to the passage beginning "Now try and win over Hortensius and
          men of that sort." In heaven's name, my dear Pomponius, don't you yet perceive by whose
          means, by whose treachery, by whose dishonest advice, I have been ruined? But all this I
          will discuss with you when we meet. I will only say this much, which I think you know: it
          is not my enemies, but my jealous rivals, that have ruined me. Now, however, if things are
          really as you hope, I will keep up my spirits, and will rely upon the hope on which you
          bid me rely. But if, as I myself think, this proves illusory, what I was not allowed to do
          at the best time shall be done at a worse. <note n="1" anchored="true">I.e., suicide.
          </note> Terentia often expresses her gratitude to you. For myself one of my miseries also
          consists in fear—the business of my unhappy brother. If I could only know how it stands, I
          should know what I ought to do. Personally, the hope of the advantages and of the letters
          you mention keeps me still, as you advise, at <placeName key="tgn,7011182"
            >Thessalonica</placeName>. If I get any news, I shall know what I ought to do about the

        <p> The public transactions up to the 25th of May I have learnt from your letter. I am
          waiting for the rest, as you advised, at <placeName key="tgn,7011182"
            >Thessalonica</placeName>; and when they arrive I shall be better able to decide where
          to be. For if there is any reason, if any <pb n="153"/> action is being taken, if I shall
          see any hopes, I shall either wait in the same place or go to your house; but if, as you
          say, these hopes have vanished into air, I shall look out for something else. At present
          you do not give me any indication except the disagreement of those friends of yours,
          which, however, arises between them on every kind of subject rather than myself. Therefore
          I don't see what good it is to me. However, as long as you all will have me hope, I shall
          obey you. For as to your scoldings so frequent and so severe, and your saying that I am
          faint-hearted, I would ask you what misery is there so heavy as not to be included in my
          disfranchisement? Did anyone ever fall from such a high position, in so good a cause, with
          such endowments of genius, wisdom and popularity, with such powerful supports from all
          loyalists? Can I forget what I was, and not feel what I am? Of what honour, of what glory,
          of what children, of what means, of what a brother I am deprived? This last, indeed, to
          draw your attention to a new kind of disaster—though I valued him, and always had done so,
          more than myself—I have avoided seeing, lest I should behold his grief and mourning, or
          lest I-whom he had left in the highest prosperity-should obtrude myself upon him in a
          state of ruin and humiliation. I pass over the other particulars that are past bearing:
          for I am prevented by my tears. And here, let me ask, am I to be blamed for my grief, or
          for the unfortunate mistake of not retaining these advantages (and I could easily have
          done so, had not a plot for my destruction been hatched within my own walls), or at least
          of not losing them without losing my life at the same time? My purpose in writing these
          words is that you should rather console me, as you do, than think me deserving of
          correction or chiding; and the reason of the comparative brevity of my letters is, in the
          first place, that I am hindered by outbursts of sorrow, and, in the second place, that I
          have news to expect from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> rather than any to
          communicate myself. But when that news arrives I will let you know my plans. Pray, as you

        <p> WELL, you argue earnestly as to what hope is to be entertained, and especially through
          the action of the senate, and yet you mention that the clause of the bill is being posted
          up, in virtue of which the subject is forbidden to be <pb n="155"/> mentioned in the
          senate. Accordingly, not a word is said about it. In these circumstances you find fault
          with me for distressing myself, when the fact is I am already more distressed than anybody
          ever was, as you know very well. You hold out hope as a consequence of the elections. What
          hope can there be with the same man tribune, and a consul-designate who is my enemy? <note
            n="1" anchored="true">Clodius was not re-elected, and Q. Caecilius Metellus <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Nepos</foreign>, who had as tribune (<date when="-0063">B.C.
            63</date>-62) been hostile to Cicero, now as <foreign xml:lang="la">consul</foreign>
            supported Pompey in befriending Cicero. </note> But you have dealt me a blow in what you
          say about my speech having got abroad. <note n="2" anchored="true">The speech in the
            senate <foreign xml:lang="la">in Curionem et Clodium</foreign>, i.e.., against the elder
            C. Curio, who had been Clodius's advocate in <date when="-0061">B.C. 61</date> on the
            charge <foreign xml:lang="la">de incesto</foreign>. Fragments only of it are preserved.
            They are sufficiently violent. Cicero suggests repudiating the authorship, because the
            speech had never been delivered, and therefore was not necessarily intended for
            publication. There is no special reason for abusing Cicero's character on this account.
            If some enemy had got hold of the MS. and published it without his consent, it was not
            really the expression of his deliberate sentiments. </note> Pray do your best to heal
          that wound, as you express it. I did indeed write one some time ago, in a fit of anger at
          what he had first composed against me; but I had taken such pains to suppress it, that I
          thought it would never get into circulation. How it has leaked out I cannot think. But
          since the occasion never arose for my having a word of dispute with him, and since it
          appears to me to be more carelessly written than my other speeches, I think it might be
          maintained not to be by me. Pray look after this if you think I can do anything to remedy
          the mischief; but if my ruin is inevitable, I don't so much care about it. I am still
          lying idle in the same place, without conversation, without being able to think. Though,
          as you say, I have "intimated" to you my desire that you should come to me, yet it is now
          clear to me <note n="3" anchored="true">Reading <foreign xml:lang="la">nunc tamen

        <p> From your letter I am full of anxiety to hear what Pompey's view is of my Case, or what
          he professes to be his view. The elections, I presume, are over; and when they were over
          you say that he was of opinion that my Case should be mooted. If I seem foolish to you for
          entertaining hopes, it is at your bidding that I do so: yet I know that you have in your
          letters been usually inclined rather to Check me and my hopes. Now pray write distinctly
          what your view is. I know that I have fallen into this distress from numerous errors of my
          own. If certain accidents have in any degree corrected those errors, I shall be less sorry
          that I preserved my life then and am still living. Owing to the constant traffic along the

          removed from Thessalonica. But now I am being forced away, not by Plancius—for he, indeed,
          wishes to keep me here—but by the nature of the place, which is not at all calculated for
          the residence of a disfranchised man in such a state of sorrow. I have not gone to
            <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName>, as I had said I would, because all of a

        <p> As to my having written you word that I meant to go to <placeName key="tgn,7002705"
            >Epirus</placeName>, I changed my plan when I saw that my hope was vanishing and fading
          away, and did not remove from <placeName key="tgn,7011182">Thessalonica</placeName>. I
          resolved to remain there until I heard from you on the subject mentioned in your last
          letter, namely, that there was going to be some motion made in the senate on my case
          immediately after the elections, and that Pompey had told you so. Wherefore, as the
          elections are over and I have no letter from you, I shall consider it as though you had
          written to say that nothing has come of it, and I shall not feel annoyed at having been
          buoyed up by a hope which did not keep me long in suspense. But the movement, which you
          said in your letter that you foresaw as likely to be to my advantage, people arriving here
          tell me will not occur. <note n="1" anchored="true">The probable split among the

          tribunes-designate: and if I wait to see how that turns out, you will have no reason to
          think of me as having been wanting to my own cause or the wishes of my friends. As to your
          constantly finding fault with me for being so overwhelmed by my misfortune, you ought to
          pardon me when you see that I have sustained a more crushing blow than anyone you have
          ever seen or heard of. As to your saying that you are told that my intellect in even
          affected by grief, that is not so; my intellect is quite sound. Oh that it had been as
          much so in the hour of danger! when I found those, to whom I thought my safety was the
          dearest object of their life, most bitterly and unfeelingly hostile: who, when they saw
          that I had somewhat lost my balance from fear, left nothing undone which malice and

        <p> ON the 13th of August I received four letters from you: one in which you urge me in a
          tone of reproof to be less weak; a second, in which you say that Crassus's freedman has
          told you about my anxiety and leanness; a third, in which you describe the proceedings in
          the senate; a fourth on the subject of Varro's assurances to you as to the friendly
          feelings of Pompey. To the first my answer is this: though I do grieve, yet I keep all my
          mental faculties, and it is precisely that which vexes me—I have no opportunity and no one
          with whom to employ so sound an intellect. For if you cannot find yourself separated from
          one individual like myself without sorrow, what do you think must be my case, who am
          deprived both of you and of everyone else? And if you, while still in possession of all
          your rights, miss me, to what an extent do you think those rights are missed by me? I will
          not enumerate the things of which I have been despoiled, not only because you are not
          ignorant of them, but also lest I should reopen my own sorrow. I only assert this, that
          never did anyone in an unofficial position possess such great advantages, or fall into
          such great miseries. Moreover, lapse of time not only does not soften this grief, it even
          enhances it. For other sorrows are softened by age, this one cannot but be daily increased
          both by my sense of present misery and the recollection of my past life. For it is not
          only property or friends that I miss, but myself. For what am I? But I will not allow
          myself either to wring your soul with my complaints, or to place my hands too often on my
          wounds. For as to your defence of those whom I said had been jealous of me, and among them
          Cato, I indeed think that lie was so far removed from that crime, that I am above all
          things sorry that the pretended zeal of others had more influence with me than his
          honesty. As for your excuses <pb n="161"/> for the others, they ought to be excused in my
          eyes if they are so in yours. But all this is an old story now. Crassus's freedman, I
          think, spoke without any real sincerity. In the senate you say that the debate was
          satisfactory. But what about Curio? Hasn't he read that speech? I can't make out how it
          got into circulation ! But Axius, in describing the proceedings of the same day, does not
          speak so highly of Curio. <note n="1" anchored="true">Or, as Prof. Tyrrell suggests, "does
            not quote Curio to that effect , I think, however, that Cicero does not use <foreign
              xml:lang="la">laudo</foreign> in this sense except in connexion with <foreign
              xml:lang="la">auctorem</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="la">auctores</foreign>, and even
            then generally with a sub-sense, at least, of commendation The speech was composed to be
            delivered against the elder Curio and Clodius (see p 155) but was never delivered. Its
            personal tone made it dangerous now. </note> But he may be omitting something; I know
          you have certainly not written anything except what actually occurred. Varro's talk gives
          me some hope of Caesar, and would that Varro himself would throw himself into the cause!
          Which he certainly will do both of his own accord and under pressure from you For myself
          if fortune ever grants me the enjoyment of you all and of my country I will at least take
          care that you shall above all the rest of my friends, have cause to be glad and I will so
          discharge all the duties of affection and friendship, which (to confess the truth) have
          not heretofore been conspicuous that you shall regard me as restored to yourself as much
          as to my brother and my children. If I have in any way sinned in my con duct to you, or
          rather since I have done so pardon me For I have sinned more grievously against myself.
          And I do not write this to you because I know you not to feel deeply for my misfortune:
          but certainly if it had been a matter of obligation with you, and had always been so, to
          love me as much as you do and have done, you would never have allowed me to lack that
          judgment with which you are so well supplied, <note n="2" anchored="true">Cicero means
            that <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign> acted with the emotion spontaneously

            a thing which he was under some obligation to do. </note> nor would you have allowed me
          to be persuaded that the passing of the bill for the "colleges" was to our advantage.

          you of days and nights in thinking out the Course I ought to have pursued—that was
          omitted, owing to my own culpable imprudence, not yours. Now if, I don't say you only, but

          living today triumphant. In this you must forgive me. For I find much greater fault with
          myself, and only call you in question afterwards, as at once my second self and the sharer
          in my error; and, besides, if I am ever restored, our mistake will seem still less in my
          eyes, and to you at least I shall be endeared by your own kindness, since there is none on
          my side. <note n="2" anchored="true">The kindness has been all on the side of <foreign

            it—for the benefactor loves more than the benefited. </note> There is something in the
          suggestion you mentioned as having been made in your conversation with Culleo as to a
            <foreign xml:lang="la">privilegium</foreign>, <note n="3" anchored="true">A <foreign
              xml:lang="la">privilegium</foreign> was a law referring to a particular person, which
            was forbidden by the twelve tables, and if it was shown to be unconstitutional a decree
            of the senate could declare it void. But Cicero seems to think that such a proceeding of
            the senate would give a possibility of raising the question afresh. </note> but by far
          the better course is to have the law repealed. For if no one vetoes it, what course can be
          safer? But if anyone is found to prohibit its passing, he will be equally able to veto a
          decree of the senate. Nor is there need for the repeal of anything else. For the previous
          law did not touch me: and if, on its publication, I had chosen to speak in its favour, or
          to ignore it, as it ought to have been ignored, it could not have done me any harm at all.
            <note n="4" anchored="true">The first bill named no one, but enacted that "anyone who
            had put a citizen to death uncondemned should be forbidden fire and water." The second,
            "that M. Tullius be forbidden fire and water." Cicero says that the former did not touch
            him, I suppose, because it could not be retrospective. This is in accordance with the
            view of Caesar, who approved of the law, but said that old sores ought not to be ripped
              up—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ou) mh\n kai\ prosh/kein e)pi\ parelhluqo/si toiou=to/n

          </note> It was at this point <pb n="163"/> first that my judgment failed to assist me,
          nay, even did me harm. Blind, blind, I say, was I in laying aside my senator's toga, and
          in entreating the people; it was a fatal step to take before some attack had been begun

          the purpose of advising you, if any action is to be taken, not to touch that law, in which
          there are many provisions in the interests of the people. But it is foolish for me to be
          laying down rules as to what you are to do and how. I only wish that something may be
          done! And it is on that point that your letter displays much reserve: I presume, to
          prevent my being too much agitated by despair. For what action do you see possible to be
          taken, or in what way? Through the senate? But you yourself told me that Clodius had fixed
          upon the doorpost of the senate-house a certain clause in the law, "that it might neither
          be put to the house nor mentioned." <note n="2" anchored="true">Letter LXVIII, p. '54.

          came it about also that Clodius held his tongue, when those you mention in your letter
          both spoke on the subject and demanded that a motion should be brought in? But if you go
          to the people—can it be carried except with the unanimous approval of the tribunes? What
          about my property? What about my house? Will it be possible to have it restored? Or, if
          that cannot, how can I be? Unless you see these difficulties on the way to be solved, what
          is the hope to which you invite me? But if, again, there is no hope, what sort of life is
          there for me? So I await at <placeName key="tgn,7011182">Thessalonica</placeName> the
          gazette of the proceedings of the 1st of August, in accordance with which I shall decide
          whether to take refuge on your estate, in order at once to avoid seeing people I don't
          want to see, to see you, according to your letter, and to be nearer at hand in case of any
          motion being made (and this I understand is in <pb n="164"/> accordance with your view and
          that of my brother Quintus), or to depart for <placeName key="perseus,Cyzicus"
            >Cyzicus</placeName>. Now, my dear Pomponius, since you imparted to me none of your
          wisdom in time to save me, either because you had made up your mind that I had judgment
          enough of my own, or that you owed me nothing beyond being by my side; and since,
          betrayed, beguiled, and hurried into a snare as I was, I neglected all my defences,
          abandoned and left <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, which was everywhere on
          the <foreign xml:lang="fr">qui vive</foreign> to defend me, and surrendered myself and
          mine into the hands of enemies while you looked on and said nothing, though, even if you
          were not my superior in mental power, you were at least in less of a fright: now, if you
          can, raise the fallen, and in that way assist me But if every avenue is barred, take care
          that I know that also, and cease at length either to scold me or to offer your
          kindly-meant consolations. If I had meant to impeach your good faith, I should not have
          chosen your roof, of all others, to which to trust myself: it is my own folly that I blame
          for having thought that your love for me was exactly what I could have wished it to be :
            <note n="1" anchored="true">Though Cicero uses <foreign xml:lang="la">tantum ...
              quantum</foreign> here, he does not mean that <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign>
            failed to love him enough—that would have been too unreasonable. in a certain way he
            means that he loved him too much. He allowed his spontaneous feelings full vent, without
            acting with the cool wisdom which he would have shewn in fulfilling a duty or moral
            obligation. It is more fully expressed above. Still, it was a difficult thing to say,
            and he doesn't succeed in making it verv clear. </note> for if that had been so, you
          would have displayed the same good faith, but greater circumspection; at least, you would
          have held me back when plunging headlong into ruin, and would not have had to encounter
          the labours which you are now enduring in saving the wrecks of my fortunes. Wherefore do
          be careful to look into, examine thoroughly, and write fully everything that occurs, and
          resolve (as I am sure you do) that I shall be some one, since I cannot now be the man I
          was and the man I might have been ; and lastly, believe that in this letter it is not you,
          but myself that I have accused. If there are any people to whom you think that letters
          ought to be delivered in my name, pray compose them and see them delivered. <milestone

        <p>News of my brother Quintus of an invariably gloomy nature reached me from the 3rd of June
          up to the 29th of August. On that day, however, Livineius, a freedman of Lucius Regulus,

        <p> YOU raised no little flutter in my mind when you said in your letter that Varro had
          assured you as a friend that Pompey would certainly take up my case, and that as soon as
          he had received a letter from Caesar, which he was expecting, he would even name some one
          to formally carry out the business. Was that all mere talk, or was the letter from Caesar
          hostile? Is there some ground for hope? You mentioned, too, that <pb n="167"/> Pompey had
          also used the expression "after the elections." Pray, as you can conceive the severity of
          the troubles by which I am prostrated, and as you must think it natural to your kindness
          to do so, inform me fully as to the whole state of my case. For my brother Quintus, dear
          good fellow, who is so much attached to me, fills his letters with hopeful expressions,
          fearing, I suppose, my entirely losing heart. Whereas your letters vary in tone; for you

        <p> As long as my letters from you all continued to be of such a nature as to keep
          expectation alive, I was bound to <placeName key="tgn,7011182">Thessalonica</placeName> by
          hope and eager longing: afterwards, when all political measures for this year appeared to
          me to be over, I yet determined not to go to <placeName key="tgn,1000004"
          >Asia</placeName>, both because a crowd of people is disagreeable to me, and because, in
          case any movement was set on foot by the new magistrates, I was unwilling to be far off.
          Accordingly, I resolved to go to your house in <placeName key="tgn,7002705"
            >Epirus</placeName>, not because the natural features of the country mattered to me,
          shunning as I do the light of day altogether, but because it will be most grateful to my
          feelings to set out fr?m a harbour of yours to my restoration; and, if that restoration is
          denied me, there is no place where I shall with greater ease either support this most
          wretched existence or (which is much better) rid myself of it. I shall be in a small
          society : I shall shake off the crowd. Your letters have never raised me to such a pitch
          of hope as those of others; and yet my hopes have always been less warm than your letters.
          Nevertheless, since a beginning has been made in the case, of whatever sort and from
          whatever motive, I will not disappoint the sad and touching entreaties of my best and only
            <pb n="168"/> brother, nor the promises of Sestius and others, nor the hopes of my most

          restoration or to that other alternative mentioned above. I beg and entreat of you, Titus
          Pomponius, as you see that I have been despoiled by the treachery of men of all that most
          adds splendour to life, of all that can most gratify and delight the soul, as you see that
          I have been betrayed and cast away by my own advisers, as you understand that I have been
          forced to ruin myself and my family-help me by your compassion, and support my brother
          Quintus who is still capable of being saved; protect Terentia and my children. For myself,
          if you think it possible that you may see me at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
            >Rome</placeName>, wait for me; if not, come to see me if you can, and make over to me

            designation. See p. 15. </note> That this is now the case, and that your uncle has done
          what he ought to have done, I approve in the strongest manner possible: I will say I am
          "glad," when circumstances shall admit of my using such a word. Ah me! how <pb n="169"/>
          well everything would have been going if my own spirit, my own judgment, and the good
          faith of those on whom I relied had not failed me! But I won't review these circumstances
          lest I increase my sorrow. Yet I feel s"re that it occurs to your mind what a life ours
          was, how delightful, how dignified. To recover this, in the name of fortune, bestow all
          your energies, as I know you do, and take care that I keep the birthday of my return in
          your delightful house with you and my family. For this hope and expectation, though now

          better not to be in the same neighbourhood. What you say in your letter about my town
          house and about Curio's speech is exactly true. Under the general act of restoration, if
          only that is accorded me, everything will be included, of which I care for nothing more
          than for my house. But I don't give you any precise injunction, I trust myself wholly to
          your affection and honour. I am very glad to hear that you have extricated yourself from
          every embarrassment in view of so large an inheritance. As to your promise to employ your
          means in securing my restoration, though I am in all points assisted by you above all
          others, yet I quite see what a support that is, and I fully understand that you are
          undertaking and can carry on many departments of my cause, and do not need to be asked to
          do so. You tell me not to suspect that your feelings have been at all affected by acts of
          commission or omission on my part towards you—well, I will obey you and will get rid of
          that anxiety ; yet I shall owe you all the more from the fact that your kind consideration
          for me has been on a higher level than mine for you. Please tell me in your letters

        <p> On the 26th of November I received three letters from you, one dated 25th of October, in
          which you exhort me to await the month of January with a good heart, and write at length
          on such topics as you think tend to encourage my hopes—as to the zeal of Lentulus, the
          goodwill of Metellus, and the general policy of Pompey. In the second letter, contrary to
          your usual custom, you append no date, but give sufficient indication of the time of its
          writing. For the law having been published by the eight tribunes, you mention that you
          wrote this letter on the very same day, that is, the 29th of October, <note n="1"
            anchored="true">This bill for Cicero's recall would, of course, be vetoed by Clodius,
            and could not therefore be passed, but it would probably influence the action of the new
            tribunes for <date when="-0057">B.C. 57</date>. </note> and you say what good you think
          that publication has done. In regard to which, if my restoration is to be despaired of
          along with this law, I would have you think in your affection for me that my fruitless
          exertions are pitiable rather than foolish: but if there is any ground for hope, try and
          secure that my cause may be hereafter supported with greater attention to details by the
          new magistrates. For this bill of the old tribunes <note n="2" anchored="true">I.e., the
            tribunes of <date when="-0058">B.C. 58</date>. </note> had three clauses, of which the
          one relating to my return was carelessly drafted. For nothing is restored to me except my
          citizenship and senatorial rank: which, in the circumstances of my position, suffices me,
          but it does not escape your observation what special provisions will have to be made, and
          in what manner. The second clause is the usual one—"If anything be done in virtue of this
          law against other laws." <note n="3" anchored="true">I.e., securing indemnity to the
            proposers if there is a technical breach of existing laws, something like the common
            clause- "all statutes to the contrary notwithstanding." </note> But observe, my dear
          Pomponius, what the object of the third clause is, and <pb n="177"/> by whom it has been
          put in. For you know that Clodius provided that it should be scarcely possible, or rather
          altogether impossible, for his law to be deprived of validity either by senate or people.
          But you must see that the penal provisions of such laws as are repealed have never been
          observed. For in that case hardly any law could be repealed at all—for there is no law
          which does not hedge itself in by trying to make repeal difficult—but when a law is
          repealed, so is the clause meant to prevent its repeal. Now, though this is in truth the
          case, since it has been the universal doctrine and practice, our eight tribunes introduced
          the following clause: <emph>If any provision is contained in this bill which, in view of
            existing laws or plebiscites</emph> (i.e., Clodius's law), <emph>it is not lawful
            without incurring penalty, now or heretofore, whether to publish, repeal, amend, or
            supersede, or whereby he who has so published or amended would be liable to penalty or
            fine—such provision is not enacted by this law</emph>. And observe that this contingency
          did not touch the case of those eight tribunes, for they were not bound by a law emanating
          from their own body. <note n="1" anchored="true">The Clodian law. </note> Which makes one
          the more suspicious of some evil intention, since they have added a clause which did not
          affect themselves, but was against my interests: so that the new tribunes, if they
          happened to be somewhat timid, would think it still more necessary to employ the clause.
            <note n="2" anchored="true">Because they would not be protected as the previous tribunes
            were by the fact of the Clodian law (which alone was contravened) having emanated from
            their own <foreign xml:lang="la">collegium</foreign>. </note> And Clodius did not fail
          to notice this. For he said in the public meeting of November the third, that by this
          clause a limit to their legal powers was laid down for the tribunes-designate; and yet it
          cannot escape your notice that in no law is there a clause of the sort: whereas, if it had
          been necessary, everybody would have employed it in repealing a law. How this point came
          to escape Ninnius <note n="3" anchored="true">L. Quadratus Ninnius, tribune-elect. On the
            1st of June next he brought forward the question of Cicero's restoration in the senate.
          </note> and the rest, pray find out, and who introduced the clause, and how it was that
          the eight tribunes did not hesitate to bring my case before the senate—which implies that
          they did not think that clause of <pb n="178"/> the law binding—and were yet so cautious
          in their proposal for its repeal, as to be afraid (though not personally liable) of what
          need not be taken into Consideration, even by those who are bound by the law. This clause
          I would not have the new tribunes propose; however, let them only carry something, no
          matter what: I shall be content with the single clause recalling me, so long only as the
          business is done. I have for some time been feeling ashamed of writing at such length; for
          I fear by the time you read this it will be all up with any hopes, so that this minute
          criticism of mine may seem pitiable to you and ridiculous to others. But if there is any
          ground for hope, pray look at the law which Visellius <note n="1" anchored="true">Cicero's
            Cousin, C. Visellius <foreign xml:lang="la">Varro</foreign>, a learned jurisconsult

          November, in which you explain with wisdom and care what the circumstances are which seem
          to cause a postponement of my affair, and about Crassus, Pompey, and the rest.
          Accordingly, I beg you, if there is any hope that the matter can be settled by the zeal of
          the loyalists, by the exertion of influence, and by getting numbers on our side, to
          endeavour to break through all difficulties at a rush, to throw your whole weight into the
          attempt, and incite others to do the same. But if, as I perceive from your conjectures as
          well as my own, there is no hope left, I beg and implore you to cherish my brother
          Quintus, whom I to our mutual misery have ruined, and not allow him to do anything to

        <p> When, some time ago, I received letters from you all stating that with your consent the
          vote for the expenses of the consular provinces had been taken, though I was nervous as to
          the result of the measure, I yet hoped that you saw some good reason for it beyond what I
          could see: but when I was informed by word of mouth and by letters that this policy of
          yours was strongly censured, I was much disturbed, because the hope which I had cherished,
          faint as it was, seemed completely destroyed. For if the tribunes are angry with us, what
          hope can there be? And, indeed, they seem to have reason to be angry, since they, who had
          undertaken my cause, have not been consulted on the measure; while by your assenting to it
          they have been deprived of all the legitimate influence of their office: and that though
          they profess that it was for my sake that they wished to have the vote for the outfit of
          the consuls under their control, not in order to curtail their freedom of action, but in
          order to attach them to my cause: <note n="1" anchored="true">The phrase <foreign
              xml:lang="la">ornare provincias, ornare consules</foreign>, etc., means the vote in
            the senate deciding the number of troops, amount of money, and other outfit that the
            magistrates going to their provinces were to have. The provinces to be taken by outgoing
            consuls were decided before the elections—in this case they were <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Cilicia</foreign> and <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>. But the
              <foreign xml:lang="la">ornatio</foreign> usually took place after the consuls had
            entered on their office, i.e., after the 1st of January. For this year, however—we don't
            know why—it had taken place before the 1st of December, <date when="-0058">B.C.
              58</date>. The result of this would be that the new tribunes for <date when="-0057"
              >B.C. 57</date>—entering on their office 10th December, <date when="-0058">B.C.
              58</date>—would have no voice in the matter, and would thus lose a great hold on the
            consuls. Most of these tribunes were supporters of Cicero, while he was doubtful as to
            one of the consuls—Q. Caecilius Metellus <foreign xml:lang="la">Nepos</foreign>. He
            thinks, therefore, that his cause has lost by this measure, for the tribunes will have
            less power of putting force on the consuls to do anything for him, and yet the same
            power of stopping them should they wish to do anything of their own accord. Besides, the
            new tribunes may be alienated by what they may think a measure derogatory to their
            position. These fears came to nothing; the tribunes were loyal to Cicero, and the
              <foreign xml:lang="la">consul Piso</foreign> forwarded his recall. </note>
          <pb n="182"/> that as things stand now, supposing the consuls to choose to take part
          against me, they can do so without let or hindrance, but if they wish to do anything in my
          favour they are powerless if the tribunes object. For as to what you say in your letter,
          that, if your party had not consented, they would have obtained their object by a popular
          vote—that would have been impossible against the will of the tribunes. <note n="1"
            anchored="true">Because the tribunes could have vetoed any measure brought before the
            people, and so could have forced the consuls to come to terms. </note> So I fear, on the
          one hand, that I have lost the favour of the tribunes; and on the other, even supposing
          that favour to remain, that the tie has been lost by which the consuls were to be
          attached. Added to this is another disadvantage, the abandonment of the weighty
          resolution—as, indeed, it was reported to me—that the senate should pass no decree until
          my case had been decided, and that, too, in the case of a measure which was not only not
          urgent, but even contrary to custom and unprecedented. For I think there is no precedent
          for voting the provincial outfit of magistrates when still only designate: so that, since
          in a matter like this the firm line <note n="2" anchored="true">I.e., that the senate
            would pass no decree prior to one recalling Cicero. </note> on which my cause had been
          taken up has been infringed, there is now no reason why any decree should not be passed.
          It is not surprising that those friends to whom the question was referred assented, for it
          was difficult to find anyone to express an opinion openly against proposals so
          advantageous to two consuls. It would in any case have been difficult not to be
          complaisant to such a warm friend as Lentulus, or to Metellus after the exceedingly kind
          way in which he put aside his quarrel with me. But I fear that, while failing to keep a
          hold on them, we have lost the tribunes. How this matter has occurred, and in what
          position the whole business stands, I would have you write to me, and in the same spirit
          as before: for your outspoken candour, even if not altogether pleasant, is yet what I
          prefer. <milestone unit="para"/>10 December. <pb n="183"/>

            January had been interrupted by Clodius's roughs. But other similar events happened, and
            there is no certain means of dating this note. The difficulty, as it stands, is that it

          <salute>TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS)</salute>
          <dateline><placeName key="perseus,Rome">RoME</placeName> (SEPTEMBER)</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> DIRECTLY I arrived at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and there was
          anyone to whom I could safely intrust a letter for you, I thought the very first thing I
          ought to do was to Congratulate you in your absence on my return. For I knew, to speak
          candidly, that though in giving me advice you had not been more courageous or far-seeing
          than myself, nor-considering my devotion to you in the past-too careful in protecting me
          from disaster, yet that you—though sharing in the first instance in my mistake, or rather
          madness, and in my ground-less terror—had nevertheless been deeply grieved at our
          separation, and had bestowed immense pains, zeal, care, and labour in securing my return.
          Accordingly, I can truly assure you of this, that in the midst of supreme joy and the most
          gratifying congratulations, the one thing wanting to fill my cup of happiness to the brim
          is the sight of you, or rather your embrace; and if I ever forfeit that again, when I have
          once got possession of it, and if, too, I do not exact the full delights of your charming
          society that have fallen into arrear in the past, I shall certainly consider myself
          unworthy of this renewal of my good fortune. In regard to my political position, I have
          resumed what I thought there would be the utmost difficulty in recovering—my brilliant
          standing at the bar, my influence in the senate, and a popularity with the loyalists even
          greater than I desired. In regard, however, to my private property—as to which you are
          well aware to what an extent it has been crippled, scattered, and plundered—I am in great
          difficulties, and stand in need, not so much of your means (which I look upon as my own),
          as of your advice for collecting and restoring to a sound state the fragments that remain.
          For the present, though I believe everything finds its way to you in the letters of your
          friends, or even by messengers and <pb n="187"/> rumour, yet I will write briefly what I
          think you would like to learn from my letters above all others. On the 4th of August I
          started from <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrachium</placeName>, the very day on which
          the law about me was carried. I arrived at <placeName key="tgn,7004094"
            >Brundisium</placeName> on the 5th of August. There my dear Tulliola met me on what was
          her own birthday, which happened also to be the name-day of the colony of <placeName
            key="tgn,7004094">Brundisium</placeName> and of the temple of Safety, near your house.
          This coincidence was noticed and celebrated with warm congratulations by the citizens of
            <placeName key="tgn,7004094">Brundisium</placeName>. On the 8th of August, while still
          at <placeName key="tgn,7004094">Brundisium</placeName>, I learnt by a letter from Quintus
          that the law had been passed at the comilta centuriata with a surprising enthusiasm on the
          part of all ages and ranks, and with an incredible influx of voters from <placeName
            key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. I then commenced my journey, amidst the compliments
          of the men of highest consideration at <placeName key="tgn,7004094"
          >Brundisium</placeName>, and was met at every point by legates bearing congratulations. My
          arrival in the neighbourhood of the city was the signal for every soul of every order
          known to my nomenclator Coming out to meet me, except those enemies who could not either
          dissemble or deny the fact of their being such. On my arrival at the Porta Capena, the
          steps of the temples were already thronged from top to bottom <note n="1" anchored="true"
            >Reading <foreign xml:lang="la">ab infimo</foreign>. </note> by the populace; and while
          their congratulations were displayed by the loudest possible applause, a similar throng
          and similar applause accompanied me right up to the Capitol, and in the forum and on the
          Capitol itself there was again a wonderful crowd. Next day, in the senate, that is, the
          5th of September, I spoke my thanks to the senators. Two days after that-there having been
          a very heavy rise in the price of corn, and great crowds having flocked first to the
          theatre and then to the senate-house, shouting out, at the instigation of Clodius, that
          the scarcity of corn was my doing—meetings of the senate being held on those days to
          discuss the corn question, and Pompey being called upon to undertake the management of its
          supply in the common talk not only of the plebs, but of the aristocrats also, and being
          himself desirous of the commission, when the people at large called upon me by name to
          support a decree to that effect, <pb n="188"/> I did so, and gave my vote in a
          carefully-worded speech. The other consulars, except Messalla and Afranius, having
          absented themselves on the ground that they could not vote with safety to themselves, a
          decree of the senate was passed in the sense of my motion, namely, that Pompey should be
          appealed to to undertake the business, and that a law should be proposed to that effect.
          This decree of the senate having been publicly read, and the people having, after the
          senseless and new-fangled custom that now prevails, applauded the mention of my name,
            <note n="1" anchored="true">As backing the decree. The phrase was <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >aderat scribendi M. Tuilius Cicero</foreign>, etc. </note> I delivered a speech. All
          the magistrates present, except one praetor and two tribunes, called on me to speak. <note
            n="2" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Dederunt</foreign>, i.e., <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >contionem</foreign>; lit. gave me a meeting, i.e., the right of addressing the
            meeting, which only magistrates or those introduced by magistrates could do. </note>
          Next day a full senate, including all the consulars, granted everything that Pompey asked
          for. Having demanded fifteen legates, he named me first in the list, and said that he
          should regard me in all things as a second self. The consuls drew up a law by which
          complete control over the corn-supply for five years throughout the whole world was given
          to Pompey. A second law is drawn up by Messius, <note n="3" anchored="true">C. Messius, a
            tribune of the year. </note> granting him power over all money, and adding a fleet and
          army, and an impedum in the provinces superior to that of their governors. After that our
          consular law seems moderate indeed: that of Messius is quite intolerable. Pompey professes
          to prefer the former; his friends the latter. The consulars led by Favonius murmur: I hold
          my tongue, the more so that the pontifices have as yet given no answer in regard to my
          house. <note n="4" anchored="true">Clodius had consecrated the site of Cicero's house for
            a temple of Liberty. The pontifices had to decide whether that consecration held good,
            or whether the site might be restored to Cicero. Hence his speech <title>de Domo sua ad
              Pontifices</title>. </note> If they annul the consecration I shall have a splendid
          site. The consuls, in accordance with a decree of the senate, will value the cost of the
          building that stood upon it; but if the pontifices decide otherwise, they will pull down
          the Clodian building, give out a contract in their own name (for a temple), and value to
          me the cost of a site and house. So our affairs are <pb n="189"/>

          money matters I am, as you know, much embarrassed. Besides, there are certain domestic
          troubles, which I do not intrust to writing. My brother Quintus I love as he deserves for
          his eminent qualities of loyalty, virtue, and good faith. I am longing to see you, and beg
          you to hasten your return, resolved not to allow me to be without the benefit of your
          advice. I am on the threshold, as it were, of a second life. Already certain persons who
          defended me in my absence begin to nurse a secret grudge at me now that I am here, and to
          make no secret of their jealousy. I want you very much. </p>

        </opener>
        <p> If by any chance you get letters less frequently from me than from others, I beg you not
          to put it down to my negligence, or even to my engagements; for though they are very
          heavy, there can be none sufficient to stop the course of our mutual affection and of the
          attention I owe to you. The fact is that, since my return to <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
            >Rome</placeName>, this is only the second time that I have been told of anyone to whom
          I could deliver a letter, and accordingly this is my second letter to you. In my former I
          described the reception I had on my return, what my political position was, and how my
          affairs were <quote>For happy though but ill, for ill not worst.</quote> The despatch of
          that letter was followed by a great controversy about my house. I delivered a speech
          before the pontifices on the 29th of September. I pleaded my cause with care, and if I
          ever was worth anything as a speaker, or <pb n="190"/> even if I never was on any other
          occasion, on this one at any rate my indignation at the business, and the importance of
          it, did add a Certain vigour to my style. <note n="1" anchored="true">The speech <title>de
              Domo sua ad Pontifices</title>. The genuineness of the existing speech has been
            doubted. But it may very well be said that no one but Cicero could have written it. It
            is not certainly one of his happiest efforts, in spite of what he says here; but he is
            not unaccustomed to estimate his speeches somewhat highly, and to mistake violence for
            vigour. </note> Accordingly, the rising generation must not be left without the benefit
          of this speech, which I shall send you all the same, even if you don't want it. <note
            n="2" anchored="true">He will send it to <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticos</foreign> to get
            copied by his <foreign xml:lang="la">librarii</foreign>, and published. </note> The
          decree of the pontifices was as follows: "If neither by order of the people nor vote of
          the plebs the party alleging that he had dedicated had been appointed by name to that
          function, nor by order of the people or vote of the plebs had been commanded to do so, we
          are of opinion that the part of the site in question may be restored to M. Tullius without
          violence to religion." Upon this I was at once congratulated—for no one doubted that my
          house was thereby adjudged to me—when all on a sudden that fellow mounts the platform to
          address a meeting, invited to speak by Appius, <note n="3" anchored="true">Appius Claudius
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Pulcher</foreign>, brother of P. Clodius, was a praetor this
            year. </note> and announces at once to the people that the pontifices had decided in his
          favour, <note n="4" anchored="true">It is not clear that Clodius was wrong; the pontifices
            decided that for a valid consecration an order of the people was requisite, and, of
            course, Clodius could allege such an order. Cicero devoted the greater part of his
            speech, therefore, to shewing (1) that Clodius's adoption was invalid, and that he was
            therefore no tribune, and incapable of taking an order of the people; (2) that the law
            was a <foreign xml:lang="la">privilegium</foreign>, and therefore invalid. The
            pontifices did not Consider either of these points, which were not properly before them,
            or within their competence; they merely decided the religious question—that unless there
            had been a <foreign xml:lang="la">jussus populi</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >plebis scitus</foreign> there was no valid consecration. </note> but that I was
          endeavouring to take forcible possession; he exhorts them to follow himself and Appius to
          defend their own shrine of Liberty. <note n="5" anchored="true">Or perhaps only "statue of
            Liberty," as the temple was not yet completed. </note> Hereupon, when even those
          Credulous hearers partly wondered and partly laughed at the fellow's mad folly, I resolved
          not to go near the place until such time as the <pb n="191"/> consuls by decree of the
          senate had given out the contract for restoring the colonnade of Catulus. <note n="1"
            anchored="true">A portico or colonnade, built by Q. Catulus, the conqueror of the

            was killed with Saturninus in <date when="-00100">B.C. 100</date>. It was close to
            Cicero's house, and what Clodius appears to have done was to pull down the portico, and
            build another, extending over part of Cicero's site, on which was to be a temple for his
            statue of Liberty. </note> On the 1st of October there was a full meeting of the senate.
          All the pontilices who were senators were invited to attend, and MarCellinus, <note n="2"
            anchored="true">Cn. <foreign xml:lang="la">Cornelius</foreign> Lentulus Marcellinus was
            called on first as consul-designate for <date when="-0056">B.C. 56</date>. </note> who
          is a great admirer of mine, being called on to speak first, asked them what was the
          purport of their decree. Then M. Lucullus, speaking for all his colleagues, answered that
          the pontifices were judges of a question of religion, the senate of the validity of a law:
          that he and his colleagues had given a decision on a point of religion; in the senate they
          would with the other senators decide on the law. Accordingly, each of them, when asked in
          their proper order for their opinion, delivered long arguments in my favour. When it came
          to Clodius's turn, he wished to talk out the day, and he went on endlessly; however, after
          he had spoken for nearly three hours, he was forced by the loud expression of the senate's
          disgust to finish his speech at last. On the decree in accordance with the proposal of
          Marcellinus passing the senate against a minority of one, Serranus interposed his veto.
            <note n="3" anchored="true">Sext. Attilius Serranus, a tribune. He had been a quaestor
            in Cicero's consulship, but had opposed his recall. </note> At once both consuls
          referred the question of Serranus's veto to the senate. After some very resolute speeches
          had been delivered—"that it was the decision of the senate that the house should be
          restored to me": "that a contract should be given out for the colonnade of Catulus": "that
          the resolution of the house should be supported by all the magistrates": "that if any
          violence occurred, the senate would consider it to be the fault of the magistrate who
          vetoed the decree of the senate"—Serranus became thoroughly frightened, and Cornicinus
          repeated his old farce: throwing off his toga, he flung himself at his son-in-law's feet.
            <note n="4" anchored="true">Cn. Oppius Cornicinlis, the father-in-law of Serranus, is
            said in <bibl n="Cic. Red. Pop. 13">p. red. at Quir. § 13</bibl> to have done the same
            in the senate on the 1st of January, when Serranus also went through the same form of
            "demanding a night" for consideration. </note> The former demanded a night for
          consideration. <pb n="192"/> They would not grant it: for they remembered the 1st of
          January. It was, however, at last granted with difficulty on my interposition. Next day
          the decree of the senate was passed which I send you. Thereupon the consuls gave out a
          contract for the restoration of the colonnade of Catulus: the contractors immediately
          cleared that portico of his away to the satisfaction of all. <note n="1" anchored="true"
            >Prof. Tyrrell brackets <foreign xml:lang="la">porticum</foreign>. But I do not
            understand his difficulty, especially as he saw none in the last letter. Cicero
              (<foreign xml:lang="la">de Domo</foreign>, § 102) certainly implies that Clodius had,
            at any rate, partly pulled down the <foreign xml:lang="la">porticus Catuli</foreign>, in
            order to build something on a larger scale, which was to take in some of Cicero's site.
            This was now to come down, and so leave Cicero his area, and, I presume, the old
              <foreign xml:lang="la">porticus Catuli</foreign> was to be restored. </note> The
          buildings of my house the consuls, by the advice of their assessors, valued at 2,000,000

          sesterces—an estimate loudly exclaimed against not only by all the best men, but even by
          the common people. You Will say, "What was the reason?" They for their part say it was my
          modesty—because I would neither say no, nor make any violent expostulation. But that is
          not the real cause: for that indeed in itself would have been in my favour. <note n="3"
            anchored="true">I.e., my modest reserve. There does not seem any reason for Tyrrell's
            emendation of <foreign xml:lang="la">num</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="la"

          whom you are no more ignorant than myself, having clipped my wings, are unwilling that
          they should grow again to their old size. But, as I hope, they are already growing again.
          Only come to me! But this, I fear, may be retarded by the visit of your and my friend
          Varro. Having now heard the actual course of public business, let me inform you of what I
          have in my thoughts besides. I have allowed myself to be made legatus to Pompey, but only
          on condition that nothing should stand in the way of my being entirely free either to
          stand, if I choose, for the censorship—if the next consuls hold a censorial election—or to
          assume <pb n="193"/> a "votive commission" in connexion with nearly any fanes or sacred
          groves. <note n="1" anchored="true">I have translated Klotz's text. That given by Prof.
            Tyrrell is, to me at any rate, quite unintelligible. Cicero's <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >legatio</foreign> under Pompey appears to have been, in fact, honorary, or <foreign
              xml:lang="la">libera</foreign>, for he doesn't seem to have done anything. He wishes
            to reserve the right of resigning it to stand for the censorship (censors were elected
            in the following year), or of turning it into a <foreign xml:lang="la">votiva
              legatio</foreign>, to visit certain sacred places on the plea of performing a vow,
            thus getting the opportunity, if he desired it, of retiring temporarily from <placeName
              key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> in a dignified manner. The force of <foreign
              xml:lang="la">prope</foreign> seems to be "almost any, I Care not what." It was not
            likely that a man with his stormy past would do for the delicate duties of the
            censorship, and he would save appearances by going on a <foreign xml:lang="la">votiva
              legatio</foreign>. See Letter XLIV. </note> For this is what falls in best with our
          general policy and my particular occasions. But I wished the power to remain in my hands
          of either standing for election, or at the beginning of the summer of going out of town:
          and meanwhile I thought it not disadvantageous to keep myself before the eyes of the
          citizens who had treated me generously. Well, such are my plans in regard to public
          affairs; my domestic affairs are very intricate and difficult. My town house is being
          built: you know how much expense and annoyance the repair of my Formian villa occasions
          me, which I can neither bear to relinquish nor to look at. I have advertised my Tusculan
          property for sale; I don't much care for a suburban residence. <note n="2" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Facile careo</foreign>, others read <foreign xml:lang="la">non

          <dateline><placeName key="perseus,Rome">ROME</placeName>, 24 NOVEMBER</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> I am very well aware that you long to know what is going on here, and also to know it
          from me, not because things done before the eyes of the whole world are better realized
          when narrated by my band than when reported to you by the pens or lips of others, but
          because it is from my letters that you get what you want—a knowledge of my feelings in
          regard to the occurrences, and what at such a juncture is the state of my mind, or, in a
          word, the conditions in which I am living. On the 3rd of November the workmen were driven
          from the site of my house by armed ruffians: the porticus Catuli, <note n="1"
            anchored="true">See last letter. The <foreign xml:lang="la">porticus Catuli</foreign>
            had been, at any rate, partly demolished by Clodius to make way for his larger scheme of
            building, which was to take in part of Cicero's "site." See <bibl n="Cic. Cael. 79">pro
              Cael. § 79</bibl>. </note> which was being rebuilt on a contract given out by the
          consuls, in accordance with a decree of the senate, and had nearly reached the roof, was
          battered down: the house of my brother Quintus <note n="2" anchored="true">Next door to
            Cicero's own house. </note> was first smashed with volleys of stones thrown from my
          site, and then set on fire by order of Clodius, firebrands having been thrown into it in
          the sight of the whole town, amidst loud exclamations of indignation and sorrow, I will
          not say of the loyalists—for I rather think there are none—but of simply every human
          being. That madman runs riot: thinks after this mad prank of nothing short of murdering
          his opponents: canvasses the city street by street: makes open offers of freedom to
          slaves. For the fact is that up to this time, while trying to avoid prosecution, <note
            n="3" anchored="true">He would avoid prosecution <foreign xml:lang="la">de vi</foreign>
            by getting elected to the aedileship for <date when="-0056">B.C. 56</date>, for actual
            magistrates were rarely prosecuted; but he, in this case, actually avoided it by getting
            a <foreign xml:lang="la">consul</foreign> and tribune to forbid it by edict (<foreign
              xml:lang="la">pro</foreign> Sest. § 89). </note>
          <pb n="195"/> he had a case, difficult indeed to support, and obviously bad, but still a
          case: he might have denied the facts, he might have shifted the blame on others, he might
          even have pleaded that some part of his proceedings had been legal. But after such
          wrecking of buildings, incendiaries, and wholesale robberies as these, being abandoned by
          his supporters, he hardly retains on his side Decimus the marshal, <note n="1"
            anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Designatorem</foreign>. This may mean (1) an official who shewed

          slaves into his confidence; sees that, even if he openly assassinates everyone he wishes
          to, he will not have a worse case before a court of law than he has at present.
          Accordingly, on the uth of November, as I was going down the Sacred Way, he followed me
          with his gang. There were shouts, stone-throwing, brandishing of clubs and swords, and all
          this without a moment's warning. I and my party stepped aside into Tettius Damio's
          vestibule: those accompanying me easily prevented his roughs from getting in. He might
          have been killed himself. <note n="2" anchored="true">Perhaps by M. Antonius See 2 Phil §
            21, <foreign xml:lang="la">pro</foreign> Mil § 40. </note> But I am now on a system of
          cure by regimen: I am tired of surgery. The fellow, seeing that what everybody called for
          was not his prosecution but his instant execution, has since made all your Catilines seem
          models of respectability. <note n="3" anchored="true">Lit. "made all Catilines <foreign

              Agr. 2.64</bibl>, Cicero classes the Acidini among men "respectable not only for the
            public offices they had held, and for their services to the state, but also for the
            noble way in which they had endured poverty." There does not, however, seem any very
            good reason known for their becoming proverbial as the antithesis to revolutionaries.
          </note> For on the 12th of November he tried to storm and set fire to Milo's house, I mean
          the one on Germalus: <note n="4" anchored="true">A slope of the <placeName

          openly was this done, that at eleven o'clock in the morning he brought men there armed
          with shields and with their swords drawn, and others with lighted torches. He had himself
          occupied the <pb n="196"/> house of P. Sulla <note n="1" anchored="true">P. <foreign

          himself; but my gentleman took refuge in the inner part of Sulla's house. The next thing
          was a meeting of the senate on the i4th. Clodius stayed at home: Marcellinus <note n="2"

            prosecution. Appius is Appius Claudius, brother of P. Clodius. </note> talked the
          business out by an obstructive speech, aided by Appius, and also, by Hercules! by your

            anchored="true">P. Sestius, the tribune favourable to Cicero, afterwards defended by
            him. </note> was fuming. Aft erwards the fellow vows vengeance on the city if his
          election is stopped. Marcellinus's resolution having been exposed for public perusal (he
          had read it from a written copy, and it embraced our entire case—the prosecution was to
          include his violent proceedings on the site of my house, his arson, his assault on me
          personally, and was to take place before the elections), he put up a notice that he
          intended to watch the sky during all comitial days. <note n="5" anchored="true">Mr.
            Purser's reading of <foreign xml:lang="la">nisi anteferret</foreign> before <foreign
              xml:lang="la">proscripsit</foreign> seems to me to darken the passage. What happened
            was this. Marcellinus's <foreign xml:lang="la">sententia</foreign> was never put to the
            vote, because Metellus, Appius, and Hortensius (Cicero seems to mean him) talked out the
            sitting. Accordingly, Marcellinus published it, i.e., put it up outside the Curia to be
            read: and under it he (or some other magistrate whose name has dropped out of the text)
            put a notice that he was going to "watch the sky" all the <foreign xml:lang="la">dies
              comitiales</foreign>, so as to prevent the election being held. But this had been
            rendered inoperative by Clodius's amendment of the <foreign xml:lang="la">lex Aelia
              Fufia</foreign> (see <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 2.81">Phil. 2.81</bibl>)—or at any rate of
            doubtful validity—and, accordingly, the only thing left was the <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >obnuntiatio</foreign> by a magistrate, which <foreign xml:lang="la">Milo</foreign>
            proceeded to make. The rule, however was that such <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >obnuntiatio</foreign> must be made before the <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >comitia</foreign> were begun (2 Phil. 81), which again could not begin till sunrise.
            Hence Milo's early visit to the <foreign xml:lang="la">campus</foreign>. For the meaning
            of <foreign xml:lang="la">proposita</foreign> see Letter XLVII. </note> Public speeches
          of Metellus disorderly, <pb n="197"/> of Appius hot-beaded, of Publius stark mad. The
          upshot, however, was that, had not Milo served his notice of bad omens in the campus, the
          elections would have been held. On the i9th of November Milo arrived on the campus before
          midnight with a large company. Clodius, though he had picked gangs of runaway slaves, did
          not venture into the campus. Milo stopped there till midday, <note n="1" anchored="true"
            >After which the <foreign xml:lang="la">comitia</foreign> could not be begun. </note> to
          everybody's great delight and his own infinite credit: the movement of the three brethren

              <foreign xml:lang="la">Nepos</foreign>. </note> ended in their own disgrace; their
          violence was crushed, their madness made ridiculous. However, Metellus demands that the
          obstructive notice should be served on him next day in the forum: "there was no need to
          come to the campus before daybreak: he would be in the c"ml'ium at the first hour of the
          day." <note n="3" anchored="true">Metellus means that he shall take the necessary auspices

              >comitium</foreign>, before going to the campus to take the votes. </note>
          Accordingly, on the 20th Milo Came to the forum before sunrise. Metellus at the first sign
          of dawn was stealthily hurrying to the campus, I had almost said by by-lanes: Milo catches
          our friend up "between the groves" <note n="4" anchored="true">Generally called <foreign

          astonishing. Some recent instances of his superhuman excellence I pass over; but the
          upshot is this: I don't think the election will take place. I think Publius will be
          brought to trial by Milo—unless he is killed first. If he once puts himself in his way in
          a riot, I can see that he will be killed by Milo himself. The latter has no scruple about
          doing it; he avows his intention; he isn't at all afraid of what happened to me, for he
          will never listen to the advice of a jealous and faithless friend, nor trust a feeble
          aristocrat. In spirit, at any rate, I am as vigorous as in my zenith, or even more so; in
          regard to money I am crippled. However, the liberality of my brother I have, in spite of
          his protests, repaid (as the state of my finances compelled) by the aid of my friends,
          that I might not be drained quite dry myself. What line of policy to adopt in regard to my
          position as a whole, I cannot decide in your absence: wherefore make haste to town. </p>

          and high-minded policy! One could scarcely believe the amount of treachery there is in
          those leaders of the state, as they wish to be, and might be, if they had any principle of
          honour in them. I had felt it, known it-taken in, abandoned, and cast aside by them, as I
          had been! and yet my purpose still was to stick by them in politics. They were the same
          men as they ever had been. At last, on your advice, my eyes have been opened. You will say
          that your advice only extended to action, not to writing also. The truth is that I wanted

          those who, even at a time when I could claim their Compassion, never cease being jealous
          of me. However, I kept within due limits in my subject, when I did put pen to paper. I

          wry faces who are angry at my possessing the villa which once belonged to Catulus, without
          reflecting that I bought it from Vettius: who say that I ought not to have built a town
          house, and declare that I ought to have sold. <pb n="226"/> But what is all this to the
          fact that, when I have delivered senatorial speeches in agreement with their own views,
          their chief pleasure has yet been that I spoke contrary to Pompey's wishes? Let us have an
          end of it. Since those who have no power refuse me their affection, let us take care to
          secure the affection of those who have power. You will say, "I could have wished that you
          had done so before." I know you did wish it, and that I have made a real ass of myself.
          But now the time has Come to shew a little affection for myself, since I can get none from

        <p> Of course I am as sorry about Lentulus as I am bound to be: we have lost a good patriot
          and a great man, one who to great strength of character united a culture equally profound.
          My consolation is a miserable one, but still it is a consolation—that I do not grieve on
          his account: I don't mean in the sense of Saufeius and your Epicurean friends, but, by
          Hercules, because he loved his country so deeply, that he seems to me to have been
          snatched away by a special favour of providence from its conflagration. For what could be
          more humiliating than the life we are living, especially mine? For as to yourself, though
          by nature a politician, you have yet avoided having any servitude peculiar to yourself:
          you merely come under an appellation common to us all. <note n="1" anchored="true">Reading
              <foreign xml:lang="la">communi fueris nomine</foreign>. After all, the meaning is very
            doubtful. </note> But!; who, if I say what I ought about the Republic, am looked on as
          mad, if what expediency <pb n="232"/> dictates, as a slave, and if I say nothing, as
          utterly crushed and helpless—what must I be suffering? Suffer, indeed, I do, and all the
          more keenly that I cannot even shew my pain without appearing ungrateful. Again: what if I
          should choose a life of inactivity and take refuge in the harbour of retired leisure?
          Impossible! Rather war and the camp Am I to serve in the ranks after refusing to be a
          general? I suppose I must. For I perceive you, too, think so, you whom I wish that I had
          always obeyed. All that is left to me now is, "You have drawn <placeName
            key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>: make the best of it!" But, by heavens, I can't:
          and I feel for Philoxenus, <note anchored="true">Philoxenus, who, having been sent to the
            quarries by Dionysius of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, for
            criticising the tyrant's poetry, was given another chance. After reading a few lines he
            turned away silently. "Where are you going?" said Dionysius. "Back to the quarries,"
            snid Philoxenus. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">*spa/rtan e)/laxes, tau/thn
              ko/smei</foreign>, see p. 59. </note> who preferred a return to jail. However, in my
          present retirement I am thinking over how to express my rejection of the old policy, and
          when we meet you will strengthen me in it. <milestone unit="para"/>I notice that you have
          written to me at frequent intervals, but I received all the letters at once. This
          circumstance increased my grief. For I had read three to begin with, in which the report
          of Lentulus was that he was a little better. Then came the thunderbolt of the fourth. But
          it is not he, as I said, who is to be pitied, but we who are so callous as to live on.
            <note anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="la">Ferrei</foreign>. The true meaning of the
            word here seems to me to be shewn by <bibl n="Cic. Amic. 87">de Am. 87</bibl>, <foreign
              xml:lang="la">quis tam esset ferreus, qui eam vitam ferre posset, cuique non auferret
              fructum voluptatum omnium solitudo?</foreign> There is an intentional play on the
            words <foreign xml:lang="la">ferreus</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >ferre</foreign>. Others have altered it to <foreign xml:lang="la">servi</foreign>,
            and others have explained it as an allusion to the iron age, in both cases spoiling the
            antithesis—he died, we remain—and in the latter using the word in a sense not elsewhere
            found. Lentulus is L. <foreign xml:lang="la">Cornelius</foreign> Lentulus. See Letter
            L.</note> You remind me to write that essay on Hortensius: I have digressed into other
          subjects, but have not forgotten your charge. But, by heaven, at the first line I shrank
          from the task, lest I, who seem to have acted foolishly in resenting foolishly rendering
          his injurious treatment of me conspicuous, his intemperate conduct as a friend, should
          once more be if I wrote anything; and at the same time lest my high morale, manifested in
          my actions, should be somewhat obscured in my writing, and this mode of taking
          satisfaction <pb n="233"/> should seem to imply a certain instability. But we shall see.
          Only be sure to write me something as often as possible. I sent a letter to Lucceius
          asking him to write the history of my consulship: be sure you get it from him, for it is a
          very pretty bit of writing, and urge him to use despatch, and thank him for having written
          me an answer saying that he would do so. Go and see my house as often as you can. Say
          something to Vestorius : <note n="1" anchored="true">A money-lender.</note> for he is

          <note n="1" anchored="true">The letter appears to be from <foreign xml:lang="la"

            with other years. So far as this is not due to accident in the preservation of his
            letters, it may be accounted for by the fact that he was working at his <title>de

          Pray speak a little louder: I seem scarcely to have caught what you said. But let me know

          to judge from what he says—one is obliged to put in that proviso in his case. He thinks
          very little of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> as a province; talks a good

        <p> I was delighted with your two letters which I received together on the 26th. Go on with
          the story. I long to know all the facts of what you write about. Also I should like you to
          find out what this means: you can do so from Demetrius. Pompey told me that he was
          expecting Crassus in his <placeName key="tgn,1031727">Alban</placeName> villa on the 27th:
          that as soon as he arrived, they were going at once to <placeName key="perseus,Rome"

          know, or when he has reached <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. I am engaged

        <p> The bare fact of my letter being by the hand of an amanuensis will be a sign of the
          amount of my engagements. I have no fault to find with you as to the number of your
          letters, but most of them told me nothing except where you were, or at most shewed by the
          fact that they Came from you that no harm had happened to you. Of this class of letters
          there were two which gave me very great pleasure, dated by you from <placeName
            key="perseus,Buthrotum">Buthrotum</placeName> almost at the same time: for I was anxious
          to know that you had had a favourable crossing. But this constant supply of your letters
          did not give me so much pleasure by the richness of their contents as by their frequency.
          The one which your guest, M. Paccius, delivered to me was important and full of matter. I
          will therefore answer it. And this is the first thing I have to say: I have shewn Paccius,
          both by word and deed, what weight a recommendation from you has: accordingly, he is among
          my intimate friends, though unknown to me before. Now for the rest. Varro, of whom you
          write, shall be got in somewhere, if l can but find a place for him. <note n="1"
            anchored="true">That is, as an interlocutor in the dialogue "On the Republic," which
            Cicero was engaged in writing. </note> But you know the style of my Dialogues: just as
          in those <title>On the Orator</title>, which you praise to the skies, a mention of anyone
          by the interlocutors was impossible, unless he had been known to or heard of by them, so
          in the "Dialogue on the Republic," which I have begun, I have put the discussion in the
          mouths of Africanus, Philus, Laelius, and Manilius. I have added two young men, Q. Tubero
          and P. Rutilius, and the two sons-in-law of Laelius, Scaevola and Fannius. So I am
          thinking how (since I employ introductions to each book, as Aristotle <pb n="281"/> does
          in what he calls his "Exoterics") to contrive some pretext for naming your friend in a
          natural way, as I understand is your wish. May I only be enabled to carry out my attempt!
          For, as you cannot but observe, I have undertaken a subject wide, difficult, and requiring
          the utmost leisure—the very thing that, above all others, I lack. In those books which you
          commend you complain of the absence of Scaevola among the speakers. Well, I did not
          withdraw him without a set purpose, but I did exactly what that god of our idolatry,
          Plato, did in his Republic. When Socrates had come to the <placeName key="perseus,Piraeus"
            >Piraeus</placeName> on a visit to Cephalus, a wealthy and cheerful old man, during all
          the introductory conversation the old man takes part in the discussion; then, after having
          himself made a speech very much to the point, he says that he wants to go away to attend
          on the religious rites, and does not return again. I believe Plato hardly thought that it
          would be quite natural, if he kept a man of that age any longer in a conversation so
          protracted. I thought that I was bound to be still more careful in the case of Scaevola,
          who was at the age and with the broken health as you remember he then was, and who had
          enjoyed such high offices, that it was scarcely in accordance with etiquette for him to be
          staying several days in the Tusculan villa of Crassus. Besides, the conversation in the
          first book was not unconnected with Scaevola's special pursuits: the other books, as you
          know, contain a technical discussion. In such I was unwilling that that facetious veteran,
          as you know he was, should take part. <milestone unit="para"/>As to Pilia's business,
          which you mention, I will see to it. For the matter is quite clear, as you say, from the
          information supplied by Aurelianus, and in managing it I shall have also an opportunity of
          glorifying myself in my Tullia's eyes. I am supporting Vestorius: for I know that it
          gratifies you, and I am careful that he should understand that to be the case. But do you
          know the sort of man he is? Though he has two such good-natured people to deal with,
          nothing can exceed his impracticability. Now as to what you ask about Gaius Cato. You know
          that he was acquitted under the <foreign xml:lang="la">lex Junia Licinia </foreign>: <note
            n="1" anchored="true">A law re-enacting the <foreign xml:lang="la">lex Didia</foreign>,
            and enacting under penalties that no law was to be brought forward without due
            publication beforehand. </note>
          <pb n="282"/> I have to tell you that he will be acquitted under the <foreign
            xml:lang="la">lex Fufia</foreign>, <note n="1" anchored="true">A law which enabled the
            magistrates and tribunes to stop legislation by <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >obnuntiatio</foreign>. </note> and not so much to the satisfaction of his defenders
          as of his accusers. However, he has become reconciled to myself and Milo. Drusus has had
          notice of prosecution by Lucretius. The 3rd of July is the day fixed for challenging his
          jurors. About Procilius <note n="2" anchored="true">Procilius had been condemned <foreign
              xml:lang="la">de vi</foreign> (p. 280). The rumours, I suppose, were as to the jury
            having been corrupted. </note> there are sinister rumours—but you know what the courts
          are. Hirrus is on good terms with Domitius. <note n="3" anchored="true">The <foreign
              xml:lang="la">consul consul</foreign> L. Domitius Ahenobarbus and C. Lucceius Hirrus,
            the latter a warm partisan of Pompey, who was supposed to be agitating for a
            dictatorship. </note> The senatorial decree which the present consuls have carried about
          the provinces—"whoever henceforth, etc."—does not seem to me likely to have any effect.
            <milestone unit="para"/>As to your question about Messalla, I don't know what to say: I
          have never seen candidates so closely matched. Messalla's means of support you know.
          Scaurus has had notice of prosecution from Triarius. If you ask me, no great feeling of
          sympathy for him has been roused. Still, his aedileship is remembered with some gratitude,
          and he has a certain hold on the country voters from the memory of his father. The two
          remaining plebeian candidates have compensating advantages which make them about equal:
          Domitius Calvinus is strong in friends, and is farther supported by his very popular
          exhibition of gladiators; Memmius finds favour with Caesar's veterans and relies on
          Pompey's client towns in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>. If this does not
          avail him, people think that some tribune will be found to push off the elections till
          Caesar comes back, especially since Cato has been acquitted. <milestone unit="para"/>I
          have answered your letter brought by Paccius: now for the rest. From my brother's letter I
          gather surprising indications of Caesar's affection for me, and they have been confirmed
          by a very cordial letter from Caesar himself. The result of the British war is a source of
          anxiety. For it is ascertained that the approaches to the island are protected by
          astonishing masses of cliff. Moreover, it is now known that there isn't a pennyweight of
          silver in that island, nor any hope of booty except from slaves, among whom I don't <pb
            n="283"/> suppose you can expect any instructed in literature or music. <milestone
            unit="para"/>Paullus has almost brought his basilica in the forum to the roof, using the
          same columns as were in the ancient building: the part for which he gave out a contract he
          is building on the most magnificent scale. <note n="1" anchored="true">L. Aemilius Paullus
              (<foreign xml:lang="la">consul</foreign>

            Aemilius Lepidus in <date when="-00179">B.C. 179</date>, and appears to have added
            largely to it, or even built a new one. </note> Need I say more? Nothing could be more
          gratifying or more to his glory than such a monument. Accordingly, the friends of Caesar—I
          mean myself and Oppius, though you burst with anger—have thought nothing of 60,000

          enlarge the forum and extend it right up to the Hall of Liberty. The claims of private
          owners could not be satisfied for less. We will make it a most glorious affair. For in the

          places for the <foreign xml:lang="la">comitia tributa</foreign>, of marble and covered,

          erections. <note n="2" anchored="true">These works seem to have been contemplated by the

          make you go so often and so far from your friends. But I could have wished that I had <pb

          you is the uncertainty I am in as to where you are or are going to be. However, I thought
          I ought to give this letter to a chance messenger, because be seemed to be likely to see

        <p> I am glad about Eutychides, who, using your old <foreign xml:lang="la"
            >praenomen</foreign> and your new <foreign xml:lang="la">nomen</foreign>, will be called
          Titus Caecilius, just as Dionysius, from a combination of your names and mine, is Marcus
          Pomponius. I am, by Hercules, exceedingly gratified that Eutychides has had cause to know
          your kindness to me, and that the sympathy he shewed me in the time of my sorrow was
          neither unnoticed at the time nor afterwards forgotten by me. I suppose you were obliged
          to undertake your journey to <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>. For you never
          would have been willing, without the most urgent cause, to be so far from so many persons
          and things which you love so much, and which give you so much delight. But the speed of
          your return will shew your kindness and love for your friends. Yet I fear lest the
          rhetorician Clodius, by his charms, and Pituanius, that excellent scholar, as he is said
          to be, and now, indeed, so wholly devoted to Greek letters, may detain you. But if you
          would shew the feelings of a man, come back to us at the time you promised. You will,
          after all, be able to enjoy their society at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
            >Rome</placeName>, when they get there safe. You say you desire something in the way of
          a letter from me: I have written, and, indeed, on many subjects—everything detailed <pb
            n="285"/> like a journal—but, as I conjecture from your not having, as it seems,
          remained long in <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName>, I suppose it has not
          reached you. Moreover, my letters to you are generally of such a kind, that I don't like
          to put them in anyone's hands, unless I can feel certain that he will deliver them to you.
            <milestone unit="para"/>Now for affairs at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
            >Rome</placeName>. On the 4th of July Sufenas and Cato were acquitted, Procilius

          the Veline Lake, which had been drained by Manius Curius by cutting away the mountain,
          flowed into the Nar, by which means the famous Rosia has been reclaimed from the swamp,
          though still fairly moist. <note n="3" anchored="true">This refers to the famous waterfall
            of <foreign xml:lang="la">Terni</foreign>. An artificial cutting drained the River
            Velinus (which otherwise covered the high valley as a lake) into the Nar, which is in
            the valley below. What was good for the people of <placeName key="perseus,Reate"

          visit Seven Waters. I returned to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> on the
          9th of July for the sake of Fonteius. I entered the theatre. At first I was greeted with
          loud and general applause—but don't take any notice of that, I was a fool to mention
          it—then I turned my attention to Antiphon. He had been manumitted before being brought on
          to the stage. Not to keep you in suspense, he bore away the palm. But there never was
          anything so dwarfish, so destitute of voice, so—— But keep <pb n="286"/> this to yourself.
          However, in the <title>Andromache</title> he was just taller than Astyanax: among the rest
          he had not one of his own height. You next ask about Arbuscula: she had a great success.
          The games were splendid and much liked. The wild-beast hunt was put off to a future
          occasion. Next follow me into the <foreign xml:lang="la">campus</foreign>. Bribery is
          raging. "and I a sign to you will tell." <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">sh=ma de/ toi e)re/w</foreign> (Hom. 51.23.326). </note> The
          rate of interest from being four per cent. on the 15th of July has gone up to eight per
          cent. You will say, "Well, I don't mind that." <note n="2" anchored="true">Because
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign> lent money. </note> What a man! What a
          citizen! Memmius is supported by all Caesar's influence. The consuls have formed a
          coalition between him and Domitius (Calvinus) on terms which I dare not commit to paper.
          Pompey rages, remonstrates, backs Scaurus, but whether only ostensibly or from the heart
          people don't feel sure. No one takes the lead: money reduces all to the same level.
          Messalla's chance is at a low ebb: not because he is wanting in spirit or friends, but
          because this coalition of the consuls, as well as Pompey's opposition, stands in his way.
          I think the result will be a postponement of the elections. The tribunician candidates
          have taken an oath to conduct their canvass according to the direction of Cato. They have
          deposited with him 500 sestertia apiece, on condition that whoever Cato condemns should
          forfeit it, and that it should be paid over to his competitors. I write this the day
          before the elections are to take place. But on the 28th of July, if they have taken place,
          and if the letter-carrier has not started, I will write you an account of the whole
            <foreign xml:lang="la">comitia</foreign>: and, if they are conducted without corruption,
          Cato by himself will have been more efficacious than all laws and jurors put together. I
          have undertaken to defend Messius, who has been recalled from his legation: for Appius had
          named him <foreign xml:lang="la">legatus</foreign> to Caesar. Servilius ordered his
          attendance in an edict. His jurors are to be from the tribes Pomptina, Velina, and Maecia.
          It is a sharp fight: however, it is going fairly well. After that I have to prepare myself
          for Drusus, then for Scaurus. Very high-sounding title-slips are being prepared for my
          speeches! Perhaps even the consuls-designate will be added to the list of my clients: and
            <pb n="287"/> if Scaurus is not one of them, he will find himself in serious
          difficulties in this trial. Judging from my brother Quintus's letter, I suspect that by
          this time he is in <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>. I await news of him
          with anxiety. We have certainly gained one advantage—many unmistakable indications enable
          us to feel sure that we are in the highest degree liked and valued by Caesar. Please give
          my compliments to Dionysius, and beg and exhort him to come as soon as possible, that he
          may continue the instruction of my son and of myself as well. </p>

          <dateline>ROME, 1 OCTOBER</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> You think I imagine that I write more rarely to you than I used to do from having
          forgotten my regular habit and purpose, but the fact is that, perceiving your locality and
          journeys to be equally uncertain, I have never entrusted a letter to anyone—either for
          Epirus, or Athens, or Asia, or anywhere else—unless he was going expressly to you. For my
          letters are not of the sort to make their non-delivery a matter of indifference; they
          contain so many confidential secrets that I do not as a rule trust them even to an
          amanuensis, for fear of some jest leaking out in some direction or another. <milestone
            unit="para"/>The consuls are in a blaze of infamy because Gaius Memmius, one of the
          candidates, read out in the senate a compact which he and his fellow candidate, Domitius
          Calvinus, had made with the consuls—that both were to forfeit to the consuls 40 sestertia
          apiece (in Case they were themselves elected consuls), if they did not produce three
          augurs to depose that they had been present at the passing of a <foreign xml:lang="la">lex
            curiata</foreign>, which, in fact, had not been passed; and two consulars to depose to
          having helped to draft a decree for furnishing the consular provinces, though there had
          not even been a meeting of the senate at all. <note n="1" anchored="true">The object of
            the existing consuls in making such a bargain was to get to their provinces without
            difficulty, with <foreign xml:lang="la">imperium</foreign>, which had to be bestowed by
            a formal meeting of the old <foreign xml:lang="la">comitia curiata</foreign>. But that
            formality could be stopped by tribunes or other magistrates "watching the sky," or
            declaring evil omens: and just as these means were being resorted to to put off the
            elections, so they were also likely to be used in this matter. If it was thus put off
            into the next year, Domitius and Appius, not being any longer consuls, would have still
            greater difficulty. Corrupt as the arrangement was, it seems not to have come under any
            existing law, and both escaped punishment. Appius went as proconsul to <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Cilicia</foreign>, in spite of the <foreign xml:lang="la">lex
              curiata</foreign> not being passed, but Domitius Ahenobarbus seems not to have had a
            province. The object of Domitius Calvinus and Memmius in making the compact was to
            secure their own election, which the existing consuls had many means of assisting, but
            it is not clear what Memmius's object in disclosing it was. Perhaps anger on finding his
            hopes gone, and an idea that anything that humiliated Ahenobarbus would be pleasing to
            Caesar. He also seems to have quarrelled with Calvinus. Gaius Memmius Gemellus is not to
            be confounded with Gaius Memmius the tribune mentioned in the next letter. </note> As
          this compact was alleged not to have been a mere verbal one, but to have <pb n="301"/>
          been drawn up with the sums to be paid duly entered, formal orders for payment, and
          written attestations of many persons, it was, on the suggestion of Pompey, produced by
          Memmius, but with the names obliterated. It has made no difference to Appius—he had no
          character to lose! To the other consul it was a real knock-down blow, and he is, I assure
          you, a ruined man. Memmius, however, having thus dissolved the coalition, has lost all
          chance of election, and is by this time in a worse position than ever, because we are now
          informed that his revelation is strongly disapproved of by Caesar. Our friend Messalla and
          his fellow candidate, Domitius Calvinus, have been very liberal to the people. Nothing can
          exceed their popularity. They are certain to be consuls. But the senate has passed a
          decree that a "trial with closed doors" should be held before the elections in respect to
          each of the candidates severally. by the panels already allotted to them all. The
          candidates are in a great fright. But certain jurors—among them Opimius, Veiento, and
          Rantius—appealed to the tribunes to prevent their being called upon to act as jurors
          without an order of the people. <note n="1" anchored="true">There is considerable
            uncertainty as to the exact nature of <foreign xml:lang="la">judicium tacitum</foreign>,
            here rendered "a trial with closed doors," on the analogy of the <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >senatus consultum tacitum</foreign> described by Capitolinus, <title>in
              Gordian.</title> ch. xli. It is not, I think, mentioned elsewhere (<foreign
              xml:lang="la">judiciis tacitis</foreign> of Off. 2.24, is a general expression for
            "anonymous expressions of opinion"), and the passage in Plutarch (<bibl n="TLG7.50 44"
              >Cato Min. 44) introduces a new difficulty, for it indicates a court in which
              candidates <emph>after</emph> election are to purge themselves. Again, <foreign
                xml:lang="la">quae erant omnibus sortita</foreign> is very difficult. Cicero nowhere
              else, I believe, uses the passive <foreign xml:lang="la">sortitus</foreign>. But,
              passing that, what are the <foreign xml:lang="la">consilia</foreign> meant? The tense
              and mood shew, I think, that the words are explanatory by the writer, not part of the
              decree. I venture, contrary to all editors, to take <foreign xml:lang="la"
                >omnibus</foreign> as dative, and to suppose that the <foreign xml:lang="la"
                >consilia</foreign> meant are those of the <foreign xml:lang="la">album
                judicum</foreign> who had been selected to try cases of <foreign xml:lang="la"
                >ambitus</foreign>, of which many were expected. There is no proof that the <foreign
                xml:lang="la">judices</foreign> in a <foreign xml:lang="la">judicium
                tacitum</foreign> had to be senators, and the names in the next sentence point the
              other way. The senate proposed that the law should allow this selection from the
                <foreign xml:lang="la">album</foreign> to form the <foreign xml:lang="la">judicium
                tacitum</foreign>, which would give no public verdict, but on whose report they
              could afterwards act.</bibl>
          </note> The business goes on. The <foreign xml:lang="la">comitia</foreign> are postponed
            <pb n="302"/> by a decree of the senate till such time as the law for the "trial with
          closed doors " is carried. The day for passing the law arrived. Terentius vetoed it. The
          consuls, having all along conducted this business in a half-hearted kind of way, referred
          the matter back to the senate. Hereupon -Bedlam! my voice being heard with the rest.
          "Aren't you wise enough to keep quiet, after all?" you will say. Forgive me: I can hardly
          restrain myself. But, nevertheless, was there ever such a farce? The senate had voted that
          the elections should not be held till the law was passed: that, in case of a tribunician
          veto, the whole question should be referred to them afresh. The law is introduced in a
          perfunctory manner: is vetoed, to the great relief of the proposers: the matter is
          referred to the senate. Upon that the senate voted that it was for the interest of the
          state that the elections should be held at the earliest possible time! Scaurus, who had
          been acquitted a few days before, <note n="1" anchored="true">M. Aemilius Scaurus was
            acquitted on the 2nd of September on a charge of extortion in <foreign xml:lang="la"

            money in bribing for the consulship. Hence he could not begin distributing his gifts to
            the electors till after September 2nd, and his rivals Domitius and <foreign

          after a most elaborate speech from me on his behalf—when all the days up to the 29th of

            <foreign xml:lang="la">comitia</foreign> by notices of ill omens put in by Scaevola—paid
          the people what they expected at his own house, tribe by tribe. But all the same, though
          his liberality was more generous, it was not so acceptable as that of the two mentioned
          above, who had got the start of him. I could have wished to see your face when you read
          this; <note n="2" anchored="true">He means that Atticus—as a lender of money—would be glad
            of anything that kept the rate of interest up (see p. 286). He is, of course, joking.
          </note> for I am certain you entertain some hope that these transactions will occupy a
          great many weeks ! But there is to be a meeting of the senate today, that is, the 1st of
          October—for day is already breaking. There no one will speak his mind except Antius and
          Favonius, <note n="3" anchored="true">Antius is not known. Favonius was a close imitator
            of Cato's Stoicism. He was now opposing both Pompey and Caesar strenuously, but on the

        <p> As it is, <note n="1" anchored="true">The beginning of the letter is lost, referring to
            the acquittal of Gabinius on a charge of <foreign xml:lang="la">majestas</foreign>.
          </note> to tell you my opinion of affairs, we must put up with it. You ask me how I have
          behaved. With firmness and dignity. "What about Pompey," you will say, "how did he take
          it?" With great consideration, and with the conviction that he must have some regard for
          my position, until a satisfactory atonement had been made to me. "How, then," you will
          say, "was the acquittal secured?" It was a case of mere dummies, <note n="2"
            anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">gorgei=a gumna/</foreign>, "mere bugbears." </note> and
          incredible incompetence on the part of the accusers—that is to say, of L. Lentulus, son of
          Lucius, who, according to the universal murmur, acted collusively. In the next place,
          Pompey was extraordinarily urgent; and the jurors were a mean set of fellows. Yet, in
          spite of everything, there were thirty-two votes for conviction, thirty-eight for
          acquittal. There are the other prosecutions hanging over his head: he is by no means
          entirely free yet. You will say, "Well, then, how do <emph>you</emph> bear it?" With the
          best air possible, by heaven! and I really do plume myself on my behaviour. We have lost,
          my dear Pomponius, not only all the healthy sap and blood of our old constitution, but
          even its colour and outward show. There is no Republic to give a moment's pleasure or a
          feeling of security. "And is that, then," you will say, "a satisfaction to you?" Precisely
          that. For I recall what a fair course the state had for a short time, while I was at the
          helm, and what a return has been made me! It does not give me a pang that one man absorbs
          all power. The men to burst with envy are those who were indignant at my having had some
          power. There are many things which console me, without my departing an inch from my
          regular position; and I am returning to the life best suited to my <pb n="326"/> natural
          disposition—to letters and the studies that I love. My labour in pleading I console by my
          delight in oratory. I find delight in my town house and my country residences. I do not
          recall the height from which I have fallen, but the humble position from which I have
          risen. As long as I have my brother and you with me, let those fellows be hanged, drawn,
          and quartered for all I care: I can play the philosopher with you. That part of my soul,
          in which in old times irritability had its home, has grown completely callous. I find no
          pleasure in anything that is not private and domestic. You will find me in a state of
          magnificent repose, to which nothing contributes more than the prospect of your return.
          For there is no one in the wide world whose feelings are so much in sympathy with my own.
          But now let me tell you the rest. Matters are drifting on to an <foreign xml:lang="la"
            >interregnum</foreign>; and there is a dictatorship in the air, in fact a good deal of
          talk about it, which did Gabinius also some service with timid jurors. All the candidates
          for the consulship are charged with bribery. You may add to them Gabinius, on whom L.
          Sulla had served notice, feeling certain that he was in a hopeless position—Torquatus
          having, without success, demanded to have the prosecution. But they will all be acquitted,
          and henceforth no one will be condemned for any. thing except homicide. This last charge
          is warmly pressed, and accordingly informers are busy. M. Fulvius Nobilior has been
          convicted. Many others have had the wit to abstain from even putting in an appearance. Is
          there any more news? Yes! After Gabinius's acquittal another panel of jurors, in a fit of
          irritation, an hour later condemned Antiochus Gabinius, some fellow from the studio of
          Sopolis, a freedman and orderly officer of Gabinius, under the <foreign xml:lang="la">lex
            Papia</foreign>. Consequently he at once remarked, "So the Republic will not acquit me
          under the law of treason as it did you!" <note n="1" anchored="true">Antiochus Gabinius
            was tried, not for treason (<foreign xml:lang="la">maiestas</foreign>), but under the
              <foreign xml:lang="la">lex Papia</foreign>, for having, though a <foreign
              xml:lang="la">peregrinus</foreign>, acted as a citizen; but he says "will not acquit
            me of <emph>treason</emph>," because he means to infer that his condemnation was really
            in place of Gabinius, whose acquittal had irritated his jury; therefore he was
            practically convicted of <foreign xml:lang="la">majestas</foreign> instead of his patron
            Gabinius. I have, accordingly, ventured to elicit the end of a hexameter from the Greek
            letters of the MS., of which no satisfactory account has been given, and to read
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Itaque dixit statim "respublica lege maiestatis</foreign>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ou) soi/ ken a)/r' i)/sa/ m' a)fei/h</foreign> (or <foreign
              xml:lang="grc">a)fi/h|</foreign>)." The quotation is not known. Antiochus Gabinius was
            doubtless of Greek origin and naturally quoted Greek poetry. <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Sopolis</foreign> was a Greek painter living at Rome (<bibl n="Plin. Nat. 35.40"
              >Pliny, N. H. 35.40</bibl>, 43). </note>
          <pb n="327"/> Pomptinus wants to celebrate a triumph on the 2nd of November. He is openly
          opposed by the praetors Cato and Servilius and the tribune Q. Mucius. For they say that no
          law for his <foreign xml:lang="la">imperium</foreign> was ever carried : <note n="1"
            anchored="true">Pomptinus had been waiting outside Rome for some years to get his
            triumph (see p.309). The <foreign xml:lang="la">negant latum de imperio</foreign> must
            refer to a <foreign xml:lang="la">lex curiata</foreign> originally conferring his
              <foreign xml:lang="la">imperium</foreign>, which his opponents alleged had not been
            passed. The <foreign xml:lang="la">insulse latum</foreign> refers to the law now passed
            granting him the triumph in spite of this. This latter was passed by the old trick of
            the praetor appearing in the <foreign xml:lang="la">campus</foreign> before daybreak to
            prevent <foreign xml:lang="la">obnuntiatio</foreign>. The result was that the tribunes
            interrupted the procession, which led to fighting and bloodshed (Dio, 39, 65). </note>
          and this one too was carried, by heaven, in a stupid way. But Pomptinus will have the
          consul Appius on his side. <note n="2" anchored="true">Because he wanted to go to his
            province himself in spite of having failed to get a <foreign xml:lang="la">lex

          so long as he is alive. I think this affair, like many of the same sort, will come to
          nothing. Appius thinks of going to Cilicia without a law, and at his own expense. <note

              (<foreign xml:lang="la">ornare provinciam</foreign>). </note> I received a letter on

          Britain on the 26th of September. Britain done with ... hostages taken no booty ... a
          tribute, however, imposed; they were on the point of bringing back the army. Q. Pilius has
          just set out to join Caesar. If you have any love for me or your family, or any truth in
          you, or even if you have any taste left, and any idea of enjoying all your blessings, it
          is really time for you to be on your way home, and, in fact, almost here. I vow I cannot
          get on without you. And what wonder that I can't get on without <emph>you</emph>, when I
          miss Dionysius so much? The latter, in fact, as soon as the day comes, both I and my young

        <head>L. VETTIUS (LETTER L, A II, 24)</head>
        <p>L. Vettius, a kind of Titus Oates, was like the witness in "Great Expectations," prepared
          to swear "mostly anything." The interest attaching to such a sordid person is confined to
          the question whether he was really acting with the connivance of, or under an agreement
          with, any of the leading politicians of the day. If the principle of <foreign
            xml:lang="la">cui bono</foreign> is applied, it is evident that the gainers were the
          party of the trumvirs, whose popularity would be increased by a belief being created that
          their opponents the Optimates were prepared to adopt extreme measures to get rid of them.
          It would give them just the advantage which the Rye House plot gave Charles II. This is
          Cicero's view, it seems, of the matter, as insinuated in this letter and in his speech
          against Vatinius (24-26 Cp. <bibl>pro Sest. 132</bibl>). In the letter, however, his
          insinuations seem directed against Caesar: in the speech Vatinius is the scape-goat. But
          Vettius was not only a liar, but a bad liar. He made blunders; and when he brought in the
          name of Bibulus, he was not aware that Bibulus had got scent of something going on, and
          had secured himself by giving Pompey warning. He also did not tell consistent stories,
          mentioning names (such as that of Brutus) at one time, and withdrawing them at another. He
          was accordingly wholly discredited, and could therefore expect no protection from Caesar,
          who had been careful not to commit himself; and he had nothing for it but suicide, like
          Pigott at the time of the Parnell Commission. </p>
        <p>Cicero, then, would have us believe that Vettius had been instigated by Vatinius (acting
          for Caesar) to name Bibulus, L. Lucullus, Curio (father and son), L. Domitius Ahenobarbus,
          L. Lentulus, L. Paullus, Cicero himself, his son-in-law Piso, and M. Laterensis, as having
          been all more or less privy to the plot to murder Pompey and Caesar. That there was
          absolutely no such plot, and that Vettius broke down hopelessly when questioned. That the
          object was, (1) to irritate Pompey with the Optimates and so confirm him in his alliance
          with Caesar, (2) to discredit the Optimates generally. </p>
        <p>It may be well to state briefly the views put forward by our other authorities for this
          period. </p>
        <p>(1.) Suetonius (<bibl>Caes. 20</bibl>) appears to attribute the instigation of Vettius to
          Caesar, as also the murder of Vettius in prison, <pb n="383"/> after he broke down so
          flagrantly. The text of this passage, however, is somewhat doubtful.</p>
        <p>(2.) Appian (<bibl>B. C. 2. 12</bibl>) describes the scene as happening at the time that
          Caesar's agrarian law was being passed, and Bibulus was hustled in the forum. Vettius,
          with a drawn dagger, rushed into the crowd crying out that he had been sent by Bibulus,
          Cicero, and Cato to assassinate Caesar and Pompey, and that an attendant of Bibulus had
          given him the dagger. Vettius was arrested, put into prison to be questioned the next day,
          and was murdered during the night. Caesar meanwhile addressed the people and excited their
          anger; but after the death of Vettius the matter was hushed up. </p>
        <p>(3.) Plutarch (<bibl>Lucull. 42</bibl>) says that the "Pompeians," annoyed at finding the
          union with Caesar opposed by the leading Optimates, induced Vettius to accuse Lucullus and
          others of a plot to assassinate Pompey; and that the corpse of Vettius shewed evident
          signs of violence. </p>
        <p>(4.) Dio Cassius (<bibl>38-39</bibl>) says bluntly that Vettius was employed by Lucullus
          and Cicero to assassinate Pompey, and was got rid of in prison. He adds that Vettius was
          discredited by bringing in the name of Bibulus, who (as Cicero also says) had secured
          himself by giving Pompey warning. The conclusions seem to be (though in such a tangled
          skein of lies it is impossible to be sure), (1) that there was no plot, properly so
          called, though many of the Optimates, and Cicero among them, had used incautious language;
          (2) that Vettius was suborned by some person or party of persons to make the people
          believe that there was one ; (3) that Caesar—though there is not sufficient evidence to
          shew that he had been the instigator—was willing to take advantage of the prejudice
          created by the suspicions thus aroused ; (4) that though Vettius had served Cicero in his
          capacity of spy in the days of the Catilinarian conspiracy, and was able to report words
          of his sufficiently characteristic, yet this letter to Atticus exonerates Cicero from
          suspicion, even if there were a plot, and even if we Could believe that he could have
          brought himself to plot the death of Pompey.</p>

        <p> Yes, I saw well enough what your feelings were as I parted from you; what mine were I am
          my own witness. This makes it all the more incumbent on you to prevent an additional
          decree being passed, so that this mutual regret of ours may not last more than a year. As
          to Annius Saturninus, your measures are excellent. As to the guarantee, pray, during your
          stay at Rome, give it yourself. You will find several guarantees on purchase, such as
          those of the estates of Memmius, or rather of Attilius. As to Oppius, that is exactly what
          I wished, and especially your having engaged to pay him the 800 sestertia (about £ 6,400),
          which I am determined shall be paid in any case, even if I have to borrow to do so, rather
          than wait for the last day of getting in my own debts. <note n="1" anchored="true">These
            brief sentences are in answer to statements in the letter of <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Atticus</foreign> which Cicero in answering. In the absence of that letter and of any
            knowledge of the business referred to, we cannot fully explain them. The <foreign
              xml:lang="la">satisdatio</foreign> may refer either to a purchase or a sale on
            Cicero's part: if the former case, it means a security for payment of the purchase
            money, either in the shape of a deposit or otherwise; in the latter, a guarantee of
            title. Annius Saturninus is presumed to be a freedman of Annius Milo's, with whom Cicero
            may have had dealings for his patron. The "<foreign xml:lang="la"
              >satisdationes</foreign> of the Memmian or Attilian estates" are quoted as models;
            they may refer to the sales of the property of C. Memmius, condemned for <foreign

              <date when="-0057">B.C. 57</date>), of whose sale we know nothing. Oppius is probably
            C. Oppius, a friend and agent of Caesar, and the debt Cicero is determined to pay is a
            loan from Caesar. The word <foreign xml:lang="la">aperuisti</foreign> is peculiar; it is
            said to mean in regard to money, "to promise to pay" or "to put at a man's order." In

            <foreign xml:lang="la">Pomponia</foreign>, wife of Quintus Cicero. </note> The facts of
          the matter are these. On arriving at my place at Arpinum, my brother came to see me, and
          our first subject of conversation was yourself, and we discussed it at great length. After
          this I brought the conversation round to what you and I had discussed at Tusculum, on the
          subject of your sister. I never saw anything so gentle and placable as my brother was on
          that occasion in regard to your sister: so much so, indeed, that if there had been any
          cause of quarrel on the score of expense, it was not apparent. So much for that day. Next
          day we started from Arpinum. A country festival caused Quintus to stop at Arcanum; I
          stopped at Aquinum; but we lunched at Arcanum. <note n="2" anchored="true">Cicero had gone
            round by <foreign xml:lang="la">Arpinum</foreign>, either to visit his own villa or to

          am only a stranger here!" The origin of that was, as I think, the fact that <pb n="4"/>
          Statius had preceded us to look after the luncheon. Thereupon Quintus said to me, "There,
          that's what I have to put up with every day !" You will say, "Well, what does that amount
          to?" A great deal ; and, indeed, she had irritated even me : her answer had been given
          with such unnecessary acrimony, both of word and look. I concealed my annoyance. We all
          took our places at table except her. However, Quintus sent her dishes from the table,
          which she declined. In short, I thought I never saw anything better-tempered than my
          brother, or crosser than your sister : and there were many particulars which I omit that
          raised my bile more than they did that of Quintus himself. I then went on to Aquinum ;
          Quintus stopped at Arcanum, and joined me early the next day at Aquinum. He told me that
          she had refused to sleep with him, and when on the point of leaving, she behaved just as I

        </opener>
        <p> On the 10th of May, the date of this letter, I am about to start from my Pompeian villa,
          intending to stay to-night with Pontius <note n="1" anchored="true">L. Pontius Aquila, who
            afterwards lost his life in the campaign at <foreign xml:lang="la">Mutina</foreign>
              (<date when="-0043">B.C. 43</date>). We shall find Cicero staying there again, as well
            as <foreign xml:lang="la">Terentia</foreign>. </note> in his villa near Trebula. After
          that I mean to make regular days' journeys without any farther delay. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">Cicero was going to <foreign xml:lang="la">Brundisium</foreign> by the
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Appia</foreign>, but both his visit to his Pompeian villa and
            this other to Pontius in the <foreign xml:lang="la">Trebulanus ager</foreign> were
            considerable deviations from it, one to the south, the other to the north. </note> While
          in my Cuman villa I was much gratified by a visit from our friend Hortensius. <note n="3"
            anchored="true">The last time Cicero ever saw his great rival in the law courts, with,
            as well as against, whom he had so often pleaded. Hortensius died just as Cicero was
            returning from <foreign xml:lang="la">Cilicia</foreign>
          </note> When he asked me whether he could do anything for me, I answered in general terms
          about everything else ; but I begged him in particular to prevent, as far as in him lay,
          any extension of my provincial government. In this please confirm him, and tell him that I
          was much gratified by his visit, and by his promise to do this for me, and anything else I
          wanted besides. I have strongly urged the same on our friend Furnius, who, I see, will be
          a tribune for next year. <note n="4" anchored="true">That is, he would enter on his office
            10th December of the present year, and so would have a voice in the senate as to the
            arrangements of the provinces. </note> I had a kind of miniature Rome in my Cuman villa
          : there was such a crowd of people in the neighbourhood. <note n="5" anchored="true">April
            and May were the fashionable months, the season, for the Campanian coast. </note> In the
          midst of all this our friend "Rufio," seeing that he was being watched by Vestorius,
          tricked that gentleman by a <foreign xml:lang="la">ruse de guerre</foreign>. For he never
          came near me. "What!" you will say, "when Hortensius <pb n="6"/> came, in spite of being
          in weak health and living at such a distance and being the great Hortensius, and such a
          crowd of people besides—do you mean to say that he didn't come? So you didn't see the
          fellow at all?" How could I help seeing him, when my road lay through the mart of Puteoli?
          There as he was, I presume, doing some business, I said "How d'ye do?" to him ; and on a
          later occasion I bade him good-bye when he came out of his own villa and asked me whether
          he could do anything for me. A man like that is one to reckon ungrateful? Doesn't he
          rather deserve Commendation for not exerting himself to get a hearing ? <note n="1"
            anchored="true">Of this sort of episode, or jesting anecdote, it is difficult to see the
            point without fuller knowledge of the circumstances. We learn from Letter CCXXIII that
            C. Sempronius Rufus (whose name Cicero jestingly alters to the servile one of <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Rufio</foreign>) had some controversy with Vestorius as to money which
            he owed him, or property which he held, as Vestorius alleged illegally. He therefore
            avoided any meeting, and Cicero hints laughingly that it was a kindness to him (Cicero),
            as it saved him from the necessity of hearing the case as arbitrator. </note>
          <milestone unit="para"/>But to return to my subject. Do not imagine that anything can
          console me for this gigantic bore, except the hope that it will not last longer than a
          year. Many will not believe me in this, because they judge from the habit of others. You,
          who know the truth, pray use every exertion ; I mean, when the time comes for the question
          to be mooted. As soon as you return from Epirus, I beg you to write about public affairs
          and tell me anything you may detect. For satisfactory intelligence has not reached as far
          as this as to how Caesar took the senatorial resolution being written out ; <note n="2"
            anchored="true">If a decree was passed in the senate but vetoed by a tribune, it was
            called not a <foreign xml:lang="la">senatus consultum</foreign>, but an <foreign

            on record, it was written out (<foreign xml:lang="la">perscripta</foreign>), otherwise
            it dropped altogether. In Letter CCXXII there is a specimen of such an <foreign
              xml:lang="la">auctoritas</foreign> This referred, like those we shall hear of later,
            to a resolution of the senate that Caesar should resign his province before standing for
            the consulship, moved by the <foreign xml:lang="la">consul</foreign> Marcellus. </note>
          and there was also a rumour about the Transpadani, that they had been bidden to elect
            <foreign xml:lang="la">quattuorviri</foreign>. <note n="3" anchored="true">That is, that
            the towns north of the Padus should become <foreign xml:lang="la">municipia</foreign>

            present had only the <foreign xml:lang="la">ius</foreign>

        <p> On the 10th of May I arrived at his Trebulanum to stay with Pontius There two letters
          from you were delivered to me, dated two days before. On that same day, as I was leaving
          my Pompeian villa, I had delivered a letter for you to Philotimus ; nor have I at present
          anything to write about. Write me word what reports there are about politics, I beseech
          you. For in the towns I observe that there is much alarm, yet for the most part it is mere
          idle gossip. What you think about all this, and when the crisis will come, please let me
          know. What letter it is you want answered I don't know : for I have as yet received none
          except the two delivered to me at Trebulanum, of which the one contained the edict of P.
          Licinius, <note n="1" anchored="true">P. Licinius Crassus Dives, a jurisconsult who had
            governed Asia, and whose "edict" Cicero perhaps wanted as a model. </note> dated 7th
          May, the other an answer to mine from Minturnae How uneasy I feel, lest there should have
          been something more important than usual in the one which I haven't received, and to which
          you want an answer! With Lentulus I will bring you into favour. I like Dionysius much.
          Your Nicanor serve me excellently. Well, I have nothing more to say, and day is breaking.
          I think of going to Beneventum today. By disinterested conduct and attention to business I

        </opener>
        <p> I ARRIVED at Beneventum on the 11th of May. There I received the letter which in your
          previous letter (answered by me the same day from Pontius's Trebulanum) you had mentioned
          having sent. And, indeed, I have received two letters from you at Beneventum, one
          delivered to me by Funisulanus early in the morning, and a second handed to me by my
          secretary Tullius. I am much obliged by the pains you have taken about my first and most
          important commission : but your leaving town rather damps my hopes. <milestone unit="para"
          />As to the man you mention, I am coming round in that direction, not that -, but we are
          forced to be content with him for want of a better. About the other one, of whom you say
          that he appeared to you to be not unsuitable—I am afraid my daughter could not be
          persuaded, and you admit that there is not a pin to choose between them. For my part, I am
          not unreasonable ; but you will be away, and will not, therefore, have a hand in the
          business in my absence. For if either of. us were on the spot, some fairly satisfactory
          arrangement might be made with Servius, with Servilia to back him. As at present situated,
          even though it should be a thing I like, I don't see how I can do anything. <note n="1"
            anchored="true">This paragraph refers to the selection of a husband for <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Tullia</foreign>. She had been left a widow in <date when="-0057">B.C.
              57</date> by the death of C. Calpurnius <foreign xml:lang="la">Piso</foreign>, and her
            betrothal to Furius Crassipes (<date when="-0056">B.C. 56</date>) had either not ended
            in a marriage, or the marriage had been quickly dissolved. The two suitors now under
            consideration are P. <foreign xml:lang="la">Cornelius Dolabella</foreign> and Servius
            Sulpicius Rufus. I have translated Schuetz's text, <foreign xml:lang="la">nec me absente
              habebis rei rationem</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la">Servio fieri
              probable</foreign>. Professor Tyrrell's emendations seem to me to be very difficult. I
            take the meaning to be that Cicero thinks that Sulpicius might "do," with Servilia's
            support ; perhaps because something good might be got for him from Caesar (her reputed
            lover), though he is himself inclining to <foreign xml:lang="la">Dolabella</foreign>,
            and is uneasy at the negotiations going on when neither himself nor <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign> is in Rome. <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign>
            was a great friend of <foreign xml:lang="la">Servilia</foreign>. </note>
          <milestone unit="para"/>Now I come to the letter delivered to me by Tullius. <pb n="9"/>
          You have been very energetic about Marcellus. Accordingly, if the decree has passed the
          senate, please write me word : but if not, do your best to get the business through ; for
          a grant must be made to me, as also to Bibulus. <note n="1" anchored="true">Bibulus, like
            Cicero, had not taken a province after his consulship, and was now, in consequence of
            Pompey a law and the decree of the senate, forced to draw lots for one. Syria had fallen
            to him, where there were rumours of a Parthian invasion. There is no need, I think, to
            read <foreign xml:lang="la">alteram</foreign> before <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >conficies</foreign> (with Tyrrell): the additional troops and the money grant might
            be included in one decree. The former had been discussed before Cicero left Rome, and
            practically assented to ; but the <foreign xml:lang="la">consul</foreign> Sulpicius had
            made difficulties, and Cicero is afraid that outside influence may have been brought to
            bear upon senators against it. </note> I have no doubt of the decree of the senate being
          passed without difficulty, especially considering that it is a gain to the people. As to
          Torquatus, excellent! As to Mason and Ligur, that will do when they have come. As to the
          request of Chaerippus : since in this case also you have given me no "tip," <note n="2"
            anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">pro/sneusin</foreign>, "a nod," to shew your wish. Chaerippus
            had been with Quintus and was afterwards in Africa with Cornificius. He was probably a
            Greek secretary. </note> . . . "Bother your province! Must I look after him too?" Yes ;
          but only so far as to prevent there being any obstructive "debate!" or "count!" in the
          senate. <note n="3" anchored="true">If the magistrate chose he could put a question to the
            senate to be voted on without debate. Such business would be usually non-contentious or
            routine. If the senators, however, thought otherwise, they cried <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Consule</foreign>, i.e., ask the opinions (<foreign xml:lang="la"
              >sententiae</foreign>) of the members. If he gave way, speeches might follow, and the
            matter would be prolonged perhaps beyond several sittings (which always ended at
            sunset). The cry of "count" was like that in the House of Commons, demanding that those
            present should be counted, to see whether there was a <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >quorum</foreign>. We do not know what that <foreign xml:lang="la">quorum</foreign>
            was, except in certain special cases, but that a fixed number is mentioned in them e.g.,
            the decree <foreign xml:lang="la">de Bacchanalibus</foreign>) seems to shew that
            business was often done with less. </note> For as to the rest—, however, thank you for
          speaking to Scrofa. <note n="4" anchored="true">Cn. Tremellius <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Scrofa</foreign>, who had been a <foreign xml:lang="la">judex</foreign> in the
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Verres</foreign> case, seems to have been with Cicero for a
            time in <foreign xml:lang="la">Cilicia</foreign>. </note> As to what you say about
          Pomptinus, I quite agree. For the upshot is that, if he is going to be at Brundisium
          before the 1st of June, M. Annius and L. Tullius <note n="5" anchored="true">Three of

          Sicinius, <note n="6" anchored="true">Some provision in the edict which Cicero meant to
            publish in his province. </note>
          <pb n="10"/> I quite assent, provided only that this restriction does not apply to anyone
          who has done me a service. But I will turn the matter over, for I quite approve of it in
          principle. I will let you know what I have settled as to the plan of my journey, and also
          what Pompey means to do about the five prefects, when I have learnt it from himself. As to
          Oppius, you have acted quite rightly in having assured him of the 800 sestertia ; and
          since you have Philotimus <note n="1" anchored="true">A freedman of Terentia's, who seems
            to have managed her business affairs for her. </note> with you, pray see the business

            n="2" anchored="true">The debt to Caesar. See Letter CLXXXIII. </note> You will have
          relieved me of a great anxiety. <milestone unit="para"/>Now I have answered all your
          letter : but stay! I almost omitted your being short of paper. The loss is mine, if for
          lack of it your letter to me is curtailed. Why, you cost me a couple of hundred sesterces
          : <note n="3" anchored="true">Two hundred <foreign xml:lang="la">sestertii</foreign>.
            Others read <foreign xml:lang="la">sexcentas</foreign>, i.e., <foreign xml:lang="la"

            instead of the common <foreign xml:lang="la">aufer</foreign>, from which I think no
            satisfactory sense can be elicited. Cicero, in answer to Atticus's remark that he hadn't
            a good stock of paper by him, says jestingly that he is sorry he is so hard up, hut he
            is the same, for his letters to <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign> put him to
            great expense in paper. He (according to my interpretation) alludes to the jest again at
            the end of Letter CXCIX, where see note, p. 32. <foreign xml:lang="la"
            >Auferre</foreign>, "swallow up," "absorb"; cp. 1 Verr. 31, <foreign xml:lang="la">hi

          the cramped nature of this page shews you : while in return I expect from you a gazette of
          events, rumours, or even anything you know for certain about Caesar. <note n="4"

          day you mentioned in your letter. <note n="2" anchored="true">I.e., the 1st of June (p.

          Tarentum on the state of the Republic ; although I wish to know precisely up to what time
          I can write to you safely, that is, how long you are going to be in Rome, so that I may
          know either where to direct my letters henceforth, or how to avoid sending them to no
          purpose. But before you leave town, in any case let the payment of the 20 sestertia and
          the 800 sestertia be put straight. <note n="3" anchored="true">The debt to Caesar, but

        <p> I arrived at Tarentum on the 18th of May. As I had determined to wait for Pomptinus, I
          thought the most convenient thing was to spend those days in Pompey's society, and all the
          more because I saw that it gave him pleasure, for he has actually begged me to give him my
          company, and be at his house every day; and this I have gladly agreed to do. For I shall
          get many notable talks with him on the Republic, and I shall also be furnished with useful
          hints for this business of mine. <note n="1" anchored="true">The government of <foreign

          long as it is possible for it to do so. And yet I have no commission to give you, or
          anything to tell you. I have given you all my commissions, and I pray you carry them fully
          out in accordance with your promise : I will tell you any news I hear. There is one thing
          I shall not cease to urge as long as I think you are in town, namely, as to the debt to
          Caesar, that you will leave it settled and done with. I am eagerly looking for a letter

        <p> DAY after day, or rather more and more as the days go on, I send you shorter letters.
          For day after day I become more suspicious of your having started for Epirus. However, to
          prove to you that I have not neglected what you wrote to me about, I am informed by Pompey
          that he intends to appoint five new prefects <note n="1" anchored="true">See Letter
            CLXXXVI. The <foreign xml:lang="la">praefecti fabrum, socium</foreign>, etc., were
            nominated by the commander-in-chief, i.e., the <foreign xml:lang="la">consul</foreign>,
            in the Roman army. Later on it became the practice for a proconsul to a province to
            nominate a certain number of <foreign xml:lang="la">praefecti</foreign> with such
            duties, judicial or other, as he chose to give them. Sometimes, as in this instance
            perhaps, the office was honorary. Under the empire the name was extended to a large

        <p> INDIFFERENT health, from which I have now recovered (for though ill, I had no fever), as
          well as waiting for Pomptinus, of whom as yet no rumour even has reached me, have kept me
          for these twelve days at Brundisium; but I am looking out for an opportunity to set sail.
          Now if you are still at Rome—for I scarcely think you can be—but if you are, I am Very
          anxious <pb n="18"/> that you should give your attention to the following. In a letter
          received from Rome I am informed that my friend Milo writes to complain of my having
          ill-treated him in allowing Philotimus to have a share in the purchase of his property. I
          decided on that measure in accordance with the opinion of C. Duronius, <note n="1"
            anchored="true">A friend of <foreign xml:lang="la">Milo</foreign>, otherwise unknown.
          </note> whom I had had reason to believe exceedingly friendly to Milo, and whom I knew to
          be the sort of man you judge him to be. Now his object and mine too was this : first, that
          the property should remain under our control—lest some outsider, making the purchase at a
          high price, should deprive him of the slaves, a great number of which he had with him;
          secondly, that the settlement he had made upon Fausta should be respected. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">After condemnation involving a forfeiture of a man's property, the whole
            was usually purchased for a fixed <foreign xml:lang="la">sum</foreign> by one or more
            persons (<term>sectors</term>), who then disposed of it by auction and made what profit
            they Could. A man who had rich friends might save a wreck of it, (I) if they chose to
            purchase, returning him the balance made by the sale; (2) or sold enough of it to pay
            the price which they had bargained to pay the treasury, not exacting the surrender of
            personalty, slaves, etc., or at any rate taking only a moderate profit. This is what
            Cicero seems to mean that Philotimus (a freedman of Terentia's) was, with others, going
            to do in this case. Again, it was customary for a man receiving a dowry with his wife to
            give security for its repayment in case of divorce or death; such a security was usually
            respected in case of confiscation, the property being sold with that burden on it,
            though this payment was at times evaded., as in the case of the Confiscations of the
            triumvirs in <date when="-0042">B.C. 42</date> (Dio Cass. xlii. See Letter LXI. </note>
          There was the farther motive, that we should ourselves have less difficulty than anyone
          else in saving anything that could be saved. Now I would have you look thoroughly into the
          whole affair : for I am frequently having letters on it written in exaggerated terms. If
          he complains, if he writes about it to his friends, and if Fausta takes the same line, as
          I told Philotimus by word of mouth, and as he undertook to do, I would not have him take
          part in the purchase against the will of Milo. It would not be in the least worth our
          while. But if there is nothing in all this, you will decide the matter. Speak with
          Duronius. I have written also to Camillus and Lamia, <note n="3" anchored="true">C. Furius
            Camillus was a lawyer specially skilled in property law (<foreign xml:lang="la"

              >Lamia</foreign> is probably a lawyer also, but of him we know nothing. </note> and
          the more so because I did not feel confident of your being in Rome. The long and short of
          the whole thing <pb n="19"/> is this : decide as shall seem to you to be in accordance
          with my honour, good name, and interests. </p>

        <p> I arrived at Actium on the 14th of June, after having feasted like priests of Mars both
          at Corcyra and the Sybota Islands, owing to your presents, which Areus as well as my

          certain of passing through this extraordinary function without the least illegality or
          extortion. I only hope the Parthian will keep quiet and <pb n="21"/> fortune favour us ! I
          will do my part. Pray take care to let me know what you are doing, where you mean to be
          from time to time, in what state you left things at Rome, and, above all, about the 820
          sestertia. Put all that into one letter, carefully directed so as to be sure of reaching
          me in any case. But that my year of office should remain unchanged and without any
          addition being decreed, for this remember to take proper measures yourself and through all
          my friends, especially through Hortensius : for, though absent at present, when the
          question is not before the house, you will, as you said in one of your answers, be in town
          at the proper time. While pressing this upon you, I feel half-inclined to beg you also to
          fight against there being an inter-calation. <note n="1" anchored="true">That is, an
            intercalary month, after 23rd February, to correct the year. It was put in at the

          on your back. As for the year, stick to that at any rate. My son Cicero, the best-behaved

        <p> I ARRIVED at Athens on the 24th of June, and have now waited there three days for
          Pomptinus and have heard nothing as yet of his arrival. I am, believe me, wholly with you:
          and though I should have done so without them, yet I am thinking of you all the more
          vividly from being reminded by the traces of you in this place. In short, I assure you we
          talk of nothing else but you. But you, perhaps, would prefer to be told something about
          myself. Here you are then: up to now neither I nor any of my staff have been any expense
          to any town or individual. We receive nothing under the Julian law, <note n="1"
            anchored="true">The law passed by Iulius Caesar in his consulship, <date when="-0059"
              >B.C. 59</date>, limiting (among other things) the amount which provincial governors
            could demand in passing to and from their provinces. Cicero's boast is that he has not
            taken even what that law allowed. </note> nothing from any public host: my whole staff
          are impressed with the belief that they must have a regard for reputation. So far, well.
          This has been noticed with praise on the part of the Greeks and is being much talked of.
          For the rest, I am taking great pains, as I have perceived that you wished. But on this
          subject let us reserve our applause till the last act has been reached. Other
          circumstances are such that I frequently blame my folly for not having found some means of
          getting out of this business. How entirely unsuited to my character and habits! How true
          the proverb is, "Let the shoemaker stick to his last !" <note n="2" anchored="true"

          already? Why, you are not actually in the business !" I know that very well, and I expect
          greater trouble remains: even as far as it has gone, though I bear it with cheerful brow,
          I think, and expression, in my inmost heart <pb n="26"/> I am enduring agonies: so many
          instances are occurring every day of ill-temper or insolence, of foolish and senseless
          behaviour of every kind, both by speech and by refusal to speak. I don't give you details
          of these things, not because I wish to conceal them from you, but because they are
          difficult to explain. So you shall admire my self-restraint when I return safe and sound:
          I am bestowing such pains on the practice of this virtue. Well, enough of this. Though I
          had nothing in my mind that I intended to write about, because I haven't even the smallest
          idea as to what you are doing, and in what part of the world you are: nor, by Hercules,
          have I ever been so completely in the dark about my own affairs, as to what has been done
          about the debt to Caesar or Milo's liabilities; and no one has come, I don't say from my
          house, but even from Rome, to enlighten me as to what is going on in politics. Wherefore,
          if there is anything that you know on the subjects which you may suppose that I should
          wish to know, I shall be very much obliged if you take the trouble to have it transmitted
          to me. What else is there to say? Why, nothing except this: Athens has pleased me
          immensely, at any rate as far as the city itself and all that adorns it are concerned, and
          the affection of the inhabitants towards you, and what I may call a prepossession in
          favour of myself: but as to its philosophy—that is very topsy-turvey, if Aristus is
          supposed to represent it, in whose house I am staying. For your and my friend Xeno I
          preferred giving up to Quintus, and yet, owing to his proximity, we spend whole days
          together. <note n="1" anchored="true">Aristus, an Academician; <foreign xml:lang="la"

          case of the man of Comum was disgraceful. Even if he were not a magistrate, he was yet an

              <foreign xml:lang="la">Strabo</foreign> (Pompey's father), whose law also gave the
            Latin franchise to all <foreign xml:lang="la">Transpadani</foreign>. The colonists had
            suffered from attacks of neighbouring tribes, and Caesar, in virtue of a <foreign
              xml:lang="la">lex Vatinia</foreign> (<date when="-0059">B.C. 59</date>), had
            determined to settle there five thousand new colonists. This had been done in the course
            of his proconsulship, and he took great interest in the place. But the <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Optimates</foreign> were anxious to shew their disregard of all Caesar's
            consular acts, as done in spite of the <foreign xml:lang="la">obnuntiatio</foreign> of
            Regulus, and without the sanction of the senate. The <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Transpadani</foreign> had the Latin franchise only, but in a colony members of the
            local senate and magistrates had the full <foreign xml:lang="la">civitas</foreign>.
            Marcellus. by way of shewing that <foreign xml:lang="la">Comum</foreign> was not a
              <foreign xml:lang="la">colonia</foreign>, ordered one of its magistrates to be flogged
            on some pretext, which was equivalent to declaring him not to be a <foreign
              xml:lang="la">civis</foreign>. Cicero says that even if this were strictly legal, it
            was outrageous —an abuse of the law. The authorities are <bibl n="TLG551.17 2.26"
              >Appian, B.C. 2.26</bibl>; <bibl n="Suet. Jul. 28">Suet. Caes. 28</bibl> ; <bibl
              n="Plut. Caes. 29">Plut. Caes. 29</bibl>. </note> So he seems to me to have given no
          less cause of anger to our friend Pompey than to Caesar. But this is his own look-out. I
          think, from what you tell me that Varro says, that Pompey certainly means to go to Spain.
          I entirely disapprove of it, and indeed I easily convinced Theophanes that the best course
          was for him not to quit Rome to go anywhere. <note n="2" anchored="true">Pompey, when

          But if that does not prove sufficient, I shall have to take some stronger measure. For at
          present I am all smiles and indulgence, and, as I hope, am making considerable progress.
          But I have only studied the part of "tolerator"—as our friends the Sicilians call it <note

          him to say that I had taken measures about his affair in accordance with a letter from
          Memmius, and this pleased him very much. But Patron having urged me to request your
          Areopagus to cancel their minute, made in the archonship of Polycharmus, <note n="1"
            anchored="true">Eponymus archon of <date>B.C. <date to="-53" from="-54"
              >54</date>-53</date>. </note> it seemed best to Xeno, and afterwards to Patron
          himself, that I should write to Memmius, who had started for Mitylene the day before my
          arrival at Athens, to induce him to write to his agents that it might be done with his
          free consent. For Xeno felt sure that it would be impossible to get this concession from
          the Areopagites if Memmius were unwilling. Now Memmius had laid aside his design of
          building, but he was angry with Patron. So I wrote him a carefully expressed letter, of
          which I enclose you a copy. <milestone unit="para"/>Please comfort Pilia with a message
          from me. For I will tell you, though don't tell her. I received a packet which contained
          Pilia's letter. I abstracted, opened, and read it. It was in very sympathetic terms. The
          letters you got from Brundisium without one from me you must regard as having been sent

            by Cicero's jocose reference to his economy in paper, in Letter CLXXXVI (p. 10). The
            MSS. have some Greek letters, <foreign xml:lang="grc">nomana/ria</foreign>
            <foreign xml:lang="la">me</foreign>. Cicero says, "My real excuse for not writing was
            illness; for don't suppose I was really stingy about buying paper and its cost I" Both
            the excuse and its withdrawal are, of course, jests (and not very good ones). The
            mistake may possibly have arisen from Cicero writing the Latin word in Greek letters.

        <p> A sea voyage is a serious business, and in the month of July too. We got to Delos on the
          sixth day from Athens. On the 6th of July we got from the Piraeus to Zoster, with a
          troublesome wind, which kept us there on the 7th. On the 8th we got to Ceos with a
          pleasant voyage. Thence to Gyaros with a violent wind, though it wasn't against us. Hence
          to Syros, and from that to Delos ; we in both cases accomplished the passage quicker than
          we could have wished. You have had experience of Rhodian open vessels: they are the worst
          things in the world for rough water. Accordingly, my intention is not to be at all in a

          The fact is, however, that the tithe-collectors, as though I had come with <foreign

          had negotiated with you. So enough of that. I return to affairs in the city. In the name
          of fortune, since you are remaining at Rome, I beg of you, use every means of supporting

          range, which you know so well, wide enough field? and is my splendid <pb n="44"/> industry
          likely to rust unemployed? Why, just look at this! That I should be sitting in court at
          Laodicea, while A. Plotius is doing so at Rome! And that, while our friend has that great
          army, I should have nominal command of two wretched legions! But the fact is, that it is
          not such things as these that I miss: it is the broad daylight of life, the forum, the
          city, my town house, <emph>you</emph> that I miss. But I will endure it as best I may,
          provided that it does not last more than a year. If there is any extension, I am lost! But
          this may easily be resisted, if only you are in Rome. <milestone unit="para"/>You ask me
          what I am doing. Why, upon my life, I am living at a vast expense. I am wonderfully

          admirable, that I am afraid that the money I took up from you will have to be paid by a
          fresh loan. I avoid reopening any wounds inflicted by Appius, but they are patent and
          cannot be concealed. I am starting today, the 3rd of August, on which I despatch this
          letter, from Laodicea to the camp in Lycaonia: thence I think of going to the Taurus, that

          savagery worthy of some wild beast, rather than of a man. In short, they are absolutely
          weary of their life. <note n="2" anchored="true">In this brief summing—up of the state of
            things following the <foreign xml:lang="la">ad</foreign>. ministration of Appius, Cicero
            perhaps may plead that he is only retailing what he has heard in an <foreign
              xml:lang="la">ex parte</foreign> statement, but he seems to confirm it in subsequent
            letters, and it makes one sorry for the fulsome tone of his letters to Appius himself.
          </note> However, the wretched towns are somewhat relieved by my costing them nothing, nor
          my legates, nor quaestor, nor anyone. Let me tell you that I not only refuse to accept
          hay, which is customarily furnished under the Julian law, but that no one of us accepts
          even firewood, or anything else, except four beds and a roof to cover us ; in many
          districts we do not accept <pb n="46"/> even a roof, but remain, as a rule, under canvas.
          Accordingly, we are greeted by extraordinary throngs from farms, villages, houses, every
          sort of place. By Hercules, on my mere arrival, the justice, purity, and merciful heart of
          your Cicero seems to give them new life: so far has he surpassed everyone's hopes. Appius,
          as soon as he heard of my arrival, hurried to the most distant part of the province, right
          up to Tarsus: there he is holding sessions. About the Parthian not a word: but,
          nevertheless, some who come from those parts announce that some cavalry of ours have been
          cut to pieces. Bibulus even now is not so much as thinking of approaching his province.
          People say that he is acting thus because he wishes to leave it somewhat later. <note
            n="1" anchored="true">Bibulus did not return till <date when="-0049">B.C. 49</date>.,
            some months after Cicero. See Letter CCXCIII. </note> We are making all haste to the
          camp, which is two days' journey away. </p>

        <p> I have received a packet of letters from Rome without one from you, for which, granting
          you to be well and in Rome, I imagine the fault to be Philotimus's, not yours. I dictate
          this letter sitting in my carriage, on my way to the camp, from which I am two days'
          journey distant. In a few days' time I am going to have men on whom I can rely to take
          letters. Accordingly, I reserve myself for that. However, I will just say, though I should
          prefer your hearing this from others—I am so conducting myself in the province that no
          farthing is spent on anyone. This is owing also to the careful conduct of legates,
          tribunes, and prefects. For one and all entertain a surprising desire to vie with each
          other in maintaining my reputation. My friend Lepta is wonderful in that respect. But at
          present I am in a hurry: I will write everything' in <pb n="47"/> full to you in a few
          days. The younger Deiotarus <note n="1" anchored="true">Son and successor of the
            Deiotarus, tetrarch of Galatia, whom Cicero defended. The younger man's title was
            probably granted him for money, through one of the proconsuls of <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Cilicia</foreign> or Asia ; some territory was attached to it, as he had a military
            force, with which he helped Cassius against the Parthians (11 Phil. 31). </note> who has
          received the title of king from the senate, has taken my son and nephew with him to his
          own dominions. So long as I am in the summer camp, I thought that the safest place for the
          boys. Sestius has written me an account of his conversation with you about my domestic
          anxiety, which is a very serious one, and of what your opinion is. Pray throw yourself
          into that matter, and write me word what can be done and what you think. He also told me
          that Hortensius had said something or other about the extension of my provincial
          government. He promised me at Cumae that he would most energetically plead for my being
          kept here only a year. If you have any affection for me, strengthen this position. I
          cannot tell you how against the grain my absence from you is. At the same time, too, I
          hope that my present reputation for justice and purity will be all the more conspicuous if
          I quit the province early. This is what happened to Scaevola, <note n="2" anchored="true"
            >Quintus Mucius <foreign xml:lang="la">Scaevola</foreign>, "the most eloquent of lawyers
            and the best lawyer of orators," was <foreign xml:lang="la">consul</foreign>

              >B.C. 82</date>. </note> who governed Asia only nine months. Our friend Appius, as
          soon as he saw that I was on the point of arriving, left Laodicea and went as far as
          Tarsus. There he is holding an assize, though I am actually in the province. However, I do
          not make any fuss about this slight upon myself ; for I have enough to do in healing the
          wounds which have been inflicted upon the province. This I am taking care to do with as
          little reflection upon him as possible: but I should like you to tell our friend Brutus
            <note n="3" anchored="true">M. <foreign xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign>, who had married

        <p> How I wish you were in Rome, if by chance you are not there! For I have nothing to go
          upon except having received a letter from you dated 19th July, in which you said that, you
          intend going to Epirus about the 1st of August. But whether you are in Rome or Epirus, the
          Parthians have crossed the Euphrates under Pacorus, son of the Parthian king Orodes, with
          nearly all his forces. I have not yet heard of the arrival of Bibulus in Syria. Cassius is
          in the town of Antioch with the whole army: <note n="1" anchored="true">C. Cassius
            Longinus (the future assassin of Caesar) had been quaestor under Crassus, and since his
            death in <date when="-0053">B.C. 53</date> had been holding the province of Syria as
            proquaestor. He decisively defeated the Parthians before Bibulus arrived. He was born in
              <date when="-0085">B.C. 85</date>, and was married to a half-sister of <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign>. </note> I am in Cappadocia, close to <pb n="59"/> the
          Taurus, with my army near Cybistra: the enemy is in Cyrrhestica, which is the part of
          Syria next to my province. On these subjects I have sent a despatch to the senate. This
          despatch please look at, if you are in Rome, and consider whether you think it ought to be
          delivered ; and so with many other things, or rather with all, chief of which is that
          there be no "slip betwixt the cup and the lip" <note n="1" anchored="true">The Latin
            proverb is <foreign xml:lang="la">inter caesa et porrecta</foreign>, between the killing
            of the victim and the examining of its entrails and placing them on the altar, thus
            completing the sacrifice. Something ill-omened might happen in the interval preventing
            the completion ; so Cicero fears something may crop up to prevent the naming of his
            successor. </note> —as the saying is—to add additional burden upon me, or an extension
          of my time. For, considering the weakness of my army, and the short supply of allies,
          especially faithful ones, my most trustworthy support is winter. If that has once come,
          and they have not first crossed into my province, the only thing I fear is that the senate
          will not allow Pompey to leave Rome, owing to the alarming state of affairs in the city.
          But if it sends some one else next spring, I do not trouble myself, always providing that
          my term of office is not prolonged. <note n="2" anchored="true">Cicero appears to think
            the Parthian danger so grave, that the idea might be entertained of sending Pompey in
            command of an army. This would supersede himself in his military capacity, but he is
            prepared to welcome him, though no one else, till the following spring, when he shall
            have ceased to care for anything but the certainty of an early departure from his
            province. As a matter of fact, the sending of Pompey or Caesar was talked of at Rome,
            but it does not seem to have been seriously contemplated. </note> So much for you if you
          are at Rome. But if you are out of town, or even if you are not, the state of affairs here
          is this: we are in good spirits ; and since, as it seems, our plans are well laid, we
          cherish the hope that we are strong enough also to carry them out. We have pitched our
          camp in a safe spot, well supplied in the matter of corn, almost commanding a view of
          Cilicia, convenient for shifting quarters, and with an army which, although small, is yet,
          I hope, entirely loyal to me ; and we are about to double its numbers by the arrival of
          Deiotarus in full force. I have found the allies much more loyal than anyone has ever
          done: and they can scarcely believe their eyes when they see the mildness of my
          administration <pb n="60"/> and the purity of my conduct. A levy of Roman citizens is
          being held ; corn is being carted from the country to places of safety. If, then, occasion
          arises, we shall defend ourselves by force ; if not, by the strength of our position.
          Wherefore do not be alarmed. For I have you before my eyes, and I perceive, as though you
          were present, your affectionate solicitude for me. <milestone unit="para"/>Now I beg you,
          if it is in any way possible, supposing my affair to remain undecided up to the 1st of
          January, to be in Rome in January. I am quite certain of receiving no unfair treatment if
          you are on the spot. The consuls are my friends, the tribune Furnius is wholly devoted to
          me. Still there is need of your persistence, good sense, and popularity. It is a momentous
          crisis. But it is not decent for me to press you at greater length. <milestone unit="para"
          />Our two Ciceros are staying with Deiotarus, but, if it shall be necessary, they will be
          transferred to Rhodes. <note n="1" anchored="true">His son and nephew, the young Marcus
            and Quintus. See Letter CCVIII. </note> Do you, if in Rome, with your accustomed
          punctuality, and anyhow, even if you are in Epirus, send one of your servants with
          letters, that both you may know what I am doing, and I what you are doing or about to do.
          I am doing your friend Brutus's business for him better than he would have done it
          himself. But I now produce my ward, and do not attempt to defend him. For they are a
          dilatory lot, and there is nothing to be got out of them. However, I will satisfy you,
          which is more difficult than satisfying Brutus himself. But in truth, I will satisfy you
          both. <note n="2" anchored="true">This refers to money owed to <foreign xml:lang="la"

          <dateline>IN CAMP AT PINDENISSUS, 19 DECEMBER</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> ON the morning of the Saturnalia (17th December) the Pindenissetae surrendered to me, on
          the fifty-seventh day from the beginning of our investment of them. "Who the mischief are
          your Pindenissetae? who are they?" you will say: "I never heard their name." Well, what am
          I to do? Could I turn Cilicia into an Aetolia or a Macedonia? Let me tell you this, that
          with an army such as mine, and in a place like this, such a big business was impossible.
          You shall have it all <foreign xml:lang="fr">en abrégé</foreign>; as you agreed in your
          last letter to take it. You know about my arrival at Ephesus, for you have congratulated
          me on my enthusiastic reception on that day, which gave me as much pleasure as anything
          ever did in my life. Thence, after a surprising reception in such towns as lay on my road,
          I arrived at Laodicea on the 31st of July. I remained there two days in the midst of great
          enthusiasm, and by my conciliatory language removed the rankling injuries of the last four
          years. I did the same afterwards during my five days stay at Apamea and three days at
          Synnada, five at Philomelium, ten at Iconium. Nothing could be more impartial, mild, or
          dignified, than my administration of justice there. Thence I came to the camp on the 24th
          of August; on the 28th I inspected the army at Iconium. From this camp, on receipt of
          serious news as to the Parthians, I started for Cilicia by way of that part of Cappadocia
          which borders on Cilicia, with the design of impressing upon the Armenian Artavasdes and
          the Parthians themselves that they were precluded from entering Cappadocia. After having
          been encamped for five days at Cybistra in Cappadocia, I got <pb n="87"/> intelligence
          that the Parthians were at a long distance from that entrance into Cappadocia, and were
          rather threatening Cilicia. I therefore marched rapidly into Cilicia by the "Gates" of
          Taurus. I arrived at Tarsus on the 5th of October. Thence I pressed on to Mount Amanus,
          which divides Syria from Cilicia by the line of its watershed—a mountain full of
          immemorial enemies. Here, on the 13th of October, we cut a large number of the enemy to
          pieces. We took some very strongly fortified posts by a night attack of Pomptinus's, and
          by one led by myself in the morning, and burnt them. I was greeted as <foreign
            xml:lang="la">imperator</foreign> by the soldiers. For a few days we were encamped on
          the very spot which Alexander had occupied against Darius at Issus, a commander not a
          little superior to either you or me! Having stayed there five days, and having ravaged and
          devastated Amanus, we evacuated that place. For you know that there are things called
          "panics," called also "war's idle rumours." <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ta panika/, ta\ kena\ tou= pole/mou</foreign>. See Polyb. xxix.
            6, <foreign xml:lang="grc">polla\ kena\ tou= pole/mou</foreign>. </note> From the report
          of our arrival encouragement was at once given to Cassius, then confined to Antioch, and
          alarm inspired in the Parthians. Accordingly, as they were retiring from that town,
          Cassius pursued them and gained a hand-some victory. In the course of this retreat the
          Parthian leader, Osaces, a man in high authority, received a wound of which a few days
          afterwards he died. My name became very popular in Syria. Meanwhile Bibulus arrived. I
          suppose he wanted to be on an equality with me in the matter of this vain acclamation of
            <foreign xml:lang="la">imperator</foreign>. In this same Mount Amanus he begins "looking
          for a bay-leaf in a wedding cake." <note n="2" anchored="true">An easy feat. Wedding cakes
            were baked on bay-leaves. </note> But he lost the whole of his first cohort and the
          centurion of the first line, a man of high rank in his own class, Asinius Dento, and the
          other centurions of the same cohort, as well as a military tribune, Sext. Lucilius, son of
          T. Gavius Caepio, a man of wealth, and high position. It was really a very galling blow
          both in itself and in the time of its reception. I was at Pindenissus, the most strongly
          fortified town of Eleutherocilicia, <note n="3" anchored="true">The <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Eleutherocilices</foreign> were the mountain tribes that had not been completely
            subjected to the Roman province. </note> never peaceful within living memory. The <pb
            n="88"/> people were fierce and brave, and furnished with everything necessary for
          standing a siege. We surrounded it with stockade and ditch, with a huge earthwork,
          pent-houses, an exceedingly lofty tower, a great supply of artillery, a large body of
          archers. After great labour and preparation I finished the business without loss to my
          army, though with a large number of wounded. I am spending a merry Saturnalia, and so are
          my soldiers, to whom I have given up all spoil except captives: the captives were sold on
          the third day of the Saturnalia (I 9th December), the day on which I write this. The sum
          realized at the tribunal is 12,000 sestertia (about £ 96,000). I intend to hand over the
          army to my brother Quintus to lead hence into winter quarters in the disturbed districts.
          I am myself going back to Laodicea. <milestone unit="para"/>So much for this. But to
          return to points omitted. As to what you urge upon me most warmly, and which in fact is
          more important than anything else, namely, your anxiety that I should satisfy my carping
          Ligurian critic, <note n="1" anchored="true">Supposed to refer to P. Aelius <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Ligur</foreign>, tribune in <date when="-0057">B.C. 57</date>, and a
            bitter opponent. </note> may I die if anything could be more fastidious than my conduct.
          And I do not now speak of it as "self-restraint," which is a virtue considered capable of
          resisting pleasure: while the fact is that I never in all my life felt such pleasure as I
          do at my own integrity. And it is not so much the reputation I get by it—though that is of
          the highest—as the thing itself that delights me. In short, it was worth the trouble: I
          never appreciated myself or knew fully of what I was capable in this direction. I have
          good reason for being puffed up. Nothing could be more splendid. Meanwhile, here is a
          score for me! Ariobarzanes is alive and a king all owing to me. By my prudence and
          prestige, and by refusing to receive even the visits, to say nothing of the bribes, of the
          conspirators against his life, I have, merely <foreign xml:lang="fr">en Passant</foreign>,
          saved a king and a kingdom. In the meantime from Cappadocia not the value of a hair! I
          have recovered Brutus from his dejection, whom I love no less than you do, I had almost
          said, than I do you. And I almost hope that throughout my year of office not a farthing's
          expense will be caused to my province. There is the whole story for you. <pb n="89"/>
          <milestone unit="para"/>I am now composing an official despatch to send to Rome. It will
          be somewhat fuller of matter than if I had sent it from Amanus. But to think that you
          won't be at Rome! And yet everything depends on the 1st of March. For I am afraid, if; on
          the question of the province coming up, Caesar shall refuse compliance, I may be kept
          here. If you were there when this was going on, I should not have been at all afraid. I
          return to the city news, which, after a long interval of ignorance, I have at length
          learnt from your most delightful letter received on the 16th of December. This was
          conveyed by your freedman Philogenes after a very long and far from safe journey. For the
          letter you say that you delivered to the slaves of Laenius I have not received. I am
          delighted about Caesar, and the decrees of the senate, and at what you expect to happen.
          If he gives way to these we are safe. That Seius got scorched in Plaetorius's fire does
          not grieve me much. <note n="1" anchored="true">M. Plaetorius Cestianus, condemned for

          has been done about it. For myself, as soon as I arrive at Laodicea I am bidden to invest

          will keep a more than usually careful eye upon him. Deiotarus, who has been of great

          with our two boys. <note n="2" anchored="true">His son Marcus and nephew Quintus, who had
            been on a visit to the younger Deiotarus See Letters CCVIII, CCXVII. </note> I am
          expecting another letter from you from Epirus, that I may get a notion not only of your
          business life, but of your holiday also. Nicanor serves me well and receives liberal
          treatment at my hands. I think I shall send him to Rome with my official despatch, to
          secure its being conveyed with more than common promptitude, and that he may also bring me
          trustworthy intelligence about you and from you. That your Alexis so often puts in a
          greeting to me is gratifying. But why does he not treat me to a letter of his own, as my

          <salute>TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS)</salute>
          <dateline>LAODICEA, 13 FEBRUARY</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> I am very glad to hear of your safe arrival in Epirus, and that, as you say, you had a
          pleasant voyage. I am a little annoyed at your not being in Rome at a crisis of great
          importance to me, but I console myself with the one reflexion, that you are having a
          pleasant winter there and are enjoying your rest. <note n="1" anchored="true">Reading
              <foreign xml:lang="la">hoc me tamen consolor uno: spero</foreign>, etc., for <foreign
              xml:lang="la">non spero</foreign>. If the latter is retained, it would mean, "I don't
            expect you are having a pleasant winter," i.e., and so will come back to Rome, where I
            want you. <foreign xml:lang="la">Uno</foreign> is Madvig's emendation, which deserves to
            be right, if it is not. </note> Gaius Cassius, brother of your friend Quintus Cassius,
          had sent a despatch—of which you ask me the meaning—written in a more modest strain than
          the later one in which he says that he had made an end of the Parthian war. It is true
          that the Parthians had retired from Antioch before the arrival of Bibulus, but it was from
          no success of our arms. At this present moment they are, as a matter of fact, wintering in
          Cyrrhestica, <note n="2" anchored="true">That is, within the province of Syria,
            immediately north of Antioch. </note> and a most serious war is impending. For the son
          of the Parthian king Orodes is within the Roman province, and Deiotarus, to whose son the
          daughter of Ariovasdes is betrothed—so he ought to know—has no doubt of the king himself
          intending to cross the Euphrates in full force at the beginning of summer. Besides, on the
          day on which Cassius's victorious despatch was read in the senate (dated the 7th of
          October) one was read from me also, announcing an alarm of war. My friend Axius says that
          my despatch made a great impression, that his was not credited. That of Bibulus had not
          yet been received, which I am quite sure will be thoroughly alarmist. The result of this,
          I fear, will be that, as Pompey is not allowed to be sent anywhere for fear of a
          revolution, and no attention is paid by the senate <pb n="126"/> to Caesar's demands,
          while this knot remains to be untied, the senate will not think that I ought to quit my
          province till a successor has arrived, and that in such troublous times legates should not
          be left in charge of two such important provinces. In view of this I tremble lest my
          tenure should be prolonged, without even a tribune being able to stop it, and all the more
          so that you are not in town to interpose, as you might have done in many cases by your
          advice, your personal influence and activity. But you will say I am piling up anxiety for
          myself with my own hands. I can't help it: I wish that it may be so. But everything causes
          me alarm. Though your letter that you wrote at Buthrotum in your sickness had a charming
          finale. "As I see and hope, there will be nothing to delay your departure from your
          province." I should have preferred that you had confined yourself to "as I see": there was
          no need to add "and hope." <milestone unit="para"/>Again, I have received a letter written
          just after the triumph of Lentulus, which came with great celerity by the hands of the
          postmen of the publicani. In this you reiterate the same "bitter-sweet," first saying that
          there will be no delay of my return, and then adding, "If anything goes wrong you will
          come to me." Your doubts torture me: at the same time you may see which of your letters I
          have received. For the one which you say yourself that you delivered to the centurion
          Hermon's servant I have not received. You have often mentioned having given a letter to
          Laenius's servants. That one Laenius did deliver to me at last, on my arrival at Laodicea,
          the 11th of February, dated the 21st of September. I will, at once by what I say to him,
          and by deeds hereafter, give Laenius reason to be satisfied with your recommendation. That
          letter had much news that was stale, one thing that was new—about the panthers from
          Cibyra. I am much obliged to you for telling M. Octavius that you didn't think I would do
          it. But pray henceforth, in any case of doubt, give a direct negative. The fact is that,
          supported by a spontaneous resolution of my own, and also, by Hercules, from the
          inspiration of your influence, I have surpassed everybody (and you will find this to be
          the case) in preserving clean hands, no less than in justice, courtesy, and mildness.
          Don't. imagine that anything has ever surprised <pb n="127"/> people more than the fact
          that not a farthing of expense has been caused to the province during my governorship,
          either for my public establishment or for any individual on my staff, except L Tullius.
          He,' who in other respects is clean-handed enough, did take something on the road in
          virtue of the Julian law not as others do at every hamlet, but once only and for the day's
          journey. <note n="1" anchored="true">The <foreign xml:lang="la">lex</foreign> Julia, while
            limiting the rapacity of governors, did allow certain supplies, such as hay, etc. (see
            p. 25), to be demanded from towns in the provinces. </note> He is the only one who has
          done so: and he forces me to make an exception when I say that not a farthing of expense
          has been caused. No one except him has taken anything. This blot I owe to our friend Q.
          Titinius. <note n="2" anchored="true">Apparently for recommending Tullius. </note>
          <milestone unit="para"/>At the end of the summer campaign I put my brother Quintus in
          charge of the winter quarters and of Cilicia. I have sent your friend Tiberius's
          son-in-law Quintus Volusius —not only a safe man, but also wonderfully disinterested—to
          Cyprus, with orders to stay some few days there, to prevent the few Roman citizens who are
          in business there from saying that they have no means of legal redress: for it is illegal
          for Cyprians to be cited in courts out of the island. <note n="3" anchored="true">See vol.
            i., p. 57 </note> I myself started for Asia from Tarsus on the 5th of January,
          accompanied by an admiration, which, by heaven, it is difficult to describe, from the
          cities in Cilicia, and specially from the people of Tarsus. As soon, however, as I had
          crossed the Taurus I found our dioceses in Asia on the tiptoe of expectation: for in the
          six months of my administration Asia had not received a single letter of injunction from
          me, nor had had a single official to entertain. Now before my time that particular period
          had been each year a source of gain, by. the richer states paying large sums of money to
          be exempted from furnishing the soldiers with winter quarters. The Cyprians used to pay
          200 Attic talents, from which island—I am not speaking in hyperbole, but the simple
          truth—not a single farthing is exacted under my administration. For these benefits, which
          they regard with speechless astonishment, I allow no honours, except verbal ones, to be
          decreed to me: statues, temples, marble chariots I forbid; nor am I a <pb n="128"/>
          nuisance to the states in any other respect—though I may be to you by thus blowing my own
          trumpet. But, an you love me, put up with it! It was you who wished me to act thus. My
          progress through Asia was of such a nature that even the famine, which prevailed in my
          part of Asia at the time—the most distressing thing there is—has been in a manner a
          welcome event. Wherever I went, without using force, legal compulsion, or strong language,
          I induced both the Greeks and Roman citizens, who had cornered the wheat, to promise large
          quantities to the communities. On the 13th of February—the day I am despatching this
          letter—I have arranged to hold a court at Laodicea for the district of Cibyra and Apamea:
          from the 15th of March at the same place for the districts of Synnada, Pamphylia (when I
          will look out for a horn for Phemius), Lycaonia, Isauria. After the 15th of May I start
          for Cilicia, with the view of spending June there—I hope without trouble from the
          Parthians. July, if all goes as I wish, will be needed for my return journey through the
          province. I entered the province at Laodicea in the consulship of Sulpicius and Marcellus
          on the 31st of July. I am due to leave it on the 30th of July. I shall first of all press
          my brother Quintus to allow himself to be left in charge, which will be very much against
          the wishes of us both. But that is the only respectable arrangement possible, especially
          as I cannot even now keep the excellent Pomptinus: for Postumius hurries him back to Rome,
          and perhaps Postumia <note n="1" anchored="true">Wife of Ser. Sulpicius. We have no
            knowledge as to why Postumius (see Letter CCCX) was able to hurry the return of
            Pomptiuus. Cicero seems to hint that <foreign xml:lang="la">Postumia</foreign> was his
            mistress, yet we hear of her afterwards as living with her husband and son. She is,
            however, credited by Suetonius with having intrigued with Caesar (<bibl
              n="Suet. Jul. 50">Suet. Caes. 50</bibl>). </note> also. <milestone unit="para"/>Now
          you know my plans. Next, let me enlighten you about Brutus. Your friend Brutus has among
          his intimates certain creditors of the people of Salamis in Cyprus, M. Scaptius and P.
          Matinius, whom he has recommended to me with more than common earnestness. I have not made
          the acquaintance of Matinius: Scaptius came to the camp to see me. I promised for the sake
          of Brutus to see that the Salaminians paid him the money. He thanked me, and asked for a
            <pb n="129"/> prefecture. I said that I never granted one to a man engaged in business,
          a rule of which I have already informed you. When Cn. Pompeius asked me he accepted the
          propriety of this rule—I need not mention Torquatus when he asked for your friend M.
          Laenius, and many others. But (I said) if he wanted to be a praefectus on account of the
          bond, I would see to his recovering the money. He thanked me and went away. Our friend
          Appius had granted certain squadrons of cavalry to this Scaptius to coerce the
          Salaminians, and had also given him rank as praefectus. He was harrying the Salaminians. I
          ordered the cavalry squadrons to quit Cyprus. Scaptius felt aggrieved. In short, to keep
          faith with him I commanded the Salaminians, when they came to see me at Tarsus and
          Scaptius with them, to pay the money. They had a great deal to say about the bond, a great
          deal about the wrongs inflicted upon them by Scaptius. I declined to hear it. I urged
          them, I even asked them as a favour, in consideration of my good services to their state,
          to settle the business: finally I said that I would use compulsion. The men not only did
          not refuse, but even said that they would be paying out of my pocket: for that, since I
          had declined the money they had been accustomed to pay the praetor, they would in a sense
          be paying out of my pocket, and indeed the debt to Scaptius amounted to considerably less
          than the praetorian contribution. I warmly commended them: "All right," said Scaptius,
          "but let us reckon the total." Then there arose this question: One of the clauses in my
          customary edict was a declaration that I would not recognize more than twelve per cent.
          interest, besides the yearly addition to the capital of interest accrued, <note n="1"
            anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Cum anatocismo anniversario</foreign>. The interest being due at
            the end of each month, if it was not paid, the creditor might at the end of the year add
            it to the capital, and thenceforth charge interest on the increased capital. It was
            compound interest, but reckoned, not every month, but every year. </note> whereas he
          demanded in virtue of the deed forty-eight per cent. "What do you mean?" said I. "Can I go
          against my own edict?" He then produced a decree of the senate made in the consulship of
          Lentulus and Philippus. "The governor of Cilicia shall recognize that bond in giving
          judgment." <note n="2" anchored="true">
            <date when="-0056">B.C. 56</date>. This was probably when the senate was confirming the
              <foreign xml:lang="la">acta</foreign> of <foreign xml:lang="la">Cato</foreign>, who
            had been sent out in 58 B.C. to take over and organize Cyprus. The real creditor—at any
            rate in part-was doubtless <foreign xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign>, who had been left in
            charge of Cyprus for some time by his uncle <foreign xml:lang="la">Cato</foreign> (Plut.
            Cat. min. 36). </note> I was at <pb n="130"/> first horrified, for it meant the ruin of
          the town. I find there are two decrees of the senate in the same year about this bond.
          When the Salaminians wished to raise money at Rome to pay off a debt, they were prevented
          from doing so by the Gabinian law. <note n="1" anchored="true">The <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >lex Gabinia</foreign>, <date when="-0068">B.C. 68</date>, forbade loans to provincial
            towns. </note> Then it was that Brutus's friends, relying on his influence, offered to
          advance the money if they were secured by a senatorial decree. A decree is passed by
          Brutus's influence "That the Salaminians and those who lent the money should be
          indemnified." They paid the money. Afterwards it occurred to the lenders that this
          senatorial decree would not secure them, because the Gabinian law forbade a legal decision
          being based on the bond. So the other senatorial decree ("that this bond be recognized in
          giving judgment") is passed: not giving that particular bond more legal validity than
          others, but the same. <note n="2" anchored="true">The first decree merely relieved
            borrowers and lenders from penalties of the law, the second allowed a debt to be
            recoverable under the bond, i.e., it placed the bond in the same position as other
            bonds; but, says Cicero, by my edict (taken from my predecessors) only twelve per cent.
            can be recovered on a bond: and nothing the senate has done gives any special force to
            this particular bond. </note> When I had expounded this view, Scaptius took me aside and
          said that he had nothing to say against it, but that those men were under the impression
          that their debt was 200 talents, and he was willing to accept that sum, whereas it really
          amounted to somewhat less; he begs me to induce them to agree on the 200. "Very well,"
          said I. I summon them without the presence of Scaptius. "What do you say," said I, "how
          much is your debt?" They answered, "One hundred and six." I refer back to Scaptius. He
          exclaimed loudly. "What is the use of this?" said I. "Check each other's additions." They
          sit down, they make their calculations: they agree to a penny. They declare themselves
          willing to pay: and beg him to accept the money. Scaptius again takes me aside: asks me to
          leave the matter as it is, undecided. I gave in to the fellow's shameless request. When
          the Greeks grumbled, and demanded that they might deposit <pb n="131"/> the money in a
          temple, <note n="1" anchored="true">For money so deposited, pending a legal decision,
            interest was not payable. See p. 94 </note> I did not assent. Everybody in court,
          exclaimed that Scaptius was the greatest knave in the world for mot being content with
          twelve per cent. plus the compound interest: others said that he was the greatest fool. In
          my opinion he was more knave than fool. For either he was content with twelve per cent. on
          a good security, or he hoped for forty-eight per cent. with a bad one. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">In the one case he was <foreign xml:lang="la">impudens</foreign> for
            refusing the proper <foreign xml:lang="la">sum</foreign> of money offered in payment, in
            the other he was <foreign xml:lang="la">impudens</foreign> for embarking in such a
            usurious transaction. </note> That is my case; and if Brutus is not satisfied with it, I
          cannot see why I should regard him as a friend: I am sure that his uncle at any rate will
          accept it, especially as a senatorial decree has just been passed—I think since you left
          town—in the matter of money-lenders, that twelve per cent. simple interest was to be the
          rate. What a wide difference this implies you will certainly be able to reckon, if I know
          your fingers. And in this regard, by the way, L. Lucceius, son of Marcus, writes me a
          ,grumbling letter asserting that—thanks to the senate—there is the utmost danger of these
          decrees leading to a general repudiation. He recalls what mischief C. Iulius <note n="3"
            anchored="true">There is no record of Caesar having done this, either as praetor or in

          turn over my case in your mind as against Brutus, if it may be called a case, against
          which nothing can be decently urged: especially as I have left it and its merits
          undecided. <milestone unit="para"/>Now for family matters. As to our "home secret," I am

          owing to the snow. I am backing up Thermus, as you ask me to do, by a great number of
          letters. As for P. Valerius, Deiotarus says that he has nothing, and is being supported by
          himself. <pb n="132"/> As soon as you know whether there is to be an intercalation at Rome

        </opener>
        <p> I received your letter on the fifth day before the Terminalia (19th of February) at
          Laodicea. I was delighted to read it, for it teemed with affection, kindness, and an
          active and obliging temper. I will, therefore, answer it sentence by sentence <note n="1"
            anchored="true">Some words are missing in the text. Boot fills up the gap by <foreign
              xml:lang="grc">kata\ mi/ton</foreign>. It gives the sense required, and is perhaps
            better than the words introduced by Wesenberg from the latter part of the letter
              (<foreign xml:lang="grc">non xru/sia xalkei/wn</foreign>), which come in rather
            awkwardly here. </note> —for such is your request—and I will not introduce an
          arrangement of my own, but will follow your order. <milestone unit="para"/>You say that
          the last letter you had of mine was from Cybistra, dated 21st September, and you want to
          know which of yours I have received. Nearly all you mention, except the one that you say
          that you delivered to Lentulus's messengers at Equotuticus and Brundisium. Wherefore your
          industry has not been thrown away, as you fear, but has been exceedingly well laid out,
          if, that is to say, your object was to give me pleasure. For I have never been more
          delighted with anything. I am exceedingly glad that you approve of my self-restraint in
          the case of Appius, and of my independence even in the case of Brutus: and I had thought
          that it might be somewhat otherwise. For Appius, in the course of his journey, had sent me
          two or three rather querulous letters, because I rescinded some of his decisions. It is
          exactly as if a doctor, upon a patient having been placed under another doctor, should
          choose to be angry with the <pb n="134"/> latter if he changed some of his prescriptions.
          Thus Appius, having treated the province on the system of depletion, bleeding, and
          removing everything he could, and having handed it over to me in the last state of
          exhaustion, he cannot bear seeing it treated by me on the nutritive system. Yet he is
          sometimes angry with me, at other times thanks me; for nothing I ever do is accompanied
          with any reflexion upon him. It is only the dissimilarity of my system that annoys him.
          For what could be a more striking difference—under his rule a province drained by charges
          for maintenance and by losses, under mine, not a penny exacted either from private persons
          or public bodies? Why speak of his praefecti, staff, and legates? Or even of acts Of
          plunder, licentiousness, and insult? While as things actually are, no private house, by
          Hercules, is governed with so much system, or on such strict principles, nor is so well
          disciplined, as is my whole province. Some of Appius's friends put a ridiculous
          construction on this, holding that I wish for a good reputation. to set Off his bad one,
          and act rightly, not for the sake of my own credit, but in order to cast a reflexion upon
          him. But if Appius, as Brutus's letter forwarded by you indicated, expresses gratitude to
          me, I am satisfied. Nevertheless, this very day on which I write this, before dawn, I am
          thinking of rescinding many of his inequitable appointments and decisions. <milestone
            unit="para"/>I now come to Brutus, whose friendship I embraced with all possible
          earnestness on your advice. I had even begun to feel genuine affection for him—but here I
          pull myself up short, lest I should offend you: for don't imagine that there is anything I
          wish more than to fulfil his commissions, or that there is anything about which I have
          taken more trouble. Now he gave me a volume of commissions, and you had already spoken
          with me about the same matters. I have pushed them on with the greatest energy. To begin
          with, I put such pressure on Ariobarzanes, that he paid him the talents which he promised
          me. As long as the king was with me, the business was in excellent train: later on be
          began to be pressed by countless agents of Pompey. Now Pompey has by himself more
          influence than all the rest put together for many reasons, and especially because there is
          an idea that he is. coming to undertake the Parthian war. However, even he has to put up
          with the following <pb n="135"/> scale of payment: on every thirtieth day thirty-three
          Attic talents ([sterling]7,920), and that raised by special taxes: nor is it sufficient
          for the monthly interest. But our friend Gnaeus is an easy creditor: he stands out of his
          capital, is content with the interest, and even that not in full. The king neither pays
          anyone else, nor is capable of doing so: for he has no treasury, no regular income. He
          levies taxes after the method of Appius. They scarcely produce enough to satisfy Pompey's
          interest. The king has two or three very rich friends, but they stick to their own as
          energetically as you or I. For my part, nevertheless, I do not cease sending letters
          asking, urging, chiding the king. Deiotarus also has informed me that he has sent
          emissaries to him on Brutus's business: that they have brought him back word that he has
          not got the money. And, by Hercules, I believe it is the case; nothing can be stripped
          cleaner than his kingdom, or be more needy than the king. Accordingly, I am thinking
          either of renouncing my guardianship, or, as Scaevola did on behalf of Glabrio, of
          stopping payment altogether—principal and interest alike. However, I have conferred the
          prefectures which I promised Brutus through you on M. Scaptius and L. Gavius, who were
          acting as Brutus's agents in the kingdom: for they were not carrying on business in my own
          province. You will remember that I made that condition, that he might have as many
          prefectures as he pleased, so long as it was not for a man in business. Accordingly, I
          have given him two others besides: but the men for whom he asked them had left the
          province. Now for the case of the Salaminians, which I see came upon you also as a
          novelty, as it did upon me. For Brutus never told me that the money was his own. Nay, I
          have his own document containing the words, "The Salaminians owe my friends M. Scaptius
          and P. Matinius a sum of money." He recommends them to me: he even adds, as though by way
          of a spur to me, that he had gone surety for them to a large amount. I had succeeded in
          arranging that they should pay with interest for six years at the rate of twelve per
          cent., and added yearly to the capital sum. <note n="1" anchored="true">That is, compound
            interest for six years at twelve per cent. See p. 129. </note> But Scaptius demanded
          forty-eight per cent. I was afraid, if he got that, <pb n="136"/> you yourself would cease
          to have any affection for me. For I should have receded from my own edict, and should have
          utterly ruined a state which was under the protection not only of Cato, but also of Brutus
          himself, and had been the recipient of favours from myself. When lo and behold! at this
          very juncture Scaptius comes down upon me with a letter from Brutus, stating that his own
          property is being imperilled—a fact that Brutus had never told either me or you. He also
          begged that I would confer a prefecture on Scaptius. That was the very reservation that I
          had made to you—" not to a man in business": and if to anyone, to such a man as that—no!
          For he has been a praefectus to Appius, and had, in fact, had some squadrons of cavalry,
          with which he had kept the senate under so close a siege in their own council chamber at
          Salamis, that five senators died of starvation. Accordingly, the first day of my entering
          my province, Cyprian legates having already visited me at Ephesus, I sent orders for the
          cavalry to quit the island at once. For these reasons I believe Scaptius has written some
          unfavourable remarks about me to Brutus. However, my feeling is this: if Brutus holds that
          I ought to have decided in favour of forty-eight per cent., though throughout my province
          I have only recognized twelve per cent., and had laid down that rule in my edict with the
          assent even of the most grasping money-lenders; if he complains of my refusal of a
          prefecture to a man in business, which I refused to our friend Torquatus in the case of
          your protégé Laenius, and to Pompey himself in the case of Sext. Statius, without
          offending either of them; if, finally, he is annoyed at my recall of the cavalry, I shall
          indeed feel some distress at his being angry with me, but much greater distress at finding
          him not to be the man that I had thought him. Thus much Scaptius will own-that he had the
          opportunity in my court of taking away with him the whole sum allowed by my edict. I will
          add a fact which I fear you may not approve. The interest ought to have ceased to run (I
          mean the interest allowed by my edict), but I induced the Salaminians to say nothing about
          that. <note n="1" anchored="true">The interest would cease to run if the money were
            deposited in a temple. See p. 94. </note> They gave in to me, it is <pb n="137"/> true,

            assumes that family interest will influence his decision on the debt to <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign>. </note> However, I have granted all this in favour of
          Brutus, who writes very kind letters to you about me, but to me my-self, even when he has
          a favour to ask, writes usually in a tone of hauteur, arrogance, and offensive
          superiority. You, however, I hope will write to him on this business, in order that I may
          know how he takes what I have done. For you will tell me. I have, it is true, written you
          a full and careful account in a former letter, but I wished you clearly to understand that
          I had not forgotten what you had said to me in one of your letters: that if I brought home
          from this province nothing else except his goodwill, I should have done enough. By all
          means, since you will have it so: but I assume my dealings with him to be without breach
          of duty on my part. Well, then, by my decree the payment of the money to Statius is good
          at law: whether that is just you must judge for yourself—I will not appeal even to Cato.
          But don't think that I have cast your exhortations to the winds: they have sunk deeply
          into my mind. With tears in your eyes you urged me to be careful of my reputation. Have I
          ever got a letter from you without the same subject being mentioned? So, then, let who
          will be angry, I will endure it: "for the right is on my side," <note n="2"

          Annius—you question my history. He, it is true, did not live before the decemvirs, for he
          was curule aedile, an office created many years after the decemvirs. What good did he do,
          then, by publishing the Fasti? It is supposed that the tablet containing them had been
          kept concealed up to a certain date, in order that information as to days for doing
          business might have to be sought from a small coterie. And indeed several of our
          authorities relate that a scribe named Cn. Flavius published the Fasti and composed forms
          of pleading—so don't imagine that I, <pb n="138"/> or rather Africanus (for he is the
          spokesman), invented the fact. So you noticed the remark about the "action of an actor,"
          did you? You suspect a malicious meaning : <note n="1" anchored="true">As though a hit at

          />You say that Philotimus told you about my having been saluted imperator. But I feel sure
          that, as you are now in Epirus, you have received my two letters on the whole subject, one
          from Pindenissus after its capture, another from Laodicea, both delivered to your own
          messengers. On these events, for fear of accidents at sea, I sent a public despatch to
          Rome in duplicate by two different letter-carriers. <milestone unit="para"/>As to my
          Tullia, I agree with you, and I have written to her and to Terentia giving my consent. For
          you have already said in a previous letter to me, "and I could wish that you had returned
          to your old set." There was no occasion to alter the letter you sent by Memnius: for I
          much prefer to accept this man from Pontidia, than the other from Servilia. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">Cicero did not like <foreign xml:lang="la">Servilia</foreign> (mother of

          friend Saufeius into council. He was always fond of me, and now I suppose all the more so
          as he is bound to have accepted Appius's affection for me with the rest of the property he
          has inherited. Appius often shewed how much he valued me, and especially in the trial of
          Bursa. Indeed you will have relieved me of a serious anxiety. <milestone unit="para"/>I
          don't like Furnius's proviso. For, in fact, there is no state of things that alarms me

          length to you on this subject if you had been at Rome. I don't wonder that you rest all
          your hope of peace on Pompey: I believe that is the truth, and in my opinion you must
          strike out your word "insincerity." If my arrangement of topics is somewhat random, blame
          yourself: for I am following your own haphazard order. <milestone unit="para"/>My son and

          Cassius's despatch was empty brag: that of Bibulus had not arrived: when that is read I

          my government is not prolonged, I have only June and July to fear. May it be so! Bibulus
          will keep them in check for two months. <pb n="140"/> What will happen to the man I leave
          in charge, especially if it is my brother? Or, again, what will happen to me, if I don't
          leave my province so soon? It is a great nuisance. However, I have agreed with Deiotarus
          that he should join my camp in full force. He has thirty cohorts of four hundred men
          apiece, armed in the Roman fashion, and two thousand cavalry. That will be sufficient to
          hold out till the arrival of Pompey, who in a letter he writes to me indicates that the
          business will be put in his hands. The Parthians are wintering in a Roman province. Orodes
          is expected in person. In short, it is a serious matter. As to Bibulus's edict there is
          nothing new, except the proviso of which you said in your letter, "that it reflected with
          excessive severity on our order." I, however, have a proviso in my own edict of equivalent
          force, but less openly expressed (derived from the Asiatic edict of Q. Mucius, <note n="1"
            anchored="true">Q Mucius Scaevola, consul <date when="-0086">B.C. 86</date>, proconsul

          do so, and give general satisfaction. The Greeks, indeed, are jubilant because they have
          non-Roman jurors. <pb n="141"/> "Yes," you will say, "a very poor kind." What does that
          matter? They, at any rate, imagine themselves to have obtained "autonomy." You at Rome, I
          suppose, have men of high character in that capacity—Turpio the shoemaker and Vettius the
          broker! You seem to wish to know how I treat the publicani. I pet, indulge, compliment,
          and honour them: I contrive, however, that they oppress no one. The most surprising thing
          is that even Servilius <note n="1" anchored="true">P. Servilius Vatia Isauricus, who

          My line is this: I name a day fairly distant, before which, if they have paid, I give out

          according to the contract. The result is that the Greeks pay at a reasonable rate of
          interest, and the publicani are thoroughly satisfied by receiving in full measure what I
          mentioned-complimentary speeches and frequent invitations. Need I say more? They are all
          on such terms with me that each thinks himself my most intimate friend. However, <foreign

          <milestone unit="para"/>As to the statue of Africanus—what a mass of confusion! But that
          was just what interested me in your letter. Do you really mean it? Does the present

          had no inscription except CENS, while on the statue near the Hercules of Polycles there is
          also the inscription CENS, and that this is the statue of the same man is proved by
          attitude, dress, ring, and the likeness itself. <note n="4" anchored="true">Apparently
            Metellus had mistaken one of the two statues for that of his great-grandfather <foreign

            that they are evidently both of the same man, and that man Africanus, not <foreign

          of gilded equestrian statues, placed by the present Metellus on the Capitol, a statue of
          Africanus with the name of Serapio inscribed under it, I thought it a mistake of the
          workman. I now see that it is an error of Metellus's. What a shocking historical blunder!
          For that about Flavius and the Fasti, if it is a blunder, is one shared in by all, and you
          were quite right to raise the question. I followed the opinion which runs through nearly
          all historians, as is often the case with Greek writers. For example, do they not all say
          that Eupolis, the poet of the old comedy, was thrown into the sea by Alcibiades on his
          voyage to Sicily? Eratosthenes disproves it: for he produces some plays exhibited by him
          after that date. Is that careful historian, Duris of Samos, laughed out of court because
          he, in common with many others, made this mistake? <note n="1" anchored="true">According
            to the account of Suidas, <foreign xml:lang="la">Eupolis</foreign> perished at Cynossema

          eyes on what is going on. Have you heard anything about anyone? I am sure nothing of the
          sort has taken place. No, no, it can't be! It would never have eluded my notice, nor will
          it. Yet that reminder of yours, so carefully worded, seems to suggest something.
            <milestone unit="para"/>As to M. Octavius, I hereby again repeat that your answer was
          excellent: I could have wished it a little more positive still. For Caelius has sent me a

          as to the latter, I am much vexed if my course of conduct is still obscure, and if it is
          not known at Rome that not a penny has been exacted from my province except for the

          the money and for him to receive it; and I have advised him (for I am really attached to
          him) that, after prosecuting others, he should be extra-careful as to his own conduct. As

          note, which I will not leave unanswered. Lucceius, on my word, could get a good price for
          his Tusculan property, unless, perchance, his flute-player is a fixture (for that's his
          way), and I should like to know in what condition it is. <note n="2" anchored="true">It is
            perhaps hopeless to explain this passage. But, understanding <foreign xml:lang="la"

            that Cicero, thinking that he would like to buy property in <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Tusculum</foreign>, remarks that it will probably go at a good price unless Lucceius
            in some way makes it unattractive. Whether the tibicen was some musical slave with whom
            Lucceius bored his friends, and Cicero jestingly fears may go with the house (thus
            lowering its value, as the presence of bores, he says, would that of his own at <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Formiae</foreign>, vol i., p. 103), or whether tibicen is to have the
            sense of a "prop" (as it has in Horace and Juvenal), indicating that the house is in bad
            repair, I must leave to my readers to determine. Lucceius seems to have sold; for in
              <date when="-0055">B.C. 55</date> Cicero refers to their being neighbours at <foreign

          except his Tusculan property. I should like to see these men cleared of their
          embarrassments, Cestius also, and you may add Caelius, to all of whom the line applies,

          some hope, though it is a feeble one. Pinarius, whom you recommended to me, is seriously

        <p> YOUR freedman Philogenes having come to call on me at Laodicea, and telling me that he

          page, which gave me great uneasiness —that is, the account sent you by Cincius of his

          often seen him fly into a rage, and often calm down again. What he has written to Statius
          I don't know. Whatever he meant to do in such a matter, he certainly ought not to have
          written to a freedman. I will take the greatest care to prevent anything occurring
          contrary to our wishes and to what is proper. And in a case of this kind it is not enough
          that each should answer for himself: for instance, the most important róle in the kindly
          work of this reconciliation is that of the boy, or young man, I should say, Quintus: and
          this I am in the habit of impressing upon him. He seems to me, indeed, to be strongly
          attached to his mother, as he ought to be, and wonderfully so to you. <pb n="150"/> But
          the boy's character, though certainly a lofty one, has yet many complications, and gives

          should believe him. His conclusion was that Arcadia had a seaport called Lepreon; while
          Tenea, Aliphera, and Tritia he thought were more recent foundations; and that view he
          backed up by Homer's "Catalogue of the Ships," where there is no mention of them.
          Accordingly, I translated that passage from Dicaearchus word for word. I know the form
          usually employed is "Phliasii," and so take care to have it in your copies: that is the
          form I now have in mine. But at first I was deceived by the analogy of <foreign

            *sipou/ntioi</foreign> (so <foreign xml:lang="grc">*fliou=s *fliou/ntioi</foreign>
          <foreign xml:lang="la">Phliuntii</foreign>), but I have at once corrected this. <milestone
            unit="para"/>I see that you rejoice at my equitable and disinterested administration:
          you would have done so still more, if you had been here. Why, in these very sessions which
          I have been holding at Laodicea from the 13th of February to the <pb n="151"/> Ist of May
          for all the dioceses except that of Cilicia, I have effected astonishing results. A great
          number of states have been entirely released from debt, and many very sensibly relieved:
          all have enjoyed their own laws, and with this attainment of autonomy have quite revived.
          I have given them the opportunity of freeing themselves from debt, or lightening their
          burdens, in two ways: first, in the fact that no expense has been imposed upon them during
          my government—and when I say "no expense" I do not speak hyperbolically, but I mean none,
          not a farthing. It is almost incredible how this fact has helped them to escape from their
          difficulties. The other way is this. There was an astonishing amount of peculation in the
          states committed by the Greeks themselves—I mean their own magistrates. I personally
          questioned those who had been in office in the course of the last ten years. They openly
          confessed it: and accordingly, without being punished by any mark of disgrace, repaid the
          sums of money to the communities out of their own pockets. The consequence is that,
          whereas the communities had paid the publicani nothing for the present quinquennium, they
          have now, without any signs of distress, paid them the arrears of the last quinquennium
          also. So I am the apple of their eye to the publicani—" A grateful set," quoth you. Yes, I
          have found it so. The rest of my administration of justice has not been without skill,
          while its lenity has been enhanced by a marvellous courtesy. The ease with which I have
          admitted men to my presence is a new thing in the provinces. I don't employ a chamberlain.
          Before daybreak I walk up and down in my house, as I used to do in old times as a
          candidate. This is very popular and a great convenience, nor have I found it as yet
          fatiguing to me, being an old campaigner in that respect. On the 15th of May I am thinking
          of going to Cilicia: having spent the month of June there—-pray heaven, in peace! for a
          serious war on the part of the Parthians is threatening—I mean to devote July to my return
          journey. For my year of service is finished on the 3oth of July: and I am in 'great hopes
          that there will be no extension of my time. I have the city gazette up to the 15 of March,
          from which I gather that, owing to the persistence of my friend Curio, every kind of
          business is coming on rather than that <pb n="152"/> of assigning the provinces. <note
            n="1" anchored="true">Curio resisted any measures as to assigning the provinces, in
            Caesar's interests, because it was proposed to nominate a successor to him among the
            rest, and not to Pompey. </note> Therefore, as I hope, I shall see you before long.
            <milestone unit="para"/>I now come to your friend Brutus, or rather our friend, since
          you will have it so. Indeed, I have on my side done everything that I could accomplish in
          my province, or attempt in Cappadocia. Thus I have urged the king in every possible way,
          and continue to do so, that is to say, by letter—for I have only had him with me three or
          four days, and in the midst of political troubles, from which I relieved him. But, alike
          in our personal interviews, and afterwards by very frequent letters, I have never ceased
          begging and beseeching him for my sake, and advising him for his own. I have had
          considerable effect, but how much I do not, at this distance from him, know for certain.
          The Salaminians, however—for upon them I could put pressure —I have brought to consent to
          pay the entire debt to Scaptius, but with interest calculated at one per cent. per month,
          and not added to the capital each month, but only at the end of each year. The money was
          actually paid down: Scaptius would not take it. What do you mean, then, by saying that
          Brutus is willing to lose some-thing? He had forty-eight per cent. in his bond. It could
          not be paid, nor, if it could, could I have allowed it. I hear, after all, that Scaptius
          repents his refusal. For as to the decree of the senate which he quoted—" that the money
          should be recoverable on the bond "—its intention was to cover the case of the Salaminians
          having borrowed money contrary to the lex Gabinia. For Aulus's law forbade the recovery of
          money so borrowed. The senate accordingly decreed that it should be recoverable on that
          particular bond. Now this bond has exactly the same validity as all other bonds, not a bit
          more. <note n="2" anchored="true">And therefore only twelve per cent. can be recovered
            under it. See Letter CCXLIX </note> I think Brutus will acknowledge that my conduct has
          been quite regular and correct. I don't know about you, Cato certainly will. <milestone
            unit="para"/>But now I return to yourself. Do you really, Atticus, mean to say— you, the
          panegyrist of my integrity and <pb n="153"/> punctilious honour—"do you venture out of
          your own mouth" (to quote Ennius) to ask me to give Scaptius cavalry to help him to exact
          the money? Would you, if you were with me—and you say in your letter that you are
          sometimes sore at heart to think that you are not with me—would you have suffered me to do
          so, even if I had wished it? "Not more than fifty," you say. There were fewer than that
          with Spartacus at first. <note n="1" anchored="true">Spartacus, the leader of the revolted
            gladiators, <date>B.C. <date to="-71" from="-73">73</date>-71</date>. </note> What
          misery would they not have inflicted in so weak an island? "They would not have done it,"
          do you say? Nay, what did they not do before my arrival? They kept the Salaminian senators
          shut up in their chamber for so many days, that some of them died of hunger. For Scaptius
          was a praefectus of Appius, and Appius allowed him some squadrons. Well, then, do you ask
          me— you, whose face, by heaven! is ever before my eyes when I think of duty and honour—do
          you, I say, ask me to allow Scaptius to be praefectus of mine? To let alone the fact that
          I had resolved that no man in business should be one, and with Brutus's approval of the
          rule—is such a fellow as that to have squadrons? Why rather than cohorts of the legions?
          Oh, Scaptius is spending his money, and is now cutting a great figure! The chief men of
          Salamis, says he, wish it. I know all about that: for they came to see me even at Ephesus,
          and with tears in their eyes told me of the abominable conduct of the cavalry and of their
          own miseries. Accordingly, I at once sent a letter ordering the cavalry to quit Cyprus by
          a fixed day, and for that, among other reasons, the Salaminians have praised me to the
          skies in their decrees. But where was the need of cavalry? The Salaminians offer
          payment—unless, by heaven, we choose to use armed force to compel the payment of
          forty-eight per cent. interest! And shall I ever dare to read or even to touch those books
          again which you compliment so highly, <note n="2" anchored="true">His own treatise
              <foreign xml:lang="la">de Republica</foreign>. </note> if I have committed such an act
          as that? You have indulged your affection for Brutus too far in this, too far I repeat, my
          dearest Atticus. Perhaps I have not done so enough: and so I have told Brutus that you
          have written in this sense to me. <pb n="154"/>
          <milestone unit="para"/>Now for the rest. I do all I can here for Appius, yet only so far
          as my duty allows, though with a right good will. For I don't dislike him, while to Brutus
          I am warmly attached, and Pompey is surprisingly urgent, of whom, by heaven, I grow fonder
          and fonder every day. You have heard that C. Caelius is coming here as quaestor. I don't
          know what it is, but I don't like that business of Pammenes. <note n="1" anchored="true"

          </note> In short, I am jealous of the influence of Vestorius. I wanted to go on chatting,

        <p> THOUGH I know of nothing new having happened since I gave a letter for you to your
          freedman Philogenes, yet as I am sending Philotimus back to Rome, I felt obliged to write
          you something. And first on the subject which causes me most anxiety—not that you can help
          me at all, for the matter is actually in hand, and you are far away in another part of the
          world: <quote>

          <milestone unit="para"/>The time is creeping on, as you see—for I am bound to leave the
          province on the 3oth of July—and no successor is named. Whom shall I leave in command of
          the province? Sound policy and public opinion demand my brother. First, because it is
          regarded as an honour: next, because no one is fitter: thirdly, because he is the only
          ex-praetor I have. For Pomptinus, in accordance with an agreement and bargain— for he
          accompanied me on that condition—has already left me. No one thinks my quaestor fit for
          the post. <note n="2" anchored="true">Mescinius Rufus. See p. 178. </note> For he is
          unsteady, loose, and has an itching palm. However, in regard to my brother, the first
          point is, that I do not think I could persuade him to do it: for he dislikes a province.
          And, by heaven, nothing can be more disagreeable and tiresome. Then again, suppose him not
          to like to say no to me, what about my own duty to him? Seeing that a <pb n="168"/>
          serious war is believed to be actually going on in Syria, and is thought likely to spread
          into this province, while there is here no adequate protection, and the ordinary supplies
          for the year only have been voted, would it seem consistent with natural affection to
          leave my brother, or with proper prudence to leave some fainéant? You see, therefore, that
          I am in great anxiety, and much at a loss as to the course to take. In short, I never
          ought to have undertaken the business at all. What a much better "province" is yours! You
          will leave it whenever you choose, if indeed you have not already done so, and you can put
          anyone you choose in charge of Thesprotia and Chaonia! <note n="1" anchored="true">The
            country round Atticus's house in Epirus. </note> However, I have not yet seen Quintus,
          so as to be quite sure, if I made up my mind to it, whether he could be induced; nor, if
          he could, am I certain what my real wishes are. That is how this matter stands. The rest
          is as yet all praise and thanks—worthy of the books you praise so highly. Communities have
          been put on a sound footing, the publicani have been thoroughly satisfied, no one has been
          insulted, some few have suffered by a judicial edict, at once just and strict, yet in no
          case does anyone venture to complain; there has been a campaign deserving of a triumph,
          but in this matter too I shall do nothing in a spirit of self-seeking, nothing at all
          indeed without your advice. The last word of the play—the handing over of my province—is
          the difficulty. But this some god will direct. <milestone unit="para"/>About events in the
          city you, of course, know more than I: your news are more frequent and more authentic. I
          am myself vexed not to get information by a letter from you. For reports of an unpleasant
          nature reach me here about Curio and about Paullus <note n="2" anchored="true">As to
            Curio, see p. 155. Paullus is L. Aemilius Paullus, the Consul who had been also bribed
            by Caesar. </note> —not that I see anything to fear as long as Pompey can stand or even
          sit: if he only recover his health ! <note n="3" anchored="true">Pompey's serious illness
            at Naples this year caused great excitement (see p. 182; <bibl n="TLG551.17 2.28"
              >Appian, B.C. 2.28</bibl>; <bibl n="Plut. Pomp. 57">Plut. Pomp. 57</bibl>). </note>
          But, by heaven! I am vexed for Curio and Paullus, my own familiar friends! Please,
          therefore, send me, if you are in Rome or when you get there, a sketch-plan of the whole
          position of public affairs to meet me on my way, <pb n="169"/> by which I may mould my
          conduct, and consider beforehand in what spirit to approach the city. For it is something
          that a man on his arrival should not be a foreigner and stranger. <milestone unit="para"
          />And then—what I had almost forgotten to mention—about your friend Brutus. I have done
          everything I could for him, as I often mentioned to you in my letters. The Cyprians were
          ready to pay the money. But Scaptius was not content with twelve per cent. and compound
          interest reckoned yearly. Ariobarzanes was not more inclined to accommodate Pompey for his
          own sake, than Brutus for mine. But I cannot pledge myself for him, for he is a very poor
          sovereign, and I am at so great a distance from him, that my only weapons are letters, and
          with these I have not ceased to ply him. The upshot is this: Brutus, in proportion to the
          amount of the debt, has been treated more liberally than Pompey. For Brutus this year
          there has been secured about a hundred talents; Pompey has had two hundred promised in six
          months. Again, in the business of Appius I can scarcely express the extent of my
          concessions to Brutus. <note n="1" anchored="true">See Letter CCLV, p. 153. </note> Why
          should I trouble myself, then? His friends are men of straw—Matinius and Scaptius—the
          latter of whom, because he did not get some squadrons of cavalry from me wherewith to
          bully Cyprus, as he had done before my governorship, is perhaps angry with me; or because
          he is not a praefectus, an office which I bestowed on no one engaged in business, not even
          on C. Vennonius, who was my intimate friend, or on M. Laenius, who was yours. To this
          principle, which I communicated to you at Rome, I have stuck. But of what has a man to
          complain, who, when he might have taken the money, refused to do so? The other Scaptius
          (who is in Cappadocia) I think I have fully satisfied. Having received the office of
          military tribune from me, which I had offered him in consequence of a letter from Brutus,
          he afterwards wrote me word that he did not wish to avail himself of it. There is a
          certain Gavius, who, after my offering him a praefectura on the request of Brutus, said
          and did a good deal meant to reflect upon me—one of Publius Clodius's sleuthhounds! He
          neither paid me the compliment <pb n="170"/> of joining my escort when I was quitting
          Apamea, nor on his subsequently visiting the camp and being about to leave it did he ask
          me "whether I had any commands," and made no secret of being, I don't know why, no friend
          to me. If I had regarded such a fellow as one of my praefecti, what would you have thought
          of me? Was I, who, as you know, never would put up with insolence from the most powerful
          of men, to endure it from this led-captain? Yet it is more than "putting up with" a man to
          bestow on him a place of profit and honour. So, then, this Gavius, when he saw me at
          Apamea, as he was starting for Rome, addressed me in a tone I should scarcely have
          ventured to adopt to Culleolus: "Will you be good enough to tell me," said he, "where I am
          to look for the allowances of a praefectus?" I answered more mildly than those present
          thought I should have done, that it was not my practice to give allowances to those whom I
          had not actually employed. He went off in a rage. If Brutus can be affected by the talk of
          such a windbag as this, you may love him all to yourself, you will have no rival in me.
          But I think he will behave as he ought. However, I wished you to be acquainted with the
          facts of the case, and I have told Brutus the story with the greatest minuteness.
          Generally speaking (between ourselves), Brutus has never written me a letter, not even the
          last one about Appius, in which there was not something haughty and distant. But you often
          have on your lips (from Lucilius): "Then Granius <note n="1" anchored="true">A <foreign
              xml:lang="la">praeco</foreign>, or marshal, who gave himself airs. </note> too Thinks
          highly of himself and loathes proud kings." However, in that matter he usually stirs my
          laughter rather than my bile; but he evidently doesn't sufficiently consider what he is
          writing, and to whom. The young Quintus, I think, and indeed I am sure, read your letter
          addressed to his father. For he is accustomed, and that by my advice, to open his father's
          letters, in case there is anything that ought to be known. Now in that letter there was
          the same remark about your sister as in your letter to me. Imagine the boy's distress! He
          told me of his sorrow with tears in his eyes. In short, he shewed me clearly how dutiful,
          sweet-tempered, and kind he was, which makes me the more hope <pb n="171"/> that nothing
          unbecoming will occur. So I wished you to know it. I will not omit the following either.
          Young Hortensius, at the time of the gladiatorial exhibition at Apamea, behaved in a
          scandalous and disgraceful manner. For his father's sake I asked him to dinner the day he
          arrived, and for his father's sake also went no farther. He remarked that he would wait
          for me at Athens, that we might leave the country together. "All right," said I: for what
          could I say? After all, I don't think he meant what he said. I hope not, indeed, lest I
          should offend his father, of whom, by heaven, I am exceedingly fond. But if he is to be in
          my suite, I will so manage him as to avoid giving offence where I least wish to do so.
          That is all: no, there is this— please send me the speech of Quintus Celer against M.
          Servilius. Send me a letter as soon as possible. If there is no news, let me know there is
          none at least by a letter-carrier of yours. Love to Pilia and your daughter. Take care of
          your health. </p>

        <p> I arrived at Tarsus on the 5th of June. There I was disturbed on many accounts—a serious
          war in Syria; serious <pb n="178"/> cases of brigandage in Cilicia; difficulty in fixing
          on any definite scheme of administration, considering that only a few days remained of my
          year of office; and, greatest difficulty of all, the necessity, according to the decree of
          the senate, of leaving some one at the head of the province. No one could be less suitable
          than the quaestor Mescinius <note n="1" anchored="true">See p. 167. </note> —for of
          Caelius I don't hear a word. Far the best course appears to be to leave my brother Quintus
          with imperium. But in doing that many disagreeable consequences are involved—our
          separation, the risk of a war, the ill-conduct of the soldiers, <note n="2"
            anchored="true">He has lately heard of the murder of two of the sons of Bibulus in a
            mutiny of Gabinius's soldiers in Egypt. See next letter. </note> hundreds of others.
          What a nuisance the whole business is! But let fortune look to it, since any great
          exercise of reason is out of the question. As for you, since by this time, I hope, you are
          safe at Rome, you will as usual be good enough to look after everything which you may
          understand to affect my interests, especially in regard to my Tullia, about whose marriage
          I have written to Terentia my decision, since you were in Greece. In the next place, see
          to the honour to be decreed to me: for owing to your absence from Rome, I fear that the
          motion in the senate, in virtue of my despatch, was not sufficiently pressed. The
          following I will write to you in a more enigmatical style than usual-your sagacity will
          smell out the meaning: <emph>my wife's freedman —you know whom I mean—seemed to me, from a

        <p> By this time you must surely be in Rome; and I rejoice at your safe arrival there, if it
          is so. As long, in fact, as you were absent from town, you seemed to me farther removed
          from me than if you were at home, for my own affairs were less known to me, and so were
          those of the state. Wherefore, though I hope by the time you read this to be far advanced
          on my way home, pray send letters frequently, and as talkative as possible on every kind
          of subject, to meet me: above all, on the subject on which I wrote to you before: <emph>my
            wife's freedman, as in our meetings and conversations he continually stammered and
            seemed at a loss, appeared to me to have a little cooked the accounts of the Crotonian."
            Please run that to earth, as is your wont; but still more the following: When leaving
            the city of the seven hills he handed in an account of two debts of 24 and 48 minae due
            to Camillus: and entered himself as liable for 24 minae from the Crotonian's estate, and
            48 from the property in the Chersonese. And having received in legacies two sums of 640
            minae, of this he says that not a penny has been paid, though it was all due on the 1st
            of the 2nd month: but that Milo's freedman, the namesake of Conon's father (Timotheus),
            had entirely failed to provide for the payment of the money. In regard, then, to this
            money, if possible secure the whole amount, and if not, don't neglect the interest
            calculated from the above-mentioned day. I have felt much <pb n="180"/> alarm about this
            all the days I had to endure him. For he visited me to survey the situation, and almost
            with a hope of something turning up. But when he gave up that hope he quitted me without
            reason assigned, and with the remark: "I yield,</emph>

          my year's full term of office—for there are only thirty-three days left—I am yet
          overpowered with anxiety for the province to the highest possible degree. For as Syria is
          in a war fever, and Bibulus has the burden of an extreme anxiety as to the war in the
          midst of such bitter private sorrow, <note n="3" anchored="true">The murder of his sons in
            Egypt. </note> and as his legates, quaestor, and friends write to me to come to his aid,
          though I have only a weak army (the auxiliaries are certainly good, Galatians, Pisidians,
          Lycians—for they are the flower of my force), yet I thought it my duty to keep my army as
          near as possible to the enemy, as long as the decree of the senate allowed me to remain
          governor of the province. But what pleases me most is that Bibulus is not importunate; he
          writes to me about everything rather than this, and the day of my departure is insensibly
          creeping on. When that arrives there is another "problem "—who to put in charge, unless my
          quaestor Caidus <note n="4" anchored="true">See p. 164. </note> shall have arrived, of
          whom as yet I have had no certain intelligence. I should like, by Hercules, to compose a
          longer letter, but I neither have anything to tell you, nor can I jest for anxiety.
          Good-bye, therefore, and give my love to the little maid "Atticula" and our Pilia. <pb

        <p> WHILE employed in my province in doing everything for the honour of Appius, I suddenly
          became his accuser's father-in-law. "Heaven prosper it," you say. So say I, and I am sure
          you wish it. But believe me, it was the last thing I expected: in fact, I had even sent
          confidential messengers to my wife and daughter in regard to Tiberius Nero, who had made
          proposals to me; but they arrived at Rome after the betrothal had taken place. However, I
          hope this will be better. I understand that the ladies are much pleased with the young
          man's accommodating temper and courtesy. As for the rest, pick no holes! <milestone

            <foreign xml:lang="la">De Republica</foreign>. Atticus's present of corn to Athens did
            not stand on the same ground as the regular distribution of cheap corn at Rome, which
            Cicero had denounced in his book. </note> at any rate did not forbid it: for that was
          not a largess to citizens, but a gift to hosts. Yet do you bid me think about the
          "propylon" for the Academy, though Appius has abandoned his idea about Eleusis? <note
            n="2" anchored="true">See p. 146. Cicero never carried out his idea of erecting a
            propylon for the Academy, and indeed he never had money to spare for such things, being
            one of those men who handle large sums and yet are perpetually in difficulties. Appius
            appears to have built his. </note> I am sure you grieve for Hortensius. <note n="3"
            anchored="true">See Letter CLXXI. Hortensius died in June. </note> I am heart-broken
          myself: for I had resolved to live on very intimate terms with him. I have put Caelius in
          command of the province: a mere boy, you will say, and perhaps empty-headed, with neither
          solidity nor self-control. I agree: but nothing else was possible. The letter, indeed,
          which I received from you a good while ago, in which you said that you "hesitated" as to
          what I ought to do about leaving a substitute, gave me a twinge, for I saw your reasons
            <pb n="191"/> for your "hesitation," <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)pe/xein</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)poxh/</foreign>,
            "suspense of judgment," technical terms of the academic Agnostics. </note> and I had the
          very same. Hand over my province to a mere boy? Well, to my brother, then? The latter was
          against my interest: for there was no one except my brother whom I could prefer to my
          quaestor without casting a slur on him, especially as he was of noble birth. Nevertheless,
          as long as the Parthians appeared to be threatening, I had resolved to leave my brother,
          or even to remain myself, contrary to the decree of the senate, for the sake of the
          Republic. But when by incredible good fortune they had dispersed, all my hesitation was at
          an end. I saw what people would say: "What, leave his brother! is this what he calls not
          holding his province more than a year? Did not the senate, again, intend that the
          governors of provinces should be those who had not had them before? Yet this man has held
          one for three years!" So here are my reasons for the public ear. What am I to give you
          privately? I should never have been without anxiety as to something happening from
          ill-temper, violent language, or carelessness, <note n="2" anchored="true">The sharp
            temper of Quintus is often referred to. See vol. i, pp. 183-185. </note> as will happen
          in this world. Again, if his son did anything—a mere lad and a lad full of
          self-confidence? What a distress it would have been! His father was resolved not to part
          with him, and was annoyed with you for expressing an opinion that he should do so. But as
          to Caelius, as things are, I don't say that I don't care about his antecedents, but at any
          rate I care much less. Then there is this consideration: Pompey— so strong a man and in so
          secure a position—selected Q. Cassius without regard to the lot; Caesar did the same in
          the case of Antony: was I to put such a slight on one regularly assigned me by lot, as to
          make him act as a spy on any man I left in command? No, the course I adopted was the
          better one, and for it there are many precedents, and certainly it is more suited to my
          advanced time of life. But, good heavens! what credit I have given you in his eyes! I read
          him the letter written, not by you, but by your amanuensis. My friends' letters summon me
          to a triumph—a thing <pb n="192"/> which, in view of the resuscitation of my reputation, I
          do not think I ought to neglect. Wherefore, my dear Atticus, do begin to wish it too, that

        <p> JUST as I had resolved to write to you and had actually taken up my pen, Batonius came
          to me straight from his ship to my house at Ephesus, and gave me your letter on the 29th
          of September. I am delighted with the pleasant nature of your voyage, with Pilia's
          opportune appearance, and also, by Hercules, with her remarks about Tullia's marriage.
            <milestone unit="para"/>Batonius, however, brought news about Caesar that is really
          terrifying, and he enlarged still more on the subject in Conversation with Lepta. I hope
          what he said was false, but it is certainly alarming: that he would on no account dismiss
          his army; that Of the magistrates-elect the praetors, Cassius the tribune, Lentulus the
          consul, side with him; that Pompey is thinking of leaving the city. But look here! are you
          very sorry for the man <note n="1" anchored="true">Probably M. Calidius, who had failed in

          days, too, were swallowed up by the Rhodian open ship. On the 1st of October, as I am
          embarking to leave Ephesus, I give this letter to L. Tarquitius, who is leaving the
          harbour at the same time, but is sailing faster than I am. I am forced to wait for fair
          weather owing to the open ships and other war vessels of the Rhodians; nevertheless,
          nothing <pb n="199"/> can exceed the hurry I am in. As to the payment to the Puteolanian,
          many thanks. Now please look into affairs at Rome, and see what steps you think I ought to
          take as to the triumph, to which my friends invite me. If it had not been that Bibulus,
          who, as long as there was a single enemy in Syria, never set foot out of doors any more

        <p> IMMEDIATELY on my landing in the Piraeus, on the 14th of October, I received your letter
          from the hand of my slave Acastus. Having been long looking forward to it, I was
          surprised, as soon as I looked at the letter before breaking the seal, at its brevity;
          when I opened it I was again surprised at the cramped handwriting, for your letters are
          generally supremely well-written and clear, and, to make a long story short, I understood
          from the fact of your writing like that, that you had arrived at Rome on the 19th of
          September in a fit of fever. Much disturbed—but not more than I was bound to be—I at once
          questioned Acastus. He said that both you and he thought, and his impression was confirmed
          by what your people at Rome told <pb n="200"/> him, that it could not be anything serious.
          This appeared to be supported by an expression used by you at the end of your letter, that
          you wrote while suffering from a" slight touch of fever." Yet it roused my gratitude, as
          well as my surprise, that you should, in spite of it, have written to me with your own
          hand. So enough about this. For I hope, considering your prudence and temperate life, and,
          by heaven, I feel confident—as Acastus bids me—that by this time you are as well as I
          could wish. <milestone unit="para"/>I am glad you have got my letter from Turranius. Keep
          an eye, an you love me, and a very keen one, upon the ambition of that cooker of accounts.
            <note n="1" anchored="true">Philotimus, a freedman of Terentia's, whom Cicero suspected
            of dishonesty. We shall hear more of him. The sentence, like those in previous letters
            referring to him, is in Greek, with a pun on the name of Philotim4s. </note> This legacy
          again—which I swear is a source of great grief to me, for I loved the man-this legacy of
          Precius don't let him lay a single finger upon. You will say that I shall want some ready
          money for the expenses of the triumph, which, as you advise, you shall find me neither
          weakly vain in seeking, nor over-modest in declining. I gather from your letter that
          Turranius told you that I had handed over my province to my brother. Do you think I so
          entirely failed to grasp the wise caution of your letter? You said your judgment was in
          "suspense." What could have called for your hesitation, if there had been any reason
          whatever for deciding that a brother should be left in command, and such a brother? I took
          your meaning to be "dogmatic rejection," <note n="2" anchored="true">

          regard to the young Quintus, that I should not leave him in any case. "You tell me my own

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">tou)mo\n o)/neiron e)moi/</foreign>, "you but repeat my own

          over together. It was the only thing to be done, and your "long suspension of judgment"
          relieved me of all doubt. But I fancy you have already a letter on this subject written in
          more detail. I intend to send off letter-carriers tomorrow, who I think will arrive sooner
          than our friend Saufeius. But it was scarcely decent that he should arrive without a
          letter from me to <pb n="201"/> you. In your turn, pray fulfil your promise of writing
          fully to me of my Tulliola, that is, of Dolabella, of politics—which I foresee will be in
          a very dangerous situation—of the censors, and especially what is taking place about the
          statues and pictures, whether the matter will be brought before the Senate. I write this
          on the 15th of October, on which day, you tell me, Caesar is going to bring four legions

          was reassured by Acastus bringing the news I wished for as to your convalescence; that I
          was, however, horrified at what your letter told me of Caesar's legions; and urged you to
          take care that the "<foreign xml:lang="grc">filotimi/a</foreign>" <note n="1"

          subject on which I had long ago written to you, but Turranius had misinformed you at
          Brundisium—as I learnt from a letter received from that <pb n="203"/> excellent man Xeno—I
          explained briefly why I had not placed my brother at the head of my province. Such was
          nearly the substance of that letter. Now for the rest. In the name of fortune, do devote
          all the affection with which you have blessed me, and all the wisdom you possess—which in
          my judgment is unrivalled on every subject—to considering my entire position. For I think
          I foresee such a violent struggle—unless the same god, who relieved me from fear of a
          Parthian war by a stroke of luck beyond what I had ventured to hope, shall now shew regard
          for the Republic—such a struggle, I say, as there has never been before. Well! this is a
          misery which I share with all the world. I don't bid you reflect on that. It is my own,
          particular "problem" that I would beg you to take up. Don't you see that it was on your
          advice that I sought the friend-ship of both? Yes, and I could wish that I had listened to
          your most friendly hints from the beginning: <quote>But in my breast my heart thou couldst
            not sway.</quote>

          persuade me to embrace the one, because he had done me eminent service, and the other,
          because he was so powerful. I did so, therefore: and by shewing them every kind of
          attention contrived that neither of them should regard anyone with more affection than
          myself. My idea, in fact, was this— if I were allied with Pompey, I should not hereafter
          be compelled to take any improper step in politics, nor, if I agreed with Caesar, have to
          fight with Pompey: for their union was so close. Now there is impending, as you shew, and
          as I see, a mortal combat between them. Each of them, again, regards me as his own, unless
          by any chance one of them is playing a part. Pompey, of course, has no doubt: for he
          rightly judges that his present view of politics has my approbation. From each, however, I
          received a letter, at the same time as yours, of a kind calculated to shew that neither
          values anyone in the world above myself. But what am I to do? I don't mean in the last
          resort of all-for, if it shall come to downright war, I see clearly that it is better to
          be beaten with the one, than to conquer <pb n="204"/> with the other—but as to what will
          be in actual debate when I arrive: that he be not a candidate without returning to
          Rome—that he dismiss his army. "Speak, Marcus Tullius I" <note n="1" anchored="true">The

          be busying myself on something to secure my triumph, and to have an unimpeachable excuse
          for remaining outside the city. Nevertheless, they will do their best to elicit my
          opinion. You will perhaps laugh at what I am now going to say. How I wish I were still
          lingering in my province! I clearly had better have done so, if this was impending. Though
          nothing could be less pleasant. For I wish you, by the way, <note n="5" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">o(dou= p/rergon</foreign>. </note> to know this—all those
          virtues displayed at the beginning of my government, which you, too, in your letters, used

          virtue! Nay, <pb n="205"/> how difficult a lasting affectation of it! For whereas I
          thought it equitable and a thing of which to be proud, that out of the sum decreed to me
          for the year's expenses, I left my quaestor C. Caelius enough to last a year, and paid
          back into the treasury 1,000,000 sesterces (£8,000), my staff grumbled, thinking that the
          whole of this money ought to have been divided among them—that I might be found a better
          friend of the treasuries of the Phrygians and Cilicians than of our own. But they did not
          move me: for my reputation had supreme weight with me. Nevertheless, there is no mark of
          honour in my power to bestow on any of them that I have omitted. However, all this, to use
          the phrase of Thucydides, is a digression, <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)kbolh/ lo/gou</foreign> (Thuc. 1.97). </note> though not
          without its point. For your part, pray think over my position: in the first place, by what
          contrivance I may preserve Caesar's good will; in the second, as to my triumph, which,
          unless the state of the Republic hinders it, I see is feasible. I judge both from my
          friends' letters and from the supplicatio; for the man who voted against it really voted
          for more, than if he had voted all the triumphs in the world. <note n="2" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Cato</foreign>. See pp. 174, 193. </note> Moreover, only one man
          voted with him who is my intimate friend— Favonius; and another who is annoyed with
          me—Hirrus. Moreover, Cato was both on the committee for drawing out the decree, and also
          sent me a very gratifying letter as to his vote. Nevertheless, Caesar, in sending me his
          congratulations on the supplicatio, exults over Cato's vote, and yet does not mention what
          he really said in delivering it, but merely remarks that he voted against my supplicatio.
          To return to Hirrus. You have begun softening his feelings towards me. Complete the
          process. You have Scrofa and Silius with you; I have already written to them, and to

          highly complimentary to me, but remarked that I had not written to him while <pb n="206"/>
          writing to everyone else. It was quite true: for he and Crassipes were the only people to

        <p> I arrived at Brundisium on the 24th of November, after a sea passage of your fortunate
          kind: so delightfully <quote>Blew from Epirus the softest of breezes-Onchesmites.</quote>

            and modern. </note>
          <pb n="214"/> There 's a spondaic hexameter for you! You may pass it off as your own
          before any of our young poets you choose. The state of your health gives me much
          uneasiness. For your letter indicates that you are really suffering. I, however, knowing
          your courage, strongly suspect that there is something which absolutely compels you to
          give in and almost exhausts your strength, although your Pamphilus informed me that one
          fit of quartan ague had departed, and that another less serious one was approaching.
          Terentia, indeed, who entered the gate at the same time as I entered the port of
          Brundisium, told me that L. Pontius had informed her at Trebulanum <note n="1"
            anchored="true">The villa near <foreign xml:lang="la">Trebula</foreign> in the Sabine
            district. See p. 5. </note> that that too had left you. If this is the case, it answers,
          by heaven, to my highest wishes, and I expect that you have obtained it by your prudence
          and temperate habits. <milestone unit="para"/>I now come to your Ietters, great budgets of
          which have reached me at the same time, one more delightful than the other, at any rate
          those that were in your own handwriting. For while I like the handwriting of Alexis, for
          its excellent imitation of your own, yet I don't like it for its indication that you are
          not well. And talking of him, <note n="2" anchored="true">Letter CCXXVII, p. 89. </note> I
          have left Tiro in at Patrae, a young man, as you know, and add, if you please, of
          excellent character. I have never seen a better. Accordingly, I miss him very much. Though
          he did not think himself seriously il, I am yet anxious, and rest my greatest hopes in the
          assiduous attention of Manius Curius, of which Tiro has spoken in his letters and many
          have told me by word of mouth. Moreover, Curius himself felt how much you wished tbat I
          should like him. And, in fact, I took great delight in his society: there is a natural
          vein of humour in the man that is very attractive. I am carrying home his will sealed up
          with the signets of two Ciceros <note n="3" anchored="true">Quintus Cicero and his son.
            The object of the seals affixed was to shew that the document was the one which the
            testator acknowledged in the presence of witnesses to be his will. The execution of the
            will was the testator's acknowledgment, not the sealing. </note> and of the praetorian
          staff. In their presence <pb n="215"/> he declared you heir to one-tenth, and me to
          one-fortieth. At Actium in Corcyra Alexis made me a splendid present. Nothing could
          prevent Quintus Cicero from going to see the river Thyamis. I am glad you find such
          delight in your little daughter, and are convinced of the doctrine as to "the natural
          instinct for procreation." For in the absence of this instinct there can be no natural tie
          uniting man and man, and, without that, social life is impossible. "Heaven prosper what we
          do," quoth Carneades, somewhat indecently, <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">tu/xh| a)gaqh=|</foreign>, sc. <foreign xml:lang="grc"
              >paidopoiou=men</foreign>, as Casaubon explains. The connexion of the whole of this
            passage with the context is obscure. It seems to be this. <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Atticus</foreign>, who married late in life, had been wont to argue against the duty
            or pleasure of parentage. Cicero says, "Now you find so much delight in your little
            daughter you will recant your denial of the doctrine (of the Peripatetics and
            Academies), which makes the instinct of procreation the first law of nature and the
            origin of social morality" (see <bibl n="TLG543.1 6.6">Polybius, 6.6</bibl>, who there
            points out that society begins thus: <foreign xml:lang="grc">pa/ntwn pro\s ta\s

              k.t.l.</foreign>). Cicero then goes on to say that Carneades's remark as to
            procreation may be indecent, but is not so bad as the Epicurean doctrine which would
            attribute this act, like all others, to mere self-gratification, not to the natural duty
            ot producing children. With <foreign xml:lang="grc">fusikh/n</foreign> in the text

          countryman Lucius and Patro—who in referring everything to a selfish motive, and denying
          that anything is ever done for another's sake, and teaching that a man's only motive for
          being virtuous is to avoid evil consequences to himself, not because right is right, do
          not perceive that they are describing a crafty man, not a good one. But all this, I think,
          is discussed in those books which you encourage me by praising. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">The <title>de Republica</title>. </note>
          <milestone unit="para"/>To return to business. How anxious I was for the letter, which you
          said that you gave to Philoxenus! For you had told me that it contained an account of
          Pompey's conversation at Naples. Patro delivered it to me at Brundisium, having received
          it, I presume, at Corcyra. Notbing could bave been more delightful. For it contained
          information about politics, about the great man's opinion as to my uprightness, about the
          kind feeling towards me which he manifested in <pb n="216"/> what he said about the
          triumph. But what pleased me more than anything else was to learn that you had visited him
          to ascertain what his disposition was towards me. This, I say, gave me the greatest
          pleasure of all. As to the triumph, I never felt any great desire for it till Bibulus's
          utterly bare faced despatch, which was followed by a supplicatio voted in the most
          complimentary terms. If he had really done what he stated in his despatch, I should have
          rejoiced and been in favour of bestowing honour upon him. But as it is—that he, who never
          set foot outside the city gate as long as the enemy was west of the Euphrates, <note n="1"
            anchored="true">See pp. 184-185. </note> should be specially honoured, and that I, on
          whose army he depended entirely, should not be able to obtain a similar honour, is an
          insult to us: I say "us," because I include you. Accordingly, I will leave no stone
          unturned, and, as I hope, shall succeed. But if you had been in good health, I should
          already have got rid of certain difficulties. But, I hope, you will soon recover. About
          the debt to Numerius I am much obliged to you. I am longing to know what Hortensius has
          done, and what Cato is doing: the latter, it is true, has been disgracefully spiteful to
          me. He gave his testimony to my integrity, equity, clemency, good faith, which I did not
          ask for: what I did ask for he withheld. Accordingly, in his letter of congratulation,
          containing also every kind of promise, how Caesar exults over the slight put upon me by
          Cato's signal ingratitude! Cato, too, who votes twenty days' supplicatio to Bibulus!
          Pardon me, I cannot and will not put up with this. I am itching to answer all your
          letters, but it is unnecessary: for I shall see you directly. However, I must just telI
          you about Chrysippus—for about the other fellow (a mere mechanic) I am less surprised. Yet
          there could not be a more rascally trick than his either. But Chrysippus—that he, whom I
          liked seeing and held in honour for his tincture of letters, should abandon my boy without
          my knowledge! I say nothing about many other things of which I am told; I say nothing of
          his embezzlements; but I cannot put up with his absconding. It seemed to me the most
          unprincipled thing in the world. Accordingly, I have availed myself of that ancient
          expedient of <pb n="217"/> Drusus <note n="1" anchored="true">M. Livius Drusus, <foreign

          a man who on being manumitted declined to take the same oaths. I denied having manumitted
          those men, especially as there was no one present at the time by whom their manumission
          could legally be maintained. Tell me what you think of that: I will abide by your opinion.
            <note n="2" anchored="true">It was customary for a slave before manumission, in some
            cases, to promise that on manumission he would take an oath to perform certain duties to

            whether, if he afterwards declined to do so, he could be brought back to slavery. In any
            case, his position, if manumitted privately (<foreign xml:lang="la">inter
              amicos</foreign>), was less secure than if he had been brought before the praetor and
            touched by his rod (<foreign xml:lang="la">vindicta</foreign>). This difference was
            later on recognized by law. See <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 13.27">Tac. Ann. 13.27</bibl>.

        <p> ON the 6th of December I reached Aeculanum, and there read the letter from you which
          Philotimus delivered to me. The first glance at it gave me pleasure from seeing that it
          was in your own handwriting, and presently I was extraordinarily delighted at its extreme
          minuteness and attention to detail. To begin with, you say you disagree with Dicaearchus:
            <note n="3" anchored="true">Who recommended a life of action, and therefore would have
            approved of Cicero remaining at his post in <foreign xml:lang="la">Cilicia</foreign>.
          </note> but although I sought with the greatest eagerness, and with your approbation, not
          to remain more than a year in my province, this was not brought about by any exertions on
          my part. For let me tell you that no proposal was ever made in the senate about any of us
          governors of provinces, to the effect <pb n="218"/> that we should remain in them beyond
          the term mentioned in the decree: so that I cannot now be blamed even for having been a
          shorter time in the province than was perhaps for the good of the public service. But the
          common expression "Perhaps it was all for the best" seems to come in pat, as though it
          were made for the case. For whether a peace can possibly be patched up, or the victory of
          the loyalists secured, I should wish in either case to lend a helping hand, or at any rate
          not to be wholly out of it. But if; on the contrary, the loyalists are beaten, I should
          have been beaten with them, wherever I was. Wherefore the rapidity of my return should be
          no cause for regret. If, again, the idea of a triumph had not been suggested to me— an
          idea which you also approve-you certainly would not have found me fall much short of the
          ideal statesman sketched in the sixth book of my Republic. Well, what would you have me
          do, you who have devoured those books? Indeed, even now, I shall not scruple to throw this
          hope aside, great as it is, if it turns out to be the better course. The two things indeed
          cannot be done at the same time-to canvass for a triumph, and to speak with independence
          on politics. But do not doubt for a moment that the more righteous course will have the
          preference in my eyes. For as to your opinion, that it is more advantageous, whether for
          my personal safety, or as enabling me to serve the state, to retain my imperium—that we
          will discuss when we meet. For it is a matter requiring serious consideration, though to a
          great extent I agree with you. About my loyalty to the Republic I thank you for feeling no
          doubt: and I also quite endorse your judgment that, considering my services to him, and
          considering what he has done for others, Caesar <note n="1" anchored="true">This differs
            in tone from what Cicero has been saying for some time of his relations with Caesar, to
            whom he owed money. Can it be a covert allusion to his treatment of Quintus after his
            indiscretion at <foreign xml:lang="la">Aduatuca</foreign> (<bibl n="Caes. Gal. 6.36"
              >Caes. B. G. 6.36</bibl>), after which Quintus seems to have had no important command?
            There is a total absence of allusion in the letter to the gallantry of Quintus in
            defending the camp (near mod. Charleroi) earlier in the year, or to his faux pas later.
            But Caesar wrote severely to Cicero about this, who may have thought that Caesar had not
            treated Quintus with generosity. </note> has been by no means overliberal in his conduct
          to me. Your explanation of that fact also is the true one, and agrees strikingly <pb
            n="219"/> with what you say has been done in the case of Fabius and Caninius. Even if
          things had been different, and he had been profuse in his liberality to me, yet that
          "Guardian goddess of the city," whom you mention in your letter, would have compelled me
          to remember the inscription upon her statue, <note n="1" anchored="true">The statuette of
            Minerva, which Cicero dedicated in the Capitol before his exile. C. Fabius Maximus and
            C. Caninius Rebilus were Caesar's <foreign xml:lang="la">legati</foreign>. If he treated
            them badly in any way, they yet do not seem to have resented it, for they stuck by him
            in the Civii War, unlike others. </note> and would not have allowed me to imitate

          some course worthy of myself: which, indeed, I would have done, if I could, in a different
          way from that in which I must now act. It is for their own supremacy that these men are
          now contending, but it is at the risk of the constitution. For if it is the constitution
          that is being now defended by Caesar, why was it not defended in his own consulship? Why
          was I, in whose cause the safety of the constitution was involved, not defended in the
          next year? Why was his imperium extended, or why in that particular way? Why was such a
          fight made that the ten tribunes should propose a law allowing him to be a candidate in
          his absence? <note n="3" anchored="true">In <date when="-0052">B.C. 52</date>. See pp.

          which has Pompey for steersman. Yes, that is just as you say. "What is to happen when the
          consul says: "<emph>Your vote, Marcus Tullius?</emph>" I shall answer in a word: "I vote
          with Gnaeus Pompeius." Nevertheless, in private, I shall exhort Pompey to keep the <pb
            n="220"/> peace. For my opinion is that there is the most imminent danger. Of course you
          are better informed as being in the city. But my view of the situation is this: we have to
          do with a man of the most consummate boldness, and in the highest state of preparation:
          all who have been condemned, or branded with infamy, or who deserve condemnation and
          infamy, are on his side; nearly all the young men; all the lowest city rabble; some
          influential tribunes, including Gaius Cassius; all who are overwhelmed with debt, who I
          find are more numerous than I thought. The only thing this cause lacks is merit: it has
          everything else in abundance. On our side everyone is doing everything he can to avert an
          appeal to arms, of which the result is in all cases uncertain, while on this particular
          occasion there is reason to fear its going the other way. Bibulus has quitted his
          province, and has left Veiento in charge of it. I hear he will be somewhat slow on his
          return journey. In complimenting him Cato remarked that the only people he did not envy
          were those whose political position admitted of no improvement, or at any rate little. Now
          for private affairs: for I have pretty well answered your letters on politics, both the
          one you wrote in your suburban villa, and that which you wrote subsequently. So now I am
          coming to private affairs. Still, there is one thing more-about Caelius. So far from his
          affecting my opinion, I am strongly of opinion that he must himself be sorry for having
          changed his views. <note n="1" anchored="true">Caelius, bribed like Curio, had become
            Caesarian. </note> But how came it that those properties of Lucceius were conveyed to
          him? I wonder you passed that over. As to Philotimus, I will do as you advise. But I was
          not expecting to have the accounts from him, which he submitted to you, but the balance
          which he himself, at Tusculum, wished me to enter in my day-book with my own hand, and for
          which he also gave me a bill in Asia in his own handwriting. If he paid the sum which be
          declared to you to be the amount of my debt, he would still owe me as much again, and
          more. But in business of this kind, if only the state of public affairs permit, I shall
          not henceforth expose myself to blame; nor, by heaven, was I really careless about it in
          former times, but my time was <pb n="221"/> swallowed up by a crowd of friends.
          Accordingly, I shall have the benefit, as you promise, of your assistance and advice, and
          yet shall not, I hope, be troublesome to you. You need not alarm yourself about the
          splints I made my staff wear. They have pulled themselves together of their own accord
          from admiration of my upright conduct. But no one had given me a greater surprise than the
          man of whom you think so meanly. He had been at the beginning, and at this day still is,
          excellent. But just at the moment of leaving the province he indicated to me that he had
          hoped for something. He did not, however, cling to the idea, upon which he had allowed his
          mind to dwell for a time, but quickly returned to his better self, and being much affected
          by the extremely high honours bestowed on him by me, he looked upon them as more valuable
          than any money. I have received his will from Curius, and am bringing it with me. I am
          informed of the legacies Hortensius has to pay. I am now eager to know the man's position,
          and what properties he is putting up to auction. For I don't know why, since Caelius has
          monopolized the Porta Flumentana, <note n="1" anchored="true">Near which Caelius had
            bought the property of Lucceius. </note> I should not make myself owner of Puteoli.
            <milestone unit="para"/>Now for the word <foreign xml:lang="la">Piraeea</foreign>: in
          using it I exposed myself to severer criticism for writing Peiraeea instead of
          Piraeum—which is the form adopted by all our countrymen-than for adding an <foreign
            xml:lang="la">in</foreign>. For I did not prefix the preposition to the word as the name
          of a town, but of a locality: and, after all, our friend Dionysius, and Nicias of Cos, who
          is with me, did not consider the Piraeus to be a town. But I will see to it. The fact is
          that, if I have made a mistake, it is in not speaking of it as a town, but as a place; and
          for having followed, I don't say Caecilius (mane ut ex portu in Piraeum), for he is a poor
          authority for Latinity, but Terence, whose plays, owing to the elegance of their language,
          were thought to be written by Laelius. He says, "Heri aliquot adulescentuli coimus in
          Piraeum"; and also, "Mercator hoc addebati...captam e Sunio." <note n="2" anchored="true"
            >Eun. 539, 115. </note> Now if we choose to consider demes to be towns, Sunium is as
          much a town as Piraeus. But since you are by way of being a grammarian, <pb n="222"/> you
          will relieve me of much vexation if you solve me this knotty point. He <note n="1"
            anchored="true">Caesar. </note> sends me courteous letters. Balbus does the same for
          him. I am resolved not to swerve a finger's breadth from the most absolute loyalty in any
          direction. But you know the balance he has against me. Do you think, then, that some one
          will twit me with it, if I am lukewarm in opposition, or that he will demand repayment if
          I am overvigorous? What solution can you find to this? "Pay him," you say. Well, then, I
          will borrow from Caelius. However, pray turn this matter over in your mind. For I imagine,
          if I have at any time made a fine speech in defence of the constitution, that your
          Tartessian <note n="2" anchored="true">Balbus, a native of <foreign xml:lang="la"

          "Be so good as to direct the money to be paid." What else is there to say? Why, this. My
          son-in-law makes himself very agreeable to me, to Tullia, and to Terentia. He has any
          amount whether of ability or culture. We must be content. Other points in his character,
          with which you are acquainted, must be tolerated. For you know the men whom we bave

        <p> DIONYSIUS was burning with desire to be with you, and I have accordingly sent him, but,
          by Hercules, with great reluctance. However, I was obliged to give way. I have found him,
          indeed, both a good scholar (which I knew before> and a man of high character, very
          obliging, careful too of my reputation, honest, and—not to give him only the praise that
          suits a freedman—a thoroughly good man. <milestone unit="para"/>I saw Pompey on the 10th
          of December: we were together perhaps two hours. He seemed to me to be much delighted at
          my return: urged me to a claim a triumph: undertook to do his part: warned me not to enter
          the senate until I had gained my object, for fear of alienating some tribune by the
          speeches I delivered. Need I say more? In cordiality of mere language nothing could have
          been more explicit. On the political situation, however, the tone of his remarks assumed
          the existence of downright war. He held out no hope of maintaining peace: "he had felt
          before that Caesar was alienated from him, he had recently become quite sure of it.
          Hirtius, Caesar's most intimate friend, had been in the neighbourhood, but had not called
          on him. Moreover, Hirtius having arrived in the evening of the 6th of December, and Balbus
          having arranged to visit Scipio <note n="1" anchored="true">Pompey's father-in-law.
          </note> on the 7th, before daybreak, Hirtius started to rejoin Caesar late in the previous
          night." This seemed to him to be a clear "symptom" <note n="2" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">tekmhriw=des</foreign>. </note> of alienation. In short, nothing
          else consoles me but the opinion that the man, to whom even his enemies have assigned a
          second consulship, and fortune has given supreme power, will not be so mad as to put these
          advantages in danger. But if he once begins to run amuck, I verily have many fears which I
          do not venture to put into writing. However, as the matter stands at present, I think of
          approaching the city on the 3rd of January. <pb n="224"/>

          thousand ways, when he is well, in every department of my business and my studies, yet my
          anxiety for his recovery is founded on his own kindness and high character, rather than on
          my convenience. Philogenes never said a word to me about Luscenius. As to other matters,

          known to us both. The only thing left is to jest, if this personage will allow us. For I
          am one who thinks it more expedient to yield to his demands than to fight. For it is too
          late in the day to be resisting a man, whom we have been nursing up against ourselves
          these ten years past. "What will be your view, then?" say you. None, of course, except in

          good scholar and warmly devoted to you, arrived in Rome on the 16th of January and
          delivered me a letter from you." Those are your exact words about Dionysius in your
          letter. You don't add, "and he expressed his gratitude to you." And yet he certainly ought
          to have done so, and, if he had, you are always so good-natured that you would have added
          it to your sentence. However, any palinode in regard to him is made impossible for me,

          paid the money due. I wished him to have the use of the money as long as he legally could;
          accordingly, he has kept it <pb n="227"/> fourteen months. I hope Pomptinus is recovering
          and as to having entered the city, as you say in your letter, I feel somewhat anxious as
          to what he means by it. For he would not have done so except for some weighty reason. As
          the 2nd of January is the Compitalia, <note n="1" anchored="true">The Compitahlia were
            always about this time, though the exact day varied. At them slaves took part in the
            family festival. It was therefore like arriving on Christmas Day to come to a house
            then. </note> I don't want to arrive at Pompey's Alban villa on that day, for fear of
          inconveniencing his servants. I shall do so, therefore, on the 3rd, and go thence to the
          city on the 4th. I don't know on what day your quartan fit is due; but I am very unwilling
          that you should be disturbed to the detriment of your health. As to my triumph, unless
          Caesar has been secretly intriguing by means of the tribunes who are in his interest,
          everything else appears to be going smoothly. My mind however is supremely calm, and
          regards the whole thing with utter indifference: the more so that I am told by many that
          Pompey and his council have determined to send me to Sicily on the ground of my having
          imperium. That is worthy of Abdera! <note n="2" anchored="true">Renowned for the stupidity
            of its inhabitants. </note> For neither has the senate decreed nor the people ordered me
          to have imperium in Sicily. But if the state delegates this to Pompey why should he send
          me rather than some unofficial person? So, if the possession of this imperium is going to
          be a nuisance to me, I shall avail myself of the first city gate I came to. <note n="3"
            anchored="true">I.e., get rid of my imperium by entering the city. </note> For as to
          what you say, that my coming is awaited with astonishing interest, and that none of the
          loyalists, or even the semi loyalists, have any doubt about what I am likely to do—I don't
          understand whom you mean by the "loyalists"—I know of none—that is to say no class of such
          men: for of course, there are individuals who are loyalists; but when it is a case of
          politic divisions what we have to look for is classes and sets of loyalists. Do you regard
          the senate as loyalist when it is owing to it that the provinces have no governors' with
          imperium? For Curio would never have held out if negotiations with him had been set on
          foot—a measure which the senate refused to adopt with the result that no successor was
          named to Caesar. Or the publicani who, having never been staunch, are now <pb n="228"/>
          warmly in favour of Caesar? Or the financiers or the farmers, whose chief interest is
          peace? Unless you can suppose such men to dread being under royal rule, who have never
          declined it, so long only as they were left in peace and quiet. Well then! Do I approve of
          votes being taken for a man who is retaining an army beyond the legal day? For my part, I
          say no; nor in his absence either. But when the former was granted him, so was the latter.
            <note n="1" anchored="true">When he was given his five extra years, i. e., up to March,
              <date when="-0048">B.C. 48</date>, the right of standing for the consulship was
            practically given him also. </note> "Why, do you approve of the ten years' grant, and of
          the way in which the law was carried?" If I do, then I approve of my own banishment, and
          the loss of the Campanian land, and of the adoption of a patrician by a plebeian, of a
          Gaditanian by a Mytilenean; <note n="2" anchored="true">Of Balbus by <foreign

          fountain-head of all these things is the same. We should have resisted him when he was
          weak, and that would have been easy. Now we are confronted by eleven legions, cavalry at
          his desire, the Transpadani, <note n="3" anchored="true">Because Caesar promised them full

          city rabble, all these tribunes, a rising generation corrupted as we see, a leader of such
          influence and audacity. With such a man we must either fight a pitched battle, or admit
          his candidature in virtue of the law. "Fight," say you, "rather than be a slave." To what
          end? To be proscribed, if beaten: to be a slave after all, if victorious? "What do you
          mean to do, then ?" say you. Just what animals do, who when scattered follow the flocks of
          their own kind. As an ox follows a herd, so shall I follow the loyalists or whoever are
          said to be loyalists, even if they take a disastrous course. What the best course is in
          this unfortunate dilemma I see clearly. For no one can be certain of the result when once
          we come to fighting: but everyone is certain that, if the loyalists are beaten, this man
          will not be more merciful than Cinna in the massacre of the nobility, nor less rapacious
          than Sulla in confiscating the property of the rich. I have <pb n="229"/> been talking
          politics with you all this time, and I would have gone on doing so, had not my lamp failed
          me. The upshot is this : " Your vote, M. Tullius!" "I vote with Gnaeus Pompeius: that is,
          with Titus Pomponius." Pray give my regards to Alexis, that very accomplished boy, unless
          perchance he has become a man during my absence, for he seemed on the point of doing so.

        <p> WHAT need was there to speak so strongly about Dionysius? Wouldn't the slightest hint
          from you have been enough for me? The fact is, your silence had roused all the more
          suspicion in me, first because your usual custom is to cement friendship by testifying to
          mutual goodwill, and secondly because I was told that he had spoken to others in a
          different tone. <note n="1" anchored="true">See p. 226. </note> However, I am quite
          convinced that the truth is as you say. Accordingly, my feelings towards him are what you
          wish them to be. The day on which your fit was due I had noted for myself, from a letter
          which you wrote in the early stages of your feverish attack, and I had calculated that, as
          things are, you could come to the Alban villa to meet me on the 3rd of January without
          inconvenience. But pray do nothing to injure your health. For what does one day or another
          matter? I see that by Livia's will Dolabella, takes a third between himself and two
          others, <note n="2" anchored="true">That is, he took a third of a third, i. e., one-ninth
            of the whole estate. We don't know who <foreign xml:lang="la">Livia</foreign> was, and

          to about how much a third of a third amounts. <milestone unit="para"/>What you thought
          would be the case—that I should see Pompey before arriving at Rome—has happened. For he
          caught me up near the Lavernium on the 25th. We came together to Formiae and from two
          o'clock till evening had a private conversation. As to your question whether there is any
          hope of making peace, as far as I could gather from a long and exhaustive discourse of
          Pompey's, he hasn't even the wish for it. His view is this: if he becomes consul, even
          after dismissing his army, there will be a bouleversement of the constitution. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">su/gxusin th=s politei/as</foreign>, perhaps coup d' état might
            represent it, but it does not really represent Pompey's view. </note> Besides, he thinks
          that when Caesar is told that preparations against him are being pushed on energetically,
          he will throw aside the consulship for this year and prefer retaining his army and
          province. But if Caesar were to act such a mad part, he entertained a low opinion of his
          power, and felt confident in his own and the state's resources. The long and the short of
          it was that, although intestine war " <note n="3" anchored="true">
            <bibl n="Hom. Il. 18.309">Hom. Il. 18.309</bibl>. </note> was often in my thoughts, yet
          I felt my anxiety removed while I listened to a man of courage, military skill, and
          supreme influence, discoursing like a statesman on the dangers of a mock peace. Moreover,
          we had in our hands the speech of Antony, delivered on the 21st of December, which
          contained an invective against Pompey, beginning from his boyhood, a complaint as to those
          who had been condemned, and a threat of armed intervention. On reading this Pompey
          remarked, "What do you think Caesar himself will do, if he obtains supreme power in the
          state, when his quaestor—-a man of no influence or wealth-dares to talk like that ?" <note
            n="4" anchored="true">M. Antonius had just become tribune (l0th December, <date
              when="-0050">B.C. 50</date>), but he had been quaestor in Gaul in <date when="-0052"
              >B.C. 52</date>, and seems to have been in high favour with Caesar, who had been
            exerting himself to get him elected augur. The "condemned" are the victims of Pompey's
            law on bribery of <date when="-0052">B.C. 52</date> (see vol. i., p. 366). The
            Caesarians always maintained that these men had been in many cases unfairly condemned,
            and one of the first measures after Caesar's success was their recall. </note> In short,
          he appeared to me not <pb n="231"/> merely not to desire the peace you talk of, but even
          to fear it. However, he is, I think, somewhat shaken in his idea of abandoning the city by
          the scandal it would cause. <note n="1" anchored="true">The text is very uncertain here. I

        <p> AM I to receive," quoth you, "a letter from you every single day?" Yes! if I find anyone
          to give it to, every day. "But you are all but here in person." Well, when I have arrived,

          holds his army (whether by the favour of senate or tribunes); OR that Caesar should be
          persuaded to hand over his province and army, and so become consul; OR, if he cannot be
          persuaded to do so, that the election should be held without admitting his name as
          candidate; OR, if he employs tribunes to prevent that, and yet makes no warlike move, that
          there must be an interregnum; OR, if on the ground of his legal candidateship having been
          ignored he moves up his army, that we must fight him with arms, while he must begin
          hostilities either at <pb n="232"/> once before we are prepared, or as soon as his friends
          have their demand for having him recognized as a candidate at the election refused: but
          that he will either have the one excuse for an appeal to arms (that his candidature is
          ignored), or will have an additional one, if it chances that some tribune, when vetoing
          the senate or stirring up the people, is censured, or hampered by a senatorial decree, or
          forcibly removed, or driven out of the city, or flies to him, alleging that he has been so
          driven out: SEEING finally, that, if war is once begun, we must either defend the city, or
          abandon it and try to cut him off from supplies and other resources: consider, I say,
          which of these evils, some one of which we must confront, you think the least. <milestone
            unit="para"/>You will no doubt say "to persuade him to hand over his army, and so become
          consul." Well, certainly against this proposal, supposing him to submit so far, nothing
          can be said: and, since he doesn't succeed in getting his candidature acknowledged while
          he still retains his army, I wonder he does not do so. For us, however, as certain persons
          think, nothing is more to be dreaded than his becoming consul. "But I would prefer his
          being consul on these terms to his being so with an army," you will say. Certainly. But
          even on "these terms," I tell you, there is one who thinks it a grave evil. Nor is there
          any remedy against it: we must submit if he insists upon it. Imagine him consul a second
          time after our experience of his former consulship! "Why, comparatively weak as he was
          then," you say, "he was more powerful than the whole state." What, then, do you think will
          be the case now? Moreover, if he is consul, Pompey is resolved to be in Spain. What a sad
          state of things, when the very worst alternative is just the one which cannot be rejected,
          and the one which, if he adopts it, would at once secure him the highest favour with all
          the loyalists! <milestone unit="para"/>Let us, then, put this out of the question. They
          say that he cannot be induced to accept it. Which is the worst of the other alternatives?
          Why, to concede to him what, according to the same authority, is his most impudent demand.
          For could anything be more impudent? "You have held a province for ten years, a time not
          granted you by the senate, but assumed by yourself with the help of violence and sedition:
          this period—not assigned by the law, but by <pb n="233"/> your own caprice—has passed. Let
          us, however, grant that it was by the law: a decree is made for naming your successor: you

          gave it you? "You must fight unless you grant it." Certainly—to quote Pompey again—and

          return to our friend. In the name of fortune, what do you think of Pompey's plan? I mean
          in abandoning the city? For I am at a loss to explain it. Nothing, again, could be more
          irrational. Do you mean to abandon the city? Then you would have done the same if the
          Gauls were upon us. "The Republic," says he, "does not depend on brick and mortar." No,
          but it does depend on altars and hearths. "Themistocles did the same." Yes, for one city
          was incapable of resisting the flood of the whole East. But Pericles did not so act, about
          fifty years afterwards, for he abandoned everything except the walls. Our own country men

          this plan is likely to prove successful in a way. There is an extraordinary outcry—I don't

          magistrates or senate. In fact, there is a wonderfully strong feeling at Pompey's being in
          flight. Indeed, the point of view is quite changed: people are now for <pb n="243"/>
          making no concessions to Caesar. Expound to me what all this means. My department is a
          very quiet one. For Pompey wishes me to be a kind of "president" of the whole of this
          Campanian seacoast, to superintend the levy, and hold the chief command. Accordingly, I
          meditate being continually on the move. I think you must see by this time what Caesar's
          aim, what the disposition of the people, and the general position of affairs are. Pray
          write and tell me about them, and that, too, as often as possible, since they are
          continually shifting. For I find relief both in writing to you and in reading your
          letters. </p>

        <p> As yet I have received only one letter from you dated the 19th, and in it you indicated
          that you had written another, which I have not received. But I beg you to write as often
          as possible, not only whatever you know or have been told, but also what you suspect, and
          above all what you think I ought to do or not to do. You ask me to be sure to let you know
          what Pompey is doing: I don't think he knows himself, certainly none of us do. I saw the
          consul Lentulus at Formiae on the 21st; I have seen Libo. Nothing but terror and
          uncertainty everywhere! Pompey is on the road to Larinum; for there are some cohorts
          there, as also at Luceria and Teanum, and in the rest of Apulia. After that nobody knows
          whether he means to make a stand anywhere, or to cross the sea. If he stays in Italy, I am
          afraid he cannot have a dependable army: but if he goes away, where I am to go or stay, or
          what I am to do, I don't know. For the man, whose "Phalarism" <note n="1" anchored="true"
            >Cruelty like that of the tyrant <foreign xml:lang="la">Phalaris</foreign>. </note> you
          dread, will, I think, spare no form of brutality: nor will the suspension <pb n="244"/> of
          business, nor the departure of senate and magistrates, nor the Closing of the treasury
          Cause him to pause. But all this, as you say, we shall know before long. Meanwhile,
          forgive my writing to you at such length and so often. For I find some relief in it, and
          at the same time want to draw a letter from you, and above all some advice as to what I am
          to do and how to conduct myself. Shall I commit myself wholly to this side? I am not
          deterred by the danger, but I am bursting with vexation. Such a want of all plan! so
          utterly opposed in every respect to my advice! Am I to procrastinate and trim, and then
          join the winning side, the party in power? "I dread to face the Trojans," <note n="1"

          only of a citizen, but also of a friend, though my resolution is often weakened by pity
          for my children. Do, therefore, though equally anxious yourself; write something to a man
          in this state of utter uncertainty, and especially what you think I ought to do in case of
          Pompey's quitting Italy. Manius Lepidus, for his part—for we have been together-draws the
          line at that, and so does L. Torquatus I am hampered, among many other things, by my
          lictors: I have never seen such a hopeless entanglement. Accordingly, I don't expect
          anything positive from you, but merely your present impression. In fact, I want to know
          what the precise difficulty in your mind is. It is all but certain that Labienus <note
            n="2" anchored="true">T. Atius Labienus had been Caesar's <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >legatus</foreign> in Gaul, and was so trusted by him as to be left in charge of

              >B.C. 50</date>). Caesar was warned that he was being tampered with, but refused to
            believe it (<bibl n="Caes. Gal. 8.52">Caes. B. G. 8.52</bibl>). It was, however, true,
            and he became one of the most violent of the Pompeians. He eventually fell at <foreign

          possible that on coming to Rome Labienus had found magistrates and a senate there, he
          would have been of eminent service to our cause.. For it would have been Clear that
          loyalty to the Republic had caused him to hold one who was his friend guilty of treason.
          This is clear even now, but of less practical advantage: for there is no one to be of
          advantage to, and I expect him to feel some dissatisfaction—unless perchance <pb n="245"/>
          it is not true, after all, that he has abandoned Caesar. For myself; I am convinced that
          it is true. Pray, though you say you confine yourself to the limits of your own house, do
          give me a sketch of the City. Is Pompey missed? Is there any appearance of a feeling
          against Caesar? What, too, is your opinion as to Terentia and Tullia? Should they stay at
          Rome, or join me, or seek some place of safety? On this, and indeed on any other point,
          pray write to me, or rather keep on writing. </p>

        <p> As to the business of Vennonius, I agree with you. Labienus I regard as a "demigod."
          There has been no political stroke this long time past more brilliant. If he has done no
          other good, he has at least given him pain. But as a matter of fact, I do think that some
          good has been done to the cause. I am charmed also with Piso, whose judgment on his
          son-in-law I think will have weight. But you perceive the nature of the war. It is only a
          civil war in the sense that it has originated from the unscrupulous boldness of one
          unprincipled citizen, not as arising from a division of sentiment between the citizens
          generally. But that man is strong in the possession of an army, he commands the allegiance
          of many by the prospects he holds out and the promises he makes: nothing that anyone
          possesses is beyond the scope of his desires. To such a man as this the city has been
          abandoned, without any garrison to protect it, crammed with every kind of wealth. What
          would you not have to fear from the man who regards those temples and roofs, not as
          constituting his fatherland? but as objects for plunder? <note n="1" anchored="true">Cp.

          without senate and without magistrates, I cannot tell. He will not be able to keep up even
          a <pb n="247"/> pretence of constitutional action. For us, however-where shall we be able
          to raise our heads or when? How utterly incapable our general is you yourself observe, in
          having had no intelligence of the state of affairs even in Picenum: and how devoid of any
          plan of campaign, the facts are witness. For, to say nothing of other mistakes committed
          during the last ten years, could any terms be worse than such a flight? Nor, indeed, have
          I any idea what he is contemplating at this moment, though I never cease asking again and
          again by letter. Everyone agrees that he is in a state of abject alarm and agitation.
          Accordingly, as far as I can see, there is no garrison—to organize which he was kept at
          the city walls-nor any place where a garrison could be posted. His whole hope rests on the
          two legions somewhat treacherously retained, and almost to be regarded as belonging to
          another. <note n="1" anchored="true">See p. 253, note. </note> For as yet, indeed, those
          whom he is enlisting are men reluctant to serve and averse from fighting. While the time
          for making terms has been let slip. I do not see what is going to happen. At any rate we,
          or our leader, have allowed things to come to this pass, that, having left harbour without
          a rudder, we must let ourselves drift before the storm. So I hesitate as to what to do
          with my son and nephew: sometimes I think I had better despatch them to Greece. For Tullia
          and Terentia, again—when I see a vision of barbarians arriving in the city—I am filled
          with all kinds of alarm; but when I think of Dolabella, I breathe again somewhat. But pray
          consider what you think ought to be done: in the first place, with an eye to their
          safety—for I must regard their security as requiring to be considered in a different light
          from my own-secondly, with a view to popular opinion, that I may not be blamed for
          deciding that they should remain at Rome, when the loyalists generally are flying from it.
          Nay, even you and Peducaeus—for he has written to me—must take care what you' do. You are
          men of such shining characters, that the same line of conduct is expected from you as from
          the noblest citizens. But I can safely leave this to you, since it is to you that I look

          which he picked up as a message. Labienus, a man of noble character in my opinion, arrived

        <p> I WRITE this letter, though suffering from slight inflammation of the eyes, when on the
          point of quitting Cales for Capua. L. Caesar brought Caesar's message to Pompey on the
          23rd, while the latter was at Teanum with the consuls. His proposal was accepted, but on
          condition of his withdrawing his garrisons from the towns which he had occupied outside
          his province. If he did this, they said in their answer that we would return to Rome and
          conclude the negotiation in the <pb n="251"/> senate. <note n="1" anchored="true">Caesar
              (<bibl n="Caes. Civ. 1.14">B.C. 1.14</bibl>) calls this proposal unfair, for Pompey,

            to Spain, and proposed to retain his province and legions, while Caesar's army was to be
            disbanded. </note> I hope for the present we have peace: for he is not quite easy about
          his mad enterprise, nor our general as to the amount of his forces. Pompey has directed me
          to come to Capua and assist the levy, to which the Campanian settlers <note n="2"

              >consul</foreign>, at first called these men out with a promise of freedom. But this
            seemed shocking to Roman ideas, and, being remonstrated with, he billeted them out as
            described. Cicero would seem to put the matter, as though this billeting them out in
            pairs was, from the first, a precautionary measure. It may be that Cicero is right, and
            that Caesar got a false idea of the transaction from some hostile source. </note> There
          were 5,000 shields in the school: they were said to be contemplating breaking out.
          Pompey's measure was a very wise precaution for the safety of the state. As to our ladies,
          in whom I include your sister, pray consider whether they can stay at Rome with propriety,
          when other ladies of the same rank have left town. I have said this to them and to
          yourself in a previous letter. I would like you to urge upon them to leave the city,
          especially as I have properties on the sea-coast—now under my presidency—on which they
          might reside in tolerable comfort, considering all things. For if I get into any

          remained in Rome longer than others. Please let me know what you and Sextus are thinking
          of doing as to leaving town, and what your opinion is on the whole situation. For my part,
          I never cease urging peace, which, however unfair, is better than the justest war in the
          world. But this is in the hands of fortune. <pb n="252"/>

        <p> EVER since I left Rome I have not let a single day pass without sending you something by
          way of letter; not because I had anything particularly to write about, but in order that I
          might chat with you in my absence, than which—since I cannot do so face to face-nothing
          gives me greater pleasure. On arriving at Capua on the 25th—the day before I write this—I
          met the consuls and many members of the senate. All were anxious that Caesar should stand
          by his offer, with the addition of withdrawing his garrisons. Favonius alone disapproved
          of any conditions being imposed on us by him; but he was not listened to in the
          discussion. For even Cato himself now prefers slavery to fighting. However, he says that
          he wishes to be in the senate when the terms are debated, if Caesar can be induced to
          withdraw his garrisons. So he is not eager about going to Sicily—the very thing most
          wanted: but he does wish to be in the senate, where I fear he will only do mischief.
          Postumius, moreover, who was definitely named in the senatorial decree to go to Sicily at
          once and succeed Furfanius, says that he will not go without Cato, and thinks very highly
          of his own personal service and influence in the senate. Accordingly, this duty has fallen
          to Fannius. He is being sent in advance to Sicily with imperium. In our discussions a
          great variety of opinion is expressed. Most declare that Caesar will not abide by his
          offer, and say that these demands were only thrown in by him to prevent our making the
          necessary preparations for war. I, however, am of opinion that he will carry out the
          withdrawal of the garrisons. For he will have gained his point if he is elected consul,
          and gained it with less crime than that of his first step. But we must put up with the
          blow: for we are scandalously unprepared both in regard to soldiers and money. All the
          latter, indeed-not only private money in <pb n="253"/> the city, but the public money in
          the treasury also—we have left for him. Pompey has started to join the Appian legions.

            Caesar for the Parthian war, which, according to Plutarch (Pomp. 57), were led into

        <p> I think all your letters have reached me, but the first batch was out of their proper
          order, the rest in the order in which they were sent by Terentia. About Caesar's message
          and the arrival of Labienus, and about the consuls' and Pompey's answer, I told you in the
          letter of the 26th of January from Capua, and I put a good deal more information into the
          same packet. At present we are in suspense on two points: first, what Caesar will do when
          he has received the answer intrusted to L. Caesar to take to him; and, secondly, what
          Pompey is doing now. The latter, indeed, writes me word that in a few days he will have a
          strong army, and leads me to hope that, if he makes his way into Picenum, we shall return
          to Rome. He has got Labienus with him, who has no doubt about the weakness of Caesar's
          forces; and Pompey is in much better spirits since his arrival. I have been <pb n="256"/>
          ordered to Capua by the consuls on the 5th of February. I left Capua for Formiae on the
          28th of January. On that day having received your letter at Cales about three o'clock in
          the afternoon, I am writing this on the spot. About Terentia and Tullia I agree with you,
          and I have written to tell them to apply to you. If they have not yet started, there is no
          occasion for their disturbing themselves until we see how affairs stand. </p>

        <p> YOUR letter is both welcome and delightful. I thought of sending the boys to Greece when
          there seemed an idea of Pompey's flying from Italy: for I should have made for Spain,
          which would not have been equally suitable for them. For yourself and Sextus, <note n="1"
            anchored="true">Sext. Peducaeus. </note> it seems to me that even now you may remain
          with propriety at Rome. For you are not at all bound to be my Pompey's friends. For no one
          ever did more to detract from the value of city property ! <note n="2" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign> invested much money in city property (<bibl
              n="Nep. Att. 14">Nepos, Att. 14</bibl>). Cicero means that Pompey's abandonment of
            Rome has depreciated the value of such properties. </note> Do you see that I am
          absolutely joking? You ought now to know what answer L. Caesar is taking back from Pompey,
          and what sort of a letter he is conveying from him to Caesar: for they were drawn up and
          despatched with the express purpose of being exposed for public perusal. 'On this point I
          blamed Pompey in my own heart for having trusted our friend Sestius with the writing of a
          despatch so important and certain to come into everybody's hands, though he has a very
          good style of his own. Accordingly, I never read anything more "Sestian." <note n="3"
            anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">*shstiwde/steron</foreign>. In the many allusions to P. Sestius
            (whom he defended) Cicero does not seem ever to have depreciated him, except that once
            (vol. i., p. 219) he calls him <foreign xml:lang="la">morosus</foreign>, "whimsical,"
              "<foreign xml:lang="la">difficile</foreign>," and talks of his "wrong-headedness in
            certain particulars" (<foreign xml:lang="la">perversitatem quibusdam</foreign> in
            rebus). </note> Nevertheless, it is made quite clear from Pompey's despatch that nothing
          is denied to Caesar, and that all his demands are conceded to the full: he will be a sheer
          madman if he declines the very proposals which it required the most consummate impudence
          ever to have made! Pray, who are you to say, "If he goes to Spain," "if he dismisses the
          garrisons"? Nevertheless, the <pb n="258"/> concession is being made: with less dignity,
          indeed, at this time of day— for it is after the Republic has actually been violated by
          him and its territory invaded-than if he had some time back obtained his demand to be
          reckoned a candidate; and yet I doubt his being content even with these concessions. For,
          after giving that message to L. Caesar, he ought, until he received the answer, to have
          somewhat relaxed his warlike movements, whereas he is said to be at this moment more
          active than ever. Trebatius, indeed, writes to say that on the 22nd of January he was
          asked by him to write to me, urging me to remain at the city walls: that I could not
          oblige him more. This was put at great length. I calculated by reckoning the days that, as
          soon as Caesar heard of my departure, he began to be anxious lest we should all leave
          town. Therefore I have no doubt he has written to Piso, and also to Servius. One thing I
          am surprised at, that he has not written to me himself; nor opened his communication with
          me through Dolabella or Caelius: not that I disdain a letter from Trebatius, whom I know
          to be singularly attached to me. I wrote back to Trebatius—for I wouldn't write to Caesar
          himself; as he had not written to me—pointing out how difficult that course was for me at
          such a time as this; that I was, however, at my own country seat and had not undertaken
          any levy or any active part in the affair. <note n="1" anchored="true">Cicero had been
            urged to come to <foreign xml:lang="la">Capua</foreign> to assist in the levy. Those who
            wish to maintain his veracity assert that he had done nothing in the matter. But at any
            rate he had accepted the command of the sea-coast of <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Campania</foreign>, though he afterwards resigned even that. It must be admitted,
            however, that he is sailing near the wind. </note> By this I shall abide, as long as
          there is any hope of peace. But if war really begins, I shall not be wanting to my duty or
          position, after despatching my boys to Greece. For I perceive that all Italy will be
          blazing with war. Such the mischief that is caused partly by disloyal, partly by jealous
          citizens! But how far this will go I shall learn within the next few days by his answer to
          mine. Then I will write to you at greater length, if there is going to be war: but if
          there is to be peace, or even a truce, I shall, I hope, see you in person. On the 2nd of
          February, on which I write this, I am expecting the ladies at my Formian house, whither I
          have returned from Capua. I <pb n="259"/> had written to them on your advice to remain at
          Rome; but I hear that there is some increase of panic in the city. I mean to be at Capua
          on the 5th of February, in accordance with orders from the consuls. Whatever news reaches
          me here from Pompey I will let you know at once, and shall expect a letter from you as to
          what is going on at Rome. </p>

        <p> On the 2nd of February our ladies came to Formiae and reported to me your services to
          them replete with the most affectionate kindness. I wished them, till we knew whether we
          were to have a dishonourable peace or an unhappy war, to remain in my Formian villa, and
          our two boys with them. I myself, with my brother, am starting for Capua on the 3rd of
          February, on which I despatch this letter, to join the consuls, having been ordered to be
          there on the 5th. Pompey's answer is said to be popular and to have received the
          approbation of a public meeting. I thought that would be the ease. If Caesar refuses to
          accept that he will be entirely discredited: if he accepts it ! "Which, then, do you
          prefer?" you will say. I would have answered the question if I knew what our state of
          preparation was. It is reported here that Cassius <note n="1" anchored="true">Q. Cassius
            Longinus, the tnbune who, with Antony, had vetoed the decree about Caesar in January,
            and had fled to <foreign xml:lang="la">Ariminum</foreign>. The rumour referred to had no
            foundation. </note> has been driven from Ancona, and that city occupied by our men. If
          there is to be war, that will be an advantage. As for Caesar himself; say that, though he
          sent L. Caesar with a message as to making peace, he continues holding levies with the
          greatest activity, occupying posts, securing them with garrisons. What an unprincipled
          bandit! What a disgrace to <pb n="260"/> the Republic, hardly to be outweighed by any
          relief from war! But let us cease anger, bow to circumstances, and accompany Pompey to
          Spain. It is the best of a bad job, since we failed to avert that man's second consulship
          from the state, even when we had the opportunity. <note n="1" anchored="true">When we
            might have prevented the law being passed allowing Caesar to be a candidate in his
            absence. Others take it, "though we refused him his second consulship even when it was
            not an opportune moment for doing it", (because he had a strong army). I do not think
            the Latin will bear this. In support of the translation in the text we may remember that
            Cicero often traces the whole difficulty to the initial mistake of the law allowing
            Caesar to be a candidate without coming to Rome. </note> But enough of this. <milestone
            unit="para"/>I forgot to write to you about Dionysius before; but I have come to the
          conclusion to wait till Caesar's answer is known, so that, if I return to the city, he
          should await me there, but, if there is any delay, I should summon him to join me. Of
          course I know what his duty will be in case I have to fly, and what will be the conduct
          becoming a man of learning and a friend: but I don't expect too much in this way from
          Greeks. However, if; as I hope will not be the case, I have to send for him, pray see that
          I am not troubling an unwilling man. Quintus is anxious to pay you his debt by drawing on
          Egnatius, and Egnatius is neither unwilling nor short of cash; but when the state of
          things is such that Quintus Titinius <note n="2" anchored="true">Q. Titinius, a Roman

            Titinius on Casar's staff, immortalized by Shakespeare ("Give me some drink, Titinius
            '). L. Octavius <foreign xml:lang="la">Ligur</foreign> was also a lender of money. L.
            Egnatius is mentioned several times as owing Q. Cicero money. </note> —of whom we are
          seeing a good deal-declares that he has no money for personal expenses, and has yet
          announced to his debtors that they may go on with the same interest, and when L Ligur is
          said to have done the same, and when Quintus at this crisis has no cash in hand, and is
          neither able to get any from Egnatius nor to raise a new loan, <note n="3" anchored="true">

            an old one. </note> he is surprised that you do not take into consideration this general
          tightness of the money market. For my part, though I obey the <pb n="261"/>

            proverbs. The line does not occur in the extant Hesiodic poems, and was attributed to

          shewn at the public meeting, and was still in the belief that he would abide by the terms,
          especially as they were of his own proposing. But here, this 3rd of February, I have
          received in the morning a letter from you, one from Philotimus, another from Furnius, with
          one from Curio to Furnius, in which Curio ridicules the mission of L. Caesar. I think we
          are completely trapped, nor do I know what plan to adopt. But it isn't about myself that I
          am anxious: what to do about the boys is what puzzles me. However, as I write this I am on

        <p> I have no choice but to be brief. I have given up all hope of peace, and as to war, our
          men are not stirring a finger. Don't, pray, suppose that our consuls care for anything
          less than that: though it was in hopes of hearing something and learning what preparations
          we were making that I came to meet them in a pelting rain on the 4th, according to orders.
          They, however, had not arrived, and were expected on the 5th-empty-handed and unprepared.
          Pompey, again, is said to be at Luceria, and on his way to join some cohorts of the Appian
          legions, <note n="1" anchored="true">The two legions which had been withdrawn from Gaul in

          friendship for Pompey, the claims of the loyalist cause, the disgrace of having anything
          to do with a tyrant; as to whom it is uncertain whether he will copy Phalaris or
          Pisistratus. Pray unravel these perplexities for me, and help me with your advice, though
          I expect by this time you are in a warm corner yourself at Rome. However, do the best you
          can. If I learn anything fresh today, I will let you know. For the consuls will be here

        <p> ABOUT our misfortunes you hear sooner than I: for they flow from Rome. As for anything
          good, there is none to be expected from this quarter. I arrived at Capua for the 5th of
          February, in accordance with the order of the consuls. Late on that day Lentulus arrived;
          the other consul had absolutely not come on the 7th. For I left Capua on that day and
          stayed at Cales. From that town I am sending this letter, before daybreak, on the 8th.
          What I ascertained while at Capua was that the consuls are no good: that no levy is being
          held anywhere. For the recruiting officers do not venture to shew their faces, with Caesar
          close at hand, and our leader, on the contrary, nowhere and doing nothing; nor do recruits
          give in their names. It is not goodwill to the cause, but hope that is wanting. As to our
          leader Gnaeus—what an inconceivably miserable spectacle! What a complete breakdown! No
          courage, no plan, no forces, no energy! I will pass over his most discreditable flight
          from the city, his abject speeches in the towns, his ignorance not only of his opponent's,
          but even of his own resources—but what do you think of this? On the 7th of February the
          tribune C. Cassius came with an order from him to the consuls that they should go to Rome,
          remove the money from the reserve treasury, <note n="1" anchored="true">Sanctius <foreign
              xml:lang="la">aerarium</foreign>. A reserve fund, said originally to have been made in
            case of a Gallic invasion, was replenished by the tax of five per cent. on the selling
            value of manumitted slaves. This was first levied in <date when="-00357">B.C. 357</date>
            (Livy, vii. i6), and remained in force till a late period of the empire. The reserve
            fund was drawn upon in <date when="-00212">B.C. 212</date>, during the second Punic war
              (<bibl n="Liv. 27.11">Livy, 27.11</bibl>). According to Caesar (<bibl
              n="Caes. Civ. 1.4">B.C. 1.4</bibl>), the consuls were just about to open it before
            they left Rome, but, teirrified by a false report of Caesar's immediate approach, fled
            without doing so. Pompey now wishes them to go back for it. </note> and <pb n="264"/>
          immediately quit the town. After leaving the City they are to return! Under what guard?
          They are to Come out of the City! Who is to give them leave to do so? The Consul
          (Lentulus) wrote back to say that Pompey must himself first make his way into Picenum. But
          the fact is, that district has already been entirely lost. No one knows that except
          myself, who have learnt it from a letter of Dolabella's. I have no manner of doubt but
          that Caesar is all but actually in Apulia, and our friend Gnaeus already on board ship.
          What I am to do is a great "problem," though it would have been no problem to me, had not
          everything been most disgracefully mismanaged, and without consulting me in any way;
          problem, however, it is, as to what it is my duty to do. Caesar himself urges me to
          promote peace. But his letter is dated before he began his violent proceedings. Dolabella
          and Caelius both say that he is well satisfied with my conduct. I am on the rack of
          perplexity. Assist me by your advice if you can, but all the same look after your own
          interests to the utmost of your power. In such a total upset I have nothing to say to you.

        <p> I CAN see that there is not a foot of ground in Italy which is not in his power. About
          Pompey I know nothing, and I think he will be caught, unless he has already embarked. What
          incredible rapidity! Whereas our general's—but I cannot find fault with him without
          sorrow, for whom I am <pb n="265"/> in an agony of anxiety. You have good reason for
          fearing a massacre: not that anything could be less in Caesar's interest, with a view to
          the permanency of his victory and supremacy, but I can see at whose bidding he is likely
          to act. To be safe, my opinion is that we must go. As to those Oppii <note n="1"

          <dateline>FORMIAE, 10 FEBRUARY</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> On the 9th of February, in the evening, I received a letter from Philotimus saying that
          "Domitius has a strong force; cohorts from Picenum, under Lentulus and Thermus, have
          effected a junction with Domitius's army; Caesar's advance can be stopped: he is himself
          afraid of that; the courage of the loyalists at Rome is raised; the disloyal are in
          dismay." For my part, I fear that these are dreams. However, Manius Lepidus, L. Torquatus,
          Gaius Cassius, who are staying with me at Formiae, are quite restored to life by
          Philotimus's letter. I, however, am afraid that the truer account is this: that we are all
          now practically captives; that Pompey is on the point of abandoning Italy, of whom, indeed
          (what a bitter pill to swallow'.), Caesar is said to be actually in pursuit. Caesar pursue
          Pompey? What, to kill <pb n="266"/> him? Merciful heavens! and don't we rush as one man to
          throw our bodies in the way? You, too, must sigh at that! But what are we to do? We are
          utterly beaten, trapped and taken. <milestone unit="para"/>However, after reading
          Philotimus's letter, I changed my plan as to the ladies, whom, as I wrote you word, I
          intended sending back to Rome. It has occurred to my mind that it would give rise to much
          talk to the effect that I already shewed my opinion about the fortunes of the party, and
          that, regarding it as desperate, I had in this return of my ladies made a kind of first
          step towards my own return. As for myself, however, I agree with you that I should not
          commit myself to an indefinite and dangerous flight, by which I should do no good to the
          Republic or to Pompey, for whom I can die with as much cheerfulness as loyalty. I will
          remain, therefore. But to go on living——! <milestone unit="para"/>You ask what is going on
          here. The whole business of Capua, and the levy in this neighbourhood, are at a
          standstill. There is complete despair. Everybody is preparing to fly, unless some such
          incident occurs as Pompey effecting a junction of his forces with those of Domitius. But I
          think we shall know all about it in two or three days. I send you a copy of Caesar's
          letter to me; for you asked for it. Many have written to tell me that he is much pleased
          with me. I don't mind that, so long as I abstain—as I have as yet-from doing anything
          discreditable. </p>

        <p> QUINTUS FABIUS came to me on the 10th of February. He brings me word that L. Domitius,

        <p> PHILOTIMUS's letter did not give me over much pleasure, but it did very much so to the
          people about here. Behold, the next day a letter to Cassius from Capua, sent by his friend
          Lucretius, announcing that Nigidius had arrived at Capua from Domitius, bringing the
          intelligence that Vibullius, with a small body of soldiers, was hastening from Picenum to
          join Pompey, that Caesar was marching rapidly at his heels, that Domitius had not three
          thousand men. I feel no doubt of Pompey being in full retreat—I only hope he may escape. I

        <p> AFTER I had sent you a gloomy and, I fear, true letter about Lucretius's letter to

          more easily than that Pompey—as you assert-has an army. <note n="1" anchored="true">Cicero
            seems throughout to exaggerate Pompey's failure to obtain troops. When Caesar arrived at

            considerable reinforcements. </note> Nobody brings such a report here, but rather
          everything opposite to my wishes. What a wretched anomaly! When he was in the wrong, he
          always got his way; now that he is eminently in the right, he fails entirely. How can I
          explain it, except by saying that he knew how to do the former—for it was not
          difficult—but not the latter. For to rule a free state in the right way was a difficult
          art! But I hourly expect full information, and then I will at once write you word. </p>

        <p> LUCERIA (BETWEEN 10 AND 16 FEBRUARY) I am much surprised at not hearing from you, and
          that I am informed of public affairs by others rather than yourself. We cannot be on equal
          terms with our opponent if our army is scattered: with forces concentrated I hope we may
          be of service to the Republic and the common safety. Wherefore, as you had
          arranged-according to Vibullius's letter to me of the 9th of February—to start from
          Corfinium with your army and join me, I am at a loss to understand why you have changed
          your design. For the reason mentioned to me in Vibullius's despatch is quite
          inadequate—that you have delayed because you had received intelligence of Caesar having
          left Firmum and arrived at <pb n="269"/> Castrum Truentinum. For the nearer the opponent
          begins to approach, the prompter ought you to have been in effecting a junction with me,
          before Caesar had the opportunity of preventing your march or throwing himself between us.
          Wherefore I once more earnestly entreat and exhort you, as I have not ceased in my former
          despatches to demand, that you should come to Luceria on the first day possible, before
          the forces, which Caesar has begun collecting, become concentrated in one spot, and so
          separate you from us. But if certain individuals are preventing your march, in order to
          preserve their own country seats, it is only fair that you should concede my request and
          be careful to send me the cohorts, which have arrived from Picenum and Camerinum, leaving
          all their property behind them. </p>

        <p> No, my experience does not tally with yours, as you express it in the sentence beginning
          "As often as I begin to feel elated." The fact is that I am at this moment somewhat
          elated, and especially by letters from Rome respecting Domitius and the Picentine cohorts.
          Everything has become more cheerful in the course of the last two days. Accordingly, the
          flight for which I was preparing has been stopped. Caesar's threats, <quote>If with

          </note> are flouted. The report about Domitius is good, about Atranius splendid. Thank you
          for your most friendly advice to keep myself uncommitted as long as possible. You add that
          I should not give the impression of being too much inclined to the evil side: certainly I
          may possibly seem to be <pb n="270"/> doing so. I refused to take a leading part in a
          Civil war, as long as negotiations for peace were going on, not because it was not a just
          one, but because former conduct of mine, which was much more fully justified, had done me
          harm. I was, of course, quite unwilling to have as my enemy a man to whom our own leader
          had offered a second consulship and a triumph —and in what high-flown terms! "In
          consideration of the extraordinary brilliancy of your achievements." I am well aware both
          of whom to be afraid and on what grounds. But if there is to be war, as I see there will
          be, I shall not fail to play my part. <milestone unit="para"/>As to the twenty sestertia,
          Terentia has answered you. I did not wish to trouble Dionysius as long as I thought that I
          should be on the move. However, I made no answer to your frequent remarks about his duty
          to me, because I expected day after day to be able to settle what was to be done. At
          present, as far as I can see, the boys are certain to pass the winter in my Formian villa.
          And I? I can't tell. For if there is war, I am resolved to be with Pompey. Whatever I
          learn for certain I will take care you know. I think there will be a most horrible war,
          unless, as you suggest, some Parthian incident <note n="1" anchored="true">A sudden
            withdrawal of Caesar, like that of the Parthians fr0m Syria. See p. 203. </note> comes

        <p> M. CICERO, imperator, greets Gnaeus Magnus, proconsul. On the 15th of February I
          received your letter at Formiae, informing me that what had happened in Picenum was much
          more satisfactory than had been before reported to us; and I was glad to hear of the
          courage and activity of Vibullius. Up to this time, though I have continued living on this
            <pb n="271"/> coast, of which I was put in command, yet I have kept a vessel in
          readiness. For the news that kept reaching me, and the anxious fears that I was
          entertaining, were of such a kind that I thought myself bound to follow any counsel you
          might give me. At present our hopes are stronger, thanks to your influence and policy. If
          you think that Tarracina and the sea-coast can be held, I am ready to remain in it, though
          there are no garrisons in the towns. There is, in fact, no one of senatorial rank in this
          part of the country except M. Eppius, whom I directed to remain at Minturnae, a man of
          vigilant and painstaking character. For that gallant and influential man, L. Torquatus, is
          not with me at Formiae: I think he has started to join you. Anyhow, according to your most
          recent directions, I went to Capua on the same day as you left Teanum Sidicinum: for you
          had expressed the wish that I should superintend operations there in conjunction with the
          praetor M. Considius. On my arrival in that town, I saw that Titus Ampius was holding a
          levy with the greatest energy, that Libo was taking over the men from him, who is also a
          man of very great energy and influence in that colony. I remained at Capua as long as the
          consuls did. I visited Capua a second time, in accordance with an order of the consuls, on
          the 5th of February. After staying there three days I returned to Formiae. At present I am
          ignorant of your designs and plan of campaign. If you think that this coast is to be held,
          which offers many advantages and is an important district, with illustrious citizens
          residing in it, and is capable, I think, of being held, there must be some one to command
          in it. But if everything is to be concentrated in one spot, I feel no hesitation about
          joining you at once. I wish for nothing more earnestly than that, and so I told you the
          day we quitted the city. For my part, I do not trouble myself about anyone's thinking that
          I have as yet been less active than I ought, so long as you do not think so: nevertheless,
          if, as I am convinced is the case, we have to fight, I feel confident of being able to
          justify myself to all the world. I have sent my connexion M. Tullius to you, to receive a
          letter, if you think it well to write to me. <pb n="272"/>

        <p> AFTER I had despatched a letter to you, I received one from Pompey. I would have sent
          you the letter itself; had not my brother's servant been in such a hurry to start. I will
          send it, therefore, tomorrow. The rest of it contained the operations in Picenum; about
          what Vibullius had written to him; about the levy held by Domitius—all of which are known
          to you, but yet were not so flourishing as Philotimus's letter had represented. But at the
          end of Pompey's letter there was a sentence in his own handwriting: "I am of opinion that
          you should come to Luceria; you will not be safer anywhere else." The interpretation I put
          on this is that he considers the towns in this district and the sea-coast as abandoned,
          nor am I surprised at a man, who has given up the head, having no regard for the other
          limbs. I wrote back at once and sent the letter by one of my establishment upon whom I
          could rely, saying that I did not want to know where I should be safest: if he wished me
          to come to Luceria for his own sake or for that of the Republic, I would come at once; and
          I urged him to keep a hold upon the seacoast, if he wished to be supplied with corn from
          the provinces. I see that it is no use my writing this. But as before in regard to keeping
          the city, so in regard to not abandoning Italy, I put my opinion on record. I perceive,
          indeed, that the plan is to concentrate all forces at Luceria, and even that not as a
          permanent centre, but that, if hard pressed, we are to abandon that also. You need not,
          therefore, be much surprised at my not being very enthusiastic about engaging in a cause,
          in which no provision has ever been sought for making peace or securing victory, but from
          the first for a discreditable and calamitous flight. I must go, to encounter any danger
          that chance <pb n="273"/> may bring with those who are reputed to be loyalists, rather
          than be thought to disagree with loyalists. Yet I foresee that before long the city will
          be crammed with the "loyalists," that is, the fine gentlemen and men of property-crammed
          chock full, indeed, when these municipal towns have been abandoned. And I would be in
          their number if I had not these confounded lictors. Nor should I be dissatisfied to have
          as my companions Manius Lepidus, L. Volcatius, and Servius Sulpicius: not one of them is a
          greater fool than L. Domitius, nor more of a weathercock than Appius Claudius. The one
          person who makes me hesitate is Pompey, not from his personal importance, but for old
          sake's sake. For what weight can he have in this controversy? When we were all alarmed at
          Caesar, he, for his part, was devoted to him: now that he has begun to be alarmed at him,
          he thinks that everybody ought to be his enemy. However, I shall go to Luceria, and yet
          perhaps my arrival will not give him any satisfaction. For I shall not be able to conceal
          my disapproval of what has been done up to this time. If I could sleep I wouldn't have
          pestered you with such long letters. If you are similarly affected, pray pay me back in
          kind. </p>

        <p> LUCERIA, 16 FEBRUARY GNAEUS POMPRIUS, proconsul, salutes Lucius Domitius, proconsul. M.
          Calenius has brought me a despatch from you dated the 16th of February, in which you say
          that your intention is to watch Caesar, and, if he commences his march upon me by the
          coast road, to come to me with speed into Samnium; but that, if he spends time about the
          towns in your district, you wish to resist him in case of his <pb n="274"/> approaching
          you. I think your plan is spirited and gallant; but I am compelled to be more solicitous
          as to whether we may not, if divided, be unequal to our opponent; since he has large
          forces and is likely soon to have larger. For a man of your foresight ought not to reckon
          how many cohorts Caesar has at this moment against you, but what amounts of infantry and
          cavalry he is likely to collect before long. This is proved in my eyes by a letter from
          Bussenius to me, in which he says—as I learn from other letters also—that Curio is drawing
          the garrisons in Umbria and Etruria together, and marching to join Caesar. Now if all
          these forces are combined, even suppose a detachment is sent to Alba, and another
          threatens you, and though Caesar should not offer battle, but should remain on the
          defensive in his own strongholds, you will still be at a stand, and will not be able,
          isolated with a force the size of yours, to offer a resistance to such vast numbers
          sufficient even to allow of your foraging for corn. Wherefore I strongly urge you to come
          here as soon as possible with your entire force. The consuls have decided to do so. I sent
          a message to you by M. Tuscilius to say that we must take care that the two legions should
          not, without the cohorts from Picenum, be allowed to come within sight of Caesar. <note
            n="1" anchored="true">The two legions, of whose withdrawal from Caesar on the plea of a
            Parthian war we have heard so much. Pompey fears that if they see their old <foreign
              xml:lang="la">imperator</foreign> they will desert—a significant commentary on what he
            had been told and believed at the beginning of the year as to the disaffection of
            Caesar's army. </note> Wherefore do not disturb yourself if you hear that I am making a
          backward movement, <note n="2" anchored="true">I. e., in the direction of <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Brundisium</foreign>. </note> should Caesar chance to advance towards
          me: for I think I must by all means avoid being caught in the toils and prevented from
          stirring. For I cannot construct a camp owing to the season and the disposition of my
          soldiers, nor is it proper to call in the garrisons from all the towns, lest I should be
          left without a place of retreat. Accordingly, I have not mustered more than fourteen
          Cohorts at Luceria. The consuls are about to bring in all garrisons to me, or are going to
          Sicily. For I must either have an army sufficiently strong to make me feel sure of being
          able to break out, or hold districts of such a kind as <pb n="275"/> to enable us to act
          on the defensive. At the present time we have neither, for Caesar has occupied a large
          part of Italy, and we have an army neither as well-appointed nor as large as he has. We
          must therefore be careful and look to the main interests of the Republic. I urge on you
          again and again to come to me at the earliest opportunity with your whole force. We may
          even now restore the fortunes of the state, if we conduct our operations in common: if we
          are divided we shall be weak. I am quite satisfied of this. <milestone unit="para"/>After
          I had written the above, Sicca brought me a despatch and message from you. You urged me to

        <p> I RECEIVED a despatch from you on the 17th of February, in which you say that Caesar has
          pitched his camp near Corfinium. What I thought and warned you of is now taking place,
          namely, that at present he would not give you battle, and yet would hem you in by
          concentrating all his forces, to prevent the road to me being open to you, and your being
          able to unite your troops, formed of the strongest loyalists, with the legions of whose
          fidelity we are doubtful. I am therefore all the more disturbed by your letter. For I am
          not sufficiently confident in the good disposition of the soldiers, whom I now have with
          me, to risk a battle involving the safety of the state, nor have the levies made by the
          consuls as yet come in. Wherefore do your best, if it is still by any means possible, to
          extricate yourself, and <pb n="276"/> Come here as soon as you can, before our opponent is
          joined by all his forces. For it is neither possible for the new levies to arrive here
          quickly, nor, if they had arrived, can it escape your observation how impossible it is to
          trust men, who are not even acquainted with each other, against veteran legions. <note
            n="1" anchored="true">This seems to be the letter, the contents of which Domitius tried

        <p> GNAEUS MAGNUS, proconsul, greets the consuls, C. Marcellus and L. Lentulus. Being of
          opinion that if we were scattered we could neither be of service to the state, nor protect
          ourselves, I sent a despatch to L. Domitius that, if possible, he should join me with all
          his men, and that, if he felt doubtful about himself, he should send me the nineteen
          cohorts which were on the march to join me from Picenum. <note n="2" anchored="true">They
            had halted on the way at <foreign xml:lang="la">Corfinium</foreign>. </note> What I
          feared has taken place: Domitius is surrounded, and is not in sufficient force to form a
          camp, because he has my nineteen and his own twelve cohorts distributed among three towns—
          for he has stationed some at Alba and some at Sulmo—and he cannot now extricate himself
          even if he wished. In these circumstances I am, I can assure you, in extreme anxiety. I am
          eager to relieve men who are so numerous and of such high position <note n="3"
            anchored="true">Domitius had with him his son, five senators, with many young men of
            senatorial families, a large number of <foreign xml:lang="la">equites</foreign>, and
            magistrates from neighbouring <foreign xml:lang="la">municipia</foreign> (<bibl

          yet I cannot go to their assistance, because I do not think that we can trust these two
          legions to go there <pb n="277"/> —of whom, after all, I have not been able to keep
          together more than fourteen cohorts; for I have sent two to Brundisium, and I did not
          think that Canusium ought to be left in my absence without a garrison. I had told Decimus
          Laelius to suggest to you, as I hope for an increase to my numbers, that one of you should
          join me, the other go to Sicily with the force you have collected at Capua and the
          neighbourhood of Capua, and the soldiers whom Faustus has recruited: that Domitius with
          his own twelve cohorts should form a junction with the same, and that all other forces of
          every description should muster at Brundisium, and be shipped thence to Dyrrachium. But as
          it is, since at this juncture I cannot go, any more than you, to the relief of Domitius,
          he must extricate himself by crossing the mountains, and I must be careful not to allow
          the enemy to get near these fourteen cohorts, whose loyalty is doubtful, or to catch me up
          on the march. Wherefore I have determined—and I find that Marcellus and other senators who
          are here agree with me—to march the force I have with me to Brundisium. I urge you to
          collect all the troops that you can collect, and come to me at Brundisium also as promptly
          as possible. I think you should use the arms, which you were intending to send to me, to
          arm the soldiers whom you have with you: if you will have all arms that may be to spare
          carted to Brundisium, you will have done the state excellent service. Please let my men
          know about this. I have sent word to the praetors P. Lupus and C. Coponius, to join you
          and take whatever men they have to you. </p>

        </opener>
        <p> THANK you all round-both for writing to tell me the remarks you had heard, and for not
          believing what reflected upon my energy, and, lastly, for letting me know your <pb n="278"
          /> opinion. I wrote only one letter to Caesar from Capua in answer to the remonstrance he
          addressed to me on the subject of his gladiators. <note n="1" anchored="true">See p. 251.
          </note> My letter was short but expressed in friendly terms. So far from containing any
          attack upon Pompey, it mentioned him in the most complimentary terms. This exactly
          corresponded with my sentiment in favour of his making terms with Pompey. If he has sent
          that letter anywhere, let him placard it for everyone to read with all my heart. I am
          writing a second letter to him on the same day as I write this to you. I cannot do
          otherwise than write, since he has written to me both by his own hand and by that of
          Balbus. I am sending you a copy of it. I don't think there is anything for you to find
          fault with. If there is, suggest how I am to escape criticism. "Don't write at all," you
          will say; "how better elude those who want to make up a story?" Well, I will follow your
          advice as long as it is possible. You exhort me to remember my deeds, words, and even my
          writings: it is truly friendly on your part, and I thank you warmly for it; but you appear
          to me to take a different view from mine as to what is right and suitable to my character
          in this controversy. For in my opinion nothing more discreditable was ever done in any
          nation by anyone professing to be a statesman and leader, than the course taken by our
          friend. I am sorry for him. He abandoned the city, that is, his country, for which, and in
          which, it would have been a glorious thing to die. You don't seem to me to appreciate the
          magnitude of this disaster: for you are at this moment in your own town house. Yes, but
          you cannot remain there any longer except by the consent of the vilest of men. Can
          anything be more humiliating, more shameful than that? We are wandering about in distress
          with wives and children. All our hopes are dependent on the life of one man, who has a
          dangerous illness every year. We are not expelled, but summoned from our country, which we
          have left not to be safe-guarded till our return, but to be plundered and fired. There are
          not so very many with me, <note n="2" anchored="true">I have ventured to emend this
            difficult passage by writing <foreign xml:lang="la">non ita</foreign> multi for <foreign
              xml:lang="la">ita</foreign> multi. Cicero says the leading Pompeians, who ought to
            have defended the city, are all gone far away; there are not many left even near him at
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Formiae</foreign>, or in suburban residences, much less in the
            city. I do not feel the difficulty as to the contradiction to Letter CCCXXVII, p. 273,
            where he says the <foreign xml:lang="la">boni</foreign> will soon crowd into Rome. He is
            thinking of different things. In the other letter he was imagining the action of the
            lukewarm <foreign xml:lang="la">boni</foreign>, who would soon be making submission to
            Caesar: here he is thinking of the leading and sincere <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >boni</foreign>, who have yet shewn (as he thinks) the white feather by seeking
            distant places of retirement. Non <foreign xml:lang="la">ita</foreign> multi makes the
            sentence much easier, and is a favourite phrase of Cicero's. </note> nor in suburban
          houses, nor <pb n="279"/> suburban parks, nor in the city itself—and if they are there
          now, they soon will not be. I meanwhile shall not stay even at Capua, but at Luceria, and
          shall, of course, abandon the care of the sea-coast at once. I shall wait to see what
          Afranius and Petreius do : <note n="1" anchored="true">Two of Pompey's legates in Spain,
            whose resistance and submission to Caesar this summer are described in the first book of
            Caesar's <title>Civil War</title>. </note> for Labienus lacks distinction. Here you will
          hint that that is just what you find lacking in me. I say nothing about myself. I will
          leave that to others. In these circumstances, indeed, where is it to be found? All you
          loyalists are sticking to your houses, and will do so. In the old times didn't every
          loyalist come forward to support me? Who does so now in this war, for so it must now be
          called? As yet Vibullius has covered himself with glory. You will learn all about that
          from Pompey's letter: in which please notice the passage at which you will find a mark of
          attention (<figure>
            <p/>
          </figure>). You will see what Vibullius himself thinks about our friend Gnaeus. What,
          then, is the point of all this talk? Why, I am capable of dying cheerfully for Pompey: I
          value him more than anyone in the world. But, for all that, I do not think that all hope
          for the Republic is centred in him. You express an opinion also considerably different
          from your usual one, that I must even quit Italy if he does so: a step which, in my
          judgment, is of advantage neither to the Republic nor to my children, and, what is more,
          neither right nor morally justifiable. But why do you say, "Will you be able to endure the
          sight of a tyrant?" As though it mattered whether I heard of him or saw him; or as though
          I needed to look for any better precedent than that of Socrates, who at the time of the
          Thirty never set foot out of the city gate. I have personally also a special motive for
          remaining, concerning which I wish to heaven I might <pb n="280"/> some time have a talk
          with you. After writing this on the 17th, by the same lamp as that in which I burnt your
          letter, I am leaving Formiae to join Pompey, with some prospect of being of use if there
          is any question of peace, but if it is to be war—what good shall I be? </p>

          <dateline>CALES, 18-19 FEBRUARY</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> A PREY to the gravest and most depressing anxieties, though I am precluded from
          discussing the question with you personally, I have, nevertheless, resolved to seek your
          advice. The whole question in debate is this: if Pompey quits Italy, which I suspect that
          he is about to do, what do you think I ought to do? To assist you in giving me advice, I
          will state briefly what occurs to my mind on either side. Pompey's very great services in
          securing my restoration and the intimacy existing between us, as well as the interests of
          the Republic themselves, lead me to the conclusion that my policy or, if you choose, my
          fortune must be united with his. Then there is this: if I stay here and desert that
          company of most loyal and illustrious citizens, I must come under the power of one man:
          and although he shews by many instances that he is well disposed to me—and you yourself
          know what precautions I took in that direction, because I suspected the storm that was
          hanging over our heads-yet I must look at the matter in two lights: first, how far I can
          trust him; and, secondly, however certain I may be that he will be my friend, whether it
          is the action of a brave man and a good citizen to remain in a city, in which, after
          having enjoyed the highest offices and commands, after having performed the most important
          services, and been invested with the most august priesthood, he is to become a mere name,
            <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Nomen futurus</foreign>, for <foreign xml:lang="la">non
              futurus</foreign>. The abbreviation of <foreign xml:lang="la">non</foreign> and
              <foreign xml:lang="la">nomen</foreign> would be very nearly the same. Still, the
            emendation is far from certain. Another is <foreign xml:lang="la">non futurus sit sui
              iuris</foreign>, "not even his own master," "a slave." </note>
          <pb n="281"/> and to incur danger, not perchance unaccompanied by some disgrace, if Pompey
          ever restores the constitution. So much for that side. Now for the other. Our friend
          Pompey has shewn neither wisdom nor courage in anything that he has done: I may add that
          he has acted in every case against my counsel and advice. I put out of the question the
          old scores: how he fostered Caesar against the Republic, promoted, armed him; assisted him
          in the passing of laws by violence and against the auspices; supported the addition of
          farther Gaul to his provinces; married his daughter; acted as augur at the adoption of
          Publius Clodius; shewed greater zeal in effecting my recall than in preventing my exile;
          supported the extension of Caesar's provincial government; championed his cause at every
          point in his absence; actually in his third consulship, when he started being a defender
          of the constitution, yet urged the ten tribunes to propose the bill allowing Caesar's
          candidature in his absence; confirmed the same privilege in a certain law of his own, and
          resisted the consul Marcus Marcellus when he proposed to fix the end of Caesar's
          government on the 1st of March. <note n="1" anchored="true">M. Marcellus, <foreign
              xml:lang="la">consul</foreign>
            <date when="-0051">B.C. 51</date>. </note> Well, to pass over all this, what could be
          more discreditable, more ill-considered, than this departure from the city, or I should
          rather call it this most shameful, most unprincipled flight? What terms could there be
          that were not preferable to the abandonment of one's country? The terms offered were bad.
          I confess it: but could anything be worse than this? But (you say) he will recover the
          Republic. When? What preparation has been made for realizing that hope? Is not Picenum
          lost? Is not the road to the city laid open? Is not all money public and private, handed
          over to his opponent? In fact, there is no cause to support, no forces to support it, no
          rallying point for those who wish the constitution maintained. Apulia has been selected,
          the most sparsely peopled district of Italy, and the most widely removed from the point of
          attack in this war: it is evident that, from sheer desperation, the object in view is
          flight and the facilities of a sea-coast. I undertook Capua with <pb n="282"/> reluctance,
          not because I desired to shirk that duty, but because it was in a cause in which there was
          no openly expressed grievance on the part of the orders in the state or of private
          individuals, though there was some-far from keen, as usual—on the part of the Optimates;
          and because, as I saw for myself, the multitude and the lowest of the people were inclined
          to the other side, while many were eager simply for change. I told Pompey himself that I
          would undertake no duty without a guard and money. Accordingly, I had practically nothing
          to do at all, because, from the first, I saw that his sole object was flight. If I am to
          follow that flight now, whither am I to go? Not with him; for when I started to join him,
          I learnt that Caesar was in such a position that I could not reach Luceria safely. <note
            n="1" anchored="true">Though Cicero had told Pompey that his personal safety did not
            affect the question! (Letter CCCXXVII, p. 272.) </note> I should have to sail by the
          Mare Inferum, without definite direction and in the worst possible weather. Again, am I to
          take my brother, or only my son without him, or how? Either alternative involves very
          great difficulty, and the keenest distress of mind. Again, what kind of attack will he
          employ against us and our property in our absence? Something more violent than in the case
          of others, for he will perhaps think that he has a chance of winning popularity by
          damaging us. Consider, again, these fetters—I mean my laurelled fasces—what a nuisance to
          carry them out of Italy! Moreover, what place, even suppose I enjoy a calm passage, will
          be safe for me till I reach Pompey? By what route, again, or whither to go, I have no
          idea. <milestone unit="para"/>If, on the other hand, I keep my ground and find some
          footing on this side, I shall have done what L. Philippus did during the tyranny of Cinna,
          as well as L. Flaccus and Q. Mucius. Though it turned out unhappily in the case of the
          latter, <note n="2" anchored="true">Q Mucius <foreign xml:lang="la">Scaevola</foreign>
            (the younger) was put to death by the younger C. Marius <date when="-0082">B.C.

          result (a result which did actually happen), but preferred it to approaching the walls of
          his native city in arms. Thrasybulus <note n="3" anchored="true">Who retired from Athens
            during the time of the Thirty, and returned with a force collected at <foreign

                from="-404">404</date>-3</date>. </note> acted differently and perhaps better. But
          yet there <pb n="283"/> are good grounds for Mucius's line of policy and opinion, as well
          as for that of the other, namely, to temporize, when necessary, and not to let slip an
          opportunity when it is given. But even if I adopt this course, those same fasces involve a
          difficulty. For suppose he is my friend, which is uncertain, but suppose he is, he will
          offer me the triumph. Not to accept I fear will get me into trouble with him, to accept I
          fear will appear scandalous to the loyalists. "What a difficult and insoluble problem !"
          you say. And yet I must solve it. For what can possibly be done else? Don't think me more
          inclined to remain, because I have used more words on that side. It may very well be, as
          happens in many investigations, that one side has the superiority in words, the other in
          truth. Wherefore please give me your advice, on the understanding that I am considering a
          most important matter with impartiality. There is a vessel at Caieta ready for me, and
          another at Brundisium. But here come couriers, as I am in the act of writing these words
          at Cales before daybreak: here comes a letter stating that Caesar has reached Corfinium,
          that Domitius is inside Corfinium with a strong force eager to fight. I can't believe that
          our friend Gnaeus will go so far as to abandon Domitius, though he has sent Scipio in
          advance to Brundisium with two cohorts, and has written to the consuls saying that he
          wishes the legion enrolled by Faustus to be taken to Sicily by a consul. But it will be
          shameful if Domitius is abandoned when imploring to be relieved. There is a certain hope,
          no great one in my mind, but warmly entertained in these parts, that Afranius has fought a
          battle with Trebonius in the Pyrenees; that Trebonius has been repulsed; that your friend
          Fadius <note n="1" anchored="true">M. Fadius Gallus, one of Caesar's legates. </note> also
          has come over with his cohorts. The chief hope, however, is that Afranius is on his way
          hither with large forces. If that is the case, we shall perhaps stay in Italy. However,
          since Caesar's line of march was uncertain, as he was thought to be intending to go either
          in the direction of Capua or Luceria, I am sending Lepta with a letter to Pompey, and am
          returning myself to Formiae to avoid falling in with anyone. I wished you to know this,
          and I am writing in a <pb n="284"/> somewhat quieter frame of mind than I mentioned just

        <p> DIONYSIUS, <note n="1" anchored="true">Cicero's freedman Dionysius (of whom we often
            hear) had apparently declined to come to <foreign xml:lang="la">Formiae</foreign> to
            continue his duties as tutor to the young Ciceros, and Cicero thinks he has done so
            rudely, and from a dislike to serve a ruined man. </note> whom I look upon as your man
          rather than mine-for though I knew very well what his character was, I yet stood by your
          judgment rather than my own-without any respect even for your recommendation several times
          repeated in my hearing, has given himself airs in view of <pb n="285"/> what he thinks
          will be the state of my fortune. The course of that fortune, however, as far as it can be
          affected by human wisdom, I shall pilot with a certain amount of skill. What honour, what
          consideration, what recommendation even to others (the contemptible fellow!) has he not
          had at my hands? Why, I even preferred to have my judgment attacked by my brother Quintus,
          and by the world in general, rather than not praise him to the skies: and that my young
          Ciceros should have some supplementary lessons from myself, rather than look out for
          another master for them. Good heavens! what a letter I wrote to him! what respect, what
          affection did it express! You would have said that it was an invitation addressed to a
          Dicaearchus or an Aristoxenus, not to the greatest windbag and worst teacher in the world.
          "But he has a good memory." He shall find I have a better! He answered my letter in a tone
          which I never used to anyone whose case I declined. I always used to say, "If I can," "If
          I am not prevented by a previous engagement": I never had a defendant so low, so mean, so
          clearly guilty, so utterly a stranger to myself, that I refused him with the abruptness
          which he has used without disguise or reserve to me. I never saw such gross ingratitude, a
          vice which embraces every other. But enough and to spare about him. I have a vessel ready:
          yet I wait for a letter from you, to know what answer it will contain to the case I put to
          you for advice. You are aware that at Sulmo Gaius Attius, the Paelignian, has opened the
          gates to Antony; though there were five cohorts there, and that Q. Lucretius has escaped
          from the town; <note n="1" anchored="true">Caesar (<bibl n="Caes. Civ. 1.18">B.C.
              1.18</bibl>) says that the Sulmonians insisted on joining him, but were for a time
            prevented by Q. Lucretius and Attius Paelignus. Lucretius escaped, but Attius was
            captured. </note> that Gnaeus is on his way to Brundisium; that Domitius <note n="2"

        <p> HAVING written you a letter before daybreak of the 22nd about Dionysius, on the evening

          else am I to think? However, it is his way to repent when he has done anything

        <p> When I had already sealed the letter to you which I intended to despatch over night, as
          I did—for it was written in the evening-C. Sosius, the praetor, came to Formiae on a visit
          to my neighbour Manius Lepidus, whose quaestor he once was. He brought me a copy of
          Pompey's letter to the consuls. <quote>I have received a despatch from L. Domitius on the
            17th of February. I append a copy. Now, without my saying a word, I know you understand
            of your own accord how important it is to the Republic that all troops should be
            concentrated in one place at the earliest possible time. Pray, if you think it right,

        <p> There is only one thing left to complete our friend's disgrace-failure to relieve
          Domitius. "But nobody doubts that he intends going to his relief." I don't think he will.
          "Will he, then, abandon such an illustrious citizen, and those whom you know to be with
          him, and that when he himself has thirty cohorts?" Yes, he will, unless I am entirely
          mistaken. He has become alarmed beyond belief. He looks to nothing except flight; in which
          you think—for I see what your opinion is—that I ought to be his companion. I, however,
          know from whom to fly, but not whom to follow. As to my remark, which you praise and
          declare to be memorable, that I preferred defeat with Pompey to victory with those others,
          it is quite true: I do prefer it—but it is with the Pompey as he was then, or as I thought
          him. But with a Pompey who flies before he knows from whom he is flying, or whither, who
          has betrayed our party, who has abandoned his country, and is about to abandon Italy—if I
          did prefer it, I have got my wish: I am defeated. For the rest, I cannot stand the sight
          of what I never had any fear of seeing, nor of the man on whose account I have to give up
          not only my friends, but my own past. I have written to Philotimus about furnishing me

        <p> What a disgraceful and, for that reason, what a miserable thing! For, in my opinion,
          that which is disgraceful is ultimately, or rather is alone, miserable. He had fostered
          Caesar, and then, all on a sudden, had begun to be afraid of him: he had declined any
          terms of peace: he had made no preparation for war: he had abandoned the city: he had lost
          Picenum by his own fault: he had blocked himself up in Apulia: he was preparing to go to
          Greece: he was going to leave us without a word, entirely uninformed of a move on his part
          so important and so unprecedented. Lo and behold, there is suddenly sprung on us a letter
          from Domitius to him, and one from him to the consuls. I thought honour had flashed before
          his eyes, and that he—the real man he ought to be—had exclaimed: <quote>

        <p> YOU say my letter has been widely published: well, I don't care. Nay, I myself allowed
          several people to take a copy of it. For suchi s the nature of events that have already
          happened and are about to happen, that I wished my sentiments as to keeping the peace to
          be put on record. Now, while exhorting Caesar of all people to keep it, I could see no
          better way of influencing him than by saying that it was suitable to his wisdom. If I
          called that wisdom "admirable," seeing that I was urging him to the preservation of our
          country, I am not afraid of being thought guilty of flattery, when for such an object I
          would gladly have thrown myself at his feet. Where, again, my expression is "bestow some
          of your time"—that does not refer to peace, but it is a request to him to reflect in some
          degree on my own case and on my obligations. As to my protesting that I have taken no part
          in the war, though that has been proved by facts, yet I mentioned it that my persuasions
          might have the greater weight, and my expressing approval of his claim has the same
          object. But what is the use of discussing this now? I only wish it had done any good! Nay,
          I should not object to have the letter read in public meeting, since Pompey himself, when
          also writing to Caesar, put up for public perusal the despatch in which are the words
          "Considering the extraordinary brilliancy of your achievements." What! more brilliant than
          his own, or those of Africanus? "Circumstances made it necessary to say so." Well, since
          two men of your character are going to meet him at the fifth milestone, <note n="1"
            anchored="true">That is, in the complimentary procession to meet Caesar on his coming to
            Rome—the usual custom in respect to returning governors. See p. 234. </note> pray, to
          what does he pledge himself, what is he doing or going to do? With what <pb n="291"/>
          greater confidence will he rely upon the merits of his case, when he sees you, and men
          like you, not only in crowds, but with smiles on your faces, and congratulations on your
          lips? "Are we, then, doing wrong?" Not at all, as far as you are concerned. Yet,
          nevertheless, there is an end of all distinguishing between the signs of genuine and
          pretended feeling. What decrees of the senate do I foresee !-But I have spoken more openly
          than I intended. <milestone unit="para"/>I mean to be at Arpinum on the 28th, then to go
          the round of my country houses, which I have no hope of ever seeing again. Your "frank"
          policy—which is yet not without a spice of caution to suit the times-has my warm
          approbation. Lepidus, for his part—for we spend almost every day together, much to his
          gratification-never liked the idea of leaving Italy, Tullus much less. For letters from
          him frequently pass from others to me. But it is not so much their opinions that move me:
          for they have given much fewer pledges to the Republic than I have: it is your influence,
          by Hercules, that has the greatest weight with me; for it suggests a means of retrieving
          the past and of securing the present. But I appeal to you: what could be more wretched
          than that the one gains applause in the worst possible cause, the other nothing but anger
          in the best? That the one is esteemed the preserver of his enemies, the other the betrayer
          of his friends? And, by heaven, however much I love our Gnaeus, as I do and am bound to
          do, yet I cannot commend him for failing to relieve such men. For if it was fear, what
          could be more cowardly? If, as some think, it was because he thought that his own position
          would be improved by their massacre, what could be more unfair? But a truce to these
          reflexions: I only increase my grief by recalling them. <milestone unit="para"/>On the
          evening of the 24th Balbus the younger called on me, hastening on a secret mission to the
          consul Lentulus from Caesar, with a letter, a message, and a promise of a province, to
          induce him to return to Rome. I don't think he will be persuaded except by a personal
          interview. Balbus also told me that Caesar wished, above all things, to catch up Pompey (I
          believe that much), and to be reconciled to him. This latter I do not believe, and I much
          fear that all this clemency is only an elaborate preparation for a <pb n="292"/>
          Cinna-like massacre. The elder Balbus, indeed, writes me word that Caesar would wish
          nothing better than to live in safety, with Pompey as chief citizen. You believe that, I
          suppose! <milestone unit="para"/>But while I am writing these words (25th February),
          Pompey may have reached Brundisium; for he started in light marching order in advance of
          his legions on the 19th, from Luceria. But this portent is a man of frightful vigilance,
          rapidity, and energy. I haven't an idea what will happen. </p>

        <p> You think me thoroughly upset by a violent mental struggle. I am so, indeed, but not by
          one so violent as you perhaps imagine. For all my anxiety is lightened as soon as I have
            <pb n="293"/> either made up my mind, or found on reflexion that a solution is
          impossible. However, one may express regret. Well, I do so, after all, from one day's end
          to another. But considering the uselessness of this, I dread being an absolute discredit
          to my philosophy and my writings: I therefore spend all my time in considering what the
          virtue of that ideal character is, which, according to you, I have delineated in my books
            <note n="1" anchored="true">The <foreign xml:lang="la">de Republica</foreign>. He
            proceeds to quote his description of the ideal statesman. </note> with considerable
          care. Do you remember, then, that ideal "director of the commonwealth" to whom we would
          refer all questions? In the fifth book, I think it is, Scipio thus speaks: <quote>For as
            the object of a pilot is a successful voyage, of a physician bodily health, of a
            commander victory, so the object of such a director of the commonwealth is the happiness
            of the citizens, that it should be secure in means of defence, opulent in material
            resources, splendid in reputation, untarnished in its virtue. For my idea of him is that
            he should carry to perfection the work which is the greatest and best among men.</quote>
          <milestone unit="para"/>Such a conception never occurred to our friend Gnaeus in former
          times, and least of all in this controversy. Supremacy has been the object of both; there
          has been no idea of securing the happiness and virtue of the citizens. Nor, indeed, did he
          abandon the city because he was unable to protect it, nor Italy because he was driven from
          it; but his idea from the first was to stir up every land and sea, to rouse foreign
          princes, to bring barbarous tribes in arms into Italy, to collect the most formidable
          armies possible. For some time past a kind of royalty like Sulla's has been the object in
          view, and this is the eager desire of many who are with him. Do you suppose that some
          understanding between the two, some bargain has been impossible? Today it is still
          possible. But the object of neither is our happiness: both want to be kings. This brief
          exposition of the situation I have made in response to your invitation: for you wished me
          to explain to you my sentiments as to these unhappy circumstances. I speak

          </note> What I can prophesy, I repeat, is much the same: such an Iliad of miseries is
          there hanging over our heads. Besides, my position is worse than that of those who have
          crossed the sea with Pompey in this, that they fear one or the other; I fear both. "Why
          have I stayed, then?" you will say. From obedience to you, if you like, or from failing to
          meet him in person, or because it was a juster course. You will see, I tell you, our poor
          Italy trodden under foot next summer, or in the hands of the slaves <note n="2"
            anchored="true">In <foreign xml:lang="la">mancipiis</foreign>. I don't think there is
            need to object to this, as Tyrrell and Purser do. Of course, Cicero would not seriously
            call the chief followers of Pompey and Caesar "slaves," but he is thinking of the
            foreign auxiliaries, Pompey's from the East, Caesar's from Gaul. There is some petulant
            exaggeration in the word, though not more than is natural in Cicero's frame of mind.
            Compare his description of Antony's proceedings in Italy in <date>B.C. <date to="-48"
                from="-49">49</date>-48</date>, 2 Phil. 57, and his employment of a guard of
            Ityreans, 2 Phil. 19. </note> of both leaders gathered from the four corners of the
          earth. It is not a proscription (which is said to have been frequently threatened in the
          talk at Luceria) that is so much to be feared, as a general destruction: so vast are the
          forces which I see will take part in the conflict on both sides. That is my conjecture of
          what is to happen. But you perhaps looked for something consoling from me. I can find
          nothing of the sort. Nothing can exceed the misery, ruin, and disgrace. You ask me what
          Caesar said in his letter to me. The usual thing: he was much obliged by my having
          remained neutral, and begged me to continue to do so. The younger Balbus brought me a
          message to the same effect. The latter was <pb n="295"/> on his way to visit the consul
          Lentulus with a letter from Caesar, and promises of rewards if he would return to Rome.
          But, when I calculate the days, I think he will have crossed over before he could be met
          by Balbus. I wished you to appreciate the slovenly style of Pompey's two letters sent to
          me, and my great care in writing my answer. I am sending you copies of them. I am anxious
          to see what this dash of Caesar's upon Brundisium through Apulia accomplishes. Oh that it
          might turn out something like the Parthian affair! <note n="1" anchored="true">I.e., as

          <dateline>FORMIAE, 27 FEBRUARY</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> When I sent you the letter which was delivered to you at Canusium, I had no idea that
          you were about to cross the sea in the service of the Republic, and I was in great hopes
          that we might eventually be able, while in Italy, to effect an arrangement—the most
          advantageous thing of all in my opinion—or to defend the Republic without the least loss
          of dignity. Meanwhile, before my letter could have reached you, being informed of your
          design from your message sent through Decimus Laelius to the consuls, I did not wait for a
          letter from you to reach me, but with all promptitude began my journey to join you in
          Apulia with my brother Quintus and our sons. When I had reached Teanum Sidicinum <pb
            n="296"/> your intimate friend Gaius Messius, and several others besides, told me that
          Caesar was on his march to Capua, and was going to halt that very day at Aesernia. I was
          much disturbed, because, if that were so, I thought not only that my journey was barred,
          but that I myself was fairly caught. So I went no farther than Cales at that time,
          intending to wait there, rather than elsewhere, till something certain was reported to me
          from Aesernia in regard to this information. But at Cales a copy of your letter to
          Lentulus, the consul, was brought to me. The substance of this was that you had received a
          despatch from L. Domitius on the 17th of February, a copy of which you appended, and added
          that it was of the utmost importance to the state, that all forces should concentrate in
          one place as early as possible, and that he should leave a sufficient garrison at Capua.
          When I read this letter I thought, and everybody else agreed with me, that you were about
          to proceed in full force to Corfinium, to which place, since Caesar was encamped against
          it, I did not think that there was a safe road for me. Whilst waiting in the greatest
          suspense for farther news, I heard two items of intelligence at the same time—what had
          happened at Corfinium, and that you had commenced your march to Brundisium: and though
          neither I nor my brother had any hesitation as to hurrying on to Brundisium, we were
          warned by many coming from Samnium and Apulia to be on our guard against being intercepted
          by Caesar, since, having started for the same district as that to which we were going, he
          was likely to arrive at his destination even quicker than we could. That being the case,
          neither I nor my brother, nor any of our friends, thought it right by rashness on our part
          to run the risk of injuring not only ourselves, but the state also; especially as we felt
          sure that, even if the road proved safe to ourselves, we could not, after all, possibly
          catch you up so late as this. Meanwhile I received a letter from you dated Canusium, 20th
          of February, in which you urged me to make still more haste to Brundisium. As I received
          this on the 27th, I felt sure that you had already arrived at Brundisium, and I saw that
          the road there was entirely closed to us, and that we were as completely prisoners as
          those at Corfinium. For I do not count as prisoners those only who have fallen into the
          hands <pb n="297"/> of armed men, but those also quite as much who, being barred from
          certain districts, find themselves between garrisons and within the lines of another.
            <milestone unit="para"/>That being so, my first and greatest desire would have been
          never to have been separated from you, and, indeed, I shewed you my wish when I resigned
          the charge of Capua: which I did not do to escape a burden, but because I saw that that
          city could not be held without troops, and I did not wish to meet with the mischance which
          I grieve to see has befallen some very gallant gentlemen. Since, however, I had not the
          good fortune to be with you, would that I had been kept informed of your design! For I
          could not possibly guess it, being always accustomed to think that the last thing in the
          world to happen would be that this cause of the Republic should fail in Italy, while we
          had you as our leader. Not, however, that I am now finding any fault with your policy, but
          I lament the fortune of the Republic; and yet, if I fail to see your object, I do not on
          that account feel less certain that you have done nothing without the most careful
          calculation. I think you remember what my opinion has ever been, in the first place, as to
          maintaining peace at any price, however unfair; in the second, as to the city-for as to
          Italy, you had never given me any indication of your purpose. <milestone unit="para"/>But
          I do not claim for myself that my policy ought to have prevailed: I followed yours, and
          that not only for the sake of the Republic—of which I despaired, and which has already
          been overthrown, and cannot be restored without a most mischievous civil war—but I wanted
          you: it was with you that I wished to be; nor will I omit any opportunity of securing
          that, if any such occurs. I was quite aware that in the whole controversy I was failing to
          satisfy men who had set their hearts on war. For, in the first place, I openly avowed that
          I preferred peace to everything, not because I was not afraid of the same things as they
          were, but because I regarded them as less formidable than civil war. In the second place,
          after the war had begun, when I saw that conditions of peace were being offered you, and a
          conciliatory and liberal answer was being returned by you to those proposals, I took my
          special case into consideration, a consideration which I thought in view of your kindness
          to me <pb n="298"/> I should have no difficulty in justifying in your eyes. For I
          remembered that I was the one man who, in return for the most eminent services to the
          state, had suffered the most afflicting and cruel punishment; the one man who, if I
          offended him—to whom, in spite of our being actually in arms, a second consulship and a
          most splendid triumph was being offered-would be exposed to the same contests as before:
          for my person seems ever to present a favourite mark for the attacks of disloyal citizens.
          Nor were my suspicions premature: threats of this sort have been openly made to me: and I
          was not so much afraid of them, if I had to face them, as convinced that I ought to avoid
          them, if that could be done with honour. <milestone unit="para"/>You have now a resumé, as
          brief as possible, of my policy during the time that there was any hope of peace: for the
          time following events made me powerless. But I have an easy answer to those who find fault
          with me. I have never been more devoted to Caesar than they, nor they more devoted to the
          Republic than I. The difference between them and me is this: while they are loyal
          citizens, and I deserve the same honourable title, I wished the controversy settled by
          diplomacy (as I know you did too), they wished it settled by arms. But since the latter
          method has won the day, I will take care that the Republic shall not miss in me the spirit
          of a citizen, nor you that of a friend. </p>

        <p> THE inflammation in my eyes is somewhat more troublesome even than before. However, I
          preferred dictating this letter to letting Fadius Gallus, who is a very affectionate
          friend of us both, have no line to deliver to you. Yesterday, indeed, I wrote with my own
          hand, as best I could, the letter whose prophecy I hope may be falsified. The motive,
          however, of the present letter is not only to prevent any day passing without writing to
          you, but the more reasonable one of inducing you to devote a little time to me. It won't
          take you long, and so I do much wish to have your view explained to me in such a way, that
          I may thoroughly understand it. I have not yet committed myself in any respect. I have
          been guilty of no omission which does not admit of a sound, not merely a plausible,
          excuse. For certainly I did not make a mistake when I refused to accept the charge of
          Capua without a garrison, in my wish to escape not only the crime of failure, but the
          suspicion of treachery as well; nor when, after the terms had been brought by L. Caesar
          and Fabatus, <note n="1" anchored="true">The praetor L. Roscius Fabatus (<bibl
              n="Caes. Civ. 1.3">Caes. B.C. 1.3</bibl>). </note> I was careful not to offend a man
          to whom Pompey was offering a consulship and triumph, though both were in arms. Nor,
          indeed, can anyone fairly find fault with my last step in not crossing the sea. For on
          this measure, though it was a thing to be considered, I have not had the opportunity of
          embarking. For I had no right to suspect what he was going to do, especially as from
          Pompey's own letter—as I see was your own opinion also—I felt no doubt of his intention to
          go to the relief of Domitius. In point of fact, I preferred to have a longer time to
          consider what was the right course and what I ought to do. First of all, then, I wish you
          would write <pb n="301"/> and tell me more distinctly—though you have already made it
          pretty clear—what you think of all this; and, secondly, that you would look into the
          future and give me a sketch of what you think ought to be my rôle, and where you think I
          could be of most service to the Republic; whether a pacific part is required, or whether
          everything depends on a man of war. And, indeed, though my standard is always duty, I yet
          remember the advice you once gave me, which, if I had followed, I should not have endured
          the sad disaster of that crisis in my life. I remember what you urged me to do on that
          occasion through Theophanes, through Culleo, and I have often recalled it with a sigh.
          Therefore let me at last revert to the calculation, which I then rejected, and see how I
          may follow a course which will not simply aim at glory, but will conduce somewhat more to
          my safety also. But I make no stipulation with you. I want you to write me your opinion in
          plain terms. I want you also to investigate with all the diligence you can—and you will
          have men through whom you can do so—what our friend Lentulus and Domitius are doing or
          intending to do, what their present bearing is, whether they find fault with anyone, or
          are angry with anyone. Why do I say "anyone"? I mean, of course, Pompey. Certainly Pompey
          lays all the blame on Domitius, as may be seen in his letter, of which I send you a copy.
          These things, then, be so good as to look into, and, as I asked you in a previous letter,
          send me the book "On Concord," by Demetrius of Magnesia, which he sent you. </p>

        <p> I entreat you, my dear Cicero, to undertake a task and a project in the highest degree
          worthy of your high character—to recall Caesar and Pompey to their former cordiality, <pb
            n="302"/> who have been alienated by the treachery of others. Believe me, Caesar will
          not only put himself in your hands, but will also consider himself under the deepest
          obligation to you, if you throw yourself into this task. I wish Pompey would do the same,
          but that he Can at this time of day be induced to accept any terms is rather a matter for
          wishes than hopes. But when he has recovered from his agitation and alarm, I shall begin
          to have some hope that your influence with him may prove to be of the greatest avail. In
          having expressed a wish that my friend the consul Lentulus should remain at Rome you have
          obliged Caesar, and, believe me, myself also in the highest degree. For I value him so
          greatly, that he holds as high a place in my regard as Caesar himself: and if he had only
          allowed me to talk with him as usual, and had not again and again shewed himself wholly
          averse from conversation with me, I should have been less unhappy than I am. For you must
          not suppose that anyone at this crisis is more painfully affected than I am by seeing a
          man, whom I love more than myself, resolved in his consulship to be anything in the world
          rather than a consul. If he will only deign to take your advice and to believe us in
          regard to Caesar, and to serve the rest of his consulship at Rome, I shall even begin to
          hope that by the advice of the senate— acting at your suggestion, and with him to bring
          the matter formally before it—Pompey and Caesar may be reconciled. If that is done, I
          shall think that I have not lived in vain. I feel sure that you will entirely approve of
          what Caesar did about Corfinium. Considering the circumstances, nothing better could have
          occurred than a settlement being made without a drop of blood. I am much gratified by the
          pleasure you express at the visit of my dear (and your dear) Balbus. Whatever Balbus has
          told you about Caesar, and whatever Caesar has written, I am sure the latter will convince
          you by his acts—whatever measure of success he may have—that he has written with the most
          absolute sincerity. <pb n="303"/>

        <p> I am very glad that your letter expresses such strong approval of what happened at
          Corfinium. I shall be glad to follow your advice, and all the more so, that I had
          spontaneously resolved to display the greatest clemency and to do my best to reconcile
          Pompey. Let us try in this way if we can recover the affections of all parties, and enjoy
          a lasting victory; for others, owing to their cruelty, have been unable to avoid rousing
          hatred, or to maintain their victory for any length of time, with the one exception of
          Lucius Sulla, whom I have no intention of imitating. Let this be our new method of
          conquering-to fortify ourselves by mercy and generosity. As to how that may be secured,
          certain ideas suggest themselves to my mind, and many more may be hit upon. I beg you to
          take these matters into consideration. I have taken Pompey's prefect Numerius Magius. Of
          course I kept to my policy, and caused him at once to be set at liberty. I have now had
          two of Pompey's prefects of engineers in my hands, and have set them both at liberty.
            <note n="1" anchored="true">L. Vibullius Rufus and Numerius Magius. The latter Caesar

        <p> Take the handwriting of my secretary as a sign of my eyes being inflamed, and let the
          same fact excuse my brevity, though at this particular time I have nothing to write. We
          are hanging entirely on news from Brundisium. If Caesar has caught our friend Gnaeus,
          there is a dubious hope of peace; but if the latter has got across beforehand, there is a
          fear of a fatal war. But do you see upon what sort of man the Republic has fallen? How
          clear-sighted, how alert, how well prepared! By heaven, if he puts no one to death, nor
          despoils anyone of anything, he will be most adored by those who had feared him most. The
          burgesses of the country towns, and the country people also, talk a great deal to me. They

          went <pb n="305"/> out of my way needlessly to send letter-carriers to you with these
          empty epistles, I should indeed be foolish: as it is, when people are going to Rome,
          especially people about the house, I cannot reconcile myself to sending nothing by way of
          a letter to you; and besides, believe me, I find a relief in a time of such unhappiness
          in, as it were, talking to you; and much more so when I read letters from you. I certainly
          feel it to be true that there has been no period since our panic flight that less demanded
          a continuance of our correspondence, because no news reaches either Rome or this place,
          which is only two or three days journey from Brundisium: whereas Brundisium is the
          cardinal point of the whole struggle in this first campaign. I am therefore racked with
          suspense about it. But we shall know all before the 15th. For I observe that Caesar
          started from Corfinium on the afternoon of the same day—that is, the 21st of February—as
          that on the morning of which Pompey left Canusium. But Caesar moves so rapidly, and
          encourages the speed of his men with such bounties, that I fear he may have approached
          Brundisium quicker than may be convenient. You will say, "What good, then, do you do by
          anticipating an annoyance, which you are to ascertain three days hence?" None indeed. But,
          as I said before, I like above all things talking to you, and at the same time I want to
          tell you that my plan of procedure, which I thought quite fixed, is somewhat shaken. The
          precedents, <note n="1" anchored="true">M. Lepidus and L. Volcatius. See p. 336. </note>
          of which you approve, don't altogether satisfy me. For what gallant action on their part
          in the service of the state has there ever been? Or who expects anything praiseworthy from
          them? Nor, by heaven, do I see anything commendable in those who have crossed the sea to
          prepare a war, intolerable as things were here-for I foresee the extent and destructive
          nature of that war. But there is one man who shakes my resolution, whose companion in
          flight, whose partner in the recovery of the constitution, I think myself bound to be. "Do
          you change your opinion as often as that, then?" I speak to you as to myself: and who is
          there that in a matter of such importance does not; argue with himself in a variety of
          ways? At the same time I also desire to elicit your opinion: <pb n="306"/> if it is the
          same, that I may be strengthened in my resolution; if it has changed, that I may conform
          mine to yours. Certainly, in regard to my present doubt, it concerns me to know what
          Domitius and our friend Lentulus intend doing. As to Domitius, we hear contradictory
          rumours: at one time that he is at Tibur not by any means leaping for joy, at another that
          he, with the Lepidi has come to the walls of the city, which also I find not to be true.
          For Lepidus says that he has made his way somewhere by secret roads—is it to hide himself
          or to reach the sea? <note n="1" anchored="true">L. Domitius Ahenobarbus, after having
            been let go by Caesar from <foreign xml:lang="la">Corfinium</foreign>, seems to have set
            about preparations for taking possession of the province of farther Gaul, to which he
            had been nominated by the senate. He went first to his estates in <foreign xml:lang="la"

              <foreign xml:lang="la">Cosa;</foreign> from that place he went to Marseilles—a free
            city, yet closely connected with the province-where his legal position was at once
            acknowledged, for the people of Marseilles had received additions of territory by
            Pompey's means and were determined to stand by him (<bibl n="Caes. Civ. 1.34">Caes. B.C.
              1.34</bibl>-36). For the younger Domitius, see p. 317. </note> Lepidus himself does
          not know. He knows nothing either about the younger Domitius. He adds a very annoying
          particular; that a considerable sum of money which Domitius had at Corfinium had not been
          restored to him. <note n="2" anchored="true">This turned out to be false. Caesar says
            that, although he knew it was public money, he yet allowed Domitius to keep it (<bibl
              n="Caes. Civ. 1.23">Caes. B.C. 1.23</bibl>). It was 6,000 <foreign xml:lang="la"

        <p> On the 3rd of March Aegypta <note n="3" anchored="true">A slave, afterwards a freedman,
            of Cicero's. </note> delivered me your letters, one, an old one, dated 26th of February,
          which you say that you intrusted to Pinarius, whom I have not seen. In this you say that
          you are waiting to learn how Vibullius, who <pb n="307"/> had been sent in advance, is
          getting on, who did not obtain an interview with Caesar at all (I observe in your second
          letter that you are aware of this), and how I mean to receive Caesar when he returns. I
          design to avoid meeting him at all. You mention also your intended retreat from Rome <note

          </note> and the change in your way of life, in the necessity of which I agree, and you say
          that you don't know whether Domitius retains his fasces. When you know, please inform me.
            <milestone unit="para"/>So much for your first letter. There followed two, both dated
          the 28th of February, which completely dislodged me from my old resolve, <note n="2"
            anchored="true">To stay quietly in Italy. See last letter, p. 305. </note> which,
          however, I told you was beginning to totter. I am not shaken by your expression, "incensed
          with Jove himself," <note n="3" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign> seems to have said in his letter that Pompey
            would be angry with anyone who stayed in Rome when Caesar came, "even with Jupiter
            Capitolinus himself" for not leaving his temple. Such an exaggerated way of expressing a
            strong feeling needs, perhaps, no explanation. But we may remember that the gods were
            supposed to quit a captured city. </note> for there is danger in the angry passions of
          both; and though victory, of course, is uncertain, yet now the worse side seems to me to
          be the better prepared. Nor am I influenced by the consuls, who are themselves more easily
          moved than feather or leaf. Consideration of duty tortures me, and has all this while been
          torturing me, with indecision. To remain is certainly the more cautious policy, to cross
          the sea is considered the more honourable. Sometimes I prefer that many should think that
          I have acted incautiously, rather than a few think that I had acted dishonourably. You ask
          me about Lepidus and Tullus; they, indeed, have made up their minds to meet Caesar at
          Rome, and to come into the senate. <milestone unit="para"/>Your most recent letter is
          dated on the 1st of March, in which you express a wish that there might be a meeting
          between them, and say that you do not despair of peace. But at the moment of writing I am
          of opinion that they will not meet, and that, if they do, Pompey will not yield to any
          offer of terms. You appear to have no doubt, if the consuls cross, what I ought to do.
          They are certainly going to cross, or rather, as a matter of fact, have already crossed.
          But remember that, with the exception of Appius, <pb n="308"/> there is hardly one who has
          not a legal right to cross. For they either have imperium, as Pompey, Scipio, Sufenas,
          Fannius, Voconius, Sestius, the consuls themselves—who have by immemorial custom the right
          to visit all provinces or they are their legates. But I decide on nothing. As to what your
          opinion is, and pretty well what is the right course, I am clear. I would have written at
          greater length, if I had been able to do so with my own hand. But I think I shall be able
          to do so in a couple of days. I am sending you a copy of Cornelius Balbus's letter
          received on the same day as yours, that you may sympathize with me, when you see me
          treated with such mockery. </p>

        <p> ROME, 3 MARCH To say nothing of humble people like ourselves, even in the case of the
          most important persons designs are generally judged by the majority of mankind by their
          result, and not their intention: yet, relying on your goodness of heart, we will offer
          you, on the point as to which you have written to us, the advice which seems to us to be
          the soundest; and if it is not sensible advice, yet it will at least proceed from absolute
          good faith and good feeling. If we knew from his own lips that Caesar—as in our judgment
          we think he should do— would try directly he arrived in Rome to effect a reconciliation
          between himself and Pompey, we should urge you to resolve upon taking part in the
          negotiation, in order to facilitate and add an air of dignity to the business through the
          ties which bind you to both parties. Or if, on the contrary, we thought that Caesar would
          not do so, and if we knew that he wished to go to war with Pompey, we would never persuade
          you to bear arms against a man who had done you very great services, just as we have ever
          begged you not to engage in a war against Caesar. But since, <pb n="309"/> even now, what
          Caesar intends doing is for us a matter of opinion rather than of knowledge, all we can
          say is this: we do not think it consistent with your position or your universally
          acknowledged good faith to bear arms against either one or the other, considering your
          intimate connexions with both; and we have no doubt that Caesar with his usual kindness,
          will very warmly approve this course. However, if you wish it, we will write to Caesar,
          and ask to be informed what he means to do in the circumstances. On receiving an answer
          from him, we will at once write and tell you what our sentiments are, and will convince
          you that we give you the advice which seems to us to conduce most to your own position,
          not to Caesar's policy. And this we feel certain that Caesar, with his usual liberality in
          making allowance for his friend, will approve. </p>

        <p> I have provided for everything except a secret and safe journey to the Upper Sea. For I

          get to the place, on which my thoughts are set, and to which the circumstances of the case
          call me? I must not delay my departure, lest anything should hinder it and tie me here. It
          is not, in truth, that man who attracts me, as is thought to be the case: I long ago knew

          it is the common talk reported to me by Philotimus. He says I am being torn to pieces by
          the Optimates. Ye Gods! Optimates indeed! See how they are rushing to meet Caesar, and
          parading their loyalty to him! Why, the country towns are offering him prayers <pb n="310"

          the simple fact is that whatever mischief this Pisistratus abstains from doing is as much
          a subject for gratitude, as if he had prevented some one else from doing it. They hope the
          one will be lenient, they believe the other to be enraged. What complimentary processions
          from the towns! What honours voted! Pure fright, you will say. Yes, I daresay; but they

          news from Brundisium. But why do I say some news? It is news of his shameful flight thence
          that I expect, and of the route which the victor is taking on his return and of his

        <p> Although by the time you read this I think I shall know what has happened at
          Brundisium—for Gnaeus left Canusium on the 21st of February, and I write on the 6th of
          March, the fourteenth day after his removing from Canusium—yet I am kept in painful
          suspense as to what each hour may bring, and am wondering that nothing even by way of
          rumour has reached me. There is a surprising silence. But perhaps all this is mere idle
          curiosity <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">keno/spouda</foreign>. </note> about what, after all, must soon
          be known. One thing worries me, that I cannot at present make out where our friend P.
          Lentulus and Domitius are. Now I want to know, in order the easier to find out their
          intentions, whether they are going to Pompey, and if so, by what route and when. The city,
          indeed, I am told, is now crammed full of Optimates. I hear that Sosius and Lupus are
          sitting in court, <note n="2" anchored="true">C. Sosius and P. Rubilius Rufus, praetors.
          </note> whom our friend Gnaeus thought would arrive at Brundisium before himself. From
          these parts there is a general exodus. Even Manius Lepidus, with whom I am used to spend
          the day, is thinking of starting tomorrow. For myself, I am stopping on at Formiae in
          order to get quicker intelligence. Then I am for Arpinum. Thence, by whatever road there
          is least chance of meetings, to the Upper Sea, leaving behind or altogether giving up my
          lictors. For I am told that by some loyalists, who are now and have often been before a
          protection to the commonwealth, my staying in Italy is disapproved, and that at their
          entertainments (beginning pretty early in the day too) many severe reflexions are being
          made upon me! Evidently, then, the thing to do is to leave the country, to wage war on
          Italy by land and sea, to rouse the hatred of the disloyal against us once more, which had
          become extinct, and to follow the <pb n="312"/> advice of a Lucceius and Theophanes! For
          others have some reason for going: Scipio, for instance, starts for Syria, the province
          allotted to him, or is accompanying his son-in-law, in either case with an honourable
          pretext, or, if you like, is avoiding the wrath of Caesar. The Marcelli, for their part,
          had they not feared the sword of Caesar, would have remained: Appius has the same reason
          for fear, and that, too, in connexion with a recent quarrel. Except him and Q. Cassius,
          the rest are legates, Faustus is a proquaestor: I am the only one who might take either
          one course or the other. Added to this, there is my brother, whom it is not fair to
          involve in this adventure, considering that Caesar would be still more angry with him. But
          I cannot induce him to stay behind. This concession I shall make to Pompey, as in duty
          bound: for as far as I am concerned no one else influences me— nor the talk of the
          loyalists, who do not really exist, nor the cause which has been Conducted with timidity
          and will be conducted with crime. To one man, one alone, I make this concession, and that,
          too, without any request from him, and though—as he says—he is not defending his own
          cause, but that of the state. I should like much to know what you are thinking of doing as
          to crossing into Epirus. </p>

        <p> IF you are well, I am glad. After sending you the letter written in conjunction with
          Oppius, I have received one from Caesar, of which I am sending you a copy. From this you
          will be able to see how desirous he is for a reconciliation between himself and Pompey,
          and how averse from every thought of cruelty. That such are his sentiments I <pb n="313"/>
          am, as in duty bound, greatly rejoiced. As to yourself, you? good faith, and your piety, I
          entertain the same opinion as you do yourself, my dear Cicero—that your reputation and
          duty cannot admit of your bearing arms against a man from whom you avow having received so
          much kindness. I have full assurance that Caesar, as might be expected from his
          extraordinary kindness, will approve of this course, and I know for certain that you will
          satisfy him to the full by undertaking no command in the war against him, and by not
          associating yourself with his adversaries. And it is not only in the case of a man of such
          a high position and character as yourself that he will accept this as sufficient, but even
          in my own case he has volunteered the concession, that I should not serve in any camp that
          shall, in the future, be opposed to either Lentulus or Pompey, to whom I am under very
          great obligations; and he has told me that he will be satisfied with my performing civil
          functions for him, which I am at liberty to perform for them also if I choose.
          Accordingly, I am now at Rome acting for Lentulus generally, taking his business upon me,
          and doing for them all that duty, honour, and piety demand. But, by heaven, the hope of
          their coming to terms, which I had given up, I now think not entirely desperate, since
          Caesar is minded as we are bound to wish him to be. In the circumstances my opinion is, if
          you think well, that you should write to him and ask him for protection, as, with my full
          approbation, you asked it from Pompey at the Milonian crisis. <note n="1" anchored="true"
            >The admirers of Clodius raised such a tumult on the first day of the trial of <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Milo</foreign>, that Pompey, being appealed to, promised to be present
            the next day with an armed guard. According to Asconius, it was M. Marcellus, one of
            Milo's advocates, and L. Domitius Ahenobarbus, who as praetor was presiding at the
            trial, that asked for the guard, not Cicero (Ascon. 41). But Cicero may very well have
            joined in the request. </note> I will engage, if I am right in my judgment of Caesar,
          that he will take more thought for your dignity than for his own advantage. I am no
          certain judge of the wisdom of the advice I am now giving you, but at least I am sure that
          whatever I write to you I write from an uncommon affection and friendly disposition;
          because upon my life—which I would forfeit to save Caesar—I value you so highly, that I
          regard few as equally dear as yourself. When you have come to some conclusion on this <pb
            n="314"/> matter, let me hear from you. For I am uncommonly anxious that you may find it
          possible to make good your kindly intentions to both sides; which, by heaven, I feel sure

        <p> THOUGH on the 7th of March (the day, I think, for your fever fit) I am expecting a
          longer letter from you, yet I think I ought to answer even the short one which you wrote
          on the 4th, just before your attack. You say that you are glad that I have stayed in
          Italy, and that you are of the same opinion as before. But in a former letter you seemed
          to me to have no doubt about my going, always provided that Gnaeus embarked with an
          adequate following, and that the consuls crossed also. Have you forgotten this, or did I
          misunderstand you, or have you changed your opinion? But I shall either ascertain your
          opinion from the letter I am now expecting, or I shall draw another letter from you. No
          news as yet from Brundisium. </p>

        <p> WHAT a difficult, what a hopeless thing! You pass over no point in giving your advice,
          and yet how completely you fail to reveal what your real opinion is! You are glad that I
          am not with Pompey, and yet you suggest how dibcreditable it would be for me to be in the
          House when <pb n="315"/> any attack is made on him; yet shocking to approve his conduct.
          Certainly. To speak against him, then? "God forbid !" say you. What, then, is to be done,
          if the one course is criminal, the other exposed to punishment? "You will obtain
          permission," say you, "from Caesar to absent yourself and live in retirement." Am I to
          implore this permission, then? How humiliating! What if I fail to get it? Again, you say,
          "The question of your triumph will be unprejudiced." What if this very thing is used to
          put pressure upon me? Should I accept it? What a disgrace! Should I decline it? Caesar
          will think that I am repudiating his whole policy, as formerly in the case of the land
          commission. <note n="1" anchored="true">The commission of twenty (<foreign xml:lang="la"

            i., p. 113. </note> Why, in excusing himself, he always throws the whole blame for what
          then happened on me, saying that I was so bitterly opposed to him, that I would not accept
          even an honour at his hands. With how much greater irritation will he take a similar
          proceeding from me now? It will, of course, be greater in proportion as this honour is
          greater than the former, and he is himself in a stronger position. <milestone unit="para"
          />But you say that you have no doubt I am in very bad odour with Pompey by this time: I
          don't see why that should be the case, particularly at this time. Shall a man who never
          told me anything about his plan, till after he had lost Corfinium, complain of my not
          having come to Brundisium, when Caesar lay between me and Brundisium? In the next place,
          complaint on his side he must know to be barred. He considers that I was clearer sighted
          than he about the weakness of the municipal towns, the levies, the maintenance of peace,
          the city, money, and the need of occupying Picenum. If, on the other hand, I don't go when
          it is in my power, he will have some right to be angry with me: and I shrink from that,
          not for fear of his hurting me—-for what could he do? And <quote>Who is a slave who does

        <p> THE son of Domitius passed through Formiae on the 8th of March, hurrying to his mother
          at Naples, <note n="2" anchored="true">Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus, who afterwards was
            counted by some among the assassins of Iulius, and played a considerable part in events
            that followed it. His mother was <foreign xml:lang="la">Porcia</foreign>, sister of
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Cato</foreign>
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Uticensis</foreign>. </note> and on my slave Dionysius putting
          some earnest questions to him about his father, he bade him tell me that he was outside
          the city. I, however, had been told that he had gone either to join Pompey or into Spain.
          What the truth of the matter is I should like very much to know: for it affects the
          question on which I am now deliberating, that, if Domitius, at any rate, has failed to
          find an exit from Italy, Gnaeus should understand that my own departure from Italy is not
          easy, occupied as it now is throughout with arms and garrisons, especially in the winter
          season. For if it had been a more c6nvenient season of the year, I might have sailed even
          on the Lower Sea. As it is, a passage is impossible except by the Upper Sea, to which my
          road is closed. Be good enough to inquire, therefore, about both Domitius and Lentulus. No
          rumour has come as yet from Brundisium, and today is the 9th, on which (or on the day
          before) I <pb n="318"/> imagine that Caesar has reached Brundisium. For he halted at Arpi
          on the 1st. But if you choose to believe Postumus, he was intending to pursue Gnaeus. For
          by a calculation of the state of the weather and days he concluded that the latter had
          already crossed. I said I didn't think Caesar would have crews: Postumus felt confident on
          that point, and all the more, because Caesar's liberality had been heard of by shipowners.
          But it cannot now be long before I learn the entire state of affairs at Brundisium. </p>

          only shewing the greatest kindness to me, but also the most admirable wisdom. Philotimus
          delivered it to me the day after receiving it from you. The points you put are indeed of
          extreme difficulty—the journey to the Upper Sea, a voyage by the Lower, a departure to
          Arpinum, lest I should seem to have avoided Caesar, a continuance at Formiae, lest I
          should seem to have put myself forward to congratulate him— but nothing is more
          distressing than the sight of those things, which, I tell you, must before long be seen.
          Curtius Postumus has been with me: I told you how oppressive he was. Q. Fufius also has
          been to see me. What a triumphant look! What assurance! Post haste for Brundisium:
          denouncing the crime of Pompey, the recklessness and folly of the senate. If I can't stand
          such things in my own villa, shall I be able to put up with Curtius in the senate-house?
          But suppose me to endure this with good temper, what will be the sequel of the usual <pb
            n="319"/> "Speak, Marcus Tullius" ? <note n="1" anchored="true">See p. 204. </note> To
          say nothing of the Republican cause, which I look upon as lost, both from the wounds
          inflicted on it and the cures prepared for them, what am I to do about Pompey? With
          whom—for why should I deny it ?-I am downright angry. For I am always more affected by the
          causes of events than by the events themselves. Therefore, turning over these disastrous
          events in my mind—and what could be more disastrous!-or rather, coming to the conclusion
          that they are his doing and his fault, I feel more hostile to him than to Caesar himself:
          just as our ancestors decided that the day of the battle of the Allia was more fatal than
          that of the capture of the city, because the latter evil was the result of the former; and
          accordingly the one day is even now regarded as accursed, while the other is generally
          unknown—so I, remembering the errors of ten years, among which was also that year which
          ruined me, without his defending me (not to put it more strongly), and being fully aware
          of the rashness, incompetence, and carelessness of the present management, felt my anger
          growing. But that is all forgotten now. It is of his kindness that I think, and also of my
          own position. I understand-later, indeed, than I could have wished, thanks to the letters
          and conversations of Balbus—I see plainly, I repeat, that the one object now, nay, the one
          object from the beginning, was the death of Pompey. As for me, therefore, since Homer's
          hero, when his goddess mother said to him, "For next to Hector's death thy doom is fixed,"
          answered his mother: <quote>
            <l>Death, then! since fate allowed me not to save</l>

          One, too, of such a great character, and engaged in such a great cause? Why, in truth, I

          of confidence, and henceforth do not devote myself either to their service. I see how they
          are surrendering themselves to Caesar, and will continue to do so in the future. Do you
          suppose that those decrees of <pb n="320"/> the municipalities as to Pompey's illness

          victory? "All terror," you will say. Yes, but they themselves assert that they were
          alarmed on the former occasion. However, let us wait to see what has happened at
          Brundisium, Perhaps from that may come a change of plan and in the tone of my letters.

        <p> NOTHING as yet from Brundisium. Balbus has written from Rome that he thinks that the
          consul Lentulus has by this time crossed, and that the younger Balbus did not succeed in
          getting an interview with him; because the young man heard this news at Canusium, and had
          written to him from that town. He says, too, that the six cohorts which were at Alba had
          joined Curius by the Minucian road : <note n="2" anchored="true">The via <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Minucia</foreign> is spoken of by Horace (Ep. 1.18, 20) as an

            from <foreign xml:lang="la">Alba</foreign> Fucentia joined Vibius Curius on the march to
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Brundisium</foreign>. </note> that Caesar had written to tell
          him that, and he would himself be shortly at the city. Therefore I shall follow your

          leaving this excuse for Caesar. But perhaps that very thing would offend him—"Why not at
          Rome rather?" And after all, if meet him I must, I would rather it were here than
          anywhere. Then I shall consider the rest, that is, whither and by what road and when I am
            <pb n="321"/> to go. Domitius, I hear, is at Cosa, ready, too, I am told, to set sail:
          if to Spain I don't approve, if to join Gnaeus I commend him: he had better go anywhere
          than have to see Curtius, <note n="1" anchored="true">M. Curtius Postumus (see p. 316).
            Cicero had formerly promoted his interests with Caesar (vol. i., p. 277). He may refer

            defended him in some lawsuit. </note> of whom, though his patron, I cannot stand the

            and the senators who were with him, all with wives and children. He is said to have
            embarked on the 4th of March. Since that day the north wind has prevailed. They say that

          managed their cause! Especially, too, when those very persons, for whose sake I was
          somewhat timid in trusting myself to fortune-wife, daughter, son, and <pb n="322"/>
          nephew-prefered that I should follow that design, and thought that my present plan was
          discreditable and unworthy of me. For, as to my brother Quintus, whatever I determined
          upon he said that he considered right, and he accepted it with the most absolute
          acquiescence. <milestone unit="para"/>I am reading over your letters from the beginning of
          the business. They somewhat relieve me. The earliest ones warn and entreat me not to be
          precipitate. The next indicate that you are glad that I stayed. Whilst reading themI feel
          less base, but only while I read them. Presently grief and the "vision of shame" rises
          again. Wherefore, my dear Titus, pray pluck out this sorrow from my mind, or at least
          mitigate it by consoling words or advice, or by anything you can. But what could you or
          any human being do? It is now almost beyond the power of God. <milestone unit="para"/>For

          private citizen, and an old age freed from anxiety: and later, I found that a bloody and
          destructive war was being undertaken by Pompey. Upon my honour, I thought it shewed a
          better man and a better citizen to suffer any punishment whatever rather than, I don't say
          to lead, but even to take part in such bloody work. I think it would have been better even
          to die than to be with such men. I shall bear any result with greater courage than such a
          pain. </p>

        <p> Although any feeling of repose is for me confined to the time I spend in writing to you
          or reading a letter from you, yet I am myself at a loss for a subject for my letters, and
          I feel certain that the same is the case with you. For the topics usually filling familiar
          letters, written with an easy mind, are excluded by the critical nature of these times;
          while those connected with the crisis we have already worn threadbare. Nevertheless, not
          to surrender myself wholly to sorrowful reflexions, I have selected certain theses, so to
          speak, which have at once a general bearing on a citizen's duty, and a particular relation
          to the present crisis: <quote>

        <p> I wrote you a letter on the 12th of March, but the messenger to whom I intended to give
          it did not start on that day. But there did arrive that very day that "swiftfoot"
          mentioned by Salvius. He brought me your full and very interesting letter, which did, so
          to speak, put just a <pb n="325"/> drop of life into me: for wholly restored I can't say
          that I am. But you have clearly done the main thing. Yes, believe me, a prosperous issue
          for me is not now my aim at all: for I see plainly that we can never have our
          constitution, either while these two men are both alive, or with this one remaining.
          Accordingly, I no longer entertain any hope of repose for myself, nor refuse to
          contemplate any amount of sorrow. The one thing I do positively dread is doing, or, I
          should say, having done anything dishonourable. So be assured that your letter was
          wholesome for me, and I don't only mean this longer one-the most explicit and complete
          possible—but also the shorter one, in which what gave me the most intense pleasure was the
          statement that my policy and action had the approval of Sextus. I am exceedingly obliged
          to you, of whose affection to myself and keen sense of what is right I am well aware.
            <note n="1" anchored="true">These words, as the text stands, must apply to <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign>. It seems, however, much more natural that they should
            refer to Sext. Peducaeus. Accordingly, editors have endeavoured to fill up the lacuna in
            various ways. </note>
          <milestone unit="para"/>Your longer letter, indeed, relieved not only myself, but all my
          party from painful feelings. So I will follow your advice and remain at Formiae: I shall
          thus avoid the scandal of a meeting with him outside the city, or, if I see him neither
          here nor there, giving him the impression of his having been intentionally avoided by me.
          As to your advice to ask him to allow me to shew the same consideration for Pompey, as I
          have shewn to himself—that you will see from the letters of Balbus and Oppius, of which I
          sent you copies, I have been doing all the time. I send you also Caesar's letter to them,
          written in quite a sane frame of mind, considering the insanity of the whole business. If,
          on the other hand, Caesar will not make this concession to me, I see your opinion is that
          my rôle should be that of the peacemaker. In this it is not the danger that I fear—for
          with so many hanging over my head, why not settle the matter by choosing the most
          honourable ?-but what I do fear is embarrassing Pompey; and that he should turn upon me

            <bibl n="Hom. Od. 11.633">Hom. Od. 11.633</bibl>. </note> For our friend Pompey has set
          his heart to a surprising <pb n="326"/> degree on imitating Sulla's reign. I am not
          speaking without book, I assure you. He never made less of a secret of anything. "With
          such a man," you will say, "do you wish to be associated?" I follow personal obligation,
          not the cause: as I did in the case of Milo, and in—but there is no need to go into that.
          "Is not the cause, then, a good one?" Nay, the best: but it will be conducted, remember,
          in the most criminal way. The first plan is to choke off the city and Italy by starving
          them; the next, to devastate the country with sword and fire, and not to keep their hands
          off the money of the wealthy. But seeing that I fear the same from Caesar's side, without
          any good to be got on Pompey's, I think my better course is to stay at home, and there
          await whatever comes. Yet I hold myself to be under so great an obligation to him, that I
          do not venture to incur the charge of ingratitude. However, you have yourself fully stated
          what is to he said in defence of that course. <milestone unit="para"/>As to the triumph, I
          quite agree with you: it will not cost me a moment's hesitation or a pang to throw it
          utterly aside. I much like your idea that, while I am moving about the country, "the

          </note> may suddenly present itself. " If only," say you, "Pompey shews a resolute front
          enough." He is even more resolute than I thought. You may pin your faith on him. I promise
          you that, if he wins, he will not leave a tile on any roof in Italy! "You his ally, then?"
          Yes, by Hercules, against my own judgment, and against the warnings of all history;
          and—not so much to help his side, as to avoid seeing what is going on here—I am anxious to
          quit the country. For pray don't imagine that the mad proceedings of the party in Italy
          will be endurable or all of one kind. I need hardly, however, point out to you, that when
          laws, jurors, law courts, and senate are abolished, neither the fortunes of individuals
          nor the revenues of the state will suffice for the licentious desires, the shameless
          demands, the extravagances, and the necessities of so many men in the lowest depths of
          poverty. Let me depart, therefore, never mind by what kind of voyage-that, indeed, shall
          be as you please—but anyhow <pb n="327"/> let me depart. For I, at least, shall be able to
          satisfy your curiosity on one point, as to what has been done at Brundisium. I am very
          glad-if one can be glad of anything now—to hear that my conduct up to this has the
          approval of the loyalists, and that they are aware of my not having started. As to
          Lentulus, I will make more careful inquiry: I have given orders about it to Philotimus, a
          man of courage and even too strong an Optimate. The last thing I have to say is this:
          supposing you are now at a loss for something to write about—for any other subject is out
          of the question, and what more can be found to say on this ?-yet, as there is no lack of
          ability (I mean it, by Heaven!) or affection on your part, which latter also adds a spur
          to my own intellect, pray maintain your practice of writing all you possibly can. I am a
          little vexed at your not inviting me to Epirus; I shouldn't give much trouble as a guest!
          But good-bye; for as you must have your walk and anointing, so I must have some sleep. In
          fact, your letter has made sleep possible for me. </p>

        <p> As we were at dinner on the 14th, and after nightfall indeed, Statius arrived with a
          short letter from you. You ask about L. Torquatus: not only Lucius, but Aulus also, has
          left the country, the latter a good many days ago. You mention the sale of prisoners at
          Reate: I am sorry that the seeds of a proscription should be sown in the Sabine district.
          I too had been informed that there were numerous senators at Rome. Can you give any reason
          why they ever left town? In these parts there is a notion-founded on conjecture rather
          than on message or despatch—that Caesar will be at Formiae on the 22nd of March. I could
          wish I <pb n="328"/> had Homer's Minerva here disguised as Mentor, to say to her: "How

        <p> I RECEIVED three letters from you on the 16th of March. They were dated on the 12th,
          13th, and 14th. So I will answer each in its order of time. I quite agree with you in
          thinking Formiae the best of all places for me to stay. I also agree with you about the
          Upper Sea, and I am very desirous, as I told you in a previous letter, to discover how I
          may without annoying Caesar avoid taking any part whatever in the conduct of public
          affairs. You praise me for saying that I put away the memory of my friend's past and his
          shortcomings. I really do so: nay, I even forget those very injuries inflicted by him upon
          myself which you mention. So much more influence do I choose gratitude for kindness to
          have with me, than resentment for injury. Let me act, then, according to your opinion, and
          summon up all my energies. The fact is, I am philosophizing all the time I am riding about
          the country, and in the course of my expeditions I never cease meditating on my theses.
          But some of them are very difficult of solution. As to the Optiinates, be it as you will:
          but you know the proverb, <pb n="329"/> "Dionysius at Corinth." <note n="1"
            anchored="true">This is generally interpreted by a reference to the story told in <bibl
              n="Cic. Tusc. 3">Tusc. 3</bibl>.27, of Dionysius the younger, after being expelled
            from Syracuse, keeping a school at Corinth because he could not live without some
            absolute power; so the <foreign xml:lang="la">Optimates</foreign> will not rest, Cicero
            is supposed to argue, till they get power, and then they will persecute me. Tyrrell and
            Purser think it sufficient to explain it as an example of the ups and downs of life.
            This hardly seems sufficiently in point here. I am inclined to dismiss the
            school-keeping altogether. Plutarch (in his life of <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Timoleon</foreign>), giving a pretty full account of Dionysius's exile, says nothing
            about it; but does say that he adopted a life of dissipation and frivolity in Corinth to
            avert suspicion of intending to recover his power. Cicero may mean, "The <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Optimates</foreign> may be moderate enough men now, as you say; but wait
            and see what they will do if they gain power, either by Pompey's success, or by joining
            Caesar." </note> The son of Titinius is with Caesar. <note n="2" anchored="true">Cicero
            seems to think that the presence of the younger Titinius in Caesar's company especially
            disgraceful or dangerous to himself (see pp. 260, 322). His father was on the other
            side. </note> You seem to have a kind of fear that I do not like your counsels: the
          fact, however, is that nothing else gives me any pleasure except your advice and your
          letters. Pray, therefore, keep to your word: do not cease writing to me whatever occurs to
          you: you can do me no greater favour. <milestone unit="para"/>I now come to your second.
          You are quite right to be incredulous about the number of Pompey's men. Clodia just
          doubled them in her letter. <note n="3" anchored="true">See Letter CCCLIX, p. 321. </note>
          It was all a lie also about disabling the ships. You praise the consuls: so do I as far as
          their spirit is concerned, but I blame their policy. For by their departure the
          negotiation for peace was rendered impossible, which I for one was meditating.
          Accordingly, after this I sent you back Demetrius's book "On Concord," and gave it to
          Philotimus. Nor have I any doubt left of a murderous war impending, which will begin with
          a famine. And yet I am vexed that I am not taking part in such a war! A war in which
          wickedness is certain to attain such dimensions, that, whereas it is a crime not to
          support one's parents, our leaders will think themselves entitled to starve to death the
          supreme and holiest of parents-their country! And this fear is not with me a matter of
          conjecture: I have heard their actual words. The whole object of collecting this fleet
          from Alexandria, Colchis, Tyre, Sidon, Aradus, Cyprus, Pamphylia, Lycia, Rhodes, Chios,
          Byzantium, <pb n="330"/> Lesbos, Zmyrna, Miletus, Cos, <note n="1" anchored="true">The
            fleet which Pompey was collecting from the East, where his name was still of the
            greatest weight. </note> is to intercept the supplies of Italy and blockade the
          Corn—growing provinces. Then, again, in what a state of anger will Pompey come! and
          especially with the very men most anxious for his safety, as though he had been abandoned
          by those whom he, in fact, abandoned himself. Accordingly, in my state of doubt as to what
          it is right for me to do, my feeling of obligation to Pompey becomes a very weighty
          motive: if that feeling were away, it were better in my eyes to perish in my country, than
          to ruin it in the attempt to save it. About the north wind it is clearly as you say: I am
          afraid Epirus may be harassed. But what part of Greece do you suppose will not be
          plundered? For Pompey gives out openly, and demonstrates to his soldiers, that he will
          outdo Caesar even in his liberality. It is an excellent suggestion of yours that, when I
          do see Caesar, I should not speak with too much tolerance, but rather with a grave
          severity. I clearly ought to do so. I am thinking of Arpinum, but not till I have had my
          meeting with him; thus avoiding being absent when he arrives, or having to hurry backwards
          and forwards along a detestably bad road. I am told, as you say in your letter, that
          Bibulus has arrived and started back again on the I4th. <note n="2" anchored="true">I.e.,
            has come home from Syria, and gone back to join Pompey. Bibulus had the command of
            Pompey's fleet. </note> You were expecting Philotimus, you say in your third letter. But
          he only left me on the 15th. That was why you got my letter in reply to yours rather late,
          though I wrote the answer at once. I agree with what you say about Domitius—he is at Cosa,
          and no one knows what his design is. Yes, that basest, meanest fellow in the world, who
          says that a consular election can be held by a praetor, is the same as he always was in
          constitutional matters. <note n="3" anchored="true">M. Aemilius Lepidus, praetor this
            year, <foreign xml:lang="la">consul</foreign>

            the world" (homo <foreign xml:lang="la">ventosissimus</foreign>): and his feebleness was
            afterwards only too clearly manifested. He was expelled from the triumvirate by Augustus
            in <date when="-0036">B.C. 36</date>, and lived on in obscurity (though still nominally
            Pontifex Maximus) till <date when="-0014">B.C. 14</date>. The constitutional point
            Cicero now attacks him on was the doctrine that a praetor could "create" a <foreign
              xml:lang="la">consul</foreign> —both consuls being away, Caesar would otherwise be
            unable to be elected—whereas, the true doctrine Cicero holds to be that the less
            magistrate cannot "create" the greater. See Letter CCCLXXII, p. 349. </note> So of
          course that was <pb n="331"/> what Caesar meant by saying in the letter, of which I sent
          you a copy, <note n="1" anchored="true">Letter CCCLVI. </note> "that he wished to avail
          himself of my advice , (well, well! that is a mere generality), "of my popularity" (that's
          empty flattery— but I suppose he adopts that tone with a view to my influencing certain
          senatorial votes), "of my position" (perhaps he means my vote as a consular). He finishes
          up by saying "of my help in every particular." I had already begun to suspect from your
          letter that this was the real meaning of it, or something very like it. For it is of great
          importance to him that there should not be an interregnum: and that he secures, if the
          consuls are "created" by the praetor. However, it is on record in our augural books that,
          so far from consuls being legally capable of being created by a praetor, the praetors
          themselves cannot be so created, and that there is no precedent for it: that it is illegal
          in case of the consuls, because it is not legal for the greater imperium to be proposed to
          the people by the less; in case of the praetors, because their names are submitted to the
          people as colleagues of the consuls, to whom belongs the greater imperium. Before long he
          will be demanding that my vote in the college should be given, and he won't be content

          at that time at Antium—that those little pleasure-grounds would suit me better, and be
          less expensive, than repairing my Tusculan house. I was then willing to give 500 sestertia
          (about £4,000) for them. I made an offer through a third person, which he refused, when he
          was putting it up for sale at Antium. But in these days I presume all such properties are
          gone down in value, owing to the dearness of money. It will suit me exactly, or rather us,
          if you buy it. But don't be put off by the late owner's follies: it is really a lovely
          place. However, all such properties appear to me to be now doomed to desolation. I have
          answered your three letters, but am expecting others. For up to this time it is letters
          from you that have kept me going. <milestone unit="para"/>The Liberalia (17th March). <pb

        </opener>
        <p> I have nothing to write about: for I have heard no news and I answered all your letters
          yesterday. But as uneasiness of mind not only deprives me of sleep, but prevents my even
          keeping awake without extreme pain, I have begun this letter to you—I can't tell what
          about, and I have no subject to hand—that I may in a manner have a talk with you, the one
          thing which gives me any repose. I think I have been a fool from the beginning, and the
          one thing that torments me is that I did not follow Pompey, like any private in the ranks,
          when, in every part of his policy, he was losing his footing, or rather rushing headlong
          to ruin. On the 17th of January I could see that he was thoroughly frightened. On that
          very day I detected his design. From that moment he forfeited my confidence, and never
          ceased committing one blunder after another. Meanwhile, never a line to me; no thought of
          anything but flight. Need I say more? As in love affairs men lose all fancy for women who
          are dirty, stupid, and indelicate, even so, the indecency of his flight and mismanagement
          put me off from my love for him. For in no respect was he acting in a way to make it
          proper for me to join his flight. Now love again rises: now my regret for him is more than
          I can bear: now I can get no good out of books, literature, or philosophy. So earnestly as
          I gaze across the sea, do I long, like Plato's bird, to fly away. <note n="1"

            wings of a dove," etc. </note> I am being punished, indeed I am, for my rashness. Yet
          what did that rashness amount to? What have I done without the most anxious consideration?
          If his only object had been flight, I could have fled with the utmost pleasure, but <pb
            n="334"/> it was the nature of the war, beyond measure sanguinary and widespread, the
          future of which men do not yet realize, that I shrank from with horror. What threats to
          the towns, to individual loyalists personally, to everybody, in fact, who stayed in Rome!
          How often did I hear" Sulla could do it, why not I?" For myself I was haunted with the
          reflexions: it was unrighteous of Tarquinius to stir up Porsena and Octavius Mamilius
          against his country; impious in Coriolanus to seek aid from the Volsci; righteous in
          Themistocles to prefer death; Hippias, son of Pisistratus, who fell in the battle of
          Marathon bearing arms against his country, was Criminal. But it may be said that Sulla,
          Marius, and Cinna had right on their side: rather I should perhaps admit that they had a
          technical justification; yet what could be more cruel and bloody than their use of
          victory? It was the nature of the war that I shrank from, and the more so because I saw
          that even bloodier work was being imagined and prepared. I—whom some called the preserver
          of this city, some its parent—I to bring against it armies of the Getae, Armenians, and
          Colchians! I to inflict famine on my fellow citizens, devastation upon Italy! Caesar, to
          begin with, I reflected was mortal, and in the next place might also come to an end in
          many ways: but the City and our people I thought ought to be preserved, as far as in us
          lay, for ever: and, after all, I pleased myself by hoping that some accommodation would be
          reached rather than the one of these men commit such a crime, or the other such an
          abomination. The matter is now wholly changed, and so are my feelings. The sun, as you
          said in one of your letters, seems to me to have disappeared from the universe. As in the
          case of a sick man one says, "While there is life there is hope," so, as long as Pompey
          was in Italy, I did not cease to hope. It is the present situation, the present, I say,
          that has baffled my calculations. And to confess the truth, my age, now after my long
          day's labour sloping towards an evening of repose, has relaxed my energies by suggesting
          the charms of family life. But now, however dangerous the experiment of attempting to fly
          hence, that experiment shall at least be made. I ought, perhaps, to have done so before.
          But the considerations I have mentioned held me back, and above all things your influence.
          For when I got to this point in my letter, I <pb n="335"/> unrolled the volume of your
          letters, which I keep under seal and preserve with the greatest care. Now there were in
          the letter dated by you the 21st of January the following expression: "But let us first
          see what Gnaeus is about, and in what direction his plans are drifting. Now, if he does
          abandon Italy, he will be acting certainly improperly, and, in my opinion, unwisely too.
          But it will be time enough, when he does that, to make a change in our policy." This you
          write on the fourth day after our quitting the city Next on the 23rd of January: "May our
          friend Gnaeus only not abandon Italy, as he has unwisely done Rome !" On the same day you
          write a second letter, in which you answer my application for advice in the plainest
          terms. This is what you say: "To come to the point on which you ask my opinion If Gnaeus
          quits Italy, I think you should return to the city: for what limit can there be to such a
          trip abroad as that?" This is what I could not get over: and I now see that attached to a
          most humiliating flight, which you euphemistically call a "trip abroad," is an unlimited
          war. Then follows your prophecy of the 25th of January: "If Pompey remains in Italy, and
          no terms are come to, I think there will be an unusually long war: but if he abandons
          Italy, I think that there awaits us in the future a really 'truceless' war." It is in such
          a war, then, that I am forced to be an abettor-one that is both truceless and with fellow
          citizens. Again, on the 7th of February, when you had heard more particulars of Pompey's
          designs, you end a certain letter thus; "For my part, if Pompey quits Italy, I should not
          advise your doing the same. For you will be running a very great risk and be doing no good
          to the Republic, to which you may be of some service hereafter if you remain." What
          patriot or statesman would not such advice, backed by the weight of wisdom and friendship,
          have moved? Next, on the 11th of February, you again answer my request for advice thus:
          "You ask me whether I advise flight, or defend delay, and consider it the better course:
          for the present, indeed, my opinion is that a sudden departure and hurried start would be,
          both for yourself and Gnaeus useless and dangerous, and I think it better that you should
          be separate and each on his own watchtower. But, on my honour, I think it disgraceful for
          us to be thinking of flight!" This <pb n="336"/> "disgraceful" measure our friend Gnaeus
          had contemplated two years ago: for so long a time past has his mind been set on playing
          the Sulla and indulging in proscriptions. Then, as I think, after you had written to me
          again in somewhat more general terms, and I had taken certain expressions of yours as
          advising me to leave Italy, you warmly disavow any such meaning on the 19th of February.
          "I certainly have not indicated in any letter of mine that, if Gnaeus quits Italy, you
          should do so with him: or, if I did so express myself, I was, I don't say inconsistent,
          but mad." In another passage of the same letter you say: "Nothing is left for him but
          flight, in which I do not think, and never have thought, that you, should share." This
          whole question again you discuss in greater detail in a letter of the 22nd of February:
          "If M. Lepidus and L. Volcatius stay, I think you should stay also: with the
          understanding, however, that, if Pompey survives and makes a stand anywhere, you should
          leave this inferno, and be more content to be beaten in the contest along with him, than
          reign with Caesar in the sink of iniquity which will evidently prevail here." You adduce
          many arguments to support this opinion. Then at the end you say: "What if Lepidus and
          Volcatius depart? In that case I doubt. So I think you must acquiesce in whatever happens
          and whatever you have done." If you had felt doubt before, you have now, at any rate, no
          hesitation, since those two are still in Italy. Again, when the flight had become an
          accomplished fact, on the 25th of February: "Meanwhile, I feel no doubt you had better
          remain at Formiae. That will be the most suitable place for waiting to see what turns up."
          On the 1st of March, when Pompey had been four days at Brundisium: "We shall be able to
          deliberate then no longer, it is true, with quite free hands, but certainly less fatally
          committed than if you had taken the great plunge in his company." Then on the 4th of
          March, though writing briefly, because it was the eve of your attack of ague, you yet use
          this expression: "I will write at greater length tomorrow; however, speaking generally, I
          will say this—that I do not repent my advice as to your staying, and though with great
          anxiety, yet, because I think it involves less evil than your starting would do, I abide
          by my opinion and rejoice that you have stayed." Moreover, <pb n="337"/> when I was now in
          great pain, and was fearing that I had been guilty of a base act, on the 5th of March you
          say: "After all, I am not sorry that you are not with Pompey. Hereafter, if it turns out
          to be necessary, there will be no difficulty: and at whatever time it takes place, it will
          be welcome to him. But I speak on the understanding that, if Caesar goes on as he has
          begun, and acts with sincerity, moderation, and wisdom, I shall have thoroughly to
          reconsider the position, and to look with greater care into what is for our advantage to
          do." On the 9th of March you say that our friend Peducaeus also approves of my having kept
          quiet; and his opinion has great weight with me. From these expressions in your letters I
          console myself with the belief that as yet I have done no wrong. Only pray justify your
          advice. There is no need to do so as far as I am concerned, but I want others to be in the
          same boat as myself. If I have done nothing wrong in the past, I will maintain the same
          blamelessness in the future. Only pray continue your exhortation that direction, and
          assist me by communicating your thoughts. Nothing has as yet been heard here about
          Caesar's return. For myself, I have got thus much good by writing this letter: I have read
          through all yours, and have found repose in that. </p>

        </opener>
        <p> ON reading your letter, handed to me by our friend Furnius, in which you ask me to come
          to the city walls, I was not so much surprised at your wishing "to avail yourself of my
          advice and position," but what you meant by speaking of my "influence and assistance" I
          did ask myself. My thoughts, however, were so far dominated by my hope, that I was induced
          to think that you wished to consult for the tranquillity, peace, and harmony of our fellow
          citizens: and <pb n="338"/> for a policy of that kind I regarded both my natural
          disposition and my public character as sufficiently well adapted. If this is the case, and
          if you are at all anxious to preserve our common friend Pompey, and to reconcile him to
          yourself and the Republic, you will assuredly find no one better calculated than myself
          for supporting such measures. For, as soon as opportunity offered, I pleaded for peace
          both to him and the senate; nor since the commencement of hostilities have I taken any
          part whatever in the war; and I have held the opinion that by that war you are being
          wronged, in that men who were hostile to and jealous of you were striving to prevent your
          enjoying an office granted you by the favour of the Roman people. <note n="1"

          your rights, but also advised everybody else to assist you, so at the present moment I am
          strongly moved by consideration for the position of Pompey. It is now a good number of
          years ago since I picked out you two as the special objects of my political devotion,
          and—as you still are of my warm personal affection. Wherefore I ask you, or rather entreat
          you, and appeal to you with every form of prayer, that in the midst of your very great
          preoccupations you would yet spare some part of your time to reflect how by your kindness
          I may be enabled to do what goodness and gratitude, and, in point of fact, natural
          affection demand, by remembering the extreme obligation under which I stand. If these
          considerations only affected myself, I should yet have hoped to secure your assent; but,
          in my opinion, it concerns both your own honour and the public interest that I-a friend to
          peace and to you both-should, as far as you are concerned, be maintained in a position
          best calculated to promote harmony between you and among our fellow citizens. <milestone

        <p> Do you know that our friend Lentulus is at Puteoli? Having been told this by a
          passer-by, who said that he had recognized him on the Appia upon his partly drawing the
          curtain of his sedan, though it was in itself probable, I yet sent some servants to
          Puteoli to inquire and take him a letter. He was discovered with some difficulty, as he
          was keeping himself concealed in his villa, and he sent me back an answer containing
          wonderful expressions of gratitude to Caesar; but as to his own plans he said that he had
          given C. Caecius a message for me. I am expecting him today, that is, the 20th of March.
          Matius <note n="1" anchored="true">C. Matius, of whom we shall hear much more, was a
            friend of Trebatius, and a strong Caesarian. He survived the Civil War and became a
            friend of Octavian </note> also came to see me on the Quinquatrus (19th of March), a
          man, by Hercules, as he seemed to me, of moderate and sensible views. Certainly he has
          always been regarded as a promoter of peace. How strongly he appealed to me to disapprove
          what, is going on in Italy! How fearful of that inferno, as you call it! In the course of
          a long conversation I shewed him Caesar's letter to me, the one of which I have sent you a
          copy before, and asked him to explain the sentence in it—"he wished to avail himself of my
          advice, influence, position, and help in all ways." He replied that he had no doubt that
          he wanted <pb n="340"/> my help and my influence for effecting a pacification. I only wish
          I could effect and carry through some politic move in the present distressing
          circumstances of the state! For his part, Matius felt confident that that was Caesar's
          feeling, and promised that he would promote it. However, on the day previous Crassipes had
          been with me, who said that he had quitted Brundisium on the 6th of March and had left
          Pompey there: and the same news was brought also by those who quitted that place on the
          8th. They one and all, even Crassipes—who is a sensible enough man to take note of what
          was going on—tell the same story of threatening speeches, alienation from the Optimates,
          hostility to the municipal towns, undisguised proscriptions—Sullas pure and simple. What
          things Lucceius says, and the whole posse of Greeks, and Theophanes at their head! And yet
          there is no hope of safety except in them: and I am keeping my mind on the watch, and

          order to escape the abominations going on here! For there—what crime do you suppose

        <p> I HAD just read your letter on the 20th, when a packet was brought me from Lepta saying
          that Pompey had been completely invested, that even the channels of the harbour were
          blocked up with vessels. Upon my honour, tears prevent my thinking of or writing the rest.
          I send you a copy. What wretches we have been! Why did we not follow his fortunes to the
          end? Oh, here's the same news from Matius and Trebatius,who have been met by Caesar's
          letter-bearers at Minturnae. I feel so wracked with misery that I long for an end like
          that of Mucius. <note n="1" anchored="true">Q Mucius <foreign xml:lang="la"

          thoroughly thought out, in regard to my journey by land as well as by sea, and my meeting
          and conversation with Caesar! There is honour and caution alike in every word. Your
          invitation to Epirus, too, how kindly, how courteous, how brotherly it is! I am surprised
          at Dionysius, who has been treated with greater honour in my family than Panaetius was in
          Scipio's: yet my unfortunate position has been regarded by him with the foulest contempt.
          I detest the fellow, and always shall. I only wish I could be even with him! But his own
          character will be his punishment. Yes, pray, now of all times turn over in your mind what
          I ought to do. An army of the Roman people is actually surrounding Gnaeus Pompeius: it has
          inclosed him with foss and palisade; it is preventing his escape. Are we alive? Is our
          city still intact? Are the praetors presiding in the courts, the aediles making
          preparations for their games, the Optimates entering their investments, I myself sitting
          quietly looking on? Am I to make an effort to reach Pompey like a madman? Am I to appeal
          to the loyalty of the <pb n="342"/> municipal towns? The loyalists won't follow me, the
          careless will laugh me to scorn, the revolutionists-especially now that they are
          successful and fully armed-will use main force to me. What is your opinion, then? Have you
          any advice to give as to how to put an end to this most wretched state of existence? It is
          now that I feel the pang, the torture—now that some one is found to think me either wise
          or lucky for not having gone. My feeling is the reverse. For while I was never willing to
          be the partner of his victory, I should have preferred having been associated with his
          disaster. Why, then, should I now appeal to your letter, to your wisdom, or your kindness?
          It is all over. Nothing can help me now: for I have now nothing even to wish for, except
          to be set free by some merciful stroke of the enemy. </p>

          what would have been the meaning of Dolabella's words in his letter, dated from Brundisium
          on the 13th of March, when he mentioned it as a success on the part of Caesar that Pompey
          was in full retreat, and was going to sail with the first favourable wind? This is quite
          inconsistent with those letters, of which I have already sent you copies. Here, indeed,
          they talk of nothing but disaster. But we have no more recent authority, and of this
          particular fact no better one, than Dolabella. <milestone unit="para"/>I have received
          your letter of the 22nd of March, in which you propose to postpone all plans till we know
          what has happened. Of course that is quite right: and meanwhile it <pb n="343"/> is
          impossible not merely to settle but even to consider any plan. However, this letter of
          Dolabella's inclines me to recur to my original ideas. For on the day before the
          Quinquatrus (18th of March) the weather was splendid, and I suppose he has taken advantage
          of it. That précis of your advice was not made by me by way of reproach to you, but rather
          to console myself. For the evils of the time were not causing me so much vexation, as the
          idea of my having done wrong and acted rashly. I have now got rid of that idea, since my
          actions and plans coincide with your suggestions. You remark in your letter that it is
          rather my avowal of Pompey's services, than the actual amount of them, that makes me seem
          to be under an obligation to him. That is true: I have always magnified them, and the more
          so that I might prevent his thinking that I remembered his earlier conduct. However much I
          might remember this, I should yet be bound to follow the example he set at that time.
            <note n="1" anchored="true">In supporting Cicero's recall; though he had failed to
            prevent his exile. </note> He gave me no aid when he might have done so. True: but
          afterwards he was my friend, and a very warm one, I don't at all know why. Therefore I too
          will be his friend. Nay, more, there is this analogy in our two cases, that we have been
          betrayed by the same people. But oh, that it had been in my power to render him as
          important a service, as he was able to render me! After all, I am exceedingly grateful for
          what he did; yet, at the present moment, I neither know how to help him, nor, if I could,
          should I think I ought to assist him while preparing to engage on such an execrable war.
          Only I don't wish to hurt his feelings by remaining here. I should neither have the
          resolution, by Hercules! to watch the events, which you can even now foresee in
          imagination, nor to take part in those unhappy measures. But I was all the slower to
          depart, from the difficulty of imagining a voluntary departure when there is no hope of a
          return. For I see that Caesar is so well equipped with infantry, cavalry, fleets, and
          Gallic auxiliaries. About these last I suppose Matius was talking big, but he certainly
          said that 10,000 infantry and 6,ooo cavalry promised their services at their own expense
          for ten years. But <pb n="344"/> grant this to be gasconnade. He certainly has great
          forces, and he will not merely have the revenue of Italy, but the property of the
          citizens. Add to this the man's own self-confidence and the weakness of the loyalists,
          who, in fact, because they think Pompey deservedly enraged with them, have, as you
          expressed it, become disgusted with the game. Yes, but I could have wished that you had
          indicated who these men were. The fact is that Caesar, because he has done much less than
          he threatened, is regarded with affection ; <note n="1" anchored="true">Reading <foreign

            me to be very harsh. Domitius was not being by any means inactive at the time, and there
            is no special reason for referring to him here. It is true that <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >amatur</foreign> is not in the MSS., but its introduction (by Graevius) seems to me a
            simpler and better way of emending the text. </note> while in every direction those who
          loved Pompey now cease to do so. The municipal towns, in fact, and the Romans living in
          the country fear Pompey, and are still attached to Caesar. Accordingly, the latter is so
          well prepared that, even if he proves unable to win a victory, I yet cannot see how he can
          be beaten himself. For myself, I am not so much afraid of Caesar's sorcery, as of his
          power of compulsion. "For the requests of tyrants," as Plato says,"you know, partake of
          the nature of commands." <note n="2" anchored="true">Plato, Ep. vii. </note>
          <milestone unit="para"/>I see you don't like a place of residence for me without a port.
          Neither do I: but the fact is I have there both a means of concealment and a trusty band
          of followers. If I could have had the same at Brundisium, I should have preferred it. But
          concealment is impossible there. However, as you say, when we know! I am not very careful
          to excuse myself to, the loyalists. For what dinners they are giving and attending,
          according to Sextus's letter to me! How splendid, how early! <note n="3" anchored="true"

          loyalist as they please, they are not more so than we are. I should have cared more for

                <p>On the 9th of March I reached Brundisium. I have pitched my camp under the walls.
                  Pompey is at Brundisium. He sent Numerius Magius to me to negotiate for peace.
                    <note n="2" anchored="true">Numerius Magius was Pompey's <foreign xml:lang="la"

                      >B.C. 1.24</bibl>-26, see p. 303), he fell into Caesar's hands during his

                    message to Pompey, but did not return with any answer. Caesar then sent Caninius
                    Rutilius to endeavour to induce Pompey to, have a personal conference. In the
                    Commentaries Caesar may, from a lapse of memory, have confused matters. Still,
                    it looks as though in the commentary he meant to justify himself. He has
                    represented the proposals for peace as emanating from himself, whereas the

        <p> Can you endure this? It is a lamentable business altogether, but nothing can be more
          lamentable than this: Pompey has sent N. Magius to negotiate a peace, and yet is being
          besieged. I could not have believed it, but I have a letter from Balbus, of which I
          inclose a copy. Read it, I beg of you, and especially the last clause of the excellent
          Balbus himself, to whom our Gnaeus presented a site for a suburban villa, and whom he
          often preferred, did he not? to everyone of us! Accordingly, the poor man is in a state of
          painful anxiety. But to save you the trouble of reading the same thing twice, I refer you
          to the letter itself. Hope of peace, however, I have none. Dolabella in his letter dated
          the 15th of March breathes nothing but war. Let us stick, then, to the same resolution,
          formed in sorrow and despair, since nothing can be more lamentable than this. <pb n="347"

        <p> I had sent you, on the 24th of March, a copy of a letter from Balbus to me and of
          Ceasar's to him. Lo and behold, on the same day I receive a letter from Q. Pedius, from
          Capua, telling me that Caesar had written to him on the 14th of March in the following
          words: "Pompey keeps himself in the town. Our camp is at the gates. We are attempting a
          difficult operation, and one which will occupy many days, owing to the depth of the sea;
          but nevertheless it is the best thing for us to do. We are throwing out moles from both
          headlands at the mouth of the harbour, in order to compel Pompey to take the forces he has
          at Brundisium across as soon as possible, or to prevent his getting out at all." <note
            n="1" anchored="true">Caesar occupied nine days in this work, which was only half
            completed then. He did not really expect to be able thoroughly to block the harbour. His
            object was to frighten Pompey into leaving Italy thus leaving him free to enter Rome
            himself and secure his position in the West generally (<bibl n="Caes. Civ. 1.25">Caes.

          <milestone unit="para"/>Where is the peace, as to which Balbus said that he was in a state
          of anxiety? Could there be anything more vindictive, more ruthless? Moreover, a certain
          person told me on good authority that Caesar gives out that he is avenging Cn. Carbo, M.

            surrendered, it is said, on promise of his life. </note> and all those on whom Sulla,
          with Pompey's assistance, had wreaked his cruelty; that Curio was doing nothing under his
          leadership which Pompey had not done under Sulla's; that he was seeking the restoration
            <pb n="348"/> of those whose exile had not been inflicted upon them by earlier laws,
          while Pompey had restored men who had been traitors to their country; that he complained
          of the violence used to secure Milo's exile, but that, nevertheless, he would harm no one
          unless he appeared in array against him. <milestone unit="para"/>This is the story told by
          a certain Baebius, who left Curio on the 13th, a man who is not without some sense, but
          yet not capable of inventing this out of his own head. I am quite at a loss what to do.
          From Brundisium, indeed, I suppose Pompey has already started. Whatever has happened, we
          shall know in two days. I haven't a line from you, not even by Anteros. No wonder: for
          what is there for us to write about? Nevertheless, I don't omit a single day. <milestone

          want a decree of the senate, and also a decree of the augurs: we shall be hurried off to
          Rome or molested, if we hold aloof, with a view of either the praetor holding an election

          hope of a speedy return, there was universal remonstrance. In the present instance I am
          eager to quit the country, with what hope of return I cannot ever conceive. Again, not
          only is there no remonstrance on the part of townsmen and countryfolk, but, on the
          contrary, they are actually afraid of Pompey as bloodthirsty and enraged. Nevertheless,
          nothing makes me more wretched than to have stayed here, and there is nothing that I more
          earnestly desire than to fly away, not so much to share in a war as in a flight. But you
          were for putting off all plans until such time as we knew what had happened at Brundisium.
          Well, we now know: but we are as undecided as ever. For I can scarcely hope that he will

          character. See what an old-fashioned man I am! I thought, upon my honour, that you would
          be annoyed at this affair more than I was myself. For, besides the fact that I think you
          ought to be moved by an injury done me by anyone, this man has also in a certain sense
          outraged yourself in having behaved badly to me. But what account you should take of this
          it is for you to judge. However, in this matter I don't wish to lay any burden upon you.
          For my part, I always thought him half cracked, now I think him a scoundrel and a
          good-for-nothing besides: and yet, after all, not a worse enemy to me than to himself.
          What you said to Philargyrus was quite right: you certainly have a clear and good case in
          proving that I had been abandoned rather than had abandoned. When I had already despatched
          my letter on the 25th, the servants whom I had sent with Matius and Trebatius brought me a
          letter, of which this is a copy: <quote>

                <p>After leaving Capua we heard, while on the road, that Pompey, with all the forces
                  he had, started from Brundisium <pb n="351"/> on the 15th of March: that Caesar
                  next day entered the town, made a speech, hurried thence for Rome, intending to be
                  at the city before the 1st of April and to remain there a few days, and then to
                  start for Spain. We thought it the proper thing to do, since we were assured of
                  Caesar's approach, to send your servants back to you, that you might be informed
                  of it as early as possible. We do not forget your charges, and we will carry them
                  out as circumstances shall demand. Trebatius is making great exertions to reach
                  you before Caesar. After this letter had been written we received tidings that
                  Caesar would stop at Beneventum on the 25th of March, at Capua on the 26th, at
                  Sinuessa on the 27th. We think you may depend on this.</p>

        <p> I am expecting Trebatius on the 27th, the day I write this letter. From his report and
          the letter from Matius I shall consider what line to take in my conversation with Caesar.
          What an unfortunate crisis! I feel no doubt that he will urge me to come to the city. For
          he ordered a notice to be put up at Formiae, among other places, that he desired a full
          meeting of the senate on the 1st. Well, then, ought I to refuse him? But why anticipate? I
          will write you word at once of all that occurs. I will judge from what he says whether I
          am to go to Arpinum or elsewhere. I want to give my son his toga virilis. I think of doing
          it there. Pray consider what should be my next step, for troubles have made me stupid. I
          should like to know from Curius whether you have received any news of Tiro. For to me Tiro
          has himself written in such a tone as to alarm me about his health. Those, too, who come
          from those parts report that he is in a critical condition. This anxiety, in the <pb
            n="353"/> midst of my other great ones, gives me much uneasiness: for in my present
          position his services, as well as his fidelity, would have been of great advantage. </p>

        <p> I FOLLOWED your advice in both particulars: for I spoke in such a manner as rather to
          gain his respect than his thanks, and I stuck to the resolution of not going to Rome. I
          found myself mistaken in one respect—in thinking that he would be easily satisfied. I
          never saw anything less so. He kept remarking that he was condemned by my decision, that
          the rest would be the slower to come, if I did not do so. I remarked that their case was
          unlike mine. After much discussion he said, "Come, then, and discuss the question of
          peace." . " At my own discretion?" said I. "Am I to prescribe to you?" said he. "My motion
          will be this," said I, "that the senate disapproves of any going to Spain or taking armies
          across to Greece, and," I added, "I shall make many regretful marks as to Gnaeus."
          Thereupon he said, "Of course, I don't wish such things said." "So I supposed," said I,
          "but I must decline being present there, because I must either speak in this sense, and
          say many things which I could not possibly pass over, if present, or I must not come at
          all." The upshot was that, by way of ending the discussion, he requested that I would
          think it over. I couldn't say no to that. So we parted. I feel certain, therefore, that he
          has no love for me. But I felt warm satisfaction with myself, which hasn't been the case
          for some time past. For the rest, good heavens! What a crew! What an inferno! to use your
          word. . <note n="1" anchored="true">Some other words (<foreign xml:lang="la">in qua erat

          </note> What a <pb n="354"/> gang of bankrupts and desperadoes! What is one to say of a
          son of Servius, a son of Tullus having been in the camp by which Pompey was besieged? Six
          legions! He is extra-ordinarily vigilant, extraordinarily bold: I see no limit to the
          mischief. Now, at any rate, it is time for you to bring out your counsels. This is where
          you drew the line. Yet his closing remark in our interview, which I had almost forgotten
          to mention, was very offensive, that "if he was not allowed to avail himself of my
          counsels, he would avail himself of such as he could, and would scruple at nothing." "So
          you have seen with your own eyes," say you, "that the man is such as you described him to
          be. Did it cost you a sigh ?" Yes, indeed. "Tell me the rest." Well, he went straight off
          to his villa at Pedum, I to Arpinum. Next I await the "twittering swallow"—to which you
          refer. <note n="1" anchored="true">

            letters of the MSS., as is explained by Letter CCCLXI, p. 326, where he quotes another
            part of the Greek epigram (Anth. 10.1), on the season for sailing announced by the
            swallow, harbinger of spring: <quote>
              <l>See the meads bloom! the time has come for sailing:</l>

              <l>the soft west wind prevailing,</l>
              <l>Late swollen with waves and lashed with bitter blast.</l>
            </quote> Of course, Cicero means that he will sail, as soon as weather permits, to join
            Pompey. </note> "Come," you will say, "don't cry over spilt milk: <note n="2"

            from caution. </note> even the leader himself, whom we are following, has made many
          mistakes." <milestone unit="para"/>But I wait for a letter from you. For you can't say, as
          in former ones, "Let us see how this turns out." The final test was to be our meeting, and
          in that I feel certain I have offended him. All the more prompt must be my next step. Pray
          send me a packet, and full of politics! I am very anxious for a letter from you. <pb

        <p> BEING debarred from Rome, I gave my son his toga virilis at Arpinum in preference to any
          other place, and my fellow townsmen were gratified at the compliment: though I observed
          everywhere that both they and others whom I passed in my journey were in low spirits and
          much dejected. So melancholy and shocking is the contemplation of this tremendous
          disaster. Levies are being held, the men are being drafted into winter quarters. These are
          measures which, even when taken by loyal citizens at a time of regular war and with due
          consideration, are yet in themselves a source of annoyance—how unpopular do you suppose
          they are in the present instance, when they are being carried out by men of reckless
          character, in an abominable civil war, and in the most offensive manner? Don't imagine
          that there is a single scoundrel in Italy who is not to be found among them. I saw them en
          masse at Formiae. I never, by Hercules! believed them to be human beings, and I knew them
          all: but I had never seen them collected in one place. Let us go, then, whither we have
          resolved to go, and leave all that is ours behind us. Let us start to join him, to whom
          our arrival will give greater satisfaction than if we had been together from the first.
          For at that time we were in the highest hopes, now I, at any rate, have none; nor has
          anyone except myself left Italy, unless he regarded Caesar as his personal enemy. Nor, by
          Hercules! do I do this for the sake of the Republic, which I regard as completely
          abolished: but to prevent anyone thinking me ungrateful to the man, who relieved me from
          the miseries which he had himself inflicted upon me: and at the same time because I cannot
          endure the sight of what is happening, or of what is certain to happen. Why, I believe
          that by this time some decrees of the senate have <pb n="356"/> been passed, I hope they
          may be in the sense of Volcatius's proposal. <note n="1" anchored="true">Perhaps in favour
            of sending commissioners to treat with Pompey. Such a proposal was made in the senate.
            Caesar tells us that he spoke in favour of it himself, but he does not mention the
            proposer (<bibl n="Caes. Civ. 1.32">Caes. B.C. 1.32</bibl>, 33). </note> But what does
          it matter? Everyone's opinion is the same. But Servius will be the most implacable of all,
          for he has sent his son with Pontius Titinianus <note n="2" anchored="true">Adopted son of
            Q. Titinius. Servius is Ser. Sulpicius Rufus. See last letter, p. 354. </note> to crush,
          or at any rate to capture, Gnaeus Pompeius. Yet the latter acts from a motive of fear: but
          the former? But let us cease shewing temper, and let us at last thoroughly realize that we
          have nothing left, except what I could least have wished-life. As for us, since the Upper
          Sea is beset, we will sail by the Lower, and if it turns out to be difficult to start from
          Puteoli, we will make for Croton or Thurii, and like good citizens, devoted to our
          country, we will play the pirate. I don't see any other way of carrying on this war. We
          will go to Egypt and ensconce ourselves there. We cannot possibly be his match on land: of
          peace there is no assurance. But enough of these lamentations. Pray give a letter to
          Cephalio on everything that has been done, and even about what men say, unless they have
          become entirely tongue-tied. I have followed your advice, and especially in the fact that,
          in my interview with him, I both maintained my proper dignity and stuck to my refusal to
          go to Rome. As to the rest, pray write to me with the most particular care—for by this
          time the worst has come to the worst—what course you approve, and what your opinion is.
          There can, of course, be now no hesitation: still, if anything does occur to you, or
          rather whatever occurs to you, pray write me word. <pb n="357"/>

          proposed and meditated, partly will crop up in the future? I, for my part, shall disregard
          the law of Solon—your countryman, and presently, I think, to be mine—who punished by
          disfranchisement the man who, in a case of civil disturbance, took neither side. Unless
          you think otherwise, I shall hold aloof both from the one and the other. But one of the
          two courses is more decidedly resolved upon in my mind, and yet I will not anticipate. I
          shall await your advice and the letter (unless you have by this time sent another) which I
          asked you to deliver to Cephalio. You say, not because you have heard it from anyone else,
          but because it is your personal belief, that I shall be drawn into any negotiation there
          may be about peace. I have no idea at all of any negotiation for peace being possible,
          since it is Caesar's most fixed determination, if he can, to strip Pompey of his army and
          province, <note n="1" anchored="true">Spain, which was being governed for Pompey by three
            legates, forced by Caesar in the following summer to surrender. </note> unless,
          perchance, that well-paid friend of yours can persuade him to keep quiet long enough to
          allow commissioners to go and return. I see nothing to hope for or to think of as
          possible. Nevertheless, this is itself a point for an honest man to consider: it is

          for my part does not give me any anxiety, for I have said what I intended saying about
          peace, and Caesar himself emphatically repudiated it—but if anything should turn up, write
          and tell me in any case what you think I ought to do. For nothing has as yet occurred to
          me requiring more <pb n="359"/> deliberation. I rejoice that you are pleased with the

          "excellent" has been the one thing up to now that has given me pleasure. I am looking
          eagerly for a letter from you which, indeed, I feel sure is already on its way. You, along
          with Sextus, have maintained the same dignified resolve as youenjoin upon me. Your friend

          active political life among the disloyal with freedom of action, or to side with the
          loyalists at whatever risk. Let me either follow the fool-hardy counsels of the loyalists,
          or attack the reckless measures of the disloyal. Either is dangerous: but what I am now
          doing is discreditable and yet not safe. I think that your friend who sent his son to

          to stop the next day at Minturnae meaning to start back thence at once, I broke <pb

          certain intelligence, I might be in a more retired place, and yet all the preparations
          should go on which do not require my presence. The "twitterer" <note n="1" anchored="true"
            >See p. 354. </note> is now here, and I am all eagerness to be gone; and yet I have no
          idea of destination or route. But these points I and those who understand such things will
          have to settle. Yet pray, to the best of your power, continue to aid us as before with
          your advice. Things are in an impossible tangle. Everything has to be left to chance. We
          are struggling along without any hope. If anything better turns up, it will be a surprise.
          I would rather Dionysius, of whom Tullia has written me word, had not set out to join me.
          The truth is that it is not a suitable time, nor do I wish that my discomforts-especially
          considering their gravity-should furnish a spectacle to a man who is not my friend, and I
          don't want you to be at enmity with him on my account. </p>

        <p> THOUGH I have absolutely nothing to write about, yet there are these remaining points
          which I want to know-whether Caesar has started; in what position he has left the city; in
          Italy itself, whom he has placed at the head of each region or department of business; and
          who were sent to Pompey and the consuls as peace commissioners, in accordance with the
          decree of the senate? So to ascertain these facts I make a point of sending this letter to
          you. You will be doing me, therefore, a great service, and one I shall be grateful for, if

        <p> I have received a large number of letters from you on the same day, all carefully
          written; one, however, which amounts to a volume, deserving to be read again and again, as
          I am doing. The labour of writing it was not thrown away, and I am excessively obliged to
          you. Wherefore, as long as circumstances allow of it, that is, as long as you know where I
            <pb n="362"/> am, I earnestly beg of you to repeat the experiment as often as possible.
          Yes, indeed: let there be once for all an end, if possible, to these daily lamentations,
          or at any rate some sort of restraint in them, which at least is possible. For it is not
          now the rank, the honours, or the position in life which I have lost that I am thinking
          of; but what I have actually attained to, the services I have performed, the reputation in
          which I have lived: in fine, the difference, even in these disastrous circumstances,
          between myself and those through whom I have lost all. These are the men who thought that,
          without expelling me from the state, they could not maintain the free gratification of
          their desires; and you see to what this close alliance and unprincipled coalition of
          theirs has come! <milestone unit="para"/>The one leader is in a fever of mad fury and
          crime: there is no slackening with him: his hand grows heavier every day. Not long ago. he
          expelled Pompey from Italy. Now on one side of the empire he is for pursuing him, on the
          other for stripping him of his province. He no longer refuses, he even in a sense demands,
          to have the title of tyrant, as he already is one in fact. The other—the man who once upon
          a time did not so much as raise me up when I threw myself at his feet—the man who said he
          could do nothing against Caesar's wish— having evaded the hand and sword of his
          father-in-law, is now preparing war by land and sea: not an unjust one on his part indeed,
          but both righteous and even necessary, but yet one fatal to his fellow citizens unless he
          prove victorious, fraught with disaster even if he is victorious. <milestone unit="para"
          />Not only do I not rate the achievements of these supreme commanders as superior to my
          own: I do not even consider that their present position is any better, though they seem to
          be in a very brilliant one, and I to be struggling with a harder fate. For who can be
          happy who has caused either the abandonment or the invasion of his country? And if, as you
          remind me, I was right in saying in these books that the only good was virtue, the only
          evil vice, certainly both those men are in the highest degree miserable, for to both the
          safety and dignity of their country have always been subordinate to their own power and
          their private advantage. I am therefore sustained by the purity of my conscience, when <pb
            n="363"/> I reflect that I either performed the most eminent services to the state, when
          I had the power, or at least never harboured any but loyal thoughts; and that the republic
          has been wrecked by precisely the storm which I foresaw fourteen years ago. With such
          feelings, then, as my companions, shall I set out, not indeed without a bitter pang, and
          that, not so much for my own or my brother's sake (for our life is practically over) as
          for our sons, for whom at times it seems to me that we were bound to have secured, among
          other things, the integrity of the constitution. Of them the one, because he is not after
          all more dutiful than he is, gives me extraordinary pain: while the other—Oh dear Oh dear!
          it is the keenest sorrow of my life—corrupted no doubt by our system of indulgence, has
          gone very far, to a point indeed which I do not venture to describe. <note n="1"
            anchored="true">Neither Cicero's son nor his nephew, apparently, were keen enough
            anti-Caesarians. His son gave him much anxiety by his conduct in early life, and the
            nephew not only now shewed his Caesarian leanings, but after <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Pharsalia</foreign> turned fiercely on his uncle, as having involved them in a losing
            cause, and was joined in that by his father Quintus. </note> I am expecting, too, a
          letter from you: for you said that you would write at greater length when you had seen the
          young man himself. All my indulgent conduct to him has been accompanied with considerable
          strictness, and it is not one only or a small peccadillo of his that I have come down
          upon, but many and very serious ones; his father's gentleness to him also ought to have
          secured his affection, rather than such unfeeling disrespect. The fact is that his writing
          to Caesar caused us such serious annoyance, that, while we concealed it from you, we yet,
          I think, made his own life unpleasant. This recent journey of his, however, and his
          pretence of loyalty to us <note n="2" anchored="true">Young Quintus had insisted on going
            to Rome to interview Caesar, professing to plead his father's and uncle's cause, but
            really, Cicero thinks, denouncing them and repudiating their policy. </note> I do not
          venture to characterize. I only know that after visiting Hirtius he was invited to an
          interview by Caesar, that he talked to him about my feeling as being entirely opposed to
          his own views, and of my design of quitting Italy. Even this I do not write with
          confidence. Well, it is not my fault, it is his natural disposition that must cause us
          alarm. It was this that corrupted Curio and the son of Hortensius, not their fathers'
          fault. My brother is prostrate <pb n="364"/> with grief, and is not so much afraid for his
          own life as for mine. To this misery pray, pray, bring any consolations that you can;
          above all I should prefer one—the assurance that the story told us is false or
          exaggerated. If it is true, I don't see what is to happen in our present state of life,
          when we are practically exiles. For if the Republic had still had any existence, I should
          have been at no loss what to do either by way of severity or indulgence. Whether it is the
          influence of anger, or pain, or fear, I have written this in a tone of greater severity
          than either your affection for him or mine would seem to warrant. If it is true, you must
          pardon me: if false, I shall be only too glad to be relieved of my mistake by you. But
          whatever the truth of the matter may be, you must not attribute any blame to his uncle or
          father. <milestone unit="para"/>I had written so far when a message was brought from
          Curio's house that he was coming to call on me. He had arrived at his Cuman villa
          yesterday, that is, the 13th. If his conversation, therefore, furnishes me with any
          subject worth writing to you, I will append it to this letter. <milestone unit="para"
          />Curio passed by my villa and sent me a message to say that he was coming presently, and
          hurried on to Puteoli to make a public speech there. He made his speech, returned, and
          paid me a very long visit. Monstrous! You know our friend: he made no concealments. To
          begin with, he said that it was absolutely certain that all who had been condemned under
          the lex Pompeia <note n="1" anchored="true">The law passed by Pompey in his third
            consulship (<date when="-0052">B.C. 52</date>) on bribery and violence. The Caesarian
            view was that the laws had been passed, and the trials held, under terrorism, as Pompey
            had an armed guard in the city. </note> were being recalled, <note n="2" anchored="true"
            >This measure was carried out by Antony under Caesar's direction (<bibl
              n="Cic. Phil. 2.56">Phil. 2.56</bibl>ff). See p. 396. </note> and that accordingly he
          would avail himself of their services in Sicily. As to the Spains, he had no doubt about
          their being Caesar's; and from them Caesar would himself march with an army wherever
          Pompey was: that an end would be put to the whole mischief by the latter's death: that in
          an access of anger Caesar had really wished the tribune Metellus to be killed, <note n="3"
            anchored="true">When Caesar was at Rome after Pompey's flight from <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Brundisium</foreign>, he found it impossible to get the measures he
            wished passed in the </note> and that it was within an ace of being done: <pb n="365"/>
          if it had been done, there would have followed a serious massacre: that a great many
          people advised one: that Caesar himself was not by taste or nature averse from bloodshed,
          but thought clemency would win him popularity: if, however, he once lost the affection of
          the people, he would be cruel: he was, again, much disturbed by finding that he had caused
          ill-feeling among the populace itself by taking the treasury, and therefore that, though
          he had quite made up his mind to address the people before leaving Rome, he had not
          ventured to do so, and had started with very disturbed feelings. <note n="1"
            anchored="true">This is a striking comment upon Caesar by one of his own partisans; and,
            though Caesar falsified it by persistent clemency to most of his citizen opponents,
            there are circumstances in the Gallic campaigns which make us hesitate to acquit Caesar
            altogether of cruelty. Curio's character, however, takes much from his credibility as a
            witness or critic. </note> When again I asked what he saw in the future, what final
          result, and what sort of a constitution, he openly confessed that there was no hope left.
          He expressed fear of Pompey's fleet, and said that, if it put out to sea, he should
          abandon Sicily. "What is the meaning of your lictors?" said I. " If derived from the
          senate, why laurelled? If from Caesar, why six?" "I wanted," said he, "to get my authority
          from a decree of the senate, though by a snatch vote, for it could not be done otherwise.
          But Caesar now dislikes the senate much more than ever. 'Everything,' he says, 'will in
          future come from me."' "But why six? " <note n="2" anchored="true">Curio was going to
            Sicily with imperium. The governor of Sicily was regularly a praetor or propraetor, and
            would have six lictors. But Curio, not having been elected praetor, or nominated by the
            senate, was really a <foreign xml:lang="la">legatus</foreign> of Caesar's, and might
            have whatever status-pro <foreign xml:lang="la">consule</foreign> or <foreign
              xml:lang="la">pro</foreign> praetore—that Caesar chose. If Curio had only the six
            lictors by way of posing as a propraetor constitutionally nominated by the senate, then
            the laurels were out of place: for such successes as he had gained were gained before
            the senate could have nominated him, and were also over citizens, for which no insignia
            of victory were ever assumed. </note> "Because I did not want twelve; I might have had
          them." Then I said, "How I wish I had asked him for what I hear Philippus <note n="3"
            anchored="true">Married to <foreign xml:lang="la">Atia</foreign>, niece of Caesar and
            mother of Augustus. He was a strong <foreign xml:lang="la">Optimate</foreign>, and was

            quarrel. </note> has succeeded in getting! But I was afraid to senate, because his
          enemies put up the tribune L. Caecilius Metellus to veto every proposal (Caesar, B.C. i
          33). <pb n="366"/> ask, as I had made no concession to him." "He would have gladly given
          you leave," said he: "indeed, consider that you have obtained it; for I will write and
          tell him, exactly as you like, that we have spoken on the subject. What does it matter to
          him, since you do not attend the senate, where you are? Nay, at this very moment you would
          not have damaged his cause in the least by having quitted Italy." In answer to this I said
          that I was looking out for some retired and solitary spot, chiefly because I still had
          lictors. He commended my design. "What do you say to this, then?" said I. "My course to
          Greece lies through your province, since the coast of the Mare Superum is guarded by
          troops." "Nothing I should like better," said he. On this subject he spoke at great length
          and in a very courteous tone. So then I have gained this much, that I can sail not only in
          safety, but even without concealment. All other subjects of discussion he put off till the
          next day; and, if any of them seem worth a letter, I will write and tell you. But there
          are some things which I omitted to ask him: whether Caesar intended to wait for an
          interregnum, or what he meant by saying, as he did, that he was offered the consulship,
          but refused it for the next year. And there are other points on which I will question him.
          To crown all he swore—as he usually makes no difficulty of doing—that Caesar must be very
          fond of me. "Why, what," continued he, "did Dolabella write to me?" "Pray tell me what."
          He then declared that Dolabella had written to say that, for having desired me to come to
          the city, Caesar had thanked him warmly, and not only expressed approbation, but joy. In
          short, I was relieved. For the suspicion of domestic treachery and of the conversation
          with Hirtius was removed. <note n="1" anchored="true">He thinks that if his nephew Quintus
            had, as he suspected, abused him to Caesar or his friend Hirtius, Caesar would not have

          how I encourage myself to believe what is in his favour! But need he have visited Hirtius?
          There is, no doubt, some motive or other; but I would wish it as slight as possible. And,
          after all, I am surprised at his not yet having returned. But we shall see about all this.

          the city now. <note n="1" anchored="true">The money difficulty. The <foreign xml:lang="la"

        <p> ABOUT my plans as a whole I have written to you, I think, before in sufficient detail.
          About the day of my departure I can state nothing for certain, except this: not before the
          new moon. Curio's conversation on the second day's inter-view amounted to much the same,
          except that he indicated still more candidly that he did not see what was to be the end of
          the business. <milestone unit="para"/>As to your charge to me to control Quintus ... 'tis
          a case of asking for Arcadia. <note n="1" anchored="true">You ask me to do what is very
            difficult. This is explained by Hdt. 1.66, where the Delphic oracle is said to have
            answered a Spartan envoy who asked for Arcadia: <quote>Arcady askest thou, truly a great
              boon, give it I will not.</quote>

          will omit nothing. And would that you—but I will not be over troublesome. I at once
          forwarded the packet to Vestorius, and, indeed, he was always asking for it. Vettienus was
          more obliging in what he said to you than in what he had written to me. But I cannot
          wonder enough at the man's carelessness. For Philotimus having told me that he could buy
          that lodge of Canuleius for 50 sestertia, and could get it for even less, if I asked
          Vettienus to act, I did ask the latter to obtain a deduction from that sum if he could. He
          promised to do so. He told me that he had bought it for 30 sestertia, and asked me to let
          him know to whom I wished it conveyed; saying that the day for payment was the 13th of
          November. I wrote back somewhat crossly, and yet with a familiar <pb n="370"/> jest. <note
            n="1" anchored="true">As Vettienus got the lodge for £240 instead of £450, it is not
            easy to see why Cicero was offended. At the end of Letter CCCXCV it appears that one
            offence was that he addressed the letter to "Cicero proconsul" instead of "<foreign
              xml:lang="la">imperator</foreign>." Another, perhaps, was something unceremonious in
            the style of the letter itself, or unbusinesslike in the arrangement for payment. The
            lodge purchased was one of those small houses of call (<foreign xml:lang="la"
              >deversoria</foreign>) which rich men purchased along the great high roads, in which
            to put up for the night, rather than burden their friends who might have villas in the
            neighbourhood (see vol. i., p. 256). Italy was not without inns, rather celebrated for
            goodness and cheapness (<bibl n="TLG543.1 2.15">Polyb. 2.15</bibl>), but men of high
            position seemed to think it undignified to use them. </note> For the present, as he is
          acting handsomely, I refrain from finding any fault with the man, and I have written to
          tell him that you have given me full information. Pray let me know about your journey,

        <p> CAEsAR imperator greets Cicero imperator. Although I had come to the conclusion that you
          were not likely to do anything unadvisedly or imprudently, yet, being made anxious by
          common report, I thought that I ought to write to you and to appeal to you, in the name of
          our mutual kindness, not to go anywhere now that fortune has declared in my favour, that
          you had not thought yourself bound to go even when it was still uncertain. For you will
          have at once committed a somewhat serious offence against our friendship, and have adopted
          a course far from beneficial to yourself: since you will make it clear that you have not
          followed fortune—for all the good luck has notoriously been on our side, all the bad on
          theirs-nor the merits of the cause, for they are the same now as when you judged it best
          not to assist at their deliberations: but you will shew that you have condemned some act
          of mine, and that is the heaviest <pb n="371"/> blow you can inflict on me. In the name of
          our friendship, I beg you not to do so. Finally, what can be more becoming to a good man,
          and a peaceable and quiet citizen, than to hold aloof from civil strife? It is a thing
          some would have been glad to do, <note n="1" anchored="true">He seems to mean himself.
          </note> but could not on account of the danger. For yourself, when you have satisfied

            active countenance. He appeals to his life as showing that he will keep his word to
            Cicero, and to this decision to allow of Cicero's neutrality as a proof of his

        <p> YES, I quite approve of your staying in Apulia and Sipontum, and of your avoiding
          committing yourself; and I do not think your case is on all fours with mine. Not but that
          in regard to the constitution the right course is the same for us both—but there is now no
          question of the constitution. It is a contest of rival kings, in which the more moderate
          king, and the more virtuous and clean-handed of the two, has been defeated, the one, too,
          whose defeat involves the necessary destruction of the very name of the Roman people:
          while, if he does conquer, he will use his victory after the manner and precedent of
          Sulla. <note n="1" anchored="true">That is, he will put to death the members of the
            popular party. Cicero has before expressed his horror of the violent language he bears
            is being used by Pompey's entourage. See, for instance, pp. 326, 334. </note> Therefore
          in this quarrel you must not openly profess adherence to either side, and must wait on
          events. My position, however, is different, because, being under the bond of an
          obligation, I cannot shew myself ungrateful, and yet do not meditate being at the seat of
          war, but at Malta or some similar retired place. "Do you do nothing to help the man," you
          will say, "to whom you do not wish to be ungrateful?" Nay, I think he would perhaps have
          been glad if I had done less. But as to this we shall see. Let me only get out of the
          country, and I have a better opportunity of doing so now that Dolabella is on the
          Adriatic, Curio in the Sicilian straits. However, I have had a certain revival of hope
          from the fact that Servius Sulpicius wishes an interview with me. I have sent my freedman
          Philotimus with a letter to him: if he chooses to play the man, we shall have a notable
          tête-à-tête: otherwise ... I shall be the same as ever. Curio has been staying with me:
          his idea is that Caesar is in low water from having offended the multitude: and he was
          nervous about going to Sicily, if Pompey should begin naval operations. <pb n="375"/>
          <milestone unit="para"/>I gave it to young Quintus when he returned! I perceive that it
          was a piece of avarice on his part, and a hope of a large bounty. This is a serious evil
          enough, but the crime which I feared I hope he did not commit. <note n="1" anchored="true"
            >I. e., denouncing his uncle to Caesar. </note> However, I think you are convinced that

          arrange as you think proper. I shall look on Epirus as at my service, but I seem destined

        <p> HAD I not been warmly attached to you—much more warmly, indeed, than you suppose—I
          should not have been alarmed at the rumour which has reached me about you, especially as I
          thought it was without foundation. But just because I am so exceedingly devoted to you, I
          cannot conceal the fact that even a report, however groundless, is a serious thing in my
          eyes. I cannot believe that you are about to cross the sea, considering how highly you
          value Dolabella and your dear Tullia, and how highly you are valued by me, to whom, by
          heaven, your rank and reputation are almost dearer than they are to yourself.
          Nevertheless, I did not think that it would be friendly in me not to be rendered anxious
          by the talk even of men of low character. And, indeed, I have been the more zealous,
          because I considered that I had thrust upon me a somewhat difficult part to play, owing to
          the misunderstanding between us, which was the result of jealousy on my part rather than
          of any wrong done me by you. <note n="1" anchored="true">We have no references in previous
            letters to any misunderstanding between Antony and Cicero, but in the second Philippic,
              <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 2.48">2, 48, 49, Cicero says that Antony was an intimate friend of
              P. Clodius in <date when="-0058">B.C. 58</date>, that he (Cicero) had interfered to
              break off his connexion with the younger Curio, and had a controversy with him in
              regard to a lawsuit with one Sicca, a freedman of Antony's. Again, in <date
                when="-0053">B.C. 53</date>, they had both been candidates for the augurship, though
              Antony retired from the canvass. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">*zhlotupi/a</foreign> may
              refer either to Curio or the augurship. Antony was now a tribune, but had been left in
              charge of Italy with the rank of propraetor.</bibl>
          </note> For I want to convince you that no one is dearer to me than you are, except my
          Caesar, and that my conviction at the same time is that Caesar gives M. Cicero a very high
          place among his friends. Wherefore, my dear Cicero, I beg you not to take any compromising
          step; and not to place any reliance on the man who, to do you a <pb n="379"/> favour,
          first inflicted an injury upon you; and, on the other hand, not to fly from one who, even
          supposing he loses all affection for you— which is impossible—will yet desire your safety
          and your highest honour. I have taken pains to send my most intimate friend Calpurnius

        <p> THE state of affairs itself, as well as your remark and my own observation, make it
          clear that the time has come to put an end to our correspondence on subjects which it
          would be dangerous to have intercepted. But as my dear Tullia keeps writing to me begging
          me to wait and see how things go in Spain, and always adds that this is your opinion also,
          and since I have gathered this also from your own letter, I do not think it out of place
          to write and tell you what I think on that point. This advice of yours would be prudent,
          as it seems to me, only if I intended to shape my course of policy in accordance with the
          result of the Spanish affair, which is impossible. For it is inevitable either that
          Caesar—what I should like best—is driven from Spain, or that the campaign there will be a
          protracted one, or (as he seems to feel certain) that he gets Spain into his hands. If he
          is driven out, how can I then join Pompey with any grace or honour, when I should think
          even Curio himself would desert to him? If, again, the war is protracted, what am I to
          wait for, and how long? The only alternative is, if we are beaten in Spain, to keep quiet.
          My view is quite the other way. For I think myself more bound to abandon Caesar when he is
          victorious than when he is beaten, and not more when his success is still <pb n="380"/>
          uncertain, than when he is quite sure of it. <note n="1" anchored="true">Reading, with
            Schütz, <foreign xml:lang="la">nec dubitantem</foreign>, etc., for <foreign
              xml:lang="la">et</foreign>. </note> For, if Caesar conquers, I foresee massacre, an
          attack on private wealth, a recall of exiles, repudiation of debts, promotion to office of
          the lowest dregs, and a despotism intolerable, I don't say to any Roman, but even to a
          Persian. Will it be possible for my indignation to remain silent? Will my eyes be able to
          endure the sight of myself delivering my vote by the side of Gabinius—or, in fact, of his
          being called on before me? Of your client Sext. Clodius <note n="2" anchored="true">Sex.
            Clodius was one of the followers of P. Clodius, and had been condemned under the
              <foreign xml:lang="la">lex</foreign> Pompeia after the trial of <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Milo</foreign>. See 2 Phil. 8. </note> in attendance? Of C. Ateius's client
          Plaguleius? And so on with the whole list. But why collect the names of my opponents, when
          I shall be unable to see in the senate-house without pain my friends whom I have defended,
          or to associate with them without dishonour. <note n="3" anchored="true">Because, though
            they were his friends, and had been defended by him, they had been legally condemned,
            and their recall by Caesar's bare authority would be looked upon as offensive to a
            friend of the constitution. </note> Nay, what if I am not even sure that I shall be
          allowed to come? His friends write me word that he is by no means satisfied with my
          conduct in not having appeared in the senate. Am I, nevertheless, to think about making
          advances to him with a risk to myself, after refusing to be united to him when it was to
          my advantage? Besides, observe that the decision of the whole controversy does not depend
          on Spain, unless you really think that Pompey will throw down his arms if that is lost! On
          the contrary, his view is entirely that of Themistocles: for he holds that the master of
          the sea must inevitably be master of the empire. Accordingly, his object has never been to
          retain Spain for its own sake: the equipment of a fleet has always been his first care. He
          will take to the sea, therefore, as soon as the season permits, with an enormous fleet,
          and will approach the shores of Italy: and what then will be our position who remain there
          doing nothing? It will be impossible for us to be any longer neutral. Shall we resist the
          fleet then? What could be a greater crime, or even so great? In fact, what could be more
          ignominious? I did not shrink from opposing Caesar when I was isolated: shall I do <pb
            n="381"/> so now with the support of Pompey and the rest of the nobles? <note n="1"
            anchored="true">The text of this sentence is hopelessly corrupt. But the general sense
            is, I think, something like what I have given. Cicero's argument is: 'The only motive
            for putting oneself in opposition to Pompey's fleet must be fear of Caesar. Now I shewed
            when I was all alone at <foreign xml:lang="la">Formiae</foreign> that I would not give
            in to him: shall I do so now that there are Pompey and the rest to support me?" </note>
          If, however, putting the question of duty aside, I must take account of danger: it is, if
          I do wrong, that there is danger from these last, from him, if I do right: nor in such
          miserable circumstances can any policy be discovered so free from danger, as to make me
          doubt that I should shun doing disgracefully, when it is dangerous, what I should have
          shunned doing, even had it been safe. "Not if I had crossed the sea along with Pompey?"
          That was impossible in any case: you have only to count the days. But all the same—for let
          me confess the truth (I do not even atttempt concealment), supposing it possible—I was
          mistaken in a point in which, perhaps, I ought not to have been mistaken: I thought that
          there would be a reconciliation, and in that case I did not want to have Caesar incensed
          with me, while he was friends with Pompey. <note n="2" anchored="true">Cicero here lets
            out his true motives. The plea of time and opportunity he feels to be hollow. His real
            motive was the uncertainty as to which was the safer course, while he was also no doubt
            torn by the conviction that the truly loyal side was that of Pompey. </note> For I had
          learnt to see how exactly alike they were. It was from dread of this that I drifted into
          this waiting policy. But now I have everything to gain by hastening, everything to lose by
          delay. And, nevertheless, my dear Atticus, there are auguries also which incite me to
          action with a certain hope, and no doubtful one, auguries not such as our college derives

          all the points, which no one sees more clearly than yourself. Still, put them before your
          eyes: you will at once understand that this despotism can scarcely last six months. If I
          turn out to be mistaken in this, I will bear it, as many most illustrious men, eminent in
          the state, have borne it, unless you should actually think that I prefer the fate of
          Sardanapalus—to die in his own bed, rather than in an exile, as was the fate of
          Themistocles: who though he had been—in the words of Thucydides <note n="3"

          the shrewdest at conjecturing what was to happen," yet fell into misfortunes which he
          would have avoided, if nothing had ever escaped him. Though he was a man, as the same
          writer says, "who, however obscure the subject, saw the better and the worse course more
          clearly than anyone, yet did not see how to avoid the jealousy of the Lacedaemonians, nor
          of his own fellow citizens, nor what promise to make to Artaxerxes. Nor would that night

            to assassination at the bands of <foreign xml:lang="la">Carbo</foreign>, to which belief
            Cicero often refers. By the Sullanus dies Cicero seems to mean Sulla's first march upon
            Rome, when Marius fled and went into exile. </note> nor that day of Sulla's triumph so
          disastrous to Gaius Marius, the craftiest of men, if neither of them had ever been
          mistaken. However, I encourage myself by that prophetic utterance (of Plato) which I
          mentioned. I am not deceived about it, nor will it happen otherwise. Fall he must, either
          by the hands of his opponents or by his own, who, indeed, is his own most <pb n="383"/>
          dangerous enemy. I only hope it may happen while we are still alive. Yet it is time for us
          to be thinking of that continuous life of the future, not of this brief span of our own.
            <note n="1" anchored="true">Cicero is thinking, not of a future life—in the Christian

          happens to me before that occurs, it will not have made much difference to me whether I
          live to see it, or have seen it long before. That being so, I must not allow myself to
          submit to men, against whom the senate armed me with authority "to see that the Republic
          took no harm." <milestone unit="para"/>All my interests have been confided to you, though
          they need no recommendation of mine, considering your affection for me. Nor, by Hercules,
          can I hit upon anything to write: for I am sitting waiting "sailing orders." Yet I never
          felt more bound to tell you anything than that none of all the delightful services you
          have done has been more grateful to my feelings, than your most delicate and careful
          attentions to my Tullia. She has herself been exceedingly charmed with them—as I have been
          no less. What high qualities she has shewn! How admirably she faces the public disaster!
          How admirably her domestic difficulties! What spirit she has displayed in the matter of my
          departure! She loves me dearly, she has the deepest sympathy with my feelings—yet she will
          have me act rightly and preserve my reputation. But don't let me enlarge too much on this
          theme, lest I should at this juncture rouse my own self-pity. If you get any surer
          intelligence about Spain, or anything else, pray write and tell me while I am still in the
          country; and, perhaps, at the moment of my departure I shall send you some intelligence,
          the more so that Tullia thinks that you are at present not thinking of leaving Italy. I
          must put before Antony, as I did before Curio, my wish to reside in Malta, and my
          determination not to take part in this civil war. I only hope I may find him as
          complaisant and good-natured to me as I did Curio. He is said to be intending to come to

        <p> THE arrival of Philotimus—why, what a fellow! how insipid! what lies he keeps telling
          for Pompey !-frightened all my party to death. For myself, I have become hardened. None of
          my party doubted that Caesar had curtailed his marches: according to him, he is absolutely
          flying. None doubted Petreius having effected a junction with Afranius: he brings no
          tidings of the kind. In short, they have also been convinced of this—that Pompey, at the
          head of a large force, had marched into Germany by way of Illyricum; for that was
          announced on good authority. Well, then, I must make for Malta, I think, until we get
          fresh news from Spain. This, indeed, I almost think from Caesar's own letter that I may do
          with his approval: for he says that I cannot take a more honourable or safer course than
          to abstain from the combat altogether. You will say, "What has become, then, of that
          resolution of yours, which you described in your last?" It is here, and still unchanged.
          But would that I had to decide for my own person only! The tears of my family at times
          weaken my resolution, who beseech me to wait for the result in Spain. Caelius's letter,
          indeed, which was expressed in moving terms, containing an identical appeal—that I would
          not so rashly abandon my property, my only son, and all my family—our boys read with
          floods of tears. Though my own son is, in fact, the braver of the two, and for that very
          reason affects me more violently. His only anxiety is for my dignity. To Malta, then, and
          thence wherever it shall seem good! However, even now pray write something, and especially
          if there is any news from Afranius. On my part, if I have any conversation with Antony, I
          will write and tell you the result. Yet I will be cautious as to trusting him, as you warn
          me. For the policy of entire concealment is difficult, and dangerous into the bargain. I
          intend to wait for <pb n="385"/> Servius Sulpicius till the 15th; both Postumia and his
          son Servius urge me to do so. I am glad your quartan ague is better. I send you also a
          copy of Caelius's letter. </p>

        <p> How blind of me not to have seen this before! I send you Antony's letter. After I had
          written again and again to say that I was not entertaining any plans against Caesar, that
          I remembered my son-in-law, remembered our friendship, that, if I had been otherwise
          minded, I might have been with Pompey, but that, as I had to my disgust to move about
          accompanied by lictors, I wished to be away from Italy, but had not made up my mind even
          to that—see what an admonitory tone <note n="2" anchored="true">Antony, as propraetor in
            charge of Italy, was for the moment able to make things disagreeable for Cicero if he
            chose. </note> he adopts in reply! <quote>Your decision is perfectly right. For the man
            who wishes to be neutral remains in the country: he who leaves it appears to express a

            particular person <pb n="389"/> has the right to go or not. Caesar has assigned me my
            rôle, which is that I should not allow anyone at all to quit Italy. Therefore it matters
            little that I approve your idea in the present instance, since I have, nevertheless, no
            power to grant you any exemption. My opinion is that you should communicate with Caesar
            direct and ask his leave. I feel no doubt that you will obtain it, especially as you
            promise that you will take our friendship into consideration.</quote> There is a Laconic

          case I will wait for the man himself. He is to arrive on the 3rd, that is, today.
          Tomorrow, therefore, he will perhaps come to see me. I will test him: I will listen to
          what he has to say: I will declare loudly that I am in no hurry, that I will communicate
          with Caesar. I will lie perdu somewhere with the smallest number of attendants possible:
          at any rate, let these men be ever so reluctant to allow it, from this country I
            <emph>will</emph> wing my way, and oh that it might be to Curio! <note n="2"
            anchored="true">To Sicily, on his way to Malta. </note> Don't mistake what I say.
          Something worthy of me shall be effected. This is a new and heavy anxiety: I am much
          distressed by your strangury. Take medical advice, I beseech you, whilst it is in an early
          stage. I am delighted with your letter about the Massilians. <note n="3" anchored="true"

          know if you get any news. I should have liked to have Ocella with me, if I could manage it
          without any concealment; and I had extracted from Curio a promise that I should. Here I am
          waiting for Servius Sulpicius, for I am requested to do so by his wife and son, and I
          think it is necessary to see him. Antony, for his part, is carrying about Cytheris with
          him with his sedan open, as a second wife. <note n="4" anchored="true">Antony was married
            to his cousin <foreign xml:lang="la">Antonia</foreign>, whom he afterwards divorced. He
            did not marry Fulvia—who was at this time the wife of Curio—for at least four years
            afterwards. <foreign xml:lang="la">Cytheris</foreign> was an actress, and is said by
            Servius (on Virgil, Eclog. x.) to have been the <foreign xml:lang="la">Lycoris</foreign>

          are being done to death: and doubt, if you can, that if Caesar returns victorious, he will
          use the sword. For my part, I will withdraw myself in a cock-boat, if I can't get a ship,
          from their parricidal proceedings. But I shall know more when I have had my interview with
          him. Our young nephew I cannot help loving, but I see clearly that he does not love me. I
          never saw a case of such want of principle, of such aversion to his own relations, and of
          such brooding over mysterious designs. What an overpowering number of anxieties! But it
          will be my care, as it is now, to correct him. His natural abilities are admirable: it is
          his character that wants attention. </p>

        <p> AFTER I had sealed my previous packet, I changed my mind about intrusting it to the man
          to whom I had intended doing so, because he was a stranger. Accordingly, it was not
          despatched the same day. Meanwhile Philotimus arrived and delivered me a letter from you.
          What you say in it about my brother does not, indeed, shew as much firmness on his part as
          one could wish, yet it does not imply any <foreign xml:lang="fr">arrière pensée</foreign>,
          any treachery, or any obstinate aversion from good, nothing that you cannot turn in any
          direction you please in one conversation. In short, he holds all his family in great
          affection-even those with whom he is too often angry—me he loves more dearly than himself.
          His having written about his boy in one tone to you, and in another to the boy's mother, I
          see no reason to blame. I am vexed at what you say about the journey and your sister, and
          the more so that the state of my affairs is such that I can apply no remedy to those
          things. For I certainly would have done so. But you see my unfortunate position and the
          desperate state of my affairs. His financial <pb n="391"/> position is not of such a
          nature—for I hear frequently from him personally—as to prevent his being eager to repay
          you, and being really anxious on that point. But if such a man as Q. Axius, because I am
          thus in exile, does not pay me thirteen sestertia, which I lent his son, and pleads the
          hardness of the times, if Lepta and everybody else do the same, it is wont to make me feel
          some surprise when he tells me that he is being pressed for an insignificant sum of twenty
          sestertia. For you, of course, see what his difficulties are. However, he is directing the
          money to be paid in any case to your order. Do you think him slow or close in business of
          that kind? No one is less so. Enough about my brother. As for his son: his father has
          always spoilt him, but his indulgence is not responsible for his being untruthful, or
          grasping, or wanting in affection for his family, though it perhaps does make him
          headstrong and self-willed, as well as aggressive. Accordingly, these latter also are
          traits in his character, which are the results of over-indulgence, but they are
          pardonable—we must admit-considering what young men are nowadays. Those traits, however,
          which to me, at least, who love him, are more distressing than the very evils surrounding
          us, do not arise from excessive compliance on my part: for they have roots of their own,
          which, however, I would assuredly have torn up, had I been allowed to do so. But my
          circumstances are such that I must put up with anything. My own son I keep under control
          without difficulty. He is the most tractable boy possible; but my remorseful pity for him
          makes me less determined in politics, and the more he desires me to be staunch, the more I
          fear turning out a cruel father to him. <milestone unit="para"/>However, Antony arrived
          yesterday in the evening. Presently perhaps he will call on me, or, maybe, will not take
          even that trouble, since he has written to say what it is his pleasure should be done. But
          you shall know the result at once. Secrecy is my only course now. What can I do about the
          boys? Shall I trust them to a small vessel? What sort of courage do you think I shall have
          in the voyage? Why, I remember while sailing in that open Rhodian vessel in the summer how
          anxious I was: what do you think will be the case in a small despatch boat in the
          dangerous season of the year? Misery on every <pb n="392"/> side! Trebatius is with me, a
          right good man and good citizen. What frightful news he brings me, good heavens! Is even
          Balbus thinking, then, of an entrée into the senate? But I will give him a letter himself
          for you tomorrow. Yes, I believe Vettienus is, as you say, friendly to me. I answered him
          with rather a peppery jest, because he wrote to me somewhat abruptly about providing for
          payment of the money. Pray smooth him down, if he took it less good-temperedly than one
          could wish. I addressed him as monetalis, <note n="1" anchored="true">Cicero, in jest,
            gives him the title of triumvir <foreign xml:lang="la">monetalis</foreign>, "a
            commissioner of the mint," as though he "coined money" out of his debtors. Or perhaps he
            was really in that office, the title of which it was not usual to append to letters.
            Cicero was apparently annoyed at not being addressed as <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >imperator</foreign>, as was usual for a man who had received that title from his
            soldiers, while still retaining his provincial imperium This Caesar is always careful to
            add. Or it may have been unusual, and therefore rather discourteous, to use such titles
            at all in a business letter. Is there, perhaps, a pun on <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >moneo</foreign>, as the dunning letter "reminded" Cicero of his obligations? For the
            transaction see Letter CCCLXXXIII. </note> because he addressed me as proconsul. But as
          he is a good fellow and attached to me, let me keep my affection for him too. Farewell.

        <p> WHAT is to become of me? Who is there, I don't say more unfortunate, but in a more
          degraded position? Antony says that he has received express orders about me, and,
          nevertheless, he has as yet not been to see me, but told Trebatius this fact. What am I to
          do now? Nothing succeeds with me, and the plans which I form with the greatest care are
          just those which fail in the most shocking manner. Why, I thought when I had got Curio' s
          consent, that I had succeeded entirely. He had written about me to Hortensius. Reginus was
          wholly in my interests. <note n="2" anchored="true">Reginus had command of ships in the
            Tuscan Sea, and Cicero hoped would allow of his voyage to Sicily, where Curio was.
          </note> I <pb n="393"/> never imagined that Antony would have anything to do with the
          western sea. Which way am I to turn now? I am watched on every side. But enough of tears!
          Well, then, I must steal away and creep stealthily into some merchant vessel: I must not
          expose myself to the suspicion of having connived at my being prevented from going. I must
          make for Sicily. If I once get there, I shall then have a greater step in my power. If
          things would only go as they should in Spain! However, I only hope the news about Sicily
          may prove true: but as yet we have had no luck. The Sicilians are said to have rallied
          round Cato, to have begged him to hold out, making all manner of promises. Affected by
          this, he is said to have begun holding a levy. <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Cato</foreign> as a matter of fact abandoned Sicily to Curio
            without a blow. A specimen of the idle rumours afloat at such a time. </note> I don't
          believe it, however distinguished the authority! I am aware that this province was at
          least capable of being held. However, we shall presently have news from Spain. We have C.
          Marcellus here, who is entertaining the same thoughts as myself, either sincerely, or
          making a good pretence of doing so. I have not, however, seen him personally, but have
          been told this by one of his most intimate friends. Pray send me any news you have: if I
          take any active step, I will at once let you know. I will treat young Quintus with more
          strictness. Would that I could do any good! However, pray some time or other tear up the
          letters in which I have written about him in a tone of severity, for fear of anything
          getting out at any time. I will do the same with yours. <milestone unit="para"/>I am still

          come to grief in the future. <pb n="394"/> Well, you bid me make provision for my journey.
          What am I to provide? The possible accidents cover so wide a field, that, if I shrink from
          them, I must remain stationary with dishonour and sorrow; if I pay no heed to them, there
          is danger of my falling into the hands of unprincipled men. Only see in what a miserable
          position I am! At times I think that I should absolutely desire to receive some injury,
          however mortifying, from the Caesarians, to convince people that I have become an object
          of hatred to the tyrant. But if the voyage, on which I set my hopes, had been open to me,
          I would have certainly effected something, as you wish and advise, to justify my delay.
          But the closeness of the watch set upon me is surprising, and even Curio himself is an
          object of suspicion. So the two alternatives are to take the high hand, or to act
          secretly. If the former, I must have favourable weather. The latter means concealment from
          those men: <note n="1" anchored="true">The text here is very corrupt. The translation is
            only conjectural. I think the words must somehow refer to his voyage, not to his general
            policy. See p. 398. </note> and if any contretemps occurs in doing that, you must see in
          what an undignified position I shall be. I am at the mercy of circumstances, and must not
          shrink from a somewhat bold course. I often think of Caelius, <note n="2" anchored="true"
            >It is quite uncertain to whom this refers. It is suggested that it has reference to one
            of the three leaders of armies against <foreign xml:lang="la">Sulla</foreign> mentioned
            by Plutarch (Pomp. vii.); but most texts there have Cloelius (<foreign xml:lang="grc"
              >*kloi/lios</foreign>). Cicero recurs again several times in other letters of this
            period to him, and he must, therefore, whoever he was, have shewn some intention of
            resisting usurpation in arms. We shall, however, find Cicero declining to avail himself
            of armed assistance offered him at Pompeii. </note> and, if ever I have the like
          opportunity, I will not let it slip. I hope Spain is safe. The action of the Massilians is
          at once glorious in itself, and a proof to me that things are going well in Spain. They
          would not have been so bold, if it had been otherwise: and they would be sure to know, for
          they are close at hand as well as careful. <note n="3" anchored="true">Marseilles received
            the senatorial governor of <foreign xml:lang="la">Gallia</foreign>, Ahenobarbus, and
            closed its gates to Caesar (see p. 389). Cicero seems not to know the facts accurately
            as yet, but to imagine that the prolonged resistance of Marseilles was in consequence of
            some failure of Caesar's in Spain. </note> Again, I am glad of your remark as to the
          popular dislike expressed in the theatre. Even these legions, which he took over in <pb
            n="395"/> Italy, I can see are very much disaffected to him. However, he has no worse
          enemy than himself. I quite agree with your dread that he may run amuck. If he once feels
          desperate, he certainly will do so. All the more reason for effecting something in the
          spirit (and, I hope, with better fortune) of Caelius. But one thing at a time: whatever it
          may be, you shall at once know all about it. I will furnish young Quintus with supplies,
          as you request, and will undertake the Arcadian task, or the whole Peloponnesus, if you
          like. <note n="1" anchored="true">Explained by Letter CCCLXXXIII, p. 369, where Cicero
            says that Atticus's request to him to manage young Quintus was as unreasonable as the
            Spartan's asking for Arcadia. </note> Yes: he has ability, if he had but character.

        <p> YOUR letter was very gratifying to my Tullia, and, by Hercules, to me also. A letter
          from you always brings a ray of hope. Pray write, therefore, and if you can suggest
          anything hopeful, don't omit to do so. No, don't be afraid of Antony's lions. <note n="4"
            anchored="true">The form of the sentence shews that this is an answer to some remark of
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign>, who had heard the common gossip of Antony's
            having a chanot drawn by lions. It is placed at a later date by Plutarch (Ant. ix.), but
            this passage seems to shew that the story belongs to his tribuneship, when he had
            propraetorian powers in Italy ftom Caesar. Pliny (<bibl n="Plin. Nat. 8.55">Plin. N.H.
              8.55</bibl>), however, assigns it to the period after the battle of <foreign

          statesman's conduct of affairs! He sent round a letter summoning ten leading men and the
          quatttuorviri from the muncipal towns. They came to his villa in the morning. In the first
          place, he remained asleep till nine <pb n="396"/> o'clock. Then on the announcement that
          the men had arrived from Naples and Cumae—for Caesar is angry with these towns—he ordered
          them to come again next day: he wanted to take a bath and to cure a looseness of the
          bowels. <note n="1" anchored="true">Cicero remarks on Antony's rudeness to the people of

          however, he purposes crossing to Aenaria. He intends promising the exiles there that they
          shall be recalled. <milestone unit="para"/>But enough of that. To return to ourselves: I
          have received a letter from Q. Axius. Thanks, about Tiro. Vettienus is a good fellow. I
          have repaid Vestorius. Servius is said to have stopped at Minturnae on the 6th of May,
          today he is to stop with C. Marcellus in his villa at Liternum. Early tomorrow, therefore,
          he will see me and will give me a theme for a letter to you. For at the present moment I
          can't think of anything to write to you about. One thing does surprise me, that Antony has
          not sent me even a message, especially as he has paid a great deal of attention to me. No
          doubt he is charged with some still sterner order as to me. He doesn't wish to say "No" to
          me face to face. I never meant to ask him the favour, nor, if he had granted it, should I
          have trusted his word. However, I will think out some plan. Please tell me any news from
          the Spains: for by this time it will be possible for some to be heard: and everybody's
          idea is that, if all is well there, there will be no more trouble. I, however, don't
          regard our cause as won if we retain them, nor utterly desperate if we lose them. Silius
          and Ocella and the rest, I suppose, are detained. I observe that you also are hindered by
          Curtius, <note n="2" anchored="true">Apparently M. Curtius Postumus, whom we heard of
            before as a Caesarian, and expecting priestly office (p. 388). He is trying (by

            Tyrrell, however, supposes it to be some unknown debtor of <foreign xml:lang="la"

        <p> WHAT a miserable state of existence! To be so long in fear is a greater evil than the
          very thing which is feared. Servius having arrived, as I told you before, on the 15th of
          May came to see me next day. Not to keep you in suspense, we arrived at no conclusion as
          to our policy. I never saw anybody so completely beside himself with fear; and yet, by
          Hercules, he feared nothing that was not a legitimate object of fear: "Pompey was angry
          with him, Caesar no friend to him: the victory of either one or the other was alarming,
          both because of the cruel nature of the one, the unscrupulousness of the other, and also
          because of the financial embarrassment of both, which could be relieved from no source
          except that of the property of private persons." And these remarks were accompanied with
          such floods of tears, that I wondered they had not run dry from such protracted misery.
          For my part, even the inflammation of the eyes, which prevents my writing to you with my
          own hand, is not accompanied with a single tear, but is very often troublesome from
          keeping me awake. Wherefore any consolations you can think of collect and write, not from
          philosophy and books—for of that I have a stock at home, though somehow or other the
          medicine is less potent than the disease: rather search for such news as that about Spain
          or Marseilles. Servius, indeed, brings a very satisfactory report about them, and also
          tells me that there is good authority for the story of the two legions. That is the sort
          of news, if you have any, and more like it. And, indeed, something must be heard before
          many days are over. <milestone unit="para"/>But I return to Servius. We in the end
          adjourned our conversation to the next day: but he is slow about leaving Italy. "He would
          much rather die in his own bed, whatever is to happen." He feels a painful hesitation as
          to his <pb n="398"/> son's service at Brundisium. <note n="1" anchored="true">See p. 356.
          </note> There was one thing that he declared with the utmost determination: if the
          condemned men were restored, he would go into exile. To this I replied that "that would
          certainly take place; and what was already being done was no less offensive," and I
          mentioned a number of instances. However, these arguments did not increase his resolution,
          only his terror: so that I think he is rather to be kept in the dark about my plan, than
          invited to adopt the same. So there is not much to be got from him. In obedience to your
          hint I will turn my thoughts to Caelius. </p>

        <p> WHILST Servius was still with me, Cephalio arrived with your letter of the 10th, which
          inspired me with a strong hope of a change for the better in regard to the eight cohorts;
          for those, too, which are stationed in these parts are said to be wavering. On the same
          day Funisulanus brought me a letter from you, in which the same news was repeated still
          more positively. I gave him full satisfaction as to his own business, ascribing the full
          credit to you. Up to this time I have had reason to be discontented with him, for he owes
          me a large sum of money and is not considered to be well off. Now he says he will pay me:
          that a man to whom he had lent money was slow in paying; that, if you have in your hands
          what his debtor has paid, you are to give it to letter-carriers for me. The amount you
          will learn from Philotimus's man Eros. But let us return to more important matters. The
          Caelian plan, which is your idea, is coming to fruition. Accordingly, I am distracted as
          to whether to wait for a favourable wind. What is wanted is a standard: men will flock to
          it. I quite agree with your advice to set <pb n="399"/> out openly, and so I think I shall
          start. Meanwhile, however, I am awaiting a letter from you. Servius's advice doesn't ease
          matters at all. Every kind of objection is obtruded in every opinion he utters. I never
          knew anyone more timid except Gaius Marcellus, <note n="1" anchored="true">C. Claudius
            Marcellus, the <foreign xml:lang="la">consul</foreign> of <date when="-0050">B.C.
              50</date>, not the C. Claudius <foreign xml:lang="la">Marce1lus, consul</foreign>
            <date when="-0049">B.C. 49</date>. The latter was already with Pompey. </note> who is
          sorry that he was ever consul. What a mean fellow! why, he is even said to have encouraged
          Antony to prevent my departure, in order, I suppose, to stay himself with greater decency.
          Antony, however, started for Capua on the 10th. He sent me a message to say that he had
          been deterred by a feeling of shame from calling on me, because he thought that I was
          angry with him. So I shall go, and in the way, too, which you think right, unless some
          hope shall have been meanwhile presented to me of undertaking some still more important
          part. <note n="2" anchored="true">He seems to mean, being deputed to Caesar or Pompey to
            endeavour to make peace. </note> But that will scarcely be the case so soon. Alienus the
          praetor, however, thinks that some one of his colleagues would do it, if I don't. Anyone
          you please, so long as it is some one. <milestone unit="para"/>In regard to your sister, I
          commend you. As to the young Quintus, I am doing all I can. I hope things are better. As
          to my brother Quintus, let me tell you that he is in considerable anxiety about raising
          money to pay his debt, but as yet has squeezed nothing out of L. Egnatius. Axius is modest
          about the twelve sestertia! For he repeatedly put in his letter a request that I would pay
          Gallius whatever he wanted. Could I have done otherwise, if he had not mentioned it? And,
          in fact, I often promised: but he wanted that round sum promptly. They should have rather
          come to my assistance at this time of difficulty, heaven confound them! However, more of
          this another time. I am very glad that you, and Pilia too, are relieved of your quartan
          ague. Whilst bread and other stores are being got on board, I intend to make an excursion
          to my Pompeian villa. Please thank Vettienus for his kindness. If you can find anyone to
          bring it, send me a letter before I leave the country. <pb n="400"/>

        <p> I HAD just despatched a letter to you on a variety of subjects, when Dionysius arrived
          at my house very early in the morning. I would not only have shewn myself placable to him,
          but would have pardoned him altogether, had he arrived in the frame of mind described by
          you. For in your letter received at Arpinum you said that he was coming and was prepared
          to do whatever I wished. For my part, I wished, or rather desired, that he should stay
          with me: and it was because, on his coming to my Formian villa, he had refused point blank
          to do so, that I used to write to you somewhat sharply about him. Well, he said very
          little, but the upshot of his remarks was that I must excuse him, that his private affairs
          prevented his going with me. I answered shortly: I felt much pained: I quite understood
          that my position roused his contempt. You will perhaps be surprised, but I assure you that
          I feel this to be among the heaviest blows which this crisis has inflicted upon me. I hope
          he may be loyal to you: that is equivalent to wishing you to remain prosperous: he will be
          so, just as long as you are. <milestone unit="para"/>I hope my design will be free of all
          risk: for, on the one hand, I have kept it dark; and, on the other, I shall not, I think,
          be very closely watched. May I only have a voyage such as I wish! For all the rest— as
          far, that is, as they can be provided for by prudence-measures shall be taken. Pray, as
          long as I am in the country, write and tell me not only anything you know or have heard,
          but also what you foresee will happen. Cato, who might have held Sicily without any
          trouble-and, if he had held it, all loyalists would have joined him— sailed from Syracuse
          on the 23rd of April, as Curio has written to tell me. I only hope, as the phrase is, that
          Cotta may hold Sardinia; for there is rumour going about. Oh, if that were to be so, what
          a stigma on Cato! In order to allay suspicion of my leaving the country, or of what I <pb
            n="401"/> am thinking of doing, I started for my Pompeian villa on the 12th of May, with
          a view of staying there, while the necessary preparations for my voyage were being made.
          On my arrival at my villa people came to see me: "The centurions of the three cohorts
          stationed at Pompeii"—this is what our friend Ninnius <note n="1" anchored="true">L.
            Ninnius Quadratus, tribune in <date when="-0057">B.C. 57</date> and a supporter of
            Cicero. </note> reported to me—"wished to visit me the next day: they were desirous of
          putting themselves and the town in my hands." I, however, I can tell you, was off from my
          villa next morning bef6re daybreak, to prevent them having any opportunity of seeing me at
          all. For what was the good of three cohorts? Or even if there were more, what equipment
          had they? I thought, indeed, of those exploits of Caelius, <note n="2" anchored="true">See
            pp. 394, 398. </note> which I found mentioned in your letter received as soon as I
          arrived at my Cuman villa, which I did on the same day: yet at the same time it might have
          been a trap to catch me. <note n="3" anchored="true">A ruse of some of his enemies to make
            him commit himself against Caesar, and so compel Caesar to treat him with severity.
          </note> I therefore removed all suspicion. But while I was on my return journey,
          Hortensius had arrived and had turned out of his road to call on Terentia, and used very
          courteous expressions about me. However, I believe I shall see him; for he has sent a
          servant to tell me that he is coming to my house. This is better behaviour than that of my
          fellow augur Antony, among whose lictors an actress is riding in a sedan. As you are free
          of your quartan ague, and have not only got rid of your new disease, but also of your
          cold, be sure you present yourself before me in Greece full of vigour, and meanwhile let
          me have something by way of a letter. </p>

        <p> ON the 14th Hortensius came to call on me after I had written my letter. I only wish the
          rest of his conduct had <pb n="402"/> been the same. You could hardly conceive such
          épanouissement! I mean, I can tell you, to make use of it. <note n="1" anchored="true"

            disagreeable, prevent Cicero's voyage. His wild conduct and character were described in
            Letter CCLXIII, which accounts for Cicero's relief at finding him a little more decent
            in conduct than Antony, as referred to in the last letter. </note> Then came Serapion
          with your letter, before opening which I remarked to him that you had written to me about
          him before, as you had done. Then, after opening the letter, I told him the rest of your
          compliment to the last syllable: and, by Hercules, I esteem him to be a good, learned, and
          honest man. And, what is more, I think of using his ship and taking him with me on my

          extent, but enough to prevent my writing. I am glad that your health is re-established,
          both from your old complaint and your more recent troubles. I could wish I had Ocella with
          me. For I think the weather here is going to be slightly calmer. At present the equinox is
          delaying us, which has been very stormy. After that, if there is a brisk wind, <note n="2"

          you were thinking of leaving the country, and since I had been told that no one could do
          so without one, I thought, of course, that you had one, and also because you had taken out
          a passport for the boys. That was the ground of my belief, and, nevertheless, I wish you
          would write and tell me what you are thinking of doing, and above all what news is now

        <p> My Tullia was confined on the 19th of May—a boy, a seven months' child. I have reason to
          be thankful that she had a good delivery. The child itself is a poor little weakling. An
          astonishingly dead calm has as yet kept me from starting, and has been a greater
          impediment than the watch kept upon me. For all that talk of Hortensius was mere
          persiflage. The truth will turn out to be this: that most dissolute of men has been
          corrupted by his freedman Salvius. <note n="1" anchored="true">The text of these sentences
            is doubtful. </note> Accordingly, henceforth I shall not write and tell you what I am
          going to do, but only what I have done. For all the eavesdroppers of Corycus <note n="2"
            anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">*kwrukai=oi</foreign> became a proverbial term for spies or
            eavesdroppers, says <foreign xml:lang="la">Stephanos</foreign> of Byzantium, from the
            piratic folk of Corycus in lonia, who listened for the arrival of merchant vessels, in
            order to plunder them: or, as others explain, because they spied out the merchant
            vessels and gave information to the pirates. </note> seem to be listening to what I say.
          Do you, however, I beg, continue to tell me any news there are of Spain, or anything else;
          but don't expect a letter from me, except when I have arrived at my wished-for
          destination, or in case I can send anything during my voyage. Even this I write with fear
          and trembling: so slowly and heavily does everything drag on. The foundation was badly
          laid, the rest follows suit. I am now making for Formiae: perhaps the Furies will follow
          me there too. <note n="3" anchored="true">He may allude to the entrance to the infernal
            regions near Lake Avernus, not far from Cumae. He more than once alludes to the Furies
            in connexion with civil strife, e.g., <bibl n="Cic. Sul. 76">pro Sulla, 76</bibl>.
          </note> However, to judge from Balbus's conversation with you, my idea of Malta does not
          find favour. Can you doubt, therefore, that he regards me as an enemy? I have, to be sure,
          written to Balbus telling him that you had mentioned to me in a letter both his kindly
          feeling and his suspicion. I thanked him. On the second point I cleared myself with him.
          Did you <pb n="404"/> ever know anyone more unlucky? I won't say more, lest I should make
          you suffer too. I am overpowered with the thought that the time has come when I no longer
          have the power of acting either with courage or with prudence. </p>

            the correspondence after the letter of the 19th of May, <date when="-0049">B.C.
              49</date>, in which we find Cicero abandoning the passing idea of retirement to
            Malta—still waiting to be assured of Caesar's failure in Spain before taking the plunge
            and joining Pompey in Greece. The silence is only broken by the one letter to Terentia
            written on the 7th of June, the day on which he finally set sail. Something then had
            happened between 19th May and 7th June to finally determine him on taking this step: and
            it is not unreasonable to suppose that it was the news of Caesar's dangerous position
            behind the flooded river Segre, which prevented the arrival of his supplies; while his
            opponents in Spain, Afranius and Petreius, having command of the bridge at Ilerda, could
            supply themselves with necessaries. Caesar's difficulty did not last many days, but
            exaggerated reports of it reached Rome, and "Afranius's town house was thronged with
            visitors offering their congratulations; and many persons started from Italy to join
            Pompey, some that they might be the first to carry the good news, others to avoid the
            appearance of having wished to see how things would go and of coming last" (<bibl
              n="Caes. Civ. 1.53">Caes. B.C. 1.53</bibl>). Then follows another silence of six
            months. When we next take up the correspondence, in January, <date when="-0048">B.C.
              48</date>, we have a few short letters up to the middle of July from Pompey's
            quarters. Those from Cicero are almost wholly On private matters, with only very dark
            hints at the uneasiness and discontent which he felt at the state of things in Pompey's
            camp. Caelius had begun to regret his adhesion to Caesar, but Dolabella was still urging
            Cicero to retire from active participation in the war. Cicero appears to have given much
            umbrage to the Pompeians by his caustic criticisms on the management of the campaign and
            the conduct of his party generally (<bibl n="Plut. Cic. 38">Plut. Cic. 38</bibl>; <bibl
              n="Cic. Phil. 2.57">Phil. 2.57</bibl>). After the 15th of July there is another pause
            in the letters of nearly four months, and when it again opens the issue of the war had
            been settled at Pharsalia, and Cicero is in Brundisium on sufferance, having been
            invited or permitted by Caesar to return from Patrae—to which he had gone from the fleet
            at Corcyra—to Italy, not venturing yet to return to Rome. There he has to remain till
            late in September, <date when="-0047">B.C. 47</date>, when Caesar's return from the
            Alexandrine and Asiatic wars at last relieved him from this quasi-exile. He met Caesar
            near Tarentum, who greeted him with warmth, and invited him to return <pb n="2"/> to
            Rome and resume his position there (<bibl n="Plut. Cic. 39">Plut. Cic. 39</bibl>). It
            must have been a dreary time, and his letters, as usual, reflect his feelings, but with
            somewhat less exaggeration than do those of the exile. He was really in greater danger,
            and owed something to the forbearance of Antony as well as to that of Caesar (<bibl
              n="Cic. Phil. 2.5">Phil. 2.5</bibl>). He had besides the sorrow of finding that his
            brother Quintus and his nephew had not only hastened to give in their adhesion to
            Caesar, but had passionately denounced him to the conqueror. </p>

        <p> I have received from you the sealed document conveyed by Anteros. I could gather nothing
          from it about my domestic affairs. What gives me the most painful anxiety about them is
          the fact that the man who has acted as my steward is not at Rome, nor do I know where in
          the wide world he is. My one hope of preserving my credit and property is in your most
          thoroughly proved kindness; and if ill this unhappy and desperate crisis you still
          maintain that, I shall have greater courage to endure these dangers which are shared with
          me by the rest of the party. I adjure and intreat you to do so. I have in Asia in

          amounting to 2,200,000 sesterces (about £17,600). By negotiating a bill of exchange for
          that sum you will have no difficulty in maintaining my credit. If indeed I had not thought

        <p> I received your letter on the 4th of February, and on the same day formally accepted the
          inheritance in accordance with the will. Of my many and most distressing anxieties one is
          removed, if; as you say, this inheritance is sufficient to maintain my credit and
          reputation; though even without any inheritance I am aware that you would have defended
          them by all means at your disposal. As to what you say about the dowry, <note n="1"
            anchored="true">The second instalment of Tullia's dowry now becoming due to <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Dolabella</foreign>. See pp. 8, 10. </note> I adjure you, in the name of
          all the gods, to undertake that whole business and protect the poor girl, whom my default
          and carelessness have reduced to distress, by the aid of funds belonging to me, if there
          are such, of your own if you can do so without inconvenience. You say that she is without
          any means: pray do not allow that state f things to continue. Why, what are the payments
          that have swallowed up the rents of my estates? For instance, one ever told me that the
          sixty sestertia, which you mention, had been deducted from the dowry; for I should never
          have allowed it. But this is the smallest of the frauds from which I have suffered: of
          which sorrow and tears prevent my writing to you. Of the money deposited in Asia I have
          called in nearly half. It seemed likely to be safer where it now is than in the hands of
          the publicani. You exhort me to be of good courage: I could have wisheded that you were
          able to allege some reason for my being so. But if to my other misfortunes there has been
          added the confiscation of my town house, which Chrysippus told me was in contemplation
          (you gave me no hint of it), who is he now in all the world in a worse plight than myself?
          I beg and beseech you,—pardon me, I can write no more. <pb n="4"/> You must see what a
          crushing weight of sorrow mine is. If it were only such as is common to me with the rest
          of those who are regarded as being in the same position as myself, my error had seemed
          less grave and therefore more easy to bear. As it is, there is no consolation, unless you
          secure (if it is not now too late to secure it) that I have no special loss or wrong
          inflicted upon me. I have been somewhat slow in sending back your letter-carrier, because
          there was no opportunity of getting him across. Pray send letters in my name to any to
          whom you think it right to do so. You know my intimates. If they remark on the absence of
          my signet or handwriting, pray tell them that I have avoided using either owing to the
          military pickets. </p>

        <p> What is going on here you will be able to ascertain from the bearer of your letter. I
          have detained him longer than I otherwise should, because I am in daily expectation of
          something happening, and even now I have, after all, no other motive for despatching him
          except the subject on which you asked for an answer from me, namely, my wish as to the 1st
          of July. Both courses are dangerous-either the risk of so large a sum of money at so
          critical a time, or the divorce, of which you speak, while the result of the campaign is
          still uncertain. <note n="1" anchored="true">Dowries were paid in three instalments
              (<foreign xml:lang="la">pensiones</foreign>). The second instalment was due to
            Tullia's husband, <foreign xml:lang="la">Dolabella</foreign>, on the 1st of July. A
            divorce, however, was already under discussion. If that were effected Cicero would not
            have to pay. He is divided in mind. If he paid, and Pompey's side won, he would wish for
            the divorce, and yet would have difficulty in recovering the money. If Caesar's side
            won, the rupture with the Caesarian <foreign xml:lang="la">Dolabella</foreign> might be
            dangerous. </note> Wherefore, I leave this, as I do other things, as absolutely as
          possible to your care and kindness, and to her consideration and wishes, for whose
          interests-poor girl I-I should have consulted better, if I had formerly deliberated with

          dangerous and such as I might very easily have avoided. However, they will be less grave,
          if, as is the case at present, they are mitigated by your management and activity. The
          money is lodged with Egnatius. There, as far as I am concerned, let it remain. The present

        <p> What the reasons were, and how distressing, peremptory, and unprecedented, which
          influenced me and compelled me to follow an impulsive feeling, so to speak, rather than

          does it much matter whether men see me in a town or on the road. However, I will consider
          even this, as I shall other plans, to see how it can be most advantageously managed. For
          myself, owing to my extraordinary uneasiness both of body and mind, I have been incapable
          of composing numerous letters: I have only answered those who have written to me. Pray
          write to Basilus and to others to whom you think it proper-even to Servilius <note n="2"

            afterwards one of his assassins. </note> —in my name, and say whatever you think right.
          As to the long interval during which I have written nothing at all to you, you will <pb

          not willingness to write. You ask about Vatinius. <note n="1" anchored="true">Cicero's

        <p> I perceive that you are anxious both for your own and for our common fortunes, and above
          all for me and my sorrow, which, so far from being lessened by the association of yours
          with it, is thereby actually increased. Assuredly your sagacity has led you to divine the
          exact consolation that gives me the greatest relief. For you express approval of my
          policy, and say that in the circumstances what I did was the best thing I could do. You
          also add—what is of smaller importance in my eyes than your own opinion, and yet is not
          unimportant—that everybody else, everybody that is that matters, approves the step I have
          taken. If I thought that to be the case, it would lessen my pain. "Believe me," you say. I
          believe you of course, but I know how anxious you are to soothe my pain. Of abandoning the
          war I have not repented for a moment. So bloodthirsty were their sentiments, so close
          their alliance with barbarous tribes, that a scheme of proscription was formed-not against
          individuals, but whole classes—and the conviction was universally entertained by them that
          the property of you all was the prize of his victory. I say "you" advisedly: for even as
          to you personally there were never any but the harshest ideas. Wherefore I shall never
          repent of my decision: what I do repent of is my plan of procedure. I could have wished
          that I had rather remained in some town until invited to Italy. <note n="1"
            anchored="true">Apparently the expression of Caesar's wish to <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Dolabella</foreign>, which he afterwards quotes in his own justification, does not
            seem to him sufficiently formal. See p.19. </note> I should have exposed myself to less
          remark and have felt less pain; this particular regret would not have been wringing my
          heart. To lie idle at Brundisium is vexatious in every point of view. As to coming nearer
          the city, as you advise, how can I do so without the lictors <pb n="16"/> given me by the
          people? They cannot be taken from me as long as I am possessed of my civil rights. These
          lictors, as a temporary measure, when approaching the town, I caused to mingle with the
          crowd with only sticks in their hands, to prevent any attack on the part of the soldiery.
            <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Brundisium</foreign> was in the hands of the Caesarians under

            Mueller's <foreign xml:lang="la">reliquo tempore me domi tenui...ad Balbum

          minds as to how they thought that I should approach Rome. I think they will advise my
          doing so. For they undertake that Caesar will be anxious not only to preserve, but to
          enhance my position, and they exhort me to be of good courage, and to hope for the most
          distinguished treatment in all respects. This they pledge themselves to and affirm. Yet I
          should have felt more sure of it, if I had remained where I was. But I am harping upon
          what is past. Look therefore, I beg of you, to what remains to be done and investigate the
          case in conjunction with them; and if you think it necessary and they approve, let
          Trebonius and Pansa and anyone else be called into council, that Caesar's approbation of
          my step may be the better secured as having been taken in accordance with the opinion of
          his own friends, and let them write and tell Caesar that whatever I have done I have done
          in accordance with their judgment. <milestone unit="para"/>My dear Tullia's ill-health and
          weakness frightens me to death. I gather that you are shewing her great attention, for
          which I am deeply grateful. <milestone unit="para"/>I never had any doubt about what would
          be the end of Pompey. Such a complete despair of his success had taken possession of the
          minds of all the kings and nations, that I thought this would happen wherever he landed. I
          cannot but lament his fall: for I know him to have been honest, pure, and a man of
          principle. <note n="3" anchored="true">Pompey was murdered on landing in Egypt on the 28th
            of September. The coldness of this reference does not accord well with Cicero's former
            warm expressions as to his "gratitude"to Pompey. But his language in regard to him is by
            no means uniformly that of admiration, often quite the reverse; and there had been much
            strained feeling between them in the camp in Epirus. </note>

            the splendid buildings of the imperial age. It seems to have been conspicuous at this

        </opener>
        <p> I am much obliged for your letter, in which you have set forth with great care all that
          you thought had any bearing on my position. Is it the case then, as you say in your
          letter, that your friends think that I should retain my lictors on the ground that Sestius
          has been allowed to do so? <note n="1" anchored="true">The text is corrupt. I venture to
            read: <foreign xml:lang="la">arbitratus es. Itane est</foreign>
            <foreign xml:lang="la">igitur, ut scribis, istis placere eisdem lictoribus me uti, quod
              concessum Sestio sit? Itane</foreign> may without much violence be extracted from t
              <foreign xml:lang="la">ea</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="la">factum</foreign> be an
            inserted explanation of <foreign xml:lang="la">est</foreign>. </note> But in his case I
          don't consider that his own lictors have been allowed him, but that lictors have been
          given him by Caesar himself. <note n="2" anchored="true">To P. Sestius had been allotted
            the province of <foreign xml:lang="la">Cilicia</foreign> in succession to Cicero, but
            this allotment had taken place after the expulsion of the Tribunes in January, <date
              when="-0049">B.C. 49</date>; for we know that Curio had up to 10th December, <date
              when="-0050">B.C. 50</date>, prevented any decree as to the provinces (vol. ii.,
            p.182). Therefore, Cicero argues, Caesar, who would not acknowledge any Senatus <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Consultum</foreign> after the expulsion of the Tribunes, if he allows of
            Sestius having imperium, must do so as an act of his own. But in Cicero's own case his
            imperium dated long before, and Caesar could consistently acknowledge it. </note> For I
          am told that he refuses to acknowledge any decrees of the Senate passed after the
          withdrawal of the tribunes. <note n="3" anchored="true">M. Antonius and Q. Cassius, vol.
            ii., p.234. </note> Wherefore he will be able without forfeiting his consistency to
          acknowledge my lictors. However, why should I talk about lictors, who am all but ordered
          to quit Italy? For Antony has sent me a copy of Caesar's letter to him, in which he says
          that "he has been told that Cato and L. Metellus had come to Italy, with the intention of
          living openly at Rome: that he disapproved of that, for fear of its being the cause of
          disturbances: and that all are forbidden to come to Italy except those whose case he had
            <pb n="19"/> himself investigated." And on this point the language of the despatch is
          very strong. Accordingly, Antony in his letter to me begged me to excuse him: "he could
          not but obey that letter." Then I sent L. Lamia to him, to point out that Caesar had told
          Dolabella to write and bid me come to Italy at the first opportunity: that I had come in
          consequence of his letter. <note n="1" anchored="true">Cicero repeats this assertion of
            Caesar's invitation afterwards, in answer to Antony's remark that he spared him at
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Brundisium</foreign> when he might have killed him. (<bibl
              n="Cic. Phil. 2.5">Phil. 2.5</bibl>.) </note> Thereupon he made a special exception in
          his edict of myself and Laelius by name. I had much rather he had not done that; for the
          exception itself could have been made without mentioning names. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">Cicero did not wish his name to be mentioned as specially favoured by
            Caesar, for fear of being discredited with the Pompeians, should they eventually
            prevail. For Laelius, see p.33. </note> Oh, what endless, what formidable dangers!
          However, you are doing your best to mitigate them: and not without success,—the very fact
          that you take such pains to lessen my distress lessens it. Pray do not get tired of doing
          so as frequently as possible. Now, you will best succeed in your object, if you can
          persuade me to think that I have not entirely forfeited the good opinion of the loyalists.
          And yet what can you do in that regard? Nothing, of course. But if circumstances do give
          you any opportunity, that is what will best be able to console me. I see that at present
          this is impossible, but if any thing should turn up in the course of events, as in the
          present instance! It used to be said that I ought to have left the country with Pompey.
          His death has disarmed criticism on that sin of omission. But of all things the one most
          found wanting in me is that I have not gone to Africa. Now my view of the question was
          this,—I did not think that the constitution ought to be defended by foreign auxiliaries
          drawn from the most treacherous race, especially against an army that had been frequently
          victorious. They perhaps disapprove that view. For I hear that many loyalists have arrived
          in Africa, and I know that there were many there before. On this point I am much pressed.
          Here again I must trust to luck,—that Some of them, or, if possible, all should be found
          to prefer their personal safety. For if they stick to their colours and <pb n="20"/>
          prevail, you perceive what my position will be. You will say, "What about them, if they
          are beaten?" Such a blow is more creditable to them. These are the thoughts that torture
          me. You did not explain in your letter why you do not prefer Sulpicius's <note n="1"
            anchored="true">Servius Sulpicius Rufus (see vol. ii., pp.354, 361) retired to <foreign

          from danger and vexation. The last case is that of those who remain in Achaia. Even they
          are in a better position than I am, in two respects: there are many together in one place;
          and, when they do come to Italy, they will come straight back to Rome. Pray continue your
          present efforts to soften these difficulties and to secure the approbation of as many as
          possible. You apologize for not coming to me: I however am well acquainted with your
          reasons, and I also think it to my advantage that you should be where you are, if only to
          make to the proper people—as you are actually doing—the representations that have to be
          made in my behalf. Above all pray observe this. I believe that there are a number of
          people who have reported or will report to Caesar either that I repent of the course I
          have adopted, or do not approve of what is now going on: and, though both statements are
          true, yet they are made by them from an unfriendly feeling to me, not because they have
          perceived them to be so. In regard to this everything depends on Balbus and Oppius
          supporting my cause, and on Caesar's kind disposition towards me being confirmed by
          frequent letters from them. Pray do your utmost to secure that. A second reason for my not
          wishing you to leave Rome is that you mention in your letter that Tullia implores your
          help. What a misfortune I What am I to say? What can I wish? I will be brief: for a sudden
          flood of tears stops me. I leave it to you. Do as you think right. Only be careful that at
          such a crisis as this there may be no danger to her safety. Pardon me, I beseech you: I
          cannot dwell on this topic any longer for tears and grief. I will only say that nothing is
          more soothing to my feelings than your affection for her. <milestone unit="para"/>I am

          Caesar, especially by means of Balbus and Oppius, to induce them to write on my behalf as
          zealously as possible. For I am being attacked, as I hear, both by certain persons who are
          with him and by letter. We must counteract them as vigorously as the importance of the
          matter demands. Fufius <note n="1" anchored="true">Q Fufius Calenus (see p.35). </note> is
          there, a very bitter enemy of mine. Quintus has sent his son not only to plead on his own

          though Caesar himself and all his friends refute this. Indeed he never stops, wherever he
          is, heaping every kind of abuse upon me. Nothing has ever happened to me so much
          surpassing my worst expectations, nothing in these troubles that has given me so much

            returning to Italy, met Cicero between Tarentum and Brundisium, embraced him, and gave
            him free leave to live anywhere in Italy he chose. There was still the fear lest, if the

          service to me ? <note n="1" anchored="true">The new tribunes, among whom was <foreign

            about which we have no information. <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign> had
            remarked that Cicero would not be affected by it, as he had come before. He replies that
            that is small consolation, as his having come at all does, not seem to have put him in
            any better position, i.e., as to regaining his full rights and the power of coming to

          Balbus's letters to me become daily less cordial, and a great number from many hands reach
          Caesar, perhaps against me. I am perishing by my own fault. It is not chance that has
          caused me any misfortune, everything has been incurred by my own mistakes. The fact is
          that when I saw what sort of war it was going to be, and that universal unreadiness and
          feebleness were pitted against men in the highest state of preparation, I had made up my
          mind to a policy, not so much courageous, as one that I of all men was justified in
          adopting. I gave in to my relations, or rather, I obeyed them. What the real sentiments of

          his own letters, which he has sent to you and others. I should never have opened them, had
          it not been for the following circumstance. The bundle was brought to me. I untied it to
          see whether there was any letter for me. There was none. There was one for Vatinius, and
          another for Ligurius. <note n="2" anchored="true">P. Vatinius was in command at <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Brundisium</foreign> (see p. 14). Aulus Ligurius was a prominent
            Caesarian, who was also friendly to Cicero. </note> I ordered them to be delivered to
          these persons. They immediately came to me boiling with indignation, loudly exclaiming
          against "the villain." They read me the letters full of every kind of abuse of me.
          Ligurius raved: said, that he knew that Quintus was detested by Caesar, and yet that the
          latter had not only favoured him, but had also given him all that money out of compliment
          to me. Thus outraged I determined to ascertain what he had said in his letters to the
          rest. For I thought it would be fatal to Quintus himself if such a villainy on his part
          became generally known. I found that they were of the same kind. I am sending them to you,
          and if you think that it is for his interest that they should be delivered, please to
          deliver them. It won't do me any harm. For as to their having had their seals broken,
          Pomponia possesses his signet, I think. <note n="3" anchored="true">This treatment of his

              n="Cic. Phil. 2.7">Phil. 2.7</bibl>). He seems to have been inclined to treat
            Quintus's correspondence with some freedom, for he advised the young Quintus in his

        <p> My distresses, already past calculation, have received an addition by the news brought
          to me of the elder and younger Quintus. My connexion Publius Terentius was employed as
          deputy master of his company in Asia in collecting the harbour dues and the pasture rents.
            <note n="2" anchored="true">See vol. ii., p.44. </note> He saw the younger Quintus at
          Ephesus on the 8th of December, and entertained him warmly for the sake of our friendship,
          and on asking some questions about me, he tells me that Quintus replied that he was
          bitterly opposed to me, and shewed him a roll containing a speech which he intended to
          deliver against me before Caesar. <note n="3" anchored="true">It was not unusual, it
            appears, to deliver a set harangue from a written copy to a great man, though in an
            informal meeting. Suetonius says that Augustus always did so on important matters, even
            with his wife <foreign xml:lang="la">Livia</foreign> (<bibl n="Suet. Aug. 84">Suet. Aug.
              84</bibl>), and Dio has preserved a conversation of the sort between them (55, 15),
            and two speeches of <foreign xml:lang="la">Agrippa</foreign> and Maecenas of the same
            kind (52, I, ff.). Tacitus (Ann. 4.39) says that it was the common custom in the time of
            Tiberius. </note> Terentius says that he dissuaded him from such a senseless proceeding
          at great length; and that afterwards at Patrae the elder Quintus talked a great deal to
          him in a similar strain of treachery. The latter's furious state <pb n="27"/> of mind you
          have been able to gather from the letters which I sent on to you. I know these things are
          painful to you: they are positive torture to me, and the more so that I don't think I
          shall have the opportunity of even remonstrating with them. <milestone unit="para"/>As to
          the state of things in Africa, <note n="1" anchored="true">Where <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Cato</foreign> and the other Pompeian leaders were making great head. </note> my
          information is widely different from your letter. They say that nothing could be sounder
          or better organized. Added to that, there is Spain, an alienated Italy, a decline in the
          loyalty and the strength of the legions, total disorder in the city. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">All these disorders make Cicero fear that, after all, Caesar will fail,
            and his own position be worse than ever, as he has hopelessly offended the Pompeians.
            The military disorders were among the legions sent back to Italy after <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Pharsalia</foreign>, who were discontented with their rewards. The
            disturbances in the city were caused by the contests between <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Dolabella</foreign> and his fellow tribunes-Dolabella endeavouring to introduce an
            act for the relief of debtors, which gave rise to bloody faction fights in Rome, which
            Antony, Caesar's Master of the Horse, vainly tried to suppress ([Caesar) Bell. Alex. 65;
            Dio, 42, 29-32; <bibl n="TLG551.17 2.92">App. Bell. Civ. 2.92</bibl>). For the trouble
            in Spain, see p.30. </note> Where can I find any repose except in reading your letters?
          And they would certainly have been more frequent, had you had anything to say by which you
          thought that my distress might be relieved. But nevertheless I beg you not to omit writing
          to tell me whatever occurs; and, if you can't absolutely hate the men who have shewn

        <p> Worn out at length by the agony of my excessive sorrows, even if I had anything that I
          ought to say to you, I should not find it easy to write it; but as it is, I am still less

          hear. Therefore pray do go on writing, whenever you have a bearer at hand: though I have
          nothing to say in answer to your last, which nevertheless I received some time ago. For in

        <p> Cephalio delivered me a letter from you in the evening of the 8th of March. Now on the
          morning of the same day I had already despatched the letter-carriers, to whom I had given
          a letter for you. However, after reading your letter I thought I must write something in
          answer, more especially as you shew that you are anxious as to what explanation I intend
          to offer Caesar of my journey at the time that I left Italy. I have no need of any new
          explanation. For I have repeatedly written to him, and have charged various people to tell
          him, that I was unable, much as I wished it, to stand out against people's talk; and much
          more to the same effect. For there is nothing I should less like than that be should think
          that in a matter of such importance I did not act on my independent judgment. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">There seems at first sight a contradiction, but Cicero means: "I did not
            wish Caesar to think that I acted under pressure from friends (e.g., Quintus), but that
            I came to the conclusion myself that I could not risk the severe remarks of the men of
            my party." If my view is right (see p. I), that Cicero eventually resolved to go when it
            was believed that Caesar had failed in Spain, no doubt the explanation to be given now
            was a delicate matter. </note> I afterwards received a letter from Cornelius Balbus the
          younger, saying that Caesar regarded my brother Quintus as having "sounded the signal" for
          my retreat—for that was his expression. I was not at the time aware of what Quintus had
          written about me to many; but he had spoken and acted to my face with great bitterness, in
          spite of which I yet wrote to Ceasar in these words: <pb n="30"/>
          <quote>I am no less anxious for my brother Quintus than for myself: but I do not venture
            in such a position as mine to recommend him to you. Yet this at least I will venture to
            ask of you—thus much I can do—I beg you not to think that he did anything to diminish
            the constancy of my service, or lessen my affection to you. Believe rather that he
            always advised our union; and was the companion, not the leader, of my journey.
            Wherefore in other matters pray give him all the credit that your own kindness and your
            mutual friendship demand. I earnestly and repeatedly entreat you not to let me stand in
            his light with you.</quote>
          <milestone unit="para"/>Wherefore if I ever do meet Caesar—though I have no doubt of his
          being lenient to Quintus, and that he has already made his intention clear—I after all
          shall be consistent with myself. But, as far as I can see, my anxiety must be much more in
          regard to Africa, which, in fact, you say is growing daily stronger, though rather in a
          way to make one hope for conditions of peace than victory. Would to heaven it were so! But
          my view of the facts is far different, and I think that you yourself agree with me, but
          write in a different sense, not to deceive but to encourage me, especially now that Spain
            <note n="1" anchored="true">Caesar had, after his Spanish victory of <date when="-0049"
              >B.C. 49</date>, left Q. Cassius Longinus (the tribune who had with Antony vetoed the
            proposal for his recall) as governor of Farther Spain, <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Baetica</foreign>. His harsh and grasping administration had caused a rebellion.
            Though this was eventually put down in <date when="-0047">B.C. 47</date>, he had been
            obliged to leave the country, which was thoroughly prepared to take the Pompeian side,
            as was soon shewn by the expulsion of the next Caesarian governor, C. Trebonius. It is
            the news of this disturbance that makes Cicero speak of Spain, by which he means
            Southern Spain, as lost to Caesar. </note> is also joined to Africa. You advise me to
          write to Antony and the rest. If you think anything of the sort necessary, please do as
          you have often done : <note n="2" anchored="true">Write in Cicero's name. As such letters
            were no doubt written by an amanuensis, there would be nothing to shew (except style!)
            that they were not dictated by Cicero himself. See pp. 4, 9, 20. </note> for nothing
          occurs to me as needing to be written. You have been told that I am in better spirits—what
          can you think when you see added to my other causes of uneasiness these fine doings of my
          son-in-law. <note n="3" anchored="true">Dolabella's extravagant proposals as tribune, and
            the consequent riots. See <foreign xml:lang="la">ante</foreign>, p.27. </note> However,
          don't cease doing what you can in that direction-namely,, <pb n="31"/> writing to me, even
          if you have nothing to write about. For a letter from you always conveys something to me.
          I have accepted the inheritance of Galeo. I presume the form of acceptance was simple, as
          none has been sent me. <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Cretio</foreign> was the acceptance by an heir of an inheritance,
            with all its burdens. This had to be done within a certain number of days after the heir
            was notified of the fact. Sometimes there were special conditions attached, or the time
            allowed for acceptance was shortened by the clause being omitted, ordering the time for
            acceptance to be counted from the day the heir was notified. By <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >cretio</foreign> simplex Cicero seems to mean that everything was regular, so that
            there was no need to send him documents: though others explain <foreign xml:lang="la"

        <p> I have not received anything by way of a letter as yet from Muraena's freedman. Publius

            made for the Hellespont, intending, it is said, to get the help of <foreign

            making his way through Asia, he immediately submitted, and, returning southward, met
            Caesar again at Rhodes, who used some of his ships on his voyage to Alexandria (<bibl

            <pb n="32"/> much more irritating than when he was accusing me most violently. For he
          says that he understands from your letter that you disapprove of his having written to
          many persons with severity about me, and that therefore he is sorry for having hurt your
          feelings, but that he had done so on good grounds. Then he sets down—but in most indecent
          terms —the reasons for his having so acted. But neither at the present juncture, nor
          before, would he have betrayed his hatred for me, had he not seen that I was a ruined man.
          And oh that I had come nearer to you, even if I had made the journeys by night, as you
          suggested! As it is, I cannot conceive either where or when I am likely to see you.

          of the property at Frusino, you have for some time past been acquainted with my wishes.
          Although my affairs were then in a better position, and I was not expecting such a
          desperate situation, I am nevertheless in the same mind. Please see how it may be brought
          about. And I beg you to consider, to the best of your ability, whence I may raise the
          necessary funds. Such means as I had I transferred to Pompey at a time when it seemed a
          prudent thing to do. <note n="1" anchored="true">For <foreign xml:lang="la"

          therefore, I took up money from your steward as well as borrowing from other sources; the
          time when Quintus writes to complain that I never gave him a farthing—I who was never
          asked for it by him, or had myself set eyes on the money. But pray see what can be scraped
          together, and what advice you would give on all points. You know the ins and outs of it.
          Grief prevents my writing more. If there is anything you think ought to be written to
          anybody in my name, pray do as usual: and whenever you find anybody to whom you can
          intrust a letter for me, I beg you not to omit doing so. Good-bye. <pb n="33"/>

        <p> As you give me good and sufficient reasons why I cannot see you at this time, I beg you
          to tell me what I ought to do. For it seems to me that, though Caesar is holding
          Alexandria, he is ashamed even to send a despatch on the operations there. Whereas these
          men in Africa seem to be on the point of coming over here: so, too, the Achaean refugees
            <note n="3" anchored="true">The Pompeians, who, instead of keeping with the Pompeian
            fleet, had taken refuge in <foreign xml:lang="la">Patrae</foreign> and <foreign

            Caesar and obtaining pardon. See p. 14. </note> seem to intend returning from Asia to
          join them, or to stay in some neutral place. What therefore do you think I ought to do? I
          quite see that it is difficult to advise. For I am the only one (or with one other <note
            n="4" anchored="true">Decimus Laelius See pp.19, 33. </note> ) for whom neither a return
          to the one party is possible, nor a gleam of hope visible from the other. But nevertheless
          I should like to <pb n="35"/> know what your opinion is, and that was the reason among
          others why I wished to see you, if it could be managed. <milestone unit="para"/>I wrote
          before to tell you that Minucius had only paid twelve sestertia: please see that the
          balance is provided. <milestone unit="para"/>Quintus wrote to me not only without any
          strong appeal for pardon, but in the most bitter style, while his son did so with
          astonishing malignity. No sorrow can be imagined with which I am not crushed. Yet
          everything is more bearable than the pain caused by my error: that is supreme and abiding.
          If I were destined to have the partners in that error that I expected, it would
          nevertheless be but a poor consolation. But the case of all the rest admits of some
          escape, mine of none. Some because they were taken prisoners, others because their way was
          barred, avoid having their loyalty called in question, all the more so, of course, now
          that they have extricated themselves and joined forces again. Why, even the very men who
          of their own free will went to Fufius <note n="1" anchored="true">Q. Fufius Calenus,
            tribune in <date when="-0061">B.C. 61</date>, and supporter of Clodius (vol. i., pp. 35,

            p.318), and during <date when="-0048">B.C. 48</date> had been engaged in taking
            possession of Greek cities in Caesar's interest, among others <foreign xml:lang="la"

            last three months of <date when="-0047">B.C. 47</date>. See supra, p.22. </note> can
          merely be counted wanting in courage. Finally, there are many who will be taken back, in
          whatever way they return to that party. So you ought to be the less astonished that I
          cannot hold up against such violent grief. For I am the only one whose error cannot be
          repaired, except perhaps Laelius—but what alleviation is that to me?—for they say that
          even Gaius Cassius has changed his mind about going to Alexandria. I write this to you,
          not that you may be able to remove my anxiety, but to know whether you have any suggestion
          to make in regard to the distresses that are sapping my strength, to which are now added
          my son-in-law, and the rest that I am prevented by my tears from writing. Nay, even
          Aesop's son <note n="2" anchored="true">The son of the famous actor, who was a great
            friend of Cicero's (vol. i., pp.132, 258). The son appears to have been dissolute.

          of men. But to return to my first question—what do you think I ought to do? Should I
          remove secretly <pb n="36"/> to some place nearer Rome, or should I cross the sea? For
          remaining here much longer is out of the question. <milestone unit="para"/>Why could no

          which there is not usually any dispute, when the portion which is thought of the less

          motive for asking the question: for I suspect that my co-heirs think that my position is
          doubtful, and therefore prefer allowing the matter to remain unsettled. <note n="1"

        <p> IT is by no fault of mine this time—for I did commit an error formerly—that the letter
          you forward brings me no consolation. For it is written in a grudging spirit, and gives
          rise to strong suspicions of not really being from Caesar, suspicions which I think have
          occurred to yourself. About going to meet him I will do as you advise. The fact is that
          there is no belief prevalent as to his coming, nor do those who arrive from Asia say that
          anything has been heard about a peace, the hope of which caused me to fall into this trap.
          I see no reason for entertaining hopes, especially in the present circumstances, when such
          disaster has been sustained in Asia, in Illyricum, in the Cassius affair, in Alexandria
          itself, in the city, in Italy. <note n="2" anchored="true">The various points are here
            enumerated in which things had gone against Caesar's interests, and therefore in favour
            of the ultimate triumph of the Pompeian party in Africa. They are: (I) the defeat of
            Domitius Calvinus by <foreign xml:lang="la">Pharnaces</foreign> in Asia; (2) the failure
            of Aulus Gabinius in <foreign xml:lang="la">Illyricum</foreign> (App. Illyr. § 12); (3)
            the insurrection in <foreign xml:lang="la">Baetica</foreign> which had forced Q. Cassius
            to quit the province (he was drowned on the voyage home); (4) the difficulties Caesar
            himself had met with at Alexandria; (5) the troubles in the city caused by the contest
            between the tribunes Trebellius and <foreign xml:lang="la">Dolabella;</foreign> (6) the
            mutinous conduct of the legions in Italy. What Cicero did not know was the completeness
            with which Caesar had overcome his difficulties in Egypt; nor could he foresee the
            rapidity with which he was to put down the war in Asia, for which he was on the point of
            starting. The troubles in Italy and Rome disappeared at once on his arrival, and in the
            next year (<date when="-0046">B.C. 46</date>) the victory of Thapsus finally crushed the
            hopes of the Pompeians in Africa. The trouble in <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Baetica</foreign> hung on for another year, and indeed lasted long after his death.
          </note> In my opinion, even if he is <pb n="37"/> going to return (he is said to be still
          engaged in war) the business will be all settled before his return. <milestone unit="para"
          />You say that a certain feeling of exultation on the part of the loyalists was roused on
          hearing of the receipt of this letter: you of course omit nothing in which you think that
          there is any consolation; but I cannot be induced to believe that any loyalist could think
          that any salvation has been of such value in my eyes, as to make me ask it of Caesar—much
          less should I be likely to do so now that I have not a single partner even in this policy.
            <note n="1" anchored="true">Decimus Laelius appears to have returned in some way to his
            old Pompeian friends. </note> Those in Asia are waiting to see how things turn out.
          Those in Achaia also keep dangling before Fufius the hope that they will petition for
          pardon. These men had at first the same reason for fear as I had, and the same policy. The
          check at Alexandria has improved their position, it has ruined mine. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">Because neither those in Asia nor those in <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Achaia</foreign> had as yet taken the final step of reconciling themselves to Caesar,
            and yet would be able to do so, if necessary, as not having crossed to the Pompeians in
            Africa; whereas Cicero, by coming to Italy, had definitely separated himself from the
            Pompeians, and, if Caesar failed, would suffer their vengeance. The others were safe in
            either event; he in neither, as he could not trust Caesar, and yet was lost if Caesar
            failed. </note> Wherefore I now make the same request to you as in my previous letter,
          that, if you can see in the midst of this desperate state of things what you think I ought
          to do, you would tell me of it. Supposing me to be received back by this party, <note
            n="3" anchored="true">All the commentators explain this to mean the Caesarians, but I
            think it more likely that Cicero means the Pompeians, who just now are in high hopes.
            "Even suppose they would admit me as one of themselves again—which they don't-yet (being
            resolved against active war) where am I to go? I can't go to Africa, where there will be
            war, or stay here if they come in arms." He has used the same word (<foreign
              xml:lang="la">recipere</foreign>) in the previous letters of the taking back by the
            Pompeians of those who deserted the fleet and went to <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Achaia</foreign> or Asia. </note> which you see is not the case, yet, as long as <pb
            n="38"/> there is war, I cannot think what to do or where to stay: still less, if I am
          rejected by them. Accordingly, I am anxious for a letter from you, and beg you to write to
          me without hesitation. <milestone unit="para"/>You advise me to write to Quintus about
          this letter of Caesar's: I would have done so, if it had been in any way one agreeable to
          me; although I have received a letter from a certain person in these words: "Considering
          the evil state of things, I am pretty comfortable at Patrae: I should be still more so, if
          your brother spoke of you in terms suited to my feelings." You say that Quintus writes you
          word that I never answer his letters. I have only had one from him; to that I gave an
          answer to Cephalio, who, however, was kept back several months by bad weather. I have
          already told you that the young Quintus has written to me in the most offensive terms.
            <milestone unit="para"/>The last thing I have to say is to beg you, if you think it a
          right thing to do and what you can undertake, to communicate with Camillus and make a
          joint representation to Terentia about making a will. The state of the times is a warning
          to her to take measures for satisfying all just claims upon her. Philotimus tells me that
          she is acting in an unprincipled way. <note n="1" anchored="true">Philotimus was the
            freedman of <foreign xml:lang="la">Terentia</foreign>, whose transactions in regard to

            against his wife from this man shews how much the alienation had already grown. Cicero
            is anxious that she should make proper provision for her children. </note> I can
          scarcely believe it, but at any rate, if there is anything that can be done, measures
          should be taken in time. Pray write to me on every sort of subject, and especially what
          you think about her, in regard to whom I need your advice, even though you fail to hit

        <p> I am giving this letter to another man's letter-carriers, who are in a hurry to start;
          that, and the fact that I am about to send my own, accounts for its brevity. My daughter
          Tullia reached me on the 12th of June, and expatiated at great length on your attention
          and kindness to her, and gave me three letters. I, however, have not got the pleasure from
          her own virtue, gentleness, and affection which I ought to get from a matchless daughter,
          but have even been overwhelmed with extraordinary sorrow, to think that a character like
          hers should be involved in circumstances of such distress, <note n="1" anchored="true"
            >According to Plutarch (Cic. 41) <foreign xml:lang="la">Terentia</foreign> had allowed
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Tullia</foreign> to undertake this journey without proper
            provision or escort. See also p.41. </note> and that that should occur from no fault of
          hers, but from my own consummate folly. Accordingly, I am not expecting from you now
          either consolation, which I see you desire to offer, or advice, which is impossible of
          adoption; and I understand on many occasions from your previous, as well as from your last
          letters, that you have tried everything practicable. <milestone unit="para"/>I am thinking

            continuation of the former hasty note. </note> to Caesar. As for Tullia, I see no motive
          for keeping her with me any longer in such a sad state of mutual sorrow. Accordingly, I am
          going to send her back to her mother as Soon as she will herself consent to go. In return
          for the letter which you wrote in the consolatory style, pray consider that I have made
          the only answer which you will <pb n="40"/> yourself understand to have been possible.
            <note n="1" anchored="true">Mueller quite alters the complexion of this sentence,

          incur their odium I don't understand. I perceive that you are prevented by a good reason
          from coming to see us, and that is a matter of great regret to me. There is no news of
          Caesar having left Alexandria; but all agree that no one has come from there either since
          the 15th of March, and that he has written no letters since the 13th of December. This
          shews you that there was nothing genuine about that letter of the 9th of February <note

        <p> ABOUT Caesar's departure from Alexandria there is as yet no rumour, and, on the
          contrary, there is an opinion that he is in serious difficulties. Accordingly, I shall not
          send my son, as I had intended, and I beg you to get me out of this place. For any
          punishment is less galling than a continuance here. On this subject I have written both to
          Antony and to Balbus and Oppius. For whether there is to be war in Italy, or whether he
          will employ his fleet, in either case this is the last place for me. Perhaps it will be
          both: certainly there will be one or the other. I understood clearly from Oppius's
          remarks, which you reported to me, what the anger of that party against me is: but I beg
          you to divert it. I expect nothing at all now that is not unhappy. But nothing can be more
          abominable than the place in which I now am. Wherefore I would like you to speak both to
          Antony and to the Caesarians with you, and get the matter through for me as well as you
          can, and write to me on all subjects as soon as possible. Good-bye. <milestone unit="para"

        <p> I have no difficulty in agreeing with your letter, in which you point out at
          considerable length that there is no advice by which I can be aided by you. At least there
          is no consolation capable of relieving my sorrow. For nothing has been brought upon me by
          chance—for that would have been endurable—but I have created it all by those mistakes and
          miserable conditions of mind and body, to which I only wish those nearest and dearest to
          me had preferred to apply remedies! Therefore, since I have no ray of hope either of
          advice from you or of any consolation, I will not ask you for them in future. I would only
          ask one thing of you—that you should not omit writing to me whatever comes into your mind,
          whenever you have anyone to whom you can give a letter, and as long as there shall be
          anyone <pb n="43"/> to whom to write, which won't be very long. There is a rumour of a
          doubtful sort that Caesar has quitted Alexandria. It arose from a letter from Sulpicius,
            <note n="1" anchored="true">The son of Servius Sulpicius Rufus was with Caesar. See vol.
            ii., pp.356, 361. </note> which all subsequent messengers have confirmed. Since it makes
          no difference to me, I don't know whether I should prefer this news being true or false.
          As to what I said some time ago to you about Terentia's will, I should like it preserved
          in the custody of the Vestals. <note n="2" anchored="true">The MS. reading is <foreign

            pp.39, 41. </note> I don't think there was ever such a creature born. If any measure of
          mine can do her any good, I should like you to tell me of it. I can see that you will have
          the same difficulty as you had before in giving me advice—but this is a matter that causes
          me more anxiety than everything else. I was blind to pay the second instalment. I wish I
          had done otherwise: but that's past and done with. I beg of you that, considering the
          ruinous state of affairs, if any money can be collected or got together and put in safe
          hands, from sale of plate and the fairly abundant furniture, you would take steps to do

            repudiating her, or being himself ruined. </note> For I think that the worst is hard
          upon us, that there will be no making of peace, and that the present regime will collapse
          even without an opponent. Speak to Terentia also on this subject, if you think it right,

        <p> On the subject on which I wrote to ask you to consult with Camillus, he has himself
          written to say that you have spoken to him. <note n="1" anchored="true">See p.38. </note>
          I am waiting for a letter from you—but I do not see how it can be changed if it is other
          than it should be. But having received a letter from him, I wanted one from you, though I
          think that you have not been informed on the subject I only hope that you are well! For
          you mentioned that you were suffering from a sort of illness. A certain Agusius arrived
          from Rhodes on the 8th of July. He brings word that young Quintus started to join Caesar
          on the 29th of May, that Philotimus arrived at Rhodes on the day previous, and had a
          letter for me. You will hear what Agusius himself has to say: but he is travelling rather
          slowly. Therefore I have contrived to give this to some one who goes quickly. I don't know
          what that letter Contains, but my brother Quintus offers me cordial congratulations. For
          my part, considering my egregious blunder, I cannot even imagine anything happening that
          can be endurable to me. <milestone unit="para"/>I beg you to think about my poor girl, and
          about what I wrote to you in my last—that some money should be got together to avert
          destitution, and about the will itself. The other thing also I could have wished that I
          had done before, but I was afraid of taking any step. The best alternative in a very bad
          business was a divorce. I should then have behaved something like a man—on the ground
          either of his proposals for abolition of debts, or his night assaults on houses, or his
          relations with Metella, or his ill conduct generally: and then I should not have lost the
          money, and should have shewn myself to possess some manly indignation. I quite remember
          your letter, but I also remember <pb n="45"/> the circumstance of the time: yet anything
          would have been better. As it is, indeed, he seems to intend to divorce her: for I am told
          about the statue of Clodius. <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">De statua Clodi</foreign>, the reading proposed by Tyrrell and
            Purser for the corrupt words of the MS. No better has been proposed. We have to assume
            that <foreign xml:lang="la">Dolabella</foreign> had in some way countenanced a statue of
            Clodius being put up. The fact is not otherwise known. Schütz reads <foreign
              xml:lang="la">de statu rei publicae</foreign>. </note> To think that a son-in-law of
          mine, of all people in the world, should do that, or propose the abolition of debts! I am
          of opinion, therefore, and so are you, that a notice of divorce should be sent by her. He
          will perhaps claim the third instalment. Consider, therefore, whether the divorce should
          be allowed to originate with him, or whether we should anticipate him. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">If the divorce originated with <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Dolabella</foreign>, he would have no claim to the third instalment of the dowry, and
            would have to refund the other instalments—though in his circumstances Cicero despairs
            of getting them, as it would seem; but if the divorce originated with <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Tullia</foreign>, unless she could shew misconduct on his part, the
            dowry would remain, in part at any rate, with <foreign xml:lang="la"
            >Dolabella</foreign>. I have followed Schütz in interpreting this passage; Tyrrell and
            Purser refer <foreign xml:lang="la">cum ab ipso nascetur</foreign> to the demand for the
            payment of the third instalment, not to the divorce itself. But see p.46. </note> If I
          can do so by any means, even by travelling at night, I will try to see you. Meanwhile,
          pray write to me about these matters, and anything else which it may be my interest to
          know. Good-bye. </p>

        <p> As I had the opportunity of giving a letter to your servants I would not pass it by,

        <p> What you said some time ago in a letter to me, and about me to Tullia—with a view of its
          reaching me also— feel to be true. It adds to my misery, though I thought no addition
          possible, that, when most flagrantly wronged, I cannot with impunity shew, not only any
          anger, but even vexation. Let me, therefore, put up with that. But when I have swallowed
          it, I shall yet have to endure the very things which you warn me to be on my guard
          against. For the blunder I have committed is such, that, whatever the final settlement and
          the sentiments of the people may be, its result seems likely to be the same. <milestone
            unit="para"/>IHere I take the pen into my own hands; for what follows must be treated
          more confidentially. See, I beg you, even now to the will, which was made at the time when
          she began to be in difficulties. She did not trouble you, for she never asked you even a
          question, nor me either. But assuming this to be the case, you will be able—as you have
          now got to the point of speaking about it—to suggest to her to deposit it with some one,
          whose position is not affected by <pb n="48"/> the result of this war. For my part, I
          should prefer you to everybody, if she agreed in wishing it. But the fact is, I keep the
          poor woman in the dark as to this particular fear of mine. <note n="1" anchored="true"
            >Terentia's will (pp. 38, 43). Cicero's fear is that Terentia's property would be
            confiscated, like his own. In that case obligations acknowledged in her will would be
            payable out of it. </note>
          <milestone unit="para"/>IAbout my other suggestion, <note n="2" anchored="true">As to the
            sale of plate and furniture. See pp.43, 44. </note> I know, of course, that nothing can
          be sold at present: but they might be stowed away and concealed, so as to be out of reach
          of the impending crash. For as to what you say about my fortune and yours being at
          Tullia's service—I have no doubt as to yours, but what can there be of mine? <milestone
            unit="para"/>IAgain, about Terentia—I omit innumerable other points—what can go beyond
          this? You wrote to her to send me a bill of twelve sestertia (about £94), saying that that
          was the balance of the money. She sent me ten, with a note declaring that to be the
          balance. When she has deducted such a petty sum from so trifling a total, you can feel
          pretty sure what she has done in the case of a very large transaction. Philotimus not only
          does not come himself, but does not inform me even by letter or messenger what he has
          done. People coming from Ephesus bring word that they saw him there going into court on
          some private suits of his own, which are themselves perhaps—for so it seems likely—being
          postponed till the arrival of Caesar. Accordingly, I presume either that he has nothing
          which he considers that there need be any hurry about conveying to me, or that I am such
          an object of contempt in my misfortunes, that, even if he has anything, he does not
          trouble himself about conveying it until he has settled all his own concerns. This annoys
          me very much, but not so much as I think it ought. For I consider that nothing matters
          less to me than the nature of any communication from that quarter. I feel sure you
          understand why I say that. You advise me to accommodate my looks and words to the
          circumstances of the time. It is difficult to do so, yet I would have put that restraint
          upon myself, had I thought that it was of any importance to me. <milestone unit="para"
          />IYou say that you think that the African affair may be <pb n="49"/> patched up. I wish
          you had told me why you think so: for my part, nothing occurs to my mind to make me think
          it possible. However, pray write and tell me if there is anything to suggest any
          consolation: but if, as I am clear, there is nothing of that nature, write and tell me
          even that fact. I, on my side, will write you word of anything which reaches me first.

          fear I must wait for him, and, among other misfortunes, my poor Tullia must also endure
          the unhealthy climate of the place. You advise me to make my actions square with the time:
          I would have done so, had circumstances allowed of it, and had it been in any way
          possible. But in view of the prodigious blunders made by myself, and the wrongs inflicted
          upon me by my relations, there is no possibility of doing anything or keeping up any
          pretext worthy of my character. You compare the Sullan period: but, if we regard the
          principle of that movement, it was everything that was most eminent; where it failed was
          in a want of moderation in its execution. The present movement, on the other hand, is of
          such a character, that I forget my own position, and much prefer the general advantage to
          that of the party, with whose interests I have identified my own. <note n="1"
            anchored="true">Though it would now be bad for me, I sometimes forget that, and still
            wish my old friends, the Pompeians, to triumph. I have adopted Mueller's text, <foreign

          pray write to me as often as possible, and the more so that no one else writes; and yet,
          if everybody did, I should still look forward to your letters most. You say that Caesar
          will be more kindly disposed to Quintus thanks to me: I have already told you that he at
          once granted everything to the younger Quintus and said never a word about me. Goodbye.

          anyone else's hands, they would not have inflicted any fresh harm upon me. For what can be
          more universally notorious than his rage against me and the sort of letter he writes ?-a
          kind of letter which even Caesar appears to have sent to his friends at Rome, not because
          he was shocked at his unprincipled conduct, but, I believe, to make my miserable position
          better known. You say that you are afraid that they will do Quintus harm, and that you are
          trying to remedy the mischief. Why! Caesar did not even wait to be asked about him. I
          don't mind that; but what I mind more is that the favours granted to myself have no
          stability. <milestone unit="para"/>Sulla, I believe, will be here tomorrow with Messalla.

        <p> I regard you as the one man who is less of a flatterer than myself, and if we both are
          sometimes such towards some one else, we are never so to each other. So listen to what I
          say in all plainness and sincerity. May I perish, my dear Atticus, if, I don't say my
          Tusculan villa-where in other respects I am very happy—but even "the islands of the blest"
          are in my eyes worth an absence of so many days from you. Wherefore let us harden
          ourselves to endure these three days-assuming you to be in the same state of feeling as
          myself, which is surely the case. But I should like to know whether you are coming today
          immediately after the auction, or on what day. Meanwhile I am busy with my books, and am
          much inconvenienced by not having Vennonius's history. <note n="1" anchored="true">A
            writer on early Roman history, see <foreign xml:lang="la">de</foreign> Leg. I, 2. </note>
          <milestone unit="para"/>However, not to omit business altogether, that debt which Caesar
          assigned to me admits of being recovered in three ways: first, purchase at the auction—but
          I would rather lose it, although, let alone the disgrace, that is as good as losing it.
          Secondly, a bond payable a year hence from the purchaser—but who is there I can trust, and
          when will that "year of Meton" come? Thirdly, accepting half down on the proposal of
          Vettienus. <note n="2" anchored="true">Apparently the property of some Pompeian who owed
            Cicero money was confiscated. From such confiscated properties as a rule debts and
            dowries were paid, the exchequer or the sector taking the balance. Caesar had admitted
            Cicero's debt, which he says he may deal with in three ways. (1) He may purchase the
            estate at the auction, deducting the amount of his claim, and then sell it for what it
            would fetch, but probably there were other debts on it and he would get no balance;
            besides, to act as a sector (making money by one's friends' misfortunes) was undignified
            (2 Phil. §§ 64-65). (2) He might transfer the whole business to another purchaser at the
            auction (<foreign xml:lang="la">manceps</foreign>), who would undertake to pay him in a
            year's time. But he did not know whom to trust. (3) He might accept an offer of
            Vettienus, the banker, to pay him half down, Vettienus taking the risk of recouping
            himself by dealing in some way with the estate. The "year of <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Meton</foreign>" was a proverb for indefinite postponement, "Meton's year" meaning
            the solar cycle of nineteen years, which he discovered (about <date>B.C. <date to="-400"
                from="-430">430</date>-400</date> at Athens). </note> Look into the matter
          therefore. <pb n="85"/> And indeed I am afraid Caesar may now not have the auction at all,
          but when the games are over <note n="1" anchored="true">Apparently the great games given
            by Caesar at the dedication of the temple of Venus soon after his return from Africa
            (Dio, 43, 22-23). </note> will hurry off to the aid of (Q. Pedius), <note n="2"

            But there seems no reason to suppose that Caesar should bestir himself just now about
            Balbus. It seems to me that the reference needed is to the coming campaign in Spain.
            Cicero is afraid Caesar will be in a hurry to leave home and not stay to see to the
            sales of confiscated properties. Now Q. Pedius—Caesar's nephew-was one of the commanders
            sent with the army in advance to Spain, from which urgent messages were coming (B. Hisp.
            1-2). I therefore suggest Q. Pedio for clypo. </note> lest such a great man should be

            was "on accents," and see a reference to that in in <foreign xml:lang="la">ista acuta et

        <p> I have already written all you want in a note and given it to Eros, briefly, but even
          more than you ask. In it I have spoken about my son, of whose idea you gave me the first
          hint. I said to him in the most liberal manner what I should like you, if it is convenient
          to you, to learn from his own mouth. But why put it off? I explained to him that you had
          reported to me his wishes and what means he required: "He wished to go to Spain; <note
            n="1" anchored="true">With Caesar to fight against the sons of Pompey. </note> he wanted
          a liberal allowance." As to a liberal allowance, I said that he should have as much as
          Publius gave his son, and the flamen Lentulus gave his. As to Spain, I put before him two
          objections, first, the one I mentioned to you, the fear of adverse criticism—"Was it not
          enough that we abandoned the war? Must we even fight on the other side?" And secondly,
          that he would certainly be annoyed at being surpassed by his cousin in intimacy with
          Caesar and every kind of favour. I could wish that he would take advantage of my
          liberality, rather than of his own freedom of action: nevertheless, I gave the permission:
          for I had been given to understand that you were not much against it. I will think over
          the subject earnestly, and beg that you will do the same. It is an important step: to stay
          at home involves no complications, the other course is risky. But we will see. About
          Balbus I had already written in the note, and I think of doing as you suggest as soon as
          he returns. But if he is somewhat slow in coming, I shall in any case be three days at
          Rome: and, oh! I forgot to say, Dolabella also will be with me. <pb n="145"/>

        <p> ON the eleventh day from my parting from you I write this notelet on the point of
          quitting my villa before daybreak. Today I think of being at my house at Anagnia, tomorrow
          at Tusculum: there I stay one day. On the 27th, therefore, I start to meet you as
          arranged. And oh! that I might hurry straight to the embrace of my Tullia and to the lips
          of Attica! Pray write and tell me what those same lips are prattling of, so that I may
          know it while I am halting in my Tusculan villa: or, if she is ruralizing, what <pb
            n="148"/> she writes to you. Meanwhile, send her by letter or give her yourself my kind
          love, as also to Pilia. But all the same, though we are to meet directly, write to me if
          you have anything to say. <milestone unit="para"/>Just as I was folding up this letter,
          your courier arrived late at night with a letter from you. I have read it: I am, of
          course, very sorry to hear of Attica's feverish attack. Everything else that I wanted to
          know I learn from your letter. As to your saying that "a little fire in the morning is an
          old man's luxury"—it is still more an old man's way to be a trifle forgetful! I had
          appointed the 26th for Axius, the 27th for you, and the 28th (the day of my reaching Rome)
          for Quintus. Pray consider that settled. There is no change. "Then what was the use of my
          writing?" What is the use of our talking when we meet and prattle about anything that
          occurs to us? A causerie is, after all, something: for, even though there is nothing in it
          substantial, there is a certain charm in the mere fact of our talking together. [The rest
          of the letters of this year are, with one or two exceptions, formal letters of

          The only person I miss is yourself; but although I find no more difficulty in going on
          with my literary work than if I were at home, yet that passionate unrest haunts and never
          quits me, not, on my word, that I encourage it, I rather fight against it: still it is
          there. As to what you say about Appuleius, I don't think that there is any need for your
          exerting yourself, nor for applying to Balbus and Oppius, to whom he undertook to make
          things right, and even sent me a message to say that he would not be troublesome to me in
          any way. But see that my excuse of ill-health for each separate day is put in. Laenas
          undertook this. Add C. Septimius and L Statilius. In fact, no one, whomsoever you ask,
          will refuse to make the affidavit. But if there is any difficulty, I will come and make a
          sworn deposition myself of chronic ill-health. <note n="3" anchored="true">The augurs met
            regularly on the Nones of each month. The only admissible excuse for non-attendance

              >de</foreign> Am. § 8, where Cicero represents his own case in the person of Laelius.
            There is nothing to shew whether M. Appuleius was the senior augur, to whom the excuse
            was to be given, or a recently elected augur, at whose inauguration and accompanying
            banquet Cicero felt unable to attend. The excuse appears to have needed the attestation
            of three other augurs. </note> For <pb n="200"/> since I am to absent myself from the
          entertainments, I would rather be thought to do so in virtue of the augural law, than in
          consequence of grief. Please send a reminder to Cocceius, for he does not fulfil his
          promise: while I am desirous of purchasing some hiding-place and refuge for my sorrow.

        <p> I wrote to you yesterday about making my excuses to Appuleius. I think there is no
          difficulty. No matter to whom you apply, no one will refuse. But see Septimius, Laenas,
          and Statilius about it. For three are required. Laenas, however, undertook the whole
          business for me. You say that you have been dunned by Iunius: Cornificius <note n="1"
            anchored="true">There are two men named Q. Cornificius, father and son, mentioned in the
            correspondence. The former was a candidate with Cicero for the consulship (vol. i., p.
            13); the latter was now going as governor to Africa (see p.131). </note> is certainly a
          man of substance, yet I should nevertheless like to know when I am said to have given the
          guarantee, and whether it was for the father or son. None the less pray do as you say, and

          />You wish me some relaxation of my mourning: you are kind, as usual, but you can bear me
          witness that I have not been wanting to myself. For not a word has been written by anyone
          on the subject of abating grief which I did not read at your house. But my sorrow is too
          much for any consolation. Nay, I have done what certainly no one ever did before me—tried
          to console myself by writing a book, which I will send to you as soon as my amanuenses
          have <pb n="201"/> made copies of it. I assure you that there is no more efficacious
          consolation. I write all day long, not that I do any good, but for a while I experience a
          kind of check, or, if not quite that—for the violence of my grief is overpowering-yet I
          get some relaxation, and I try with all my might to recover composure, not of heart, yet,
          if possible, of countenance. When doing that I sometimes feel myself to be doing wrong,
          sometimes that I shall be doing wrong if I don't. Solitude does me some good, but it would
          have done me more good, if you after all had been here: and that is my only reason for
          quitting this place, for it does very well in such miserable circumstances. And even this
          suggests another cause of sorrow. For you will not be able to be to me now what you once
          were: everything you used to like about me is gone. I wrote to you before about Brutus's
          letter to me: it contained a great deal of good sense, but nothing to give me any comfort.
          As to his asking in his letter to you whether I should like him to come to see me—by all
          means: he would be sure to give me some help, considering his strong affection for me. If
          you have any news, pray write and tell me, especially as to when Pansa goes. <note n="1"

            Boot supposes that he stayed in some villa till March, which was the usual time of going

        <p> To fly from recollections, which make my soul smart as though it were stung, I take
          refuge in recalling my plans to your memory. Pray pardon me, whatever you think of this
          one. The fact is that I find that some of the authors, whom I am now continually reading,
          suggest as a proper thing to do just what I have often discussed with you, and for which I
          desire your approval. I mean about the shrine-pray think of it as earnestly as your
          affection for me should suggest. <note n="1" anchored="true">Cicero wished to build a
            shrine in honour of Tullia's memory. His first idea was to do this at <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Astura</foreign> (p.206): but he soon changed to the plan of purchasing
            suburban <foreign xml:lang="la">horti</foreign>. </note> About the design I do not feel
          any doubt, for I like that of Cluatius, nor about the building of it at all—for to that I
          have made up my mind: but about the site I do sometimes hesitate. Pray therefore think
          over it. To the fullest capacity of such an enlightened age, I am quite resolved to
          consecrate her memory by every kind of memorial borrowed from the genius of every kind of
          artist, Greek or Latin. This may perhaps serve to irritate my wound: but I look upon
          myself as now bound by a kind of vow and promise. And the infinite time during which I
          shall be non-existent has more influence on me than this brief life, which yet to me seems
          only too long. For though I have tried every expedient, I find nothing to give me peace of
          mind. For even when I was composing that essay, of which I wrote to you before, I was in a
          way nursing my sorrow. Now I reject every consolation, and find nothing more endurable
          than solitude, which Philippus did not, as I feared, disturb. For after calling on me
          yesterday, he started at once for Rome. The letter which, in accordance with your advice,
          I have written to Brutus I herewith send you. Please see it delivered to him with your
          own. However, I am <pb n="204"/> sending you a copy of it, in order that, if you
          disapprove, you should not send it. You say my domestic affairs are being managed
          properly: please tell me what they are. For there are some points on which I am expecting
          to hear. See that Cocceius does not play me false. For Libo's promise, mentioned by Eros
          in his letter, I regard as secure. As to my capital, I trust Sulpicius, and, of course,
          Egnatius. About Appuleius why need you trouble yourself, when my excuse is so easily made?
          Your coming to me, as you shew an intention of doing, may, I fear, be difficult for you.
          It is a long journey, and when you went away again, which you will perhaps have to do very
          quickly, I should be unable to let you go without great pain. But all as you choose.
          Whatever you do will in my eyes be right, and done also in my interest. </p>

        <p> MARCIANUS has written to tell me that my excuse was made to Appuleius by Laterensis,
          Naso, Laenas, Torquatus, Strabo: please see that a letter is sent to each of them in my
          name, thanking them for their kindness. As for the assertion of Flavius that more than
          twenty-five years ago I gave a guarantee for Cornificius, though he is a man of substance,
          and Appuleius is a respectable dealer in land, yet I should like you to take the trouble
          to ascertain by inspecting the ledgers of my fellow guarantors whether it is so. For
          before my aedileship I had no dealings with Cornificius, yet it may be the case all the
          same, but I should like to be sure. And call upon his agents for payment, if you think it
          right to do so. However, what does it matter to me? Yet, after all Write and tell me of
          Pansa's departure for his province when you know. Give my love to Attica, and take good
          care of her, I beseech you. My compliments to Pilia. <pb n="205"/>

        <p> HAVING learnt yesterday from the letters of others of Antony's arrival, I was surprised
          to find no mention of it in yours. But perhaps it was written the day before it was sent.
          It does not matter to me: yet my own idea is that he has hurried back to save his
          securities. <note n="1" anchored="true">This is the "return from <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Narbo</foreign>," of which Cicero makes such large use in the second Philippic (§§
            76, 77). The "securities" were those given for the confiscated property which Antony had
            bought, especially that of Pompey, for which he had not paid. </note> You say that
          Terentia speaks about the witnesses to my will: in the first place, pray believe that I am
          not paying attention to things of that sort, and that I have no leisure for business which
          is either unimportant or fresh. Yet, after all, where is the analogy between us? She did
          not invite as witnesses those whom she thought would ask questions unless they knew the
          contents of her will. Was that a danger applicable to me? Yet, after all, let her do as I
          do. I will hand over my will for anyone she may select to read: she will find that nothing
          could have been in better taste than what I have done about my grandson. As for my not
          having invited certain witnesses: in the first place, it did not occur to me; and, in the
          second place, it did not occur to me because it was of no consequence. You know, if you
          have not forgotten, that I told you at the time to bring some of your friends: what need
          of a great many was there ? <note n="2" anchored="true">Seven was the legal number.
          </note> For my part, I had bidden members of my household. At the time it was your opinion
          that I ought to send word to Silius: hence it came about that a message was sent to
          Publilius. <note n="3" anchored="true">Brother of his second wife. </note> But neither was

        <p> THIS is certainly a lovely spot, right in the sea, and within sight of Antium and
          Cerceii: but in view of the whole succession of owners—who in the endless generations to
          come may be beyond counting, supposing the present empire to remain—I must think of some
          means to secure it being made permanent by consecration. <note n="1" anchored="true">If
            consecrated, the building would not change hands with a change of owners of the
            property. </note> For my part, I don't want large revenues at all, and can put up with a
          little. I think sometimes of purchasing some pleasure-grounds across the Tiber, and
          principally for the reason that I don't think that there is any other position so much
          frequented. But what particular pleasure-grounds I shall purchase we will consider when we
          are together; but it must be on condition that the temple is finished this summer.
          Nevertheless, settle the contract with Apella of Chius for the columns. What you say about
          Cocceius and Libo I quite approve, especially as to my jury-service. If you have seen
          light at all about the question of my guarantee, and what after all Cornificius's agents
          say, I should like to know about it: but I don't wish you, when you are so busy, to bestow
          much trouble on that affair. <milestone unit="para"/>About Antony, Balbus also in
          conjunction with Oppius wrote me a full account, and said that you had wished them to
          write to save me from anxiety. <note n="2" anchored="true">In the second Philippic (§ 77)
            Cicero says that Antony's sudden and secret return from <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Narbo</foreign> caused great alarm in Italy. Probably people thought that he had bad
            news from Spain, or orders from Caesar to take some strong measures. </note> I have
          written to thank them. I should wish you to know however, as I have already written to
          tell you, that I was not alarmed by that news, and am not going to be alarmed by any in
          future. If <pb n="207"/> Pansa has started for his province today, as you seemed to
          expect, begin telling me henceforward in your letters what you are expecting about the
          return of Brutus, that is to say, about what days. <note n="1" anchored="true">Ad quos
            dies. Perhaps the plural may allude to the several stages his journey, stopping—as we
            have often seen Cicero doing—at one villa after another for the night. See Letter DCXXI
            (A XIII, 9). </note> You will be easily able to guess that, if you know where he is. I
          note what you say to Tiro about Terentia: pray, my dear Atticus, undertake that whole
          business. You perceive that there is at once a question of duty on my part involved—of
          which you are cognizant-and, as some think, of my son's pecuniary interest. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">As getting an allowance from his mother when her dower was refunded.
          </note> For myself, it is the former point that affects my feelings much the more
          strongly: it is more sacred in my eyes and more important, especially as I do not think we
          can count on the latter as being either sincerely intended or what we can rely upon. </p>

        <p> You don't yet appear to me to be fully aware how indifferent I have been about Antony,
          and how impossible it is for anything of that sort now to disturb me. I wrote to you about
          Terentia in my letter of yesterday. You exhort me-Saying that other people look for it
          also—to hide the fact that my grief is as deep as it is. Could I do so more than by
          spending whole days in literary composition? Though my, purpose in doing so is not to
          hide, but rather to soften and heal my feelings: yet, if I don't do myself any good, I at
          least do what keeps up appearances. I write the less fully to you because I am waiting
          your answer to my letter of yesterday. What I most want to hear is about the temple, <pb
            n="208"/> and also something about Terentia. Pray tell me in your next whether Cn.
          Caepio, father of Claudius's wife Servilia, perished in the shipwreck before or after his
          father's death: also whether Rutilia died in the lifetime of her son C. Cotta, or after
          his death. <note n="1" anchored="true">We know nothing of this Caepio. Boot quotes Seneca
            (Consol. <foreign xml:lang="la">ad</foreign> Helviam, 16, 7) to show that Rutilia

            <date when="-0075">B.C. 75</date>, was a great orator. These antiquarian questions, as
            well as the whole tone of the letter, shew that Cicero was conquering his sorrow.

        <p> ABOUT the aqueduct you did quite right. You may perhaps find that I am not liable to the
          pillar-tax. However, I think I was told by Camillus that the law had been altered. What
          more decent answer can be given to Piso than the absence of Cato's guardians? Nor was it
          only from the heirs of Herennius that he borrowed money, as you know, for you discussed
          the matter with me, but also from the young Lucullus: and this money his guardian had
          raised in Achaia. I mention this because it is one element in the case also. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">We cannot explain this, because we don't know the circumstances. The son
            of <foreign xml:lang="la">Cato Uticensis</foreign>, still a minor, seems to have
            borrowed money through his guardian, payment of which was being claimed by <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Piso</foreign>. </note> But Piso is behaving well about it, for he says
          that he will do nothing against my wishes. So when we meet, as you say, we will settle how
          to untangle the business. You ask me for my letter to Brutus: I haven't got a copy of it,
          but it is in existence all the same, and Tiro says that you ought to have it. To the best
          of my recollection, along with his letter of remonstrance I sent you my answer to it also.

        <p> As to the dowry, make a clean sweep of the business all the more. To transfer the debt
          to Balbus is a rather high and mighty proceeding. <note n="1" anchored="true">Apparently
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Terentia</foreign> owed Balbus money; she proposed that

        <p> I have read Brutus's letter, and hereby return it to you. it was not at all a
          well-informed answer to the criticisms which you had sent him. But that is his affair. Yet
          it is discreditable that he should be ignorant of this. He thinks that Cato was the first
          to deliver his speech as to the punishment of the conspirators, whereas everyone except
          Caesar had spoken before him. And whereas Caesar's own speech, delivered from the
          praetorian bench, was so severe, he imagines that those of the consulars were less
          so-Catulus, Servilius, the Luculli, Curio, Torquatus, Lepidus, Gellius, Volcatius,
          Figulus, Cotta, Lucius Caesar, Gaius Piso, Manius Glabrio, and even the consuls-designate
          Silanus and Muraena. "Why, then," you may say, "was the vote on Cato's motion?" Because he
          had expressed the same decision in clearer and fuller words. Our friend Brutus again
          confines his commendation of me to my having brought the matter before the senate, without
          a word of my having unmasked the plot, of my having urged that measures should be taken,
          of having made up my mind on the subject before I brought it before the senate. It was
          because Cato praised these proceedings of mine to the skies, and moved that they should be
          put on record, that the division took place on his motion. Brutus again thinks he pays me
          a high compliment in designating me as "the most excellent consul." Why, what opponent
          ever put it in more niggardly terms? But to your other criticisms what a poor answer! He
          only asks you to make the correction as to the decree of the senate. He would have done
          that much even at the suggestion of his copyist. But once more that is his affair.
            <milestone unit="para"/>As to the suburban pleasure-grounds, as you approve of them,
          come to some settlement. You know my means. <pb n="214"/> If, however, we get any more out

            MSS. have <foreign xml:lang="la">recedit</foreign>, and many other emendations have been
            proposed. Faberius (Caesar's secretary) owed Cicero money, and was slow in paying.
          </note> of Faberius, there is no difficulty. But even without him I think I can get along.
          The pleasure-grounds of Drusus at least are for sale, perhaps those of Lamia and Cassius
          also. But this when we meet. <milestone unit="para"/>About Terentia I can say nothing more
          to the point than you say in your letter. Duty must be my first consideration: if I have
          made any mistake, I would rather that I had reason to be dissatisfied with her than she
          with me. A hundred sestertia have to be paid to Ovia, wife of C. Lollius. Eros says he
          can't do it without me: I suppose because some land has to pass at a valuation between us.
            <note n="2" anchored="true">Ovia it seems had to take a property at a valuation for her
            debt. See Letter DCXXXII (A XIII, 22), cp. p.93, note. Eros is <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Atticus</foreign> a steward. </note> I could wish that he had told you. For if the
          matter, as he writes, is arranged, and he is not lying on that very point, it could have
          been settled by your agency. Pray look into and settle the business. <milestone
            unit="para"/>You urge me to reappear in the forum: that is a place which I ever avoided
          even in my happier days. Why, what have I to do with a forum when there are no law courts,
          no senate-house, and when men are always obtruding on my sight whom I cannot see with any
          patience? You say people call for my presence at Rome, and are unwilling to allow me to be
          absent, or at any rate beyond a certain time: I assure you that it is long since I have
          valued your single self higher than all those people. Nor do I undervalue myself even, and
          I much prefer abiding by my own judgment than by that of all the rest. Yet, after all, I
          go no farther than the greatest philosophers think allowable, all whose writings of
          whatever kind bearing on that point I have not only read—which is itself being a brave
          invalid and taking one's physic—but have transcribed in my own essay. That at least did
          not look like a mind crushed and prostrate. From the use of these remedies do not call me

        <p> I DO not recognize your usual consideration for me in throwing the whole burden upon my
          shoulders in regard to Terentia. For those are precisely the wounds which I cannot touch
          without a loud groan. Therefore I beg you to make the fairest settlement in your power.

          is fair. <milestone unit="para"/>As to Rutilia, since you seem to be in doubt, please
          write and tell me when you ascertain the truth, and do so as soon as possible. Also
          whether Clodia survived her son Decimus Brutus, the ex-consul. The former may be
          ascertained from Marcellus, or at any rate from Postumia; the latter from M. Cotta or
          Syrus or Satyrus. <milestone unit="para"/>As to the suburban pleasure-grounds, I am
          particularly urgent with you. I must employ all my own means, and those of men whom I know
          will not fail to help me: though I shall be able to do it with my own. I have also some
          property which I could easily sell. But even if I don't sell, but pay the vendor interest
          on the purchase money—though not for more than a year—I can get what I want if you will
          assist me. The most readily available are those of Drusus, for he wants to sell. The next
          I think are those of Lamia; but he is away. Nevertheless, pray scent out anything you can.
          Silius does not make any use of his either, and he will be very easily satisfied by being
          paid interest on the purchase money. Manage the business your own way; and do not consider
          what my purse demands-about which I care nothing—but what I want. <pb n="216"/>

        <p> I thought that your letter was going to tell me some news, to judge from the opening
          sentence, which said that though I did not care about what was going on in Spain, you
          would yet write and tell me of it: but in point of fact you only answered my remark about
          the forum and senate-house. "But your town-house," you say, "is a forum." What do I want
          with a town-house itself, if I have no forum? Ruined, ruined, my dear Atticus! That has
          been the case for a long while, I know: but it is only now that I confess it, when I have
          lost the one thing that bound me to life. Accordingly, I seek solitude: and yet, if any
          necessity does take me to Rome, I shall try, if I possibly can—and I know I can—to let no
          one perceive my grief except you, and not even you if it can by any means be avoided. And,
          besides, there is this reason for my not coming. You remember the questions Aledius asked
          you. If they are so troublesome even now, what do you think they will be, if I come to
          Rome? Yes, settle about Terentia in the sense of your letter; and relieve me from this
          addition—though not the heaviest—to my bitter sorrows. To shew you that, though in
          mourning, I am not prostrate, listen to this. You have entered in your Chronicle the
          consulship in which Carneades and the famous embassy came to Rome. I want to know now what
          the reason of it was. It was about Oropus I think, but am not certain. And if so, what
          were the points in dispute? <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <date when="-00155">B.C. 155</date>
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Carneades</foreign> the Academic, Diogenes the Stoic, and
            Critolaus the Peripatetic came to Rome to plead against the fine of 500 talents imposed
            on Athens for a raid upon Oropus. </note> And farther, who was the best known Epicurean
          of that time and head of the Garden at Athens? Also who were the famous political writers
          at Athens? These facts too, I think, you can ascertain from the book of Apollodorus. <pb
            n="217"/>
          <milestone unit="para"/>I am sorry to hear about Attica; but since it is a mild attack, I
          feel confident of all going well. About Gamala I had no doubt. For why otherwise was his
          father Ligus so fortunate ? <note n="1" anchored="true">We know nothing of the persons
            named. It seems to refer to some instances mentioned by Cicero in his <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Consolatio</foreign> of a son (or daughter) of eminent qualities lost in
            the father's lifetime. </note> For what could I say of myself, who am in-capable of
          having my grief removed, though all my wishes should be gratified. I had heard of the
          price put on Drusus's suburban pleasure-grounds, which you mention, and, as I think, it
          was yesterday that I wrote to you about it: but be the price what it may, what one is
          obliged to have is a good bargain. In my eyes, whatever you think—for I know what I think
          of myself—it brings a certain alleviation, if not of sorrow, yet of my sense of solemn
          obligation. I have written to Sicca because he is intimate with L. Cotta. If we don't come
          to terms about pleasure-grounds beyond the Tiber, Cotta has some at Ostia in a very
          frequented situation, though confined as to space. Enough, however, and more than enough
          for this purpose. Please think the matter over. And don't be afraid of the cost of the
          pleasure-grounds. I don't want plate, nor rich furniture coverings, nor particular
          picturesque spots: I want this. I perceive too by whom I can be aided. But speak to Silius
          about it. There's no better fellow. I have also given Sicca a commission. He has written
          back to say that he has made an appointment with him. He will therefore write and tell me
          what he has arranged, and then you must see to it. </p>

        <p> I am much obliged to Aulus Silius for having settled the business: for I did not wish to
          disavow him, and yet I was <pb n="218"/> nervous as to what I could afford. Settle about
          Ovia on the terms you mention. As to my son, it seems time to arrange. But I want to know
          whether he can get a draft changed at Athens, or whether he must take the money with him.
          And with regard to the whole affair, pray consider how and when you think that he ought to
          go. You will be able to learn from Aledius whether Publilius is going to Africa, and when:
          please inquire and write me word. <milestone unit="para"/>To return to my own triflings,
          pray inform me whether Publius Crassus, son of Venuleia, died in the lifetime of his
          father P. Crassus the ex-consul, as I seem to remember that he did, or after it. I also
          want to know about Regillus, son of Lepidus, whether I am right in remembering that his
          father survived him. Pray settle the business about Cispius, as also about Precius. As to

        <p> Sicca has written to me fully about Silius, and says that he has reported the matter to
          you—as you too mention in your letter. I am satisfied both with the property and the
          terms, only I should prefer paying ready money to assigning property at a valuation. For
          Silius will not care to have mere show-places: while, though I can get on with my present
          rents, I can scarcely do so with less. How am I to pay ready money? You can get 600
          sestertia (about £4,800) from Hermogenes, especially if it is absolutely necessary, and I
          find I have 6oo in hand. For the rest of the purchase money I will even pay interest to
          Silius, pending the raising of the money from Faberius or from some debtor of Faberius. I
          shall besides get some from other quarters. But manage the whole business yourself. I, in
          fact, much prefer these suburban pleasure-grounds to those <pb n="219"/> of Drusus: and
          the latter have never been regarded as on a level with them. Believe me, I am actuated by
          a single motive, as to which I know that I am infatuated. But pray continue as before to
          indulge my aberration. You talk about a "solace for my old age": that is all over and done
          with; my objects now are quite different. </p>

        <p> SICCA says in his letter that, even if he has not concluded the business with Aulus
          Silius, he is coming to me on the 23rd. Your engagements are sufficient excuse in my eyes,
          for I know what they are. Of your wish to be with me, or rather your strong desire and
          yearning, I feel no doubt. You mention Nicias : <note n="1" anchored="true">A learned
            grammarian of Cos, who was with Cicero in <foreign xml:lang="la">Cilicia</foreign> (vol.
            ii., p.221). </note> if I were in a frame of mind to enjoy his cultivated conversation,
          there is no one whom I would have preferred to have with me. But solitude and retirement
          are now my proper sphere. And it was because Sicca is likely to be content with them, that
          I am the more looking forward to his visit. Besides, you know how delicate our friend
          Nicias is, how particular about his comforts and his habitual diet. Why should I consent
          to be a nuisance to him, when I am not in a state of mind to receive any pleasure from
          him? However, I am gratified by his wish. Your letter was all on one subject, <note n="2"

            for the repayment of her dowry. </note> as to which I have resolved to make no answer.

        <p> As to the bargain with Silius, though I am acquainted with the terms, still I expect to
          hear all about it today from Sicca. Cotta's property, with which you say that you are not
          acquainted, is beyond Silius's villa, which I think you do know: it is a shabby and very
          small house, with no farm land, and with sufficient ground for no purpose except for what
          I want it. What I am looking out for is a frequented position. But if the bargain for
          Silius's pleasure-grounds is completed, that is, if you complete it—for it rests entirely
          with you—there is of course no occasion for us to be thinking about Cotta's. As to my son,
          I will do as you say: I will leave the date to him. Please see that he is able to draw for
          what money he needs. If you have been able to get anything out of Aledius, as you say,
          write me word. I gather from your letter, as you certainly will from mine, that we neither
          of us have anything to say. Yet I cannot omit writing to you day after day on the same
          subjects—now worn threadbare—in order to get a letter from you. Still, tell me anything
          you know about Brutus. For I suppose he knows by this time where to expect Pansa. If; as
          usual, on the frontier of his province, it seems likely that he will be at Rome about the
          1st of April. I could wish that it might be later: for I have many motives for shunning
          the city. <note n="1" anchored="true">Cicero thinks he will be forced to go to Rome to

        <p> I have learnt nothing more about Silius from Sicca in conversation than I knew from his
          letter: for he had written in full detail If; therefore, you have an interview with him,
          write and tell me your views. As to the subject on which you say a message was sent to me,
          whether it was sent or not I don't know; at any rate not a word has reached me. Pray
          therefore go on as you have begun, and if you come to any settlement on such terms as to
          satisfy her—though I, for my part, think it impossible-take my son with you on your visit,
          if you think it right. It is of some importance to him to seem to have wished to do
          something to please. I have no interest in it beyond what you know, which I regard as
          important. <milestone unit="para"/>You call upon me to resume my old way of life: well, it
          had long been my practice to bewail the republic, and that I was still doing, though
          somewhat less violently, for I had something capable of giving me ease. Now I positively
          pursue the old way of life and old employments; nor do I think that in that matter I ought
          to care for the opinion of others. My own feeling is more in my eyes than the talk of them
          all. As to finding consolation for myself in literature, I am content with my amount of
          success. I have lessened the outward signs of mourning: my sorrow I neither could, nor
          would have wished to lessen if I could. <milestone unit="para"/>About Triarius you rightly
          interpret my wishes. But take no step unless the family are willing. I love him though he
          is no more, I am guardian to his children, I am attached to the whole household. As to the
          business of Castricius,—if Castricius will accept a sum for the slaves, and that at the
          present value of money, certainly nothing could be more advantageous. But if it has come
          to the point of his taking the slaves themselves away, I don't think it is fair, <pb
            n="222"/> as you ask me to tell you what I really think: for I don't want my brother
          Quintus to have any trouble, and in that I think I have gathered that you agree with me.
          If Publilius is waiting for the aequinox—as you say that Aledius tells you—I think he must
          be on the point of sailing. He told me, however, that he was going by way of Sicily. <note
            n="1" anchored="true">Publilius, brother of Cicero's second wife, was going to Africa.
            The question is whether he is going by the long sea voyage from Rome, or the overland
            route by Sicily. </note> Which of the two it is, and when, I should like to know. And I

        <p> SILIUS, you say, sees you today. Tomorrow therefore, or rather as soon as you can, you
          will write and tell me, if there is anything to tell after you have seen him. I neither
          avoid Brutus, nor after all expect any consolation from him. But there are reasons for my
          not wishing to be at Rome at the present juncture; and if those reasons remain in force, I
          must find some excuse with Brutus, and as at present advised they seem likely to remain in
          force. About the suburban pleasure-grounds do, I beseech you, come to some conclusion. The
          main point is what you know it to be. Another thing is that I want something of the sort
          for myself: for I cannot exist in a crowd, nor yet remain away from you. For this plan of
          mine I find nothing more suitable than the spot you mention, and on that matter pray tell

          <milestone unit="para"/>I am quite convinced—and the more so because I perceive that you

          only possible if the business of Faberius <note n="1" anchored="true">Caesar's

          whether they will promise the future payment. Even if I must sustain some loss in taking
          ready money, induce them to go as far as they can in the matter—for payment in full is
          hopeless. You will discover, in fact, whether they are at all disposed to assist my
          design. If they are so, it is a great help; if not, let us push on in any way we can. Look
          upon it—as you say in your letter—as a solace for my old age, or as a pro-vision for my
          grave. The property at Ostia is not to be thought of. If we can't get this one—and I don't
          think Lamia will sell—we must try that of Damasippus. </p>

        <p> As I wrote to you yesterday, if Silius is the sort of man you think and Drusus will not

          on the Tiber into lots of I don't know how many acres apiece, with a fixed price for each,
          the amount of which is not known to me. Write and tell me therefore whatever you have
          settled upon. I am very much troubled about our dear Attica's ill-health: it almost makes
          me fear that some indiscretion has been committed. Yet the good character of her tutor,

          letter. You see what an unpleasant business it is. I wrote back to say that it would be
          even more painful than it was when I told her that I wished to be alone, and that
          therefore I did not wish her to come to see me at this time. I thought that, if I made no
          answer, she would come with her mother: now I don't think she will. For it is evident that
          her letter is not her own composition. Now this is the very thing I wish to avoid, which I
          see will occur-namely, that they will come to my house: and the one way of avoiding it is
          to fly away. I would rather not, but I must. I beg you to find out the last day I can
          remain here without being caught. Act, as you say, with moderation. <milestone unit="para"
          />I would have you propose to my son, that is, if you think it fair, to adapt the expenses
          of this sojourn abroad to what he would have been quite content with, if; as he thought of
          doing, he had remained at Rome and hired a house—I mean to the rents of my property in the
          Argiletum and Aventine And in making that proposal to him, pray arrange the rest of the
          business for our supplying him with what he needs from those rents. I will guarantee that
          neither Bibulus nor Acidinus nor Messalla, who I hear are to be at Athens, <pb n="226"/>
          will spend more than the sum to be received from these rents. Therefore, please
          investigate who the tenants are and what their rent is, and take care that the tenant is a
          man to pay to the day. See also what journey money and outfit will suffice. There is
          Certainly no need of a carriage and horses at Athens. For such as he wants for the journey
          there is enough and to spare at home, as you observe yourself. </p>

        <p> SICCA expresses surprise at Silius having changed his mind. He makes his son the excuse,
          and I don't think it a bad one, for he is a son after his own heart. Accordingly, I am
          more surprised at your saying that you think he will sell, if we would include something
          else which he is anxious to get rid of, as he had of his own accord determined not to do
          so. You ask me to fix my maximum price and to say how muck I prefer those pleasure grounds
          of Drusus. I have never set foot in them. I know Coponius's villa to be old and not very
          spacious, the wood a fine one, but I don't know what either brings in, and that after all
          I think we ought to know. But for me either one or the other is to be valued by my
          occasion for it rather than by the market price. Pray consider whether I could acquire
          them or not. If I were to sell my claim on Faberius, I don't doubt my being able to settle
          for the grounds of Silius even by a ready money payment, if he could only be induced to
          sell. If he had none for sale, I would have recourse to Drusus, even at the large price at
          which Egnatius told you that he was willing to sell. For Hermogenes can give me great
          assistance in finding the money. But I beg you to allow me the disposition of an eager
          purchaser; yet, though I am under the influence of this eagerness and of my sorrow, I am
          willing to be ruled by you. <pb n="227"/>

          as <pb n="238"/> in order to attain as nearly as possible to an apotheosis. This I could
          do if I built it in the villa itself, but, as we often observed to each other, I dread the
          changes of owners. Wherever I constructed it on the land, I think I could secure that
          posterity should respect its sanctity. <note n="1" anchored="true">By exempting it from
            following the proprietorship of the land. Such monuments had on them the letters H. M.

          as I do in taking you. But if you approve of the idea, the site, and the plan, pray read

        <p> I received two letters from you yesterday, the first delivered on the previous day to
          Hilarus, the other on the same day to a letter-carrier; and I learnt from my freedman
          Aegypta, on the same day, that Pilia and Attica were quite well. Thanks for Brutus's
          letter. He wrote me a letter also, which did not reach me till the 13th day. I am <pb

          pleasure-grounds, which you really must find me, if you value me as highly as I am sure
          you do, I much approve of your suggestion as to the Tusculan site. However acute in
          hitting on plans you may be, as you are, yet unless you had been very anxious for me to
          secure what I greatly wished, that idea could never have come into your head so aptly. But
          somehow or other what I want is a frequented spot. So you must manage to get me some
          suburban pleasure-grounds. This is best to be found on Scapula's land: besides, there is
          the nearness to the city, so that you can go there without spending the whole day at the
          villa. Therefore, before you leave town, I should much like you to call on Otho, <note

            one of his heirs. </note> if he is at Rome. If it comes to nothing, I shall succeed in
          making you angry with me, however accustomed you are to putting up with my folly. For
          Drusus at least is willing to sell. So, even if nothing else turns up, it will be my own
          fault if I don't buy. Pray take care that I don't make a mistake in this business. The
          only way of making certain of that is our being able to get some of Scapula's land. Also
          let me know how long you intend being in your suburban villa. With Terentia I need your
          power of conciliation as well as your influence. But do as you think right. For I know
          that whatever is to my interest is a subject of more anxiety to you than to myself. </p>

        <p> You think that by this time my composure of spirit ought to be en evidence, and you say

          your letters: if anybody supposes me to be crushed in spirit and unmanned, let them know
          the amount of my literary labours and their nature. I believe, if they are only reasonable
          men, they would think, if I am so far recovered as to bring a disengaged mind to writing
          on difficult subjects, that I am not open to their criticism; or if I have selected a
          diversion from sorrow in the highest degree noble and worthy of a scholar, that I even
          deserve to be praised. But though I do everything I can to relieve my sorrow, pray bring
          to a conclusion what I see that you are as much concerned about as I am myself. I regard
          this as a debt, the burden of which cannot be lightened unless I pay it, or see a
          possibility of paying it, that is, unless I find a site such as I wish. If Scapula's
          heirs, as you say that Otho told you, think of cutting up the pleasure-grounds into four
          lots, and bidding for them between themselves, there is of course no room for a purchaser.
          But if they are to come into the market we will see what can be done. For that ground once
          belonging to Publicius, and now to Trebonius and Cusinius, has been suggested to me. But
          you know it is a town building site. I don't like it at all. Clodia's I like very much,
          but I don't think they are for sale. As to Drusus's pleasure-grounds, though you say that
          you dislike them, I shall take refuge in them after all, unless you find something. I
          don't mind the building, for I shall build nothing that I should not build even if I don't

          not writing was what you mentioned yesterday in the very epistle to which I am now
          replying. Yet, after all, I was expecting to hear something from you about Asinius
          Pollio's letter. But I am too apt to judge of your leisure by my own. However, if nothing
          imperative occurs, I absolve you from the necessity of writing, unless you are quite at
          leisure. About the letter-carriers I would have done as you suggest, had there been any
          letters positively necessary, as there were some time ago, when, though the days were
          shorter, the carriers nevertheless arrived every day up to time, and there was something
          to say-about Silius, Drusus, and certain other things. At present, if Otho had not cropped
          up, there would have been nothing to write about: and even that has been deferred.
          Nevertheless, I feel relieved when I talk to you at a distance, and much more even when I

          Well or ill is not the question: but the substance of my writings was such as no one could
          have composed who was broken down in spirit. I have been <pb n="244"/> thirty days in your
          suburban villa. <note n="1" anchored="true">That is during April, in which there are no
            letters to <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign>. I do not think in <foreign
              xml:lang="la">hortis</foreign> can refer to <foreign xml:lang="la">Astura</foreign>.
            It is always used of a suburban residence or grounds. </note> Who ever failed to find me
          at home or reluctant to converse? At this very moment the amount of my reading and writing
          is such that my people find a holiday more laborious than I do working days. If anyone
          wants to know why I am not at Rome,—"because it is the vacation." Or why I am not staying
          at the humble places of mine on this coast, which are now in season,—"because I should
          have been annoyed by the crowd of visitors there." I am therefore staying at the place,
          where the man who considered Baiae the queen of watering-places used year after year to
          spend this part of the season. When I come to Rome I will give no cause for unfavourable
          remark either by my look or my conversation. That cheerfulness by which I used to temper
          the sadness of the situation I have lost for ever; but firmness and fortitude either of
          heart or speech will not be found wanting. As to Scapula's pleasure-grounds, it seems
          possible that as a favour, partly to you and partly to me, we might secure their being put
          up to auction. Unless that is done, we shall be cut out. But if we come to a public
          auction, we shall outbid Otho's means by our eagerness. For as to what you say about
          Lentulus, he is not solvent. <note n="2" anchored="true">I suggest <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >non est solvendo</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="la">non est in eo</foreign> (cp.
              <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 2.4">Phil. 2.4</bibl>). Others suggest <foreign xml:lang="la">non
              extimesco</foreign> (Madvig), <foreign xml:lang="la">non timeo</foreign> (Tyrrell and
            Purser). Taking <foreign xml:lang="la">solvendo</foreign>, the reference would be to
            some (to us unknown) Lentulus who was said to be wishing to buy the <foreign
              xml:lang="la">horti Scapulani</foreign>. </note> If only the Faberian business is
          certain, <note n="3" anchored="true">The recovery of his debt from Faberius. See p.223.
          </note> and you are making an effort, as I am sure you are doing, we shall get what we
          want. You ask how long I am staying on here. Only a few days: but I am not certain. As
          soon as I have settled, I will write to you: and write to me yourself, and tell me how
          long you intend to be in your suburban villa. The day on which I am sending this to you, I
          have the same news as you give me about Pilia and Attica, both by letter and messenger.

        <p> I never desired you to have a regular day for writing: for I understood the state of
          things you mention, <note n="1" anchored="true">Of <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Atticus</foreign> being very busy. See p.242. </note> and yet I suspected or rather
          was quite aware that there was nothing for you to tell me. On the 10th of the month,
          indeed, I think you must be out of town and quite see that you have no news to give.
          However, I shall continue sending you a letter nearly every day. For I prefer writing for
          nothing to your not having a carrier at hand to whom to give a letter, if anything does
          turn up which you think I ought to know. Accordingly, I have received on the 10th your
          letter with its dearth of news. For what was there for you to send? To me however that was
          not unpleasing, whatever it contained, even if I learnt nothing else but that you had
          nothing to tell me. Yet, after all, you did say something-about Clodia. Where then is she,
          and when does she arrive? I like her property so much, that I put it next to Otho's above
          all others. But I don't think that she will sell, for she likes it and is rich: and as for
          that other, you are quite aware of the difficulty. But pray let us exert ourselves to hit
          upon some way of obtaining what I desire. I think <pb n="247"/> of leaving this place on
          the 16th: but it will be either to Tusculum or my town house, and thence perhaps to
          Arpinum. when I know for certain I will write you word. </p>

        <p> I have nothing to write about. However, I want to know where you are: if you are out of
          town or about to be so, when you intend to return. Please, therefore, let me know. And, as
          you wish to be informed when I leave this place, I write to tell you that I have arranged
          to stay at Lanuvium on the 16th, thence next day at Tusculum or Rome. Which of the two I
          am going to do you shall know on the day itself. You know how misery is inclined to
          grumble. It is not at all in regard to yourself, yet I feel a restless desire as to the
          shrine. I don't say unless it is built, but unless I see it being built—I venture to say
          this much, and you will take it as you ever do words of mine—my vexation will redound upon
          you, not that you deserve that it should do so; but you will have to endure what I say, as
          you endure and always have endured everything that affects me. Pray <pb n="249"/>
          concentrate all your methods of consoling me upon this one thing. If you want to know my
          wishes, they are these: first Scapula's, second Clodia's; then, if Silius refuses and
          Drusus does not behave fairly, the property of Cusinius and Trebonius. I think there is a
          third owner; I know for certain that Rebilus was one. If however you are for Tusculum, as
          you hinted in one of your letters, I will agree to your suggestion. Pray bring this
          business to a conclusion in any case, if you wish me to feel consoled. You are already
          finding fault with me in somewhat severer terms than is customary with you; but you do so
          with the utmost affection, and perhaps tired out by my weakness. Yet all the same, if you
          wish me to be consoled, this is the very greatest of consolations and, if you would know
          the truth, the only one. <milestone unit="para"/>If you have read Hirtius's letter, which
          appears to me to be a kind of "first sketch" of the invective which Caesar has composed
          against Cato, please let me know, when you can conveniently do so, what you think of it.
          To return to the shrine: unless it is finished this summer, which you perceive is all
          before us, I shall not consider myself cleared of positive guilt. </p>

        <p> IT has occurred to me to remind you to do the very thing which you are doing. For I
          think you can transact the business you have in hand more conveniently at home by
          preventing any interruption. For myself, I intend, as I told you before, to stay at
          Lanuvium on the 16th, and thence to go to Tusculum or Rome. You shall know which of the
          two. You say truly that this erection will be a consolation to me. Thank you for saying
          so: but it is a consolation to <pb n="250"/> a degree beyond what you can conceive. <note
            n="1" anchored="true">The text of this clause is very corrupt. I have translated the
            reading of Tyrrell and Purser. </note> It is a sufficient proof of how keenly desirous I
          am for it, that I venture to confess it to you, though I think you do not approve of it so
          very warmly. But you must put up with my aberration in this matter. Put up with it, do I
          say? Nay, you must even assist it. About Otho I feel uncertain: perhaps because I am eager
          for it. But after all the property is beyond my means, especially with a competitor in the
          field anxious to purchase, rich, and one of the heirs. The next to my taste is Clodia's.
          But if that can't be secured, make any bargain you please. I regard myself as under a more
          sacred obligation than anyone ever was to any vow. See also about the pleasure-grounds of
          Trebonius, though the owners are away. But, as I said yesterday, please also consider the
          Tusculan suggestion, lest the summer slip away. That must not be allowed on any account.

        <p> THAT Hirtius wrote to you in an agitated tone about me does not trouble me—for he meant
          it kindly—and that you did not forward me his letter troubles me much less. For that was
          even kinder of you. His book which he sent me about Cato I wish to be published by your
          copyists, to enhance Cato's reputation from the nature of their invectives. <milestone
            unit="para"/>So you are negotiating through Mustela: well, he is well suited for the
          purpose, and much attached to me since the affair of Pontianus. Therefore make some
          bargain or other. Why, what else is wanted except an opening for a purchaser? And that
          could be secured by means of any one of the heirs. But I think Mustela will accomplish
          that, if <pb n="251"/> you ask him. For myself, you will have secured for me not only a
          site for the purpose I have at heart, but also a solace for my old age. For the properties
          of Silius and Drusus do not seem to me to be sufficiently suited to a paterfamilias. What!
          spend whole days in the country house! <note n="1" anchored="true">That is, the property
            is too far from Rome, and would necessitate staying a night there. It could not be
            visited for a few hours. </note> My preference therefore is-first Otho's, second
          Clodia's. If neither of them comes off; we must try and outwit Drusus, or have recourse to
          the Tusculan site. You have acted prudently in shutting yourself in your house. But pray
          finish off your business and let me find you once more at leisure. I leave this place for
          Lanuvium, as I told you, on the 16th. Next day I shall be at Tusculum. For I have well
          disciplined my feelings, and perhaps conquered them, if only I keep to it. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">From these and some similar expressions afterwards it has been inferred
            that <foreign xml:lang="la">Tullia</foreign> died at <foreign xml:lang="la"

          </note> You shall know, therefore, perhaps tomorrow, at the latest the day after.
            <milestone unit="para"/>But what does this mean, pray? Philotimus reports that Pompeius
          is not invested at Carteia, and that a serious war remains to be fought. Oppius and Balbus
          had sent me a copy of a letter written to Clodius of Patavium on this investment, saying
          that they thought it was so. It is just like Philotimus to act the second-rate Fulvinius.
            <note n="3" anchored="true">We know nothing of Fulvinius: he must have been notorious
            for spreading false news. Philotimus was so also (see vol. ii., p. 384). Very
            characteristically the report was true in fact, though only half the truth. Gnaeus
            Pompeius was not invested at <foreign xml:lang="la">Carteia</foreign>, for he escaped on
            board ship. But not long afterwards he was killed when landing to take in water. See
            p.240. </note> Nevertheless, tell me anything you know. About the shipwreck of Caninius
          also I want to know the truth. <note n="4" anchored="true">See p.240. </note>

          Anything rather than not have it completed this summer. For myself, considering my

        <p> I FELT all along how much good your presence was doing me, but I feel it much more since
          your departure. <pb n="256"/> Wherefore, as I wrote to you before, either I must come
          bodily to you or you to me, as may be possible. Yesterday, not much after you left my
          house, I think, some men from the city, as they seemed, brought me a message and a letter
          from "Gaius Marius, son of Gaius, grandson of Gains," <note n="1" anchored="true">Cicero
            quotes the full description that this man gave of himself. He was apparently an <foreign
              xml:lang="la">impostor</foreign> named Amatias or Herophilus (a veterinary surgeon),
            but he claimed to be a grandson of the great Marius, and therefore a relation of Caesar,
            whose aunt Iulia was wife of Marius. He met the young Octavius on his return after
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Munda</foreign>, and begged him to acknowledge his
            relationship, but was cautiously though politely declined. After Caesar's assassination
            he again made a parade of his relationship by putting up the column raised to mark the
            spot in the forum where Caesar's body was burnt; this became the <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >centre</foreign> of much rioting, and Antony at length interfered and put the
            would-be Marius to death. See Letters DCCV, DCCVI, DCCVII; Nicolas Dam. vit. Caes. 14;
            Valer. Max. 1.15,.2; App. B.C. iii. 2, 3. Cicero would be his quasi-relation through his
            grandmother Gratidia, whose brother adopted the younger Marius, the impostor's supposed
            father. L. Cassius the orator had a daughter married to this same younger Marius, and
            therefore claimed by the <foreign xml:lang="la">impostor</foreign> as his mother.
          </note> written at great length: "they begged me in the name of our relationship to them,
          in the name of the famous Marius on whom I had composed a poem, <note n="2"
            anchored="true">See vol. i., Introduction, p. xiv. </note> in the name of the eloquence
          of his grandfather L. Cassius, to undertake his defence,"—he then stated his case in full
          detail. I wrote back to say that he had no need of counsel, as all power was in the hands
          of his relation Caesar, who was a most excellent and fair-minded man, but that I would
          support him. <milestone unit="para"/>What times we live in! To think that Curtius should

          </note> it is as you say. Yet what I should like to know is when the auction is to be. I
          see you are of opinion that the letter should be sent to Caesar. Well! I was very much of
          that opinion also, and the more so that there is not a word in it unbecoming the most
          loyal of citizens, that is, as loyal as the state of the times permit, to which all
          political writers teach us that we must bow. But observe, I stipulate that your Caesarian
          friends read it first. <note n="3" anchored="true">He means Oppius and Balbus. </note> So
          please see to it. But unless you clearly understand that they approve, it must not be

        <p> You know L. Tullius Montanus, who has gone abroad with my son. I have received a letter

          that subject. I should be much obliged if you could assist him either by making an

        <p> In your letter to my son you spoke with a serious gravity, and yet with a moderation
          which nothing could surpass. It is exactly what I should have wished. Your letters to the
          Tullii <note n="1" anchored="true">Marcianus and Montanus of the previous letter, both at

          money moreover I perceive that you are making every effort or rather have done so. If you

          which I have resolved to carry out. And in regard to this you relieve my impatience by
          your promise, or rather your undertaking as to this summer. In the second place, there is
          nothing that can possibly be better adapted for my declining years and for an alleviation
          of my melancholy. My eagerness for this drives me at times to wish to spur you on. But I
          suppress the impulse: for I have no doubt that, when you know me to be very much set on a
          thing, your eagerness will surpass my own. Accordingly I look upon it as already done.
            <milestone unit="para"/>I am anxious to hear what those friends of yours <note n="1"

        <p> I had always determined, and on very good grounds, that your friends should read my
          letter to Caesar before it was sent. If I had acted otherwise, I should have been wanting
          in courtesy to them, and almost rash in regard to my own danger in case my letter should
          prove offensive to him. Now your friends have acted frankly, and have obliged me by not
          suppressing their opinion; but best of all by suggesting so many alterations, that I have
          no reason for writing it all over again. And yet, in the matter of the Parthian war, what
          ought I to have kept in view except what I thought was Caesar's wish ? <note n="1"
            anchored="true">The Parthians were again threatening Syria, and Caesar seems to have let
            it be known that he wished to lead an army against them. He was, in fact, preparing to
            do so when he was assassinated. </note> What, in fact, was the point of my letter at all
          except to say smooth things to him ? <note n="2" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">kolakei/a</foreign>, a strong word. Speaking frankly to <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign>, Cicero makes no concealment of his real dislike of
            Caesar's policy and of his own unwilling submission to force majeure. </note> Do you
          suppose that if I had wanted to give him the advice which I thought best, I should have
          been at a loss for language? Therefore the whole letter is altogether superfluous. For
          when no great "hit" is possible, and a "miss," however slight, would bring unpleasant
          consequences, what need to run the risk? Especially as it occurs to me that, as I have not
          written to him before, he will think that I should probably not have written had not the
          war been over. Moreover, I fear his thinking that I meant <pb n="262"/> this as a sop for
          my "Cato." There is no more to be said. I am extremely sorry I wrote it; nor could
          anything in this affair have fallen out more in accordance with my wishes, than to find
          that my intrusion is not approved. For I should have found myself also involved with that

          us devote our efforts to Faberius. How ever, tell me the day of the auction, if you know
          it. The bearer of this has just come from Cumae, and as he reported that Attica was quite

        <p> As you are going to inspect the pleasure-grounds today, I shall hear of course tomorrow
          what you think of them. About Faberius again you will write when he has arrived. As to the
          letter to Caesar, believe my solemn assertion, -I cannot! Nor is it the dishonour of the
          thing that deters me, though it ought to do so most of all. For where is the disgrace of
          flattery, in view of the disgrace of living at all? But as I began by saying, it is not
          the dishonour that deters me: and, indeed, I only wish it could—for then I should have
          been the man I ought to be—but I cannot think of anything to say. For those exhortations
          addressed to Alexander by men of eloquence and learning-think of the circumstances in
          which they were delivered! Here was a young man fired with ambition for the purest glory,
          desiring to have some suggestions made to him as to how to win undying fame, and they
          exhort him to follow honour. <pb n="263"/> There is no lack of something to say in such a
          case. But what can I say? Nevertheless, I had roughhewn what seemed to me a kind of model.
          Because there were some things in it which were slightly coloured beyond the actual
          facts-present and past-adverse criticism is provoked, and I am not sorry for it. For if
          that letter had reached its destination, believe me, I should have repented it. Why, don't
          you see that even that famous pupil of Aristotle, distinguished for the very best ability
          and the most perfect conduct, no sooner got the title of king than he became haughty,
          cruel, and ungovernable? Well now, do you think that this god of the procession, this
          messmate of Quirinus, <note n="1" anchored="true">Alluding to Caesar's statue in the
            temple of Quirinus (see p.255), and to his bust being carried with those of the gods in

          be gratified by temperate letters such as I should write? In truth, I would rather that he
          felt annoyed at not receiving what I had not written, than disapprove of what I had. In
          fine, let it be as he pleases. What was goading me on to action, at the time I put the
          "Archimedian problem" <note n="2" anchored="true">See p.85. </note> before you, is now all
          gone. By Heaven, I am now actually desirous—and much more earnestly—of that same
          misfortune of which I was then afraid, <note n="3" anchored="true">Of losing a hold upon
            Caesar's favour. This shews a decided change in the tone of Cicero's references to
            Caesar. The extraordinary honours voted to him after the news of Munda—among which was
            the life dictatorship—may account for this, as destroying all hope of a constitutional

          Dolabella—for I read the letter-has gone against my will, yet at the same time on my

          steady and of good character. But what follows did not seem to me to be satisfactory. He

          Faberius, let us purchase even at a high price: if not, we can't do it even at a low one.
          So then we must go to Clodia. From her also I seem to have more hope, because, in the

          to which I should expect you today or tomorrow. But while longing for your arrival, it is
          I after all, as I think, who will hinder you. For I don't suppose the Faberius business
          will be so promptly settled, even if it is ever to be so, as not to cause some delay. Come
          when you can then, since your arrival is still deferred. I should be much obliged if you
          would send me the books of Dicaearchus which you mention: add also the book of the

          Caesar, my mind is made up. And yet the very thing which your friends assert that be
          writes—that he will not go against the Parthians until everything is settled at home—is
          exactly the advice I gave all through that letter. I told him to do whichever he chose:
          that he might rely on my support. No doubt he is waiting for that, and is not likely to do
          anything except on my advice! Pray let us dismiss all such follies, and let us at least be

          enjoy your society. As to the price however, the following occurs to me. Gaius Albanius is
          the nearest neighbour: he bought 1,000 iugera of M. Pilius, as far as I can remember, for
          11,500 sestertia. <note n="2" anchored="true">A 1,000 <foreign xml:lang="la"

        <p> I am sending you back Q. Cicero's letter. <note n="2" anchored="true">The younger
            Quintus Cicero was with Caesar in Spain. He appears to have written to his uncle
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign>, making the most of his adventures. His habit
            of romancing is again illustrated in Letter DCCL (<bibl n="Cic. Att. 15.21">Att.
              15.21</bibl>). Some editors put this paragraph (down to "today") at the end of Letter
            DCIII: but it seems no more in place there, and leaves this letter beginning with
              <foreign xml:lang="la">ei dedi</foreign>, without anyone for <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >ei</foreign> to refer to. </note> How hard-hearted of you not to be agitated by his
          dangers! He has something to say against me also. I am sending you half the letter. For
          the other half, with the account of his achievements, I think you have in duplicate. I
          have sent a letter-carrier to Cumae today. I have given him your letter to Vestorius,
          which you had given Pharnaces. I had just sent Demeas to you when Eros arrived, but there
          was nothing new in the letter he brought except that the auction was to last two days. So
          you will come after it is over, as you say; and I hope with the Faberius affair settled.
          But Eros says that he won't settle today: he thinks he will tomorrow morning. You must be
          very polite to him. But such flatteries are almost criminal. I shall see you, I hope, the
          day after tomorrow. If you can do so from any source, find out who Mummius's ten legates
          were. Polybius doesn't give their names. I remember the consular Albinus and <pb n="268"/>
          Spurius Mummius: I think Hortensius told me Tuditanus; but in Libo's annals Tuditanus was
          praetor fourteen years after Mummius's Consulship. That certainly doesn't square with it.
          I have in my mind a Political Conference, to be held at Olympia or where you will, after
          the manner of your friend Dicaearchus. <note n="1" anchored="true">He is referring to the

        <p> So the auction of Peducaeus is tomorrow. Come when you can, therefore. Although perhaps

        <p> Having received a second letter from you today I did not wish you to be content with
          only one from me. Yes, pray do as you say about Faberius. For on our success in that <pb
            n="269"/> depends entirely what I have in my mind. If that idea had never occurred to me
          I should, believe me, have been as in different to that as I am about everything else.
          Wherefore as you are doing at present—and I am sure it cannot be improved upon-push the
          matter on: don't let it rest: carry it through. Please send me both the books of
          Dicaearchus—on the "Soul" and on the "Descent." I can't find his "Tripoliticus" and his
          letter to Aristoxenus. I should be specially glad to have these three books; they would
          bear upon what I have in my mind. "Torquatus" is at Rome: I have ordered it to be given to
          you. "Catulus" and "Lucullus" I think you have already. To these books a new preface has
          been added, in which both of them are spoken of with commendation. I wish you to have
          these compositions, <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Literas</foreign> (see <foreign xml:lang="la">vo</foreign>1. i.,
            p.34). "Torquatus" means the first book of the <foreign xml:lang="la">de</foreign>
            Finibus, "Catulus" and "Lucullus" the first and second books of the <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Academica</foreign>, in which they are the speakers. </note> and there
          are some others. You didn't quite understand what I said to you about the ten legates, I
          suppose, because I wrote in shorthand. What I wanted to know was about Tuditanus.
          Hortensius once told me that he was one of the ten. I see in Libo's annals that he was
          praetor in the consulship of P. Popilius and P. Rupilius. <note n="2" anchored="true">
            <date when="-00132">B.C. 132</date>. </note> Could he have been a legatus fourteen years
          before he was praetor, unless his quaestorship was very late in life? <note n="3"
            anchored="true">For the ten commissioners in the Peloponnesus, see p.268. Cicero's
            difficulty is this. To be a commissioner in <date when="-00146">B.C. 146</date> a man
            must have been a senator, that is, he must at least have been quaestor in <date
              when="-00147">B.C. 147</date> (at latest). But if Tuditanus was quaestor in <date
              when="-00147">B.C. 147</date> and obtained the praetorship in his regular year
              (<foreign xml:lang="la">legitimo anno</foreign>) he would be praetor in <date
              when="-00139">B.C. 139</date>; whereas Tuditanus was not quaestor till <date
              when="-00145">B.C. 145</date> and praetor till <date when="-00132">B.C. 132</date>,
            seven years late. The solution is given in Letter DCXII. It was a son who was quaestor
            in <date when="-00145">B.C. 145</date>, praetor in <date when="-00132">B.C. 132</date>.
            The commissioner was his father and had held his offices (not, however, the consulship)
            many years before, and therefore was eligible for the commissionership in <date
              when="-00146">B.C. 146</date>. </note> And I don't think that that was so. For I
          notice that he easily obtained which Polybius was employed to explain to the inhabitants.
          The labours of the commissioners occupied six months, and Polybius thinks that they did a
          very noble piece of work in the way of constitution-building. Hence Cicero meant to choose
          them as speakers in a dialogue on constitutions, which, however, was never composed (<bibl
            n="TLG543.1 39.15">Polyb. 39.15</bibl>-16). <pb n="270"/> the curule magistracies in his
          regular years. However, I did not know that Postumius, whose statue you say you remember
          in the Isthmus, was one of them. He is the man who was consul with L. Lucullus. <note

        <p> Yes, the debtors you mention appear to be so satisfactory that my only hesitation arises
          from the fact that you seem to have doubts. The fact is, I don't like your referring the
          matter to me. What! was I to manage my own business without your advice? But, after all, I
          quite understand that you do so more from your habitual caution than because you doubt the
          soundness of the debtors. The fact is, you don't think well of Caelius, and you don't want
          a multiplicity of debtors. In both sentiments I concur. We must therefore be content with
          the present list. <note n="2" anchored="true">The question is of certain debts due to
            Faberius, which he offers to assign to Cicero in payment of the money owed to him (see
            p.265). Cicero is satisfied with the list of names; but <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Atticus</foreign> would rather have had one name, or at least fewer, and yet does not
            approve of the substitution of Caelius for all or some of them. Thereupon Cicero says
            that they had better make the best of the list as it stands. </note> Sooner or later,
          indeed, you would have had to go security for me even in the auction with which we are now
          concerned. <note n="3" anchored="true">The auction of the <foreign xml:lang="la">horti
              Scapulani</foreign> which Cicero had contemplated buying for Tullia's shrine. He goes
            on to say that <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign>, no doubt, would have to be his
            security for the purchase-money till the debts above-mentioned were got in, but a
            corresponding time of grace can be obtained from the vendors, so that Atticus's
            guarantee would not be called upon, and the money would be paid out of his own pocket.
            This sense I think can be fairly got from the text as given by Tyrrell </note> All then

          Laelius. But you proved to demonstration that I was wrong. Now Brutus and Fannius refute
          you. However, I had good authority—that of Hortensius—for my statement as it appears in

        <p> The Tuditanus you mention—great-grandfather of Hortensius—I was quite unacquainted with,

          certain that Spurius Mummius was at Corinth. For the Spurius of our time, lately dead,
          frequently used to recite to me his letters written in witty verse sent to his friends
          from Corinth. But I feel sure he was legatus to his brother, not one of the ten. And,
          besides, I have been taught that it was not the custom of our ancestors to nominate on a
          commission men who were related to the imperators, as we—in our ignorance of the best
          principles of government, or rather from carelessness of them-sent Marcus Lucullus and
          Lucius Muraena and others closely connected with him as commissioners to Lucius Lucullus.

          reasonable, and is what I had suspected. But one must give in to your friends, unless you

        <p> You had only just left me yesterday when Trebonius arrived and a little later
          Curtius—the latter merely intending to call, but he stayed on being pressed. We have
          Trebatius with us. Early this morning Dolabella arrived. We had much talk to a late hour
          in the day. I cannot exaggerate its cordial and affectionate tone. However, we came at
          last to the subject of Quintus. <note n="2" anchored="true">The younger Quintus, who was
            with Caesar. </note> He told me many things beyond words-beyond expression: but there
          was one of such a kind that, had it not been notorious to the whole army, I should not
          have ventured, I don't say to dictate to Tiro, but even to write it with my own hand. But
          enough of that. Very opportunely, while I had Dolabella with me Torquatus arrived; and in
          the kindest manner Dolabella repeated to him what I had been saying. For I had been just
          speaking <pb n="281"/> with very great earnestness in his cause, <note n="1"
            anchored="true">In urging <foreign xml:lang="la">Dolabella</foreign> to stand his friend

            Athens. He appears now to have been allowed to return. See p.235. </note> an earnestness
          which seemed to gratify Torquatus. I am waiting to hear what news you have about Brutus.
          However, Nicias thinks that the matter is settled, but that the divorce <note n="2"
            anchored="true">From Claudia, to marry <foreign xml:lang="la">Porcia</foreign>. </note>
          does not find favour. <milestone unit="para"/>All the more am I anxious for the same thing

            Pompeian party. </note> For if any scandal has been caused, this step may put it right.
          I must go to Arpinum: for in the first place my small property there needs putting
          straight, and in the second place I fear I may not be able to leave town when once Caesar
          has come, as to whose arrival Dolabella has the same opinion as you had-founded on your

        <p> I am not at all surprised either at your sorrow in regard to Marcellus or at your
          misgiving as to increased sources of danger. For who would have feared such a thing as
          this <pb n="282"/> —a thing that had never happened before and which nature seemed to
          forbid the possibility of happening? Therefore there is nothing that may not be feared.
            <milestone unit="para"/>But this is an historical slip of yours—the last person I should
          have expected to make it—that "I am the sole remaining consular." Why, what do you think
          of Servius? <note n="1" anchored="true">Servius Sulpicius Rufus, <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >consul</foreign>
            <date when="-0051">B.C. 51</date>. <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign> must have
            meant that Cicero was the sole surviving consular of the militant Pompeian party. For
            several ex-consuls were still surviving. See a list of such consulars dead by <date
              when="-0044">B.C. 44</date> in <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 2.12">Phil. 2.12</bibl>. But
            perhaps, after all, he used the expression with that kind of careless exaggeration apt
            to rise to the lips at a sudden shock, such as the news of the assassination of
            Marcellus, and Cicero takes it too literally. </note> However, this survival has of
          course no value of any sort-especially to me, who think that their fate is no less happy
          than my own. For what am I, and what influence do I possess? Is it at home or abroad?
          Well, if it had not occurred to me to write my poor books, I shouldn't have known what to
          do with myself. Yes, as you say, I think I must dedicate to Dolabella some treatise of a
          more general kind and more political in tone. Something certainly I must compose for him;
          for he is very desirous that I should do so. If Brutus takes any step, <note n="2"
            anchored="true">About his marriage with <foreign xml:lang="la">Porcia</foreign>. </note>
          pray be careful to let me know. I think he ought to do it as soon as possible, especially
          if he has made up his mind. He will thereby either entirely stop, or at any rate mitigate,
          any little talk there may be about it. For there are people who talk even to me. But he
          will settle these things best himself, especially if he also consults you. I intend
          starting on the 21st: for I have nothing to do here, nor, by Hercules! there either, or
          anywhere: yet there, after all, there is something. Today I am expecting Spinther; for
          Brutus has sent him to me. He writes to clear Caesar in regard to the death of
          Marcellus—on whom no suspicion would have fallen, even if his assassination had been the
          consequence of a plot. As it is, as there is no doubt whatever about Magius. Does not his
          madness account for the whole thing? I don't clearly understand what he means. Please
          explain therefore. However, for myself my only doubt is as to the cause of Magius's mad
          fury. Marcellus had even gone security for him. No doubt that is the true <pb n="283"/>
          explanation—he was insolvent. I suppose he had asked some indulgence from Marcellus,
          who—as was his way—had answered him somewhat decidedly. </p>

        <p> Your letters about our dear Attica stung me to the heart. However, they also healed the
          wound. For the fact that you consoled yourself in the same letter gave me sufficient
          assurance to alleviate my distress. You have given my speech for Ligarius <note n="3"

          advertising to you. As to what you say in your letter about Varro, you are aware that
          heretofore my speeches and writings of that nature have been composed in a way that made
          the introduction anywhere of Varro impossible. But when I began these more literary works,
          Varro had already announced to me a dedication of an important treatise. Two years have
          passed, and that "Callippides," <note n="4" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Callippides</foreign> appears to have been someone who, like Mr.

            runner seems uncertain. </note> though perpetually on the move, has not advanced a yard.
          I, on the other hand, am preparing to return anything he sent me, "measure and all and
          even better"—if I had but the power: for even Hesiod adds the proviso "if you can." <note

          </note> As things stand at present <pb n="285"/> I have plighted to Brutus, as you
          advised, my treatise de Finibus, of which I think very highly, and you wrote to say that
          he was not unwilling to accept it. So let us transfer to Varro my Academica, in which the
          speakers are men of rank, as far as that goes, but being in no respect men of learning are
          made to speak with a subtlety beyond them. It contains the doctrines of Antiochus, with
          which he is in full agreement. <note n="1" anchored="true">The first edition of the
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Academica</foreign> was in two books, and the chief speakers
            were Catulus and Lucullus. It was afterwards arranged in four books, in which <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Varro</foreign> takes the chief part in the dialogues. Antiochus of
            Ascalon was lecturing at Athens when Cicero was there in <date when="-0079">B.C.
              79</date>. He had also been a friend of Lucullus. His school is sometimes called the "
            Fifth Academy," approaching nearer to Stoicism and receding from the full scepticism of
            the New Academy. </note> I will make it up to Catulus and Lucullus in some other work.
          However, this depends on your approval, so pray write me an answer on this point.
            <milestone unit="para"/>I have had a letter from Vestorius about the auction of
          Brinnius's estate. He says that the direction of the business has been unanimously

          am anxious to know is how Attica is. Though your letter—which however is now rather out of
          date-bids me hope for the best, yet I am anxious for something recent. You see what
          advantage there is in our being near each other. By all means let us get suburban
          pleasure-grounds: we seemed to be conversing with each other when I was in my Tusculan
          villa—so frequent was the interchange of letters. But that at least will soon be the case
          again. Meanwhile, acting on your hint, I have completed some books-really quite clever
          ones - addressed to Varro. Nevertheless I await your answer to what I wrote to you: first,
          how you learnt that he wanted something of the sort from me, since he has never, for all
          his extraordinary literary activity, addressed a line to me: secondly, of whom he was
          jealous, unless I am to think it to be Brutus. For if he is not jealous of him, much less
          can he be so of Hortensius or of the interlocutors in the de Republica. I should like you
          to make this quite clear to me: especially whether you abide by your opinion that I should
          send him what I have written, or whether you think it unnecessary. But of this when we

        <p> Hilarus the copyist had just left me on the 28th, to whom I had delivered a letter for
          you, when your letter-carrier arrived with yours dated the day before: in which the
          sentence that pleased me most was, "Our dear Attica begs you not to be cast down," and
          that in which you say that all danger is over. To my speech for Ligarius I see that your
          authority has served as an excellent advertisement. For Balbus and Oppius have written to
          say that they like it extremely, and have therefore sent that poor little speech to
          Caesar. So this is what you meant by what you wrote to me before. As to Varro, I should
          not be influenced by the motive you mention, that is, to avoid being thought fond of great
          men—for my principle has always been not to include any living person among the
          interlocutors of my dialogues. But as you say that it is desired by Varro and that he will
          value it highly, I have composed the books and finished a complete review of the whole
          Academic philosophy in four books—how well I can't say, but with a minute care which
          nothing could surpass. In them the arguments so brilliantly deduced by Antiochus against
          the doctrine of <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)katalhyi/a</foreign> (impossibility of attaining
          certainty) I have assigned to Varro. To them I answer in person. You are the third
          personage in our conversation. If I had represented Cotta and Varro as keeping up the
          argument, according to the suggestion contained in your last letter, I should have been
          myself a persona muta. This is often the case with graceful effect in ancient dramatis
          personae—for instance, Heraclides did it in many of his dialogues, and so did I in the six
          books of the de Republica. So again in my three books <title>de Oratore</title> with which
          I am fully satisfied. In these too the persons represented are of such a character that
          silence on my part was natural. For the speakers are <pb n="291"/> Antonius, the veteran
          Catulus, Gaius Iulius, the brother of Catulus, Cotta, and Sulpicius. The conversation is
          represented as taking place when I was a mere boy, so that I could have no part in it. On
          the other hand, my writings in the present period follow the Aristotelian fashion—the
          conversation of the other characters is so represented as to leave him the leading part.
          My five books de Finibus were so arranged as to give L. Torquatus the Epicurean arguments,
          Marcus Cato the Stoic, Marcus Piso the Peripatetic. I thought that could rouse no
          jealousy, as all those persons were dead. This new work Academica, as you know, I had
          divided between Catulus, Lucullus, and Hortensius. It was quite inappropriate to their
          characters: for it was more learned than anything they would appear likely to have ever
          dreamed of. Accordingly, I no sooner read your letter about Varro than I caught at the
          idea as a godsend. For there could be nothing more appropriate than Varro to that school
          of philosophy, in which he appears to me to take the greatest pleasure, and that my part
          should be such as to avoid the appearance of having arranged to give my side of the
          argument the superiority. For in fact the arguments of Antiochus are very convincing. As
          carefully translated by me they retain all the acuteness of Antiochus, with the polish
          peculiar to the language of our countrymen—if there is indeed any such to be found in me.
          But pray consider carefully whether I ought to present these books to Varro. Certain
          objections occur to me—but of those when we meet. </p>

        <p> Now just tell me—do you think it right, to begin with, to publish at all without an
          order from me? Hermodorus himself used not to do that—the man who made a practice of
          circulating Plato's books, whence came the line: "In <pb n="292"/> note-books Hermodorus
          makes his gain." <note n="1" anchored="true">Hermodorus, a pupil of Plato, was said to

          it to anyone before Brutus, to whom, on your advice, I dedicate it? For Balbus has written
          to tell me that you have allowed him to take a copy of the fifth book of the de Finibus,
          in which, though I have not made very many alterations, yet I have made some. I shall be
          very much obliged to you if you will keep back the other books, so that Balbus may not
          have what is uncorrected, and Brutus what is stale. But enough of that, lest I seem "to

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">peri\ mikra\ spouda/zein</foreign>. </note> Yet, in the present

          to Varro, as you advise, that I have already despatched it to Rome to be copied out. This
          you shall have at once, if you so wish. For I have written to tell the copyists that your
          men should have permission to make a copy of them if you chose. Please, however, keep it
          to yourself till I see you, as you always do with the greatest care when you have been
          told by me to do so. But how did it escape me to tell you? Caerellia—wonderfully inflamed
          no doubt by a zeal for philosophy—is taking a copy from yours: she already has those very
          books of the de Finibus. Now I assure you—though I am mortal and fallible—that she did not
          get them from mine, for they have never been out of my sight: and so far from my men

          charge your men with any dereliction of duty, and so I would have you think: for I omitted
          to say that I did not wish them to get abroad yet. Dear me! what a time I am talking about
          trifles! The fact is, I have nothing to say on business. About Dolabella I agree with you.
          Yes, I will meet my co-heirs, as you suggest, at my Tusculan villa. As to Caesar's
          arrival, Balbus writes to say that it will not be before the 1st of August. I am very glad
          to hear about Attica, that her attack is lighter and less serious, and that <pb n="293"/>
          she bears it cheerfully. You mention that idea of ours, in which I am as earnest as
          yourself. As far as my knowledge goes, I strongly approve of the man, the family, and the
          fortune. What is most important of all, though I don't know him personally, I hear nothing
          but good of him, among others recently from Scrofa. We may add, if that is of any
          consequence, that he is better born even than his father. Therefore when we meet I will
          talk about it, and with a predisposition in favour of him. I may add that I am—as I think
          you know-with good reason attached to his father, and have been so for a long time past,
          more even than not only you but even he himself is aware. <note n="1" anchored="true">What
            all this refers to we cannot be sure. Possibly it is to a pro-posed husband for Attica,
            who eventually married the great minister of Augustus—M. Vipsanius <foreign

        <p> I have received a letter of consolation from Caesar, dated 31st of May, at Hispalis.
            <note n="2" anchored="true">The modern Seville on the Guadalquivir. </note> I did not
          understand the nature of the bill published for extending the boundaries of the City: I

            the Tiber so as to include part of the Vatican district. See p.300. </note> I am glad
          that Torquatus is satisfied with what I have done for him, and I will not cease adding to
          those services. To the speech for Ligarius it is not now either possible to add a clause
          about <pb n="297"/> Tubero's wife and step-daughter <note n="1" anchored="true">Q. Aelius
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Tubero</foreign> prosecuted Ligarius; we know nothing of his
            wife and step-daughter, or how it was proposed to bring them into the speech. </note>
          —for the speech is by this time very widely known-nor do I wish to annoy Tubero: for he is
          astonishingly sensitive. You certainly had a good audience! For my part, though I get on
          very comfortably in this place, I nevertheless long to see you. So I shall be with you as
          I arranged. I suppose you have met my brother. I am therefore anxious to know what you
          said to him. As to "reputation," I am not at all inclined to trouble myself, though I did
          say foolishly in that letter that it was "better than anything else." For it is not a
          thing for me to be anxious about. And don't you see how truly philosophical this sentiment
          is—"that every man is bound not to depart a nail's breadth from the strict path of
          conscience"? Do you think that it is all for nothing that I am now engaged in these

            fame. </note> I would not have you feel distressed by that remark, which amounted to
          nothing. For I return to the same point again. Do you suppose that I care for anything in
          the whole question except not to be untrue to my past? I am striving, forsooth, to
          maintain my reputation in the courts! Not in them I trust! I only wish I could bear my
          home sorrows as easily as I can disregard that! But do you think that I had set my heart
          on something that has not been accomplished? Self-praise is no commendation: still, though
          I cannot fail to approve of what I did then, <note n="3" anchored="true">I.e., in the

        <p> As to Varro, I had my reasons for being so particular to ascertain your opinion. Certain
          objections occur to me, but of them when we meet. For yourself, I have introduced your
          name with the greatest possible pleasure, and I shall do it still more frequently; for
          from your last letter I have for the first time satisfied myself that you are not

          </note> Cassius had written to me before; Servius sent details. What a melancholy thing!
          To return to my subject. There are no hands in which I would rather my writings were than
          yours: but I wish them not to be published before we both agree upon doing so. For my
          part, I absolve your copyists from all blame, nor do I find any fault with you; and yet,
          after all, what I mentioned in a previous letter was a breach of this understanding—that
          Caerellia had certain of my writings which she could only have had from you. As for
          Balbus, I quite understand that it was necessary to gratify him: only I don't like either
          Brutus being given anything stale, or Balbus anything unfinished. I will send it to Varro
          as soon as I see you, if you approve. Why I have hesitated about it, however, I will tell
          you when we meet. I fully approve of your calling in the money from the debtors assigned
          to me. I am sorry that you are being troubled about Ovia's estate. It is a great nuisance
          about our friend Brutus: but such is life! The ladies, however, don't shew very good
          feeling in their hostile attitude to each other—though both of them do all that propriety
          requires. <note n="2" anchored="true">Reading <foreign xml:lang="la">utraque</foreign>. By

          to demand if there had been I would have instructed you to do so. The fact is that he
          holds no money that was set apart for the vow, though there is something of mine in his
          hands. That sum I have resolved to transfer to this purchase. So we were both right—I in
          telling you where it was, he in denying it to you. But let us at once pounce upon this
          very money also. In the case of a shrine for human beings I don't think well of a grove,
          because it is not much frequented: yet there is something to say for it. However, this
          point too shall be settled in accordance with your opinion, as everything else is. I shall
          come to town the day I fixed: and I hope to heaven you will come the same day. But if
          anything prevents you—for a hundred things may do so—at any rate the next day. Why, think
          of the co-heirs, and of my being left to their tender mercies without your cunning! This
          is the second letter I have had without a word about Attica. However, I put a very hopeful
          construction on that. I don't lay the blame on you, but on her, that there isn't so much
          as a "kind regards." However, give my kindest, both to her and Pilia, and don't in spite
          of all hint that I am angry. I am sending you Caesar's letter, in case you have not read

          Porcia, daughter of Cato and widow of Bibulus. Naturally the Caesarians thought it a
          dangerous alliance, and especially his mother Servilia—the warm friend and perhaps
          mistress of Caesar. Cicero says that it is a pity the two ladies are unfriendly to each
          other, but, he adds, they keep up appearances and do all that their respective positions
          demand. <pb n="300"/> that he had to be kept <note n="1" anchored="true">I.e., to dinner.

          remember that expression of yours), and they were a large party and I was not prepared.
          How did that help me? Soon after came Gaius Capito with Titus Carrinas. I hardly laid a
          finger on their cloaks; yet they stopped, and very à propos (though by chance) Capito fell
          to talking about the enlargement of the city: the Tiber is to be diverted, starting from
          the Milvian bridge along the Vatican Hills: the Campus Martius is to be covered with
          buildings; while the Vatican plain is to become a kind of new Campus Martius. "What do you
          say?" said I, "why, I was going to the auction, to secure Scapula's pleasure-grounds if I
          could safely do so." "Don't do anything of the sort," said he, "for the law will be
          carried. <note n="3" anchored="true">This scheme was never carried out, though both Dio
            (43, 58) and Aulus Gellius (13, 14) say that Caesar did enlarge the pomaerium. </note>

            that Caesar meant to make into a Campus Martius, and so Cicero would have been obliged
            to surrender them, probably at a loss. See p.296. </note> I didn't betray any annoyance
          at the information, but I am annoyed at the scheme. What do you say to it? But I needn't
          ask: you know what a quidnunc Capito is, always finding some mare's nest: he is as bad as

        <p> Your morning letter of yesterday I answered at once. I will now answer your evening
          letter. I had rather that Brutus had asked me to come to Rome. For it would have been
          fairer, considering that a journey both unexpected and long was before him. And, by
          heaven! nowadays, as the state of our feelings forbids our getting on frankly together—for
          I certainly need not tell you what constitutes being "good company "-I should be glad if
          our meeting were at Rome rather than at Tusculum. <milestone unit="para"/>The books

          you know that I had some hesitation, but I leave it to you. Also those I am dedicating to

          </note> the copyists have in hand. Yes, as you say in your letter, get my business
          through. However, Trebatius says that everybody makes that rebate you mention; what, then,
          do you suppose those fellows will do ? <note n="3" anchored="true">By the Iulian law,
            passed at the end of <date when="-0049">B.C. 49</date>, mortgagers were not only allowed
            to satisfy their creditors by handing over property valued at the market price before
            the civil war, but were also authorized to deduct the amount of interest paid. It was
            only meant as a temporary measure to meet a temporary crisis, but Cicero says that of
            course his debtors will take advantage of it. For nosti <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >domum</foreign> Dr. Reid proposes nosti <foreign xml:lang="la">dominum</foreign>:
            "You know their master (Caesar), like master, like man." Tyrrell explains: "You know the

          without any friction. You'd scarcely believe how indifferent I am about such things. I
          solemnly declare to you, and pray believe me, that those trumpery properties are more a
          bore than a pleasure to me. For I grieve more at not having anyone to whom to transmit
          them than at being in want of <pb n="302"/> immediate cash. <note n="1" anchored="true">It
            seems a harsh thing of Cicero to look upon his son—though he had given him some
            trouble—as already unworthy to be his heir. Young Marcus was now at Athens, though he
            had wished to join Caesar's army in Spain. See p.144. </note> And so Trebatius says that
          he told you. Now perhaps you were afraid that I should be sorry to hear your report. That
          was like your kindness, but believe me I am now quite indifferent about those things.
          Wherefore devote your energies to these conferences: get your knife well in and finish the
          business. When talking to Polla consider that you are talking with that fellow Scaeva,
            <note n="2" anchored="true">A well-known centurion and favourite of Caesar. Nothing is
            known of <foreign xml:lang="la">Polla</foreign>, and Dr. Reid suggests Balbo—for Cicero
            has before suggested talking to Balbus on the debt due by Faberius. On the other hand,
            Cicero is putting forward these names as of men harsh and barely honest: while of Balbus
            he generally speaks respectfully. The reading of the paragraph is very doubtful, and
            probably there are several corruptions. </note> and don't imagine that men who are
          accustomed to try to lay hands on what is not owed to them will abate anything that is.

        <p> About Andromenes, I thought what you say was the case. For you would have known and told
          me. Yet your letter is so full of Brutus, that you don't say a word about yourself. But
          when do you think he is coming? For I intend to arrive in Rome on the 14th. I meant in my
          letter to tell Brutus—but since you say that you have read it, I was not perhaps quite
          clear—that I understood from your letter that he did not wish me to come to Rome now out
          of compliment as it were to himself. But since my arrival in town is now approaching, pray
          take care that the Ides (the 15th) <note n="1" anchored="true">The day of the auction of
            the <foreign xml:lang="la">horti Scapulani</foreign>. </note> don't prevent him from
          being at Tusculum if that suits his convenience. For I am not likely to want him at the
          auction. In a business of that kind why are you not sufficient by yourself? But I do want
          him at the making of my will. This, however, I wish to be on another day, that I may not
          appear to have come to Rome for that express purpose. I have written to Brutus, therefore,
          to say that there was not the occasion for his presence on the 15th, which I had
          contemplated. So I should like you to direct the whole of this business in such a way as
          to prevent our inconveniencing Brutus in any particular, however small. <milestone
            unit="para"/>But pray, why in the world are you in such a fright at my bidding you send
          the books to Varro at your own risk? Even at this eleventh hour, if you have any doubt,
          let me know. Nothing can be more finished than they are. I want Varro to take a part in
          them, especially as he desires it himself: but he is, as you know, <quote>Keen-eyed for

          despair of the book securing Varro's approval, and I am not sorry that my plan should be

            refers to it again in <bibl n="Cic. Att. 16.3">Att. 16.3</bibl>.Pliny (N. H 13.80) says
            that it was a cubit broad. Cicero had had the "presentation copy" written on this
            expensive material. </note> but I say again and again—it shall be done at your risk.
          Wherefore, if you have any hesitation, let us change to Brutus, for he too is an adherent
          of Antiochus. What an excellent likeness of the Academy itself, with its instability, its
          shifting views, now this way and now that! But, please tell me, did you really like my

          Consequently I did not dictate it even to Tiro, <note n="2" anchored="true">Tiro's

        <p> What a delightful letter! Though the procession was odious, it is nevertheless not
          odious "to know everything"—even about Cotta. The people were splendid not to clap even
          the figure of Victory owing to its impious neighbour. Brutus has been to see me, and is
          very strongly in favour of my writing something to Caesar. I assented, but this procession

            reported to have said that they contained an oracle declaring that the Parthians could
            only be conquered by a Roman king, and to have expressed an intention of proposing that
            Caesar should have that title (<bibl n="Suet. Jul. 76">Suet. Iul. 76</bibl>-79). L.

        <p> I have despatched a very bulky letter to Hirtius which I recently wrote at Tusculum.
          That which you have sent me I will answer another time. For the present I prefer other
          subjects. What can I do about Torquatus <note n="2" anchored="true">That is, about
            effecting his recall. See p.235. </note> unless I hear something from Dolabella? As soon
          as I do you shall know at once. I expect letter-carriers from him today, or at latest
          tomorrow. As soon as they arrive they shall be <pb n="316"/> sent on to you. I am
          expecting to hear from Quintus. For as I was starting from Tusculum on the 25th, as you
          know, I sent letter-carriers to him. Now to return to business: the word inhibere
          suggested by you, <note n="1" anchored="true">The question is as to the right Latin
            equivalent for <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)pe/xein</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc"
              >e)poxh/</foreign>, the technical terms of the Academies for "suspension of judgment"
            in consequence of the impossibility of arriving at scientific certainty. </note> which I
          thought very attractive, I am now strongly against. For it is an entirely nautical word.
          Of course I knew that, but I thought that the vessel was "held up" (sustineri) when the
          rowers were ordered inhibere. But that that is not the case I learnt yesterday, when a
          ship was being brought to land opposite my villa. For when ordered inhibere the rowers
          don't hold up the vessel, they backwater. Now that is a meaning as remote as possible from
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)poxh/</foreign> ("suspension of judgment"). Wherefore pray let
          it stand in the book as it was. Tell Varro this also, if by any chance he has made an
          alteration. One can't have a better authority than Lucilius: "Bring to a halt (sustineas)
          chariot and horses, as oft doth a skilful driver." Again, Carneades always uses the guard
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">probolh</foreign>) of a boxer and the pulling up (retentio) of
          a charioteer as metaphorical expressions for "suspension of judgment" (<foreign
            xml:lang="grc">e)poxh/</foreign>): but the inhibitio of rowers connotes motion, and
          indeed an unusually violent one—the action of the oars driving the vessel backwards. You
          see how much more eager and interested I am on this point than either about rumours or
          about Pollio. Tell me too about Pansa, whether there is any confirmation—for I think it
          must have been made public: also about Critonius, whatever is known, and at least about
          Metellus and Balbinus. <pb n="317"/>

        <p> YESTERDAY evening I got a letter from Lepidus dated Antium, for he was there in a house

          greatly gratify both Caesar and himself by so doing. <note n="1" anchored="true">M.

          be absent if I was wanted: I should have regretted it afterwards. So today I shall be at

        <p> YESTERDAY, in the midst of the noise, I seem to have caught a remark of yours, that you

          convenient to yourself. Lepta begs me to hurry to Rome if he wants me in any way. For
          Babullius is dead. Caesar, I imagine, is heir to a twelfth—though I don't know anything
          for certain as yet—but Lepta to a third. Now he is in a fright that he may not be allowed
          to keep the inheritance. His fear is unreasonable, but nevertheless he is afraid. So if he

        <p> THIS is my second letter today. As to Xenon's debt to you and the forty sestertia due to
          you in Epirus, no arrangement could be more convenient or suitable than what you suggest
          in your letter. Balbus the younger had made the same suggestion to me in conversation.
            <milestone unit="para"/>I have absolutely no news except that Hirtius has kept up a keen
          controversy with Quintus <note n="2" anchored="true">The younger Quintus, who was in
            Caesar's army in Spain. </note> on my behalf: that the latter talks violently in all
          kinds of places and especially at dinner parties: that much of this talk is directed
          against me, but that he also falls upon his father. Nothing he says, however, has a
          greater vraisemblance than his assertion that we are bitterly opposed to Caesar: that we
          are neither of us to be trusted, while I personally ought to be regarded with
          suspicion-this would have been truly terrible had I not perceived that our monarch knew
          that I had no courage left. Lastly, that my son is being bullied by me. But that he may
          say as much as he chooses. <milestone unit="para"/>I am glad I had handed Porcia's funeral
          oration to Lepta's letter-carrier before I got your letter. Take care then, as you love
          me, that it is sent to Domitius and Brutus—if it is going to be sent—in the form you
          mention. <milestone unit="para"/>About the gladiators and the other things, which you call
          in your letter "airy nothings," give me particulars day by day. I should wish, if you
          think it right, to apply to Balbus <pb n="321"/> and Offilius. About giving notice of the
          auction I myself spoke to Balbus. He agreed—I presume that Offilius has a complete
          inventory, and so has Balbus—well, he agreed that it should be on an early day and at
          Rome: but that, if Caesar's arrival was delayed, it might be put off from day to day.
            <note n="1" anchored="true">This all refers to the will of Cluvius of <foreign

        <p> As I was writing against the Epicureans before daybreak, I scratched a hasty note to you
          by the same lamp and in the same breath, and despatched it also before daybreak. Then,
          after going to sleep again and getting up at sunrise, a letter from your sister's son
            <note n="2" anchored="true">The younger Quintus Cicero. </note> is put into my hands,
          which I herewith send to you in the original copy. It begins with a gross insult. But
          perhaps he didn't stop to think. Well, this is how it begins: "Whatever can be said to
          your discredit I___" He will have it that much can be said to my discredit, but says that
          he does not endorse it. Could anything be in worse taste? Well, you shall read the
          rest—for I send it on to you—and judge for yourself. My belief is that it was because the
          fellow was disturbed by the daily and persistent compliments of our friend Brutus—the
          expression of which by him in regard to us has been reported to me by a very large number
          of people—that he has at length deigned to write to me and to you. Please let me know if
          that is so. For what he has written to his father about me <pb n="322"/> I don't know.
          About his mother, how truly filial! "I had wished," he says, "to be with you as much as
          possible, and that a house should be taken for me; and I wrote to you to that effect. You
          have neglected to do it. Therefore we shall see much less of each other: for I cannot bear
          the sight of your house; you know why." The reason to which he alludes, his father tells
          me, is hatred of his mother. Now, my dear Atticus, assist me with your advice:
            <quote>Scale the high-built wall shall I By justice pure and verity?</quote> That is,
          shall I openly renounce and disown the fellow, or shall I proceed "by crooked wiles"? For

        <p> What astonishing duplicity! He writes to his father that he must abstain from entering
          his house on account of his mother: to his mother he writes a letter full of affection! My
          brother however is taking it more easily, and says that his son has reason for being angry
          with him. But I am following your advice: for I see that your opinion is in favour of
          "crooked ways." I shall come to Rome, as you think I ought, but sorely against the grain:
          for I cling strongly to my writing. "You will find Brutus," say you, "on the same
          journey." No doubt. But had it not been for this affair, that inducement would not have
          overcome my reluctance. For he has not come from a quarter which I should have preferred,
          nor has he been long away, nor has he written a syllable to me. But after all I am anxious

        <p> REALLY? Does Brutus say that Caesar is going to join the Optimates? That's good news!
          But where will he find them? Unless he should by chance hang himself. <note n="1"

          what about Brutus? You say, "It is no good." What became, then, of that chef-d'oeuvre of
          yours which I saw in his "Parthenon"-I mean the Ahala and Brutus pedigree? <note n="2"
            anchored="true">The "Parthenon " is a library or other room in the house of <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign>. Thus <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign> had such
            a room which he called Amaltheium (vol. i., p. 44), and Cicero an Academeia (vol. i.,
            p.12), and Augustus one which he called <foreign xml:lang="la">Syracusae</foreign>
              (<bibl n="Suet. Aug. 72">Suet. Aug. 72</bibl>). Atticus's chef-d'oeuvre was a pedigree
            of the Iunian family, "which he made at the request of <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Brutus</foreign>, from its origin to the present day, noting the birth of each man
            and the offices he had held " (<bibl n="Nep. Att. 18">Nepos, Att. 18</bibl>). It
            enumerated among the ancestors Iunius <foreign xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign>, the

              2.26</bibl>). This was one of the ways in which Atticus—who dabbled in ancient history
            and antiquities-gratified his great friends. Cicero means, "if <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Brutus</foreign> submits to Caesar, what is the use of his descent from these
            tyrannicides?" We may remember how this was used next year by the authors of libels
              (<bibl n="TLG551.17 2.112">App. B.C. 2.112</bibl>). </note> But what is he to do?
            <milestone unit="para"/>That's excellent hearing! "Not even has the prime author of the

          nephew." Why, I was beginning to be afraid that even Brutus was fond of him. For that
          seemed the meaning of the sentence in his letter to me: "But I could wish that you had a
          taste of his conversations with me." But, as you say, of this when we meet. And yet, which

        <p> Yes, I sent Quintus the letter for your sister. When he complained that his son was on
          bad terms with his mother, and said that on that account he intended to give up the house
          to his son, I told him that the latter had written a becoming letter to his mother, but
          not a word to you. He expressed surprise at the former, but said that in regard to you the
          fault was his own, because he had frequently written in indignant terms to his son as to
          your unfairness to him. In this respect he says that his feelings have softened; so I read
          him your letter, and on the "crooked paths" <note n="2" anchored="true">

          done me are the more serious, or at least the more notorious, of the two. If however

        <p> POLLEX, for his part, having appointed to meet me by the 13th of August, has in fact
          done so at Lanuvium on the 12th. But he was true to his name—a thumb and not a finger, he
          pointed to nothing. You must get your information, therefore, from his own lips. I have
          been to call on Balbus; for Lepta, being anxious about his own contract for the wine,
            <note n="3" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">De vini curatione</foreign>, a contract for supplying wine at the
            games. Others, however, read <foreign xml:lang="la">de munerum curatione</foreign>,
            "contracting for the gladiatorial show." See p.312. </note> had induced me to go and see
          him. He was staying in that villa at Lanuvium which he has made over to Lepidus. The first
          thing he said to me was: "I recently received a letter from Caesar, in which he positively
          asserts that he will arrive before the Roman games." I read the <pb n="328"/> letter.
          There was a good deal about my "Cato." He says that by repeatedly reading it he had
          increased his command of language: when he had read the "Cato" of Brutus he thought
          himself eloquent. Next I learnt from him that acceptance of Cluvius's inheritance (oh,
          careless Vestorius!) was to be an unconditional acceptance in the presence of Witnesses
          within sixty days. I was afraid I should have to send for Vestorius. As it is, I need only
          send him a commission to accept on my order. This same Pollex therefore shall go. I also
          discussed the question of Cluvius's suburban pleasure-grounds with Balbus. Nothing could
          be more liberal: he said that he would write to Caesar at once: but that Cluvius had left
          Terentia a legacy of fifty sestertia (£48o), charged on Hordeonius's share, as also money
          for his tomb and many other things, but that my share had no charge on it. Pray give
          Vestorius a gentle rebuke. What could be less proper than that the druggist Plotius should
          have employed his servants to give Balbus full particulars so long in advance, while he
          gave me none even by my own? I am sorry about Cossinius; I was very fond of him. I will
          assign to Quintus whatever surplus there is after paying my debts and purchases. The
          latter I expect will force me to borrow more. About the house at Arpinum I know nothing.
          P.S.-There is no occasion for you to scold Vestorius. For after I had sealed this packet
          my letter-carrier arrived after dark bearing a letter from him with full particulars and a
          copy of the will. </p>

        <p> First, health to Attica, whom I imagine to be in the country, so I wish her much health,
          as also to Pilia. If there is anything fresh about Tigellius, let me know it. He is—as
          Fadius Gallus has written me word—bringing up a most unfair accusation against me, on the
          ground that I left Phamea in the lurch after having undertaken to plead his cause. This
          cause, indeed, I had undertaken against the sons of Gnaeus Octavius, much against my
          will—but I did also wish well to Phamea. For, if I remember rightly, when I was standing
          for the consulship he sent me a promise through you to do anything he could; and I was no
          less mindful of that courtesy than if I had availed myself of it. He called on me and told
          me that the arbitrator had arranged to take his case on the very day on which the jury
          were bound by the Pompeian law to consider their verdict on our friend Sestius. For you
          are aware that the days in those suits have been fixed by law. I replied that he was not
          ignorant of my obligations to Sestius: if he selected any other day he chose, I would not
          fail to appear for him. So on that occasion he left me in a rage. I think I told you about
          it. I didn't trouble myself, of course, nor did I think that the wholly groundless anger
          of a man not in the least connected with me required any attention from me. But the last
          time I was in Rome I told Gallus what I had heard, without however mentioning the younger
          Balbus. Gallus made it his business to go into the matter, as he writes me word. He says
          that the allegation of Tigellius is that I suspect him because I have it on my conscience
          that I left Phamea in the lurch. Wherefore all I ask you to do is to get anything you can
          from our friend the younger Balbus, but not to trouble yourself about me. It is a sop to
          one's dignity to have some one to hate without restraint and not to be a slave to
          everybody (as the man was <pb n="332"/> not "asleep to everybody"). <note n="1"
            anchored="true">The reading is doubtful. See p.329. </note> Yet, by heaven, as you know
          very well, those men <note n="2" anchored="true">The Caesarians. </note> are rather acting
          as slaves to me, if to pay a man constant attentions is being a slave. </p>

        <p> YOU gave me a hint in one of your letters, that I should set about writing a letter to
          Caesar on a larger scale. Balbus also recently, at our meeting at Lanuvium, informed me
          that he and Oppius had written to tell Caesar that I had read his books against Cato and
          warmly admired them. Accordingly, I have composed an epistle to Caesar to be transmitted
          to Dolabella. But I sent a copy of it to Oppius and Balbus, and wrote also to them, saying
          that they should only order it to be transmitted to Dolabella, if they themselves approved
          of the copy. So they have written back to say that they never read anything better, and
          they have ordered my letter to be delivered to Dolabella. <milestone unit="para"
          />Vestorius has written to ask me to authorize the conveyance—as far as I am concerned—of
          the estate of Brinnius to a slave of their own for a certain Hetereius, to enable him to
          make the conveyance himself in due form to Hetereius at Puteoli. <note n="3"
            anchored="true">Cicero, as one of the heirs of Brinnius, was to join in a sale of the
            estate to Hetereius. To do that, without having the trouble of going to <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Puteoli</foreign> personally, he was to convey it formally to a slave of
            the banker Vestorius sent for that purpose. It thus became the property of Vestorius
            himself, as the slave's master: and he then could convey it to Hetereius. </note> If you
          think it is all right send that slave to me. For I presume that Vestorius has written to
          you also. <milestone unit="para"/>As to Caesar's arrival, I have had the same information
          in a letter from Oppius and Balbus as from you. I am surprised that you have not yet had
          any conversation with <pb n="333"/> Tigellius. For instance, I should much like to know
          how much he got-yet, after all, I don't care a straw. Where do you think I ought to go,
            <note n="1" anchored="true">To meet Caesar. For <foreign xml:lang="la">Alsium</foreign>,
            see p.86. </note> if it is not to be Alsium? And in fact I have written to Murena to ask
          him to put me up, but I think he has started with Matius. Sallustius therefore shall have
          the burden of my entertainment. <milestone unit="para"/>After I had written the above
          line, Eros informed me that Murena had answered him with the greatest kindness. Let him be
          our host, therefore. For Silius has no cushions: while Dida, I believe, has given up his
          whole villa to guests. </p>

        <p> THE reason of my not sending you at the time a copy of the letter which I wrote to
          Caesar was that I forgot. Neither was the motive what you suspected it to have been-shame

          wrote without any flattery, and at the same time in such a tone as I think will give him
          as much pleasure to read it as possible. <milestone unit="para"/>At last I have certain
          news of Attica. So please congratulate her all over again. Tell me all about Tigellius,

        <p> WELL, I have no reason after all to repent my formidable guest! For he made himself
          exceedingly pleasant. But on his arrival at the villa of Philippus on the evening of the
          second day of the Saturnalia, <note n="1" anchored="true">The Saturnalia began on the 17th
            of December. </note> the villa was so choke full of soldiers that there was scarcely a
          dining-room left for Caesar himself to dine in. Two thousand men, if you please! I was in
          a great taking as to what was to happen the next day; and so Cassius Barba came to my aid
          and gave me guards. A camp was pitched in the open, the villa was put in a state of
          defence. He stayed with Philippus on the third day of the Saturnalia till one o'clock,
          without admitting anyone. He was engaged on his accounts, I think, with Balbus. Then he
          took a walk on the beach. After two he went to the bath. Then he heard about Mamurra
          without changing countenance. <note n="2" anchored="true">We have no means of knowing what
            Caesar was told of Mamurra—his death, some think. Hardly the epigram of Catullus (57),
            as others have suggested (see <bibl n="Suet. Jul. 73">Suet. Iul. 73</bibl>). <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Mamurra</foreign> was one of his agents whom Caesar had enriched (vol.
            ii., p.228). </note> He was anointed: took his place at the table. He was under a course
          of emetics, <note n="3" anchored="true">This use of emetics—no doubt often abused-took at
            this time somewhat the place in medical treatment that bleeding did a hundred years ago.
            Caesar seems to have frequently submitted to it. See <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >pro</foreign> Deiot. § 21. </note> and so ate and drank without scruple and as suited
          his taste. It was a very good dinner, and well served, and not only so, but "Well cooked,
          well seasoned food, with rare discourse: A banquet in a word to cheer the heart." <note
            n="4" anchored="true">Verses of Lucilius. </note> Besides this, the staff were
          entertained in three rooms in a very liberal style. The freedmen of lower rank and the
          slaves had everything they could want. But the upper sort <pb n="347"/> had a really
          recherché dinner. In fact, I shewed that I was somebody. However, he is not a guest to
          whom one would say, "Pray look me up again on your way back." Once is enough. We didn't
          say a word about politics. There was plenty of literary talk. In short, he was pleased and
          enjoyed himself. He said he should stay one day at Puteoli, another at Baiae. That's the
          story of the entertainment, or I might call it the billeting on me—trying to the temper,
          but not seriously inconvenient. I am staying on here for a short time and then go to
          Tusculum. When he was passing Dolabella's villa, the whole guard formed up on the right
          and left of his horse, and nowhere else. <note n="1" anchored="true">This was apparently a

              (<bibl n="Cic. Phil. 2.79">Phil. 2.79</bibl>). See the next letter. </note> This I was

        <p> He <note n="2" anchored="true">Cicero's nephew Quintus. </note> has been to see me and
          with a very dejected air. Said I to him: "Why so gloomy ?" "Can you ask," said he, "when I

          not only dangerous, but discreditable as well ? " <note n="3" anchored="true">Quintus is

          haven't even money enough for the journey." At this point I took a hint from your kind of
          eloquence. I held my tongue. He went on: "But what gives me most pain is my uncle. " <note

            <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign>. </note> "Why is that?" said I. "Because he is

          word to "Why do you incur it ?" "I won't allow it," said he, "for I will remove the
          reason." "Excellent !" said I; "but if it won't be disagreeable to you, I should like to
          know what the reason is." "Because, while hesitating as to whom to marry, I vexed my
          mother, and consequently him too. However, nothing can make up for doing that in my eyes.
          I will do what they wish." "I wish you good luck," I said, "and I commend your resolution.
          But when is it to be?" "Oh, I don't care about the time," he said, "since I accept the
          thing." "Well, my <pb n="349"/> opinion is," said I, "that you should do it before
          starting. You will thus oblige your father also." "I will do as you think right," said he.

        <p> I have come on a visit to the man, of whom I was talking to you this morning. <note
            n="2" anchored="true">Gaius Matius (<foreign xml:lang="la">Calvena</foreign>), as shewn
            in the letters following. </note> His view is that "the state of things is perfectly
          shocking: that there is no way out of the embroglio. For if a man of Caesar's genius
          failed, who can hope to succeed?" In short, he says that the ruin is complete. I am not
          sure that he is wrong but then he rejoices in it, and declares that within twenty days
          there will be a rising in Gaul: that he has not had any conversation with anyone except
          Lepidus since the Ides of March: finally that these things can't pass off like this. What
          a wise man Oppius is, who regrets Caesar quite as much, but yet says nothing that can
          offend any loyalist! But enough of this. Pray don't be idle about writing me word of
          anything new, for I expect a great deal. Among other things, whether we can rely on Sextus
          Pompeius; but above all about our friend Brutus, of whom my host says that Caesar was in
          the habit of remarking: "It is of great importance <pb n="6"/> what that man wishes; at
          any rate, whatever he wishes he wishes strongly": and that he noticed, when he was
          pleading for Deiotarus at Nicaea, <note n="1" anchored="true">In <date when="-0047">B.C.
              47</date>, when Caesar was on his way home from the Pontic campaign. Deiotarus had
            been Pompeian, and was afterwards accused of having attempted to poison Caesar, but the
            subject of Brutus' pleading was whether he was to retain his dominions. </note> that he
          seemed to speak with great spirit and freedom. Also—for I like to jot down things as they
          occur to me—that when on the request of Sestius I went to Caesar's house, and was sitting
          waiting till I was called in, he remarked: "Can I doubt that I am exceedingly disliked,
          when Marcus Cicero has to sit waiting and cannot see me at his own convenience? And yet if
          there is a good-natured man in the world it is he; still I feel no doubt that he heartily
          dislikes me." This and a good deal of the same sort. But to my purpose. Whatever the news,
          small as well as great, write and tell me of it. I will on my side let nothing pass. </p>

          waiting: "Do you suppose I am such a fool as to think that this man, good-natured as he
          is, can like me, when he has to sit all this time waiting on my convenience?" <note n="1"
            anchored="true">It is very likely that Cicero wrote this letter in his carriage on the
            way to <foreign xml:lang="la">Tusculum</foreign>. He explains that he is late, having
            been detained by the talk of Matius, but he has just time to repeat the story that
            follows more clearly than in his last letter. It comes in parenthetically in the middle

        <p> Your letter has a peaceful tone. I hope it may last! for Matius declared it impossible.
          Here are my builders who went to Rome to purchase corn, and returning empty-handed, bring
          a loud report that at Rome all corn is being <pb n="8"/> collected into Antony's quarters.
            <note n="1" anchored="true">Antony, who had been voted a body-guard after the
            assassination of Caesar, had continually added to its number till he had an army of
            about 6,ooo men in or just outside Rome (App. B.C. iii. 5; <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 2.108"
              >Phil. 2.108</bibl>). </note> It must certainly be a mere panic rumour; for you would
          have written to tell me about it. Balbus's man Corumbus has not as yet put in an
          appearance. I know him by name very well; for he is said to be a skilful architect. The
          motive of inviting you to witness the sealing of wills is, I think, evident: they want me
          to think that the disposition of their property is of this kind. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">I think this must refer to some definite persons mentioned by <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign>, who had some reason to wish to stand well with Cicero
            (see p.29). </note> I don't know why they should not be sincere as well. But what does
          it matter to me? However, try and get scent of what Antony's disposition is. Yet I am
          inclined to think that he is more occupied with his banquets than with any mischievous
          designs. If you have any news of practical importance, write and tell me: if not, at any
          rate tell me whom the people cheered in the theatre and the latest bons mots of the mimes.

        <p> What news do you suppose I get now at Lanuvium? But I suspect that at Rome you hear
          something fresh every day. Matters are coming to a crisis: for when Matius talks like
          that, what do you think the rest will do? My vexation is that—as never happened before in
          any free state—the constitution has not been recovered along with liberty. It makes one
          shudder to hear their talk and their threats. Moreover, I am afraid of a rising in Gaul
          also, as well as of the line Sextus Pompeius may take. But come one, come all, the Ides of
          March console me. Moreover, our "heroes," as far as anything decisive could be
          accomplished by their <pb n="9"/> unaided efforts, accomplished it in the most glorious
          and most magnificent manner. The rest requires material resources and troops, neither of
          which we possess. So far I am giving you information: It is your turn now to send
          me—promptly anything fresh that occurs—for I expect something every day—and if there is
          nothing fresh, nevertheless let us keep up our habit of allowing no break in our
          interchange of notes. I certainly will allow none. </p>

        <p> I hope you are now as well as I could wish—for you were fasting owing to a slight

              >Atticus</foreign>, but <foreign xml:lang="la">Nepos</foreign> says that he had no
            occasion for medicine for thirty years of his life. He seems, however, to have had a

          object of suspicion to Brutus. It will be a bad symptom if the legions come from Gaul with
          their ensigns. What think you as to those that were already in Spain—won't they make the
          same demands? As also those that Annius has taken across thither? I didn't mean Annius, I
          meant to say C. Asinius. <note n="2" anchored="true">That is, C. Asinius Pollio, now

            the leader in these disorders (see vol. iii., p.256). They took the form of mass
            meetings round the column and altar set up by this man to mark the spot where Caesar's
            body was buried. Eventually <foreign xml:lang="la">Dolabella</foreign> pulled it down
            and executed some of the most violent of the rioters (<bibl n="Cic. Phil. 1.5">Phil.

          has brought about! For that conspiracy of Caesar's freedmen would have been easily put
          down, if Antony had had his wits about him. How foolishly <pb n="10"/> scrupulous I was
          not to accept a free legation before the vacation! I didn't wish to appear to shirk this
          ferment: for if it had been possible for me to remedy it, I should certainly have been
          bound to stick to my post. But you see what sort of magistrates we have—if magistrates
          they are to be called. You see, after all, the tyrant's hangers—on in enjoyment of
          imperium, you see his armies, his veterans on our flank! All these are materials easily
          fanned into a flame. While the men who ought not merely to be hedged round, but to be
          protected by the watchful care of all the world, you see merely made the objects of
          commendation and affection, but confined within the walls of their houses. Yet
          they—whatever their position—are happy. It is the state that is wretched. <milestone
            unit="para"/>But I should like to know something about the arrival of Octavius. <note
            n="1" anchored="true">C. Octavius (the future Augustus) was at <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Apollonia</foreign> in Epirus when the letter from his mother informed him of his
            great-uncle's death. The legions in the neighbourhood, that had wintered there to be
            ready for Caesar's expedition against the <foreign xml:lang="la">Getae</foreign>,
            offered him their support. But he refused it and started for Italy with his friends.
            Cicero seems to think that he was already in Rome, but he did not go there for some
            weeks. He went to his mother and stepfather's Villa near Cumae, where he now is and
            where Cicero a little later met him. Cicero still calls him Octavius—not Octavianus—an
            indication that he was not (as some have maintained) adopted in his uncle's lifetime.
            After adoption his name is Gaius lulius Caesar Octavianus. </note> Is there a great
          flocking to visit him, any suspicion of a coup on his part? I don't expect it myself:

        <p> On the 12th I received your letter at Fundi while at dinner. First—you are better:
          second—you give better news. For that was a disquieting report about the legions coming.
          As <pb n="11"/> for Octavius, it is of no consequence. I want to hear about Marius : <note
            n="1" anchored="true">The <foreign xml:lang="la">impostor</foreign> or pseudo-Marius, of
            whom see <foreign xml:lang="la">ante</foreign>, p. 9; vol. iii., p.256. </note> I
          thought he had been got rid of by Caesar. Antony's conversation with our "heroes" is not
          unsatisfactory in the circumstances. But after all the only thing so far that gives me any
          pleasure is the Ides of March. For as I am at Fundi with my friend Ligur, I am vexed to
          the heart that the estate of a Sextilius is in the hands of a rascally Curtilius. <note
            n="2" anchored="true">Land granted by Caesar to his freedman Curtilius. Caesar placed
            his veterans in <foreign xml:lang="la">Campania</foreign> with allotments of land.
          </note> And in mentioning that instance I include a whole class of similar cases. For what
          can be more contemptible than that we should maintain the measures which caused us to
          detest him? Are we also to have the consuls and tribunes which he chooses for the next two
          years? I see no possibility of my taking part in the administration of affairs. For could
          there be a more flagrant solecism than that the tyrannicides should be exalted to the
          skies, the tyrant's administrative acts defended? But you see what sort of consuls and
          other magistrates we have—if they are to be called magistrates! You see the indifference
          of the loyalists. In the municipal towns they are jumping for joy. In fact I can't
          describe to you how rejoiced they are, how they flock to see me, how eager they are to
          hear me speak on the state of the Republic. Meanwhile, however, we can get no decrees out
          of the senate. The result of our policy is that we stand in awe of the conquered party. I
          write this to you after the dessert has been put on the table. More another time, and more

          he is not in want of anything. That is a duty on my part, and also concerns my reputation

        <p> I have learnt a good deal about public affairs from your letters, a considerable batch
          of which I received at the same time from the freedman of Vestorius. However, to your

          estate. <note n="1" anchored="true">Some property that had been left to Cicero and others
            by Cluvius of <foreign xml:lang="la">Puteoli</foreign>. Cicero had bought out his

          able to thank you enough! Good heavens, how paltry such things are in my eyes! But after

          thousand deaths than to endure the present state of things, which seems to me likely to be
          more than a passing phase. Balbus too is here and often at my house. He has had a letter
          from Vetus, dated on the last day of the year, announcing that "when he was investing
          Caecilius Bassus, and was on the point of compelling him <pb n="16"/> to surrender, the
          Parthian Pacorus arrived with an immense force: that accordingly Bassus was snatched from

        <p> CAN it be true? Is this all that our noble Brutus has accomplished—that he should have

          than if he were still <pb n="17"/> alive? Do you remember that on that very first day of
          the retreat upon the Capitol I exclaimed that the senate should be summoned into the
          Capitoline temple? Good heavens, what might have been effected then, when all
          loyalists—even semi-loyalists—were exultant, and the brigands utterly dismayed! You lay
          the blame on the Liberalia. <note n="1" anchored="true">That is, on what was done in the

              <item> (c) March 17th. At the meeting of the senate (to which the assassins were
                summoned, but did not come) Cicero spoke in favour of an amnesty. Dio (44, 23-33)
                professes to give his speech. At this meeting decrees or resolutions were passed
                  <list type="simple">
                  <item>(1) That there should be a general amnesty, i.e., no prosecution of the

            <milestone unit="para"/>It was the funeral and the recitation of the will to which

              >Phil. 2.89</bibl>) attributed the revulsion of public feeling and the mischief which
            followed. The best account of the scene in the senate and of how this last resolution
            was carried is in <bibl n="TLG551.17 2.126">Appian, B.C. 2.126</bibl>-136. The will was
            read and the fuineral took place apparently on the 18th. The bill declaring it illegal
            to nominate any man dictator was apparently brought in by Antony a few days later in
            consequence of a vote in this meeting. </note> What was possible at the time? Our case
          had long been hopeless. Do you remember that you explained that it was all over with us,
          if he were allowed a funeral? But he was even burnt in the forum, and a funeral oration
          was pronounced over him in moving terms, and a number of slaves and starvelings instigated
          to attack our houses with firebrands. What next! They even have the impudence to say: "You
          utter a word against the will of Caesar?" These and other things like <pb n="18"/> them I
          cannot endure, and accordingly I am thinking of wandering away "from land to land." Your

            <milestone unit="para"/>Is your sickness quite gone by this time? I rather judged so
          from the tone of your letter. <milestone unit="para"/>I return to the case of the
          veterans-your Tebassi, Scaevae, and Frangones. Do you suppose these men feel any
          confidence in retaining their grants so long as our party have any footing in the state?
          They have found it possessed of more resolution than they expected. They, I presume, are
          devoted to the cause of public tranquillity rather than supporters of robbery! But when I
          wrote to you about Curtilius and the estate of Sextilius, I must be understood to have
          included Censorinus, Messalla, Plancus, Postumus, <note n="2" anchored="true">All men
            enriched in various ways by Caesar's confiscations. For Sextilius see p.11. </note> and
          the whole lot. It had been better to have risked destruction <note n="3" anchored="true"
            >That is, by taking strong measures. This seems the only meaning possible if the MS.
            reading, <foreign xml:lang="la">quod nunquam accidisset</foreign>, is retained, but I
            doubt whether the meaning is to be got out of the Latin. It would be at any rate much
            more intelligible if we read with Gronovius, <foreign xml:lang="la">quod utinam
              accidisset</foreign>. What Cicero really wrote is of course the question—and of this
            MSS. are the best though not the certain guides. </note> —which would never have
          befallen us—when Caesar was killed, rather than to have lived to see this sort of thing.
            <milestone unit="para"/>Octavius arrived at Naples on the 18th of April. There Balbus
          called on him early next day, and on the same day came to see me at Cumae, with the

          was on bad terms with her. He sent me a very hot letter against him. If you know what the

        <p> THE day before yesterday I sent you a fairly long letter. Now I will answer your last. I
          only wish to heaven Brutus would stay at Astura. You mention the "intemperance" <note
            n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)kolasi/an</foreign>. Cicero is no doubt quoting the exact word
            used by <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign>. <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Fulvia</foreign>. In <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 2.93">Phil. 2.93</bibl> Cicero says that

            and will therefore demur to paying the <foreign xml:lang="la">sum</foreign> agreed upon
            by his agents. Cicero's objection to the citizenship of the Sicilians is the loss of
            revenue, for they would no longer pay <foreign xml:lang="la">tributum</foreign> (<bibl
              n="Cic. Phil. 2.92">Phil. 2.92</bibl>). </note> of the Caesarians. Did you expect
          anything else? For my part, I look for worse things. For when I read his speech
          "Concerning so great a man," "Concerning a most illustrious citizen," I can scarcely
          contain myself; yet all that sort of thing is now really ludicrous. But remember this: the
          habit of delivering unprincipled speeches is being fostered to such a pitch that our—I
          won't say heroes—our gods, while sure of eternal glory, will yet not escape prejudice or
          even danger. They, however, have a great consolation in the consciousness of a most
          magnificent and noble deed: what consolation is there for us, who, though the tyrant is
          slain, are not free? But let fortune look to this, since reason is not at the helm. What
          you say about my son is very gratifying—God bless him! I am exceedingly obliged to you for
          arranging that he should have an allowance ample for the amenities as well as the
          necessaries of life; and I emphatically beg you to continue to do so. About the
          Buthrotians your idea is quite right. I am not losing sight of that affair. I will
          undertake to plead the entire case, and I perceive that it daily grows simpler. As to the
          Cluvian inheritance, since in <pb n="20"/> all business of mine you even surpass me in
          interest—I may tell you that the total is approaching one hundred-sestertia. The fall of
          the houses did not depreciate the value of the property: I am not sure that it didn't
          increase it. <note n="1" anchored="true">See p. 15. </note> I have here with me Balbus,

        <p> Ah, my dear Atticus, I fear the Ides of March have brought us nothing beyond exultation,
          and the satisfaction of our anger and resentment. What news reaches me from Rome! What
          things are going on here under my eyes! Yes, it was a fine piece of work, but inconclusive
          after all! You know how fond I am of the Sicilians, and what an honour I consider it to be
          their patron. Caesar granted them many privileges with my full approval, though their
          having the ius Latinum was intolerable; yet, after all— <milestone unit="para"/>But look
          at Antony! For an enormous bribe he has put up a law—alleged to have been Carried at the
          comitia by the dictator, granting the Sicilians full Roman citizenship; though while he
          was alive there was never a word said about it. Again: take the case of my client
          Deiotarus, isn't it exactly parallel? He, of course, deserved any kingdom you please, but
          not through Fulvia. <note n="3" anchored="true">Deiotarus of Galatia, whom Cicero had
            defended before Caesar, was restored by Antony to the possession of lesser Armenia—who
            alleged a minute of Caesar's; but really, Cicero says, because Deiotarus had bribed
          </note> There are hundreds of <pb n="21"/> similar cases. However, I come back to this:
          shall I not be able to maintain in some degree the case of Buthrotium—a case so clear, so
          fully supported by witnesses, and so intrinsically just ? <note n="1" anchored="true"
            >Cicero means that Caesar had promised to revoke the confiscation of lands in the
            territory of <foreign xml:lang="la">Buthrotum</foreign>, and this promise—besides being
            just—can be testified to by many. If Antony carries out his measures on pretended
            minutes of Caesar, surely this genuine one ought to hold good. </note> And indeed all
          the more so that Antony is being so lavish in his grants? Octavius here treats me with
          great respect and friendliness. His own people addressed him as "Caesar," but Philippus
          did not, so I did not do so either. <note n="2" anchored="true">Being adopted in Caesar's
            will the future Augustus was now properly Gaius Iulius Caesar Octavianus (the adjectival
            form of his original name, as usual). But this adoption required a formal confirmation
            by a <foreign xml:lang="la">lex</foreign> curiata—which Antony managed to postpone till
            August <date when="-0043">B.C. 43</date>. Meanwhile his friends gave him by courtesy the
            name which he was entitled to claim, but to which he had not yet technically a full
            right. We shall find Cicero calling him Octavianus by-and-by, but not "Caesar" till it
            became necessary to compliment him. </note> I declare that it is impossible for him to
          be a good citizen. <note n="3" anchored="true">Reading <foreign xml:lang="la">bonum civem
              esse</foreign>. By omitting <foreign xml:lang="la">esse</foreign> Cicero is made to
            say that no good citizen could call him "Caesar," as it would be acknowledging the
            adoption. This seems to me much too strong. Cicero had consented to the confirmation of
            Caesar's public <foreign xml:lang="la">acta</foreign>, surely it would be unreasonable
            to reject the disposition of his private property. </note> He is surrounded by such a
          number of people, who even threaten our friends with death. He says the present state of
          things is unendurable. But what do you think of it, when a boy like that goes to Rome,
          where our liberators cannot be in safety. They indeed will always be illustrious, and even
          happy, from the consciousness of their great deed. But for us, unless I am mistaken, we
          shall be ruined. Therefore I long to leave the country and go "Where of the Pelopidae,"

        <p> I was prevented by my engagements, and by your own sudden departure from town, from

          eyes owing to its not being personally presented. But if your liberality answers to the
          opinion which I have always entertained of you I shall rejoice. I asked Caesar for the
          restoration of Sextus Clodius. <note n="2" anchored="true">A <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >scriba</foreign> and hanger—on of Publius Clodius, called <foreign xml:lang="la"

            (vol. i., p.221), but was condemned in <date when="-0052">B.C. 52</date> on account of
            the riots following the death of his patron and the burning of the Curia (<bibl
              n="Cic. Mil. 90">pro Mil. § 90</bibl>; Asconius, § 55). </note> I obtained my request.
          It was in my mind even at the time only to avail myself of the favour if you did not
          object. I am therefore the more anxious to be allowed to do it now with your acquiescence.
          But if you shew yourself sternly inclined towards his distressing and ruinous position, I
          will not contest the matter with you though I consider myself bound to carry out a minute
          of Caesar's. But, by Hercules, if you are inclined to take a large-hearted philosophical
          and kindly view of my proceedings, you will certainly shew your good nature <pb n="23"/>

          suffer it to be seen that you quarrelled with his father on public grounds only. Of this
          family you can have no reason for thinking meanly. It is of course more to our honour, and
          more agreeable to our feelings, to give up quarrels undertaken on public grounds than
          those that are the result of personal prejudice. Let me then at once lead the youth to
          think and be convinced, while his mind is young and impressionable, that enmities are not
          to be transmitted to another generation. Although your fortunes, my dear Cicero, are now,
          I feel assured, removed from every danger, nevertheless I think you would prefer spending
          a peaceful and honoured old age rather than one full of anxiety. Finally, I claim a right
          to ask this favour of you myself; for I have omitted nothing that I could do for your
          sake. But if I don't obtain it I shall not make this grant to Clodius as far as I am
          concerned, in order that you may understand what weight your authority has with me, and
          may on that account shew yourself all the more placable. </p>

        <p> THE request you make to me by letter I have only one reason for wishing that you had
          made personally. For in that case you would have been able to perceive my affection for
          you not merely by my language, but from my "expression, eyes, and brow"—as the phrase
          goes. For while I have always loved you—incited thereto at first by your zeal in my
          service and then by your actual favours—so in these times the interests of the state have
          so recommended me to you, that there is no one whom I regard with warmer <pb n="24"/>
          affection. Moreover, the very affectionate and complimentary tone of your letter had such
          an effect upon me that I felt as though I were not doing you a favour, but receiving one
          from you, when you qualified your request by an assurance that you would not restore a
          personal enemy of mine, who was a friend of your own, if I did not wish it, though you
          could have done so without any trouble. Of course, my dear Antony, I give you my free
          consent, besides acknowledging that by expressing yourself as you have done you have
          treated me with the utmost liberality and courtesy. And while I should have thought it my
          duty to have granted what you ask without reserve, whatever the circumstances, I now grant
          it as a concession to my own feelings and inclination. For I never had a spark, I won't'
          say of bitterness, in me, but even of sternness or severity beyond what the service of the
          state required. I may add that even against Clodius himself my exasperation has never been
          extravagant, and I have always held that the friends of my enemies were not proper objects
          for attack, especially those in a lower position of life. Nor ought we ourselves to be
          deprived of such supporters. <milestone unit="para"/>As for the boy Clodius, I think it is
          your duty to imbue what you call "his young and impressionable" mind with the conviction
          that no vindictive feelings remain between our families. I fought P. Clodius, since I was
          supporting the interests of the state, he his own. Upon the merits of our controversies
          the state has decided. If he were now alive, I should have had no cause of contention with
          him remaining. Wherefore, since you put this request to me with the reservation that you
          will not avail yourself of what is undoubtedly within your power against my wishes, please

        <p> YOUR letter of the 19th did not reach me till the seventh day. In it you ask me (and
          even seem to think I can't answer) which of the two I like best-hills and a fine view or a
          walk along a flat coast. Well, it is quite true that, as you say, the charm of both spots
          is so great, that I can't make up my mind which is to be preferred. <quote>

          you have sent me important and welcome news about Decimus Brutus having joined his

            been named to the government of <foreign xml:lang="la">Gallia Cisalpina</foreign> by

            legions there (<bibl n="TLG551.17 3.6">App. B.C. 3.6</bibl>). </note> in which I see the
          promise of very great things. Nevertheless, if there is to be a civil war, as there is
          sure to be, if Sextus Pompeius is going to remain in arms—as I know for certain he
          will—what I am to do I am at loss to conceive. For it will not be allowable now, as it was
          in Caesar's war, to go neither to the one nor to the other. For anyone that this party
          shall believe to have rejoiced at Caesar's death—and we all of us shewed our joy in the
          most open way—they will consider in the light of a public enemy: and that means a
          formidable massacre. The only resource is to go <pb n="26"/> to the camp of Sextus
          Pompeius or perhaps to that of Brutus. It is a tiresome step and quite unsuitable to our
          time of life, Considering the uncertainty of war, and somehow or another I can say to you
          and you to me: <quote>

              >ga/moio</foreign>, "of wedlock," at the end of the second line. </note> But I will
          leave all this to chance, which in such matters is more powerful than design. For
          ourselves let us only take care—a thing which is within our power—that we bear whatever
          happens with courage and philosophy, remember that we are but mortal, and allow literature
          to console us much, but the Ides of March most of all. <milestone unit="para"/>Now join me
          in the deliberation which is distracting my mind, owing to the many conflicting arguments
          which occur to me on either side. Shall I start for Greece, as I had determined, with a
          libera legatio? Thereby I seem to avoid a considerable risk of impending massacre, but to
          be likely to expose myself to some reproach for having deserted the state at such a grave
          crisis. If on the other hand I remain, I perceive that I shall be in danger indeed, but I
          suspect that an opportunity may occur of my being able to benefit the republic. There is
          also a consideration of a private nature, namely, that I think it of great importance for
          confirming my son in his good resolutions that I should go to Athens, and I had no other
          motive for my journey at the time when I contemplated accepting a libera legatio from
          Caesar. Therefore pray take under your consideration the whole question, as you always do
          in anything which you think touches my interests. <milestone unit="para"/>Now I return to
          your letter. You say that there are rumours that I am about to sell my property on the
          Lake; <note n="2" anchored="true">The <foreign xml:lang="la">Lucrine</foreign> lake.
          </note> while I am going to convey my bijou villa—and that at a fancy price—to my brother
          Quintus, for him to bring home, as young Quintus has told you, the rich heiress Aquilia.
          The real truth is that I have no thoughts of selling unless I find something that pleases
          me better; while Quintus has no idea of purchasing at this time. He is quite bothered <pb
            n="27"/> enough by his obligation to repay the dowry. To marriage, moreover, he has such
          a distaste that he assures me that nothing can be pleasanter than a bed to oneself. <note
            n="1" anchored="true">Quintus Cicero had recently divorced <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Pomponia</foreign>. </note> But enough of that. I return to the downcast or rather to
          the non-existent republic. Marcus Antonius has written to me about the recall of Sextus
          Clodius—in what a complimentary manner, as far as I am concerned, you may see from his
          letter, for I am sending you a copy. But you will at the same time have no difficulty in
          recognizing the unprincipled and improper nature of his proposal,—so mischievous in fact
          that it sometimes makes one wish Caesar back again. For measures which Caesar would never
          have taken or sanctioned are now produced from his forged minutes. However, I made no
          difficulty about it to Antony: for of course, having once made up his mind that he may do
          what he chooses, he would have done it all the same if I had refused. So I inclose a copy
          of my letter also. </p>

          I am quite sure that there was no one that wasn't a traitor. Please therefore make this
          clearer. For myself, it chanced that I had just despatched a fairly long letter to you on
          the 26th, when about three hours later I received yours, which was also very bulky. So I
          needn't write to tell you that I <pb n="28"/> had a hearty laugh over your witty and
          amusing remarks about Vestorius's "sect" and the Puteolian custom of the Pheriones. <note
            n="1" anchored="true">Cicero (p. 22) had jocosely referred to the banker Vestorius as
            "no philosopher but good at accounts," and <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign>
            seems to have replied by a punning reference to the <foreign xml:lang="grc"
              >ai(/resis</foreign>, "sect," with perhaps an allusion to the meaning "taking," as the
            characteristic of a banker. We can never explain the joke as to the local habits of the
            "Pheriones," because we don't know who they were or what <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Atticus</foreign> said about them. May it be a similar pun on pherein "to carry
            off"—"convey the wise it call"? <foreign xml:lang="la">Puteoli</foreign> was the mart of
            the corn trade from Egypt, and its merchants and bankers may have had a name for sharp
            practice. </note>
          <milestone unit="para"/>Now about things more "political." You defend the two Brutuses and
          Cassius as though I were finding fault with them: whereas the fact is I cannot praise them
          enough. lt was the weak points in the situation, not in the individuals, that I reviewed.
          For though the tyrant has been removed, I see that the tyranny remains. For instance,
          things which Caesar never intended to do are being done: as in the case of Clodius—in
          regard to which I have full assurance not only that Caesar was not likely to have done it
          himself, but that he would have actually forbidden it. The next will be Vestorius's old
          foe Rufio, <note n="2" anchored="true">Apparently C. Sempronius Rufus, who had a
            controversy with Vestorius (vol. ii., p. 6). </note> Victor whose name was never in
          Caesar's minutes, and so on with the rest—who shall we not see restored? We could not
          endure being his slaves; we are the humble servants of his memorandum books. <milestone
            unit="para"/>As to the senate of the 17th of March <note n="3" anchored="true">See p. 17
          </note> —who was strong enough to refuse to attend? Suppose that could somehow have been
          done: when I did attend, could I possibly speak with freedom? Wasn't it on every ground
          necessary, seeing that I had nothing to protect me, to speak up for the veterans who were
          there with arms in their hands? You can bear me witness that I never approved of that
          lingering on the Capitol. Well, was that the fault of the Brutuses? Not at all, but of
          those other dull brutes, who think themselves cautious and wise, who thought it enough in
          some cases to rejoice, in others to congratulate, in none to persevere. But let us leave
          the past: let us bestow all our care and power of protection on our heroes, and, as you
            <pb n="29"/> advise, let us be content with the Ides of March. Yet though they gave our
          friends-those inspired heroes—an entrance to heaven, they have not given the Roman people
          liberty. Recall your own words. Don't you remember exclaiming that all was lost if Caesar
          had a public funeral? <note n="1" anchored="true">The scene at the reading of Caesar's
            will, the funeral oration of Antony, and the burning of the body in the forum —so
            faithfully dramatized by Shakespeare—is given most fully by Appian (<bibl
              n="TLG551.17 3.143">B.C. 3.143</bibl>-148). The revulsion of feeling caused by it made
            Antony all-powerful for some weeks. </note> Wisely said! Accordingly, you see what has
          been the issue of it. <milestone unit="para"/>So you say that on the 1st of June Antony
          means to bring the allotment of provinces before the senate, and to propose taking the
          Gauls himself. Well, will the senate be free to pass a decree? If it is, then I shall
          rejoice that liberty has been recovered. If not, what will that change of masters have
          brought me except the joy with which I feasted my eyes on the just execution of a tyrant?
          You mention plundering going on at the temple of Ops. <note n="2" anchored="true">Cicero
            elsewhere insinuates that Antony took forcible possession of 700,000 <foreign
              xml:lang="la">sestertia</foreign> (about £5,600,000) deposited in Caesar's lifetime in
            the public treasury at the temple of <foreign xml:lang="la">Ops</foreign> (<bibl
              n="Cic. Phil. 2.93">Phil. 2.93</bibl>). See infra, p.41. </note> I, too, was a witness
          to that at the time. Yes in truth, we have been freed by heroic champions with the result
          that we are not free after all! So theirs is the glory, ours the fault. And do you advise
          me to write history? To record the outrageous crimes of the men by whom we are still held
          down? Shall I be able to refrain from complimenting those very persons, who have asked you
          to act as their witness? <note n="3" anchored="true">Of wills, in which legacies were left
            to Cicero. See p. 8. </note> And it isn't, by heaven, the petty gain that moves me; but
          it is painful to attack with invectives men who have shewn me personal goodwill, whatever
          their character. <milestone unit="para"/>However, as you say, I shall be able to determine
          my whole line of conduct with greater clearness by the 1st of June. I shall attend on that
          day and shall strive by every means and exertion in my power-with the assistance of your
          influence and popularity and the essential justice of the cause—to get a decree through
          the senate about the Buthrotians in the sense of your letter. The plan of which you bid me
          think I will of course think over, though I had <pb n="30"/> already in my previous letter
          Commended it to your consideration. But here are you seeking-just as though the
          Constitution were already recovered—to give back their just rights to your neighbours of
          Marseilles. These rights may possibly be restored to them by arms—though I do not know how
          far we can rely on them—they cannot be so by anybody's influence. <note n="1"
            anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Massilia</foreign> (as we have seen, vol. ii., p.394) had held

            surrender after a long siege, and had given up its arms and ships. But it does not
            appear to have lost its position as a <foreign xml:lang="la">libera civitas</foreign>,
            or if it did, it soon regained it. A figure of <foreign xml:lang="la">Massilia</foreign>
            was carried in Caesar's triumph (Off. 2.28: see also <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 2.94">Phil.

            loss of <foreign xml:lang="la">libertas</foreign> for the time. Why Cicero calls the
            people of <foreign xml:lang="la">Massilia</foreign> "neighbours" to <foreign

          <milestone unit="para"/>P.S. The short letter written by you afterwards was very agreeable
          to me—that about Brutus's letter to Antony, and also his to you. It seems possible that
          things may be better than they have been hitherto. But I must take measures as to my

          removal of the column, the contract given out for paving the whole spot. <note n="2"

            crucified those of the rioters who were slaves, and hurled from the Tarpeian rock some
            who were free. This unconstitutional conduct on the part of both consuls was condoned by

        </opener>
        <p> Though I am quite content, my dear Dolabella, with the glory you have earned, and feel
          it to be a source of great exultation and pleasure, yet I Cannot help confessing that it
          adds a finishing stroke to my joy that popular opinion associates my name with your
          praises. I meet a great many people every day, for large numbers of men of rank are
          collected in this district for their health, besides a goodly crowd of friends of mine
          from the country towns. Well, I have met none who did not with one consent praise you to
          the skies, adding in the same breath a very warm expression of thanks to me. For they say
          that they have no doubt that it is in obedience to my precepts and advice that you are
          shewing yourself to be a most eminent citizen and brilliant consul. Though I can answer
          such men with the most absolute truth that what you are doing you do on your own judgment
          and your own initiative, and do not need any man's advice, yet I neither admit outright
          the truth of their remark, lest I should detract from your glory by making it Seem to have
          sprung entirely from my advice, nor do I deny it entirely either. For I am even too
          covetous of honour. And, after all, it is no disparagement to your dignity—as it was not
          to that of Agamemnon himself the "king of kings"—to have some Nestor to assist you in
          forming your plans. Whereas it redounds to my glory that as still a young man <note n="1"
            anchored="true">That is, below the statutable age for the consulship. <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Dolabella</foreign> was only about twenty-five. </note> you should have
          a brilliant reputation as a Consul while being, so to speak, a pupil of my school. <note
            n="2" anchored="true">vol. iii., p.93, for Dolabella's study of rhetoric under Cicero. </note>
          <pb n="34"/>
          <milestone unit="para"/>Lucius Caesar, for instance, when I visited him on his sick bed at
          Naples, though racked with pains all over his body, scarcely got the formal words of
          greeting out of his mouth before he exclaimed: "Oh my dear Cicero, I congratulate you on
          having an influence with Dolabella, such as if I had had with my sister's son, <note n="1"
            anchored="true">L. Caesar's sister Iulia married first Antonius Creticus, by whom she
            was the mother of Marcus Antonius, and secondly Lentulus, the Catilinarian conspirator
              (<bibl n="Cic. Phil. 2.14">Phil. 2.14</bibl>). </note> we might now have been safe.
          Your Dolabella indeed I both congratulate and thank—for he is the only man since your
          consulship that I can with any truth call a consul." Then he proceeded to say a great deal
          about the occurrence, and how you had managed the affair, declaring that no more splendid
          and brilliant act had ever been done, nor one more beneficial to the state. And this was
          the observation of everyone. <milestone unit="para"/>Now, I beg of you to allow me to
          accept this quasi-inheritance, so to speak, of another man's glory, and to permit me to
          some extent to be a sharer in your reputation. However, my dear Dolabella—for this is only
          my joke—it would give me greater pleasure to divert the full stream of my glories, if I
          may be said to have any, upon you, than to draw off any part of yours. For while I have
          always had the warm attachment to you which you have had every opportunity of
          appreciating, by your recent acts I have been so inflamed that nothing can exceed the
          ardour of my attachment. For there is nothing, believe me, fairer, more beautiful, or more
          attractive than virtue. I have always, as you know, loved Marcus Brutus for his eminent
          ability, his very agreeable manners, <note n="2" anchored="true">See, however, vol. ii.,
            p.137. </note> and unequalled honesty and consistency. Nevertheless, on the Ides of
          March my affection was so much enhanced, that I was surprised to find an addition possible
          in what I had looked upon as having long ago reached its height. Who could have thought
          that any addition was possible to my affection for you? Yet so great an addition has been
          made that I seem to myself never to have loved before, only to have liked. Wherefore what
          need to exhort you to support your position and reputation? Shall I quote to you the
          examples of illustrious men, as people usually do when exhorting another. <pb n="35"/> I
          have none to quote more illustrious than yourself. You must imitate yourself, vie with
          yourself. It is not even admissible after such great achievements for you to fail to be
          like yourself. <note n="1" anchored="true">Surely party spirit never so perverted a great
            man as when it induced Cicero to write these words to a dissolute young scoundrel like
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Dolabella;</foreign> and in praise of an act of wholly
            unconstitutional cruelty. Even the unhappy boys hanged after the Gordon riots were
            allowed some form of trial. </note>
          <milestone unit="para"/>This being so, exhortation is superfluous. What is called for is
          rather congratulation. For it has been your good fortune—as I think it has never been
          anyone else's—to inflict the most severe punishment, not only without exciting ill
          feeling, but with full popular approval, and to the greatest and most universal
          satisfaction of aristocrat and plebeian alike. If this were merely a stroke of luck in
          your case I should have congratulated your good fortune; but it is in fact the result of a
          certain largeness of spirit, ability, and prudence. For I read your speech. It was wisdom
          itself. So well did you feel your way in first approaching and then avoiding the points of
          the case, that by universal consent the time for striking the blow seemed naturally to
          arise from the facts. So you have freed the city from danger and the state from terrorism,
          and not only done a useful service in view of the present emergency, but have set a
          precedent. Wherefore you ought to understand that the constitution depends on you, and
          that you are bound not only to protect, but to honour the men who laid the foundation of
          liberty. But of such matters at greater length when we meet, which I hope will be soon.
          For you, my dear Dolabella, since you are preserving the Republic and us, take care to
          guard your own life with every possible precaution. <pb n="36"/>

          <salute>TO ATTICUS (AT ROME)</salute>
          <dateline>POMPEII, 3 MAY</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> I arrived at my Pompeian villa on the 3rd of May, having on the day before—as I wrote to
          tell you—established Pilia in my villa at Cumae. There, as I was at dinner, the letter was
          put into my hands which you had delivered to your freedman Demetrius on the 3oth of April.
          It contained much that was wise; still, as you remarked yourself, you had to allow that
          every plan depended entirely on fortune. Therefore on these matters we will consult on the
          spot and when we meet. As to the Buthrotian business, I wish to heaven I could have an
          interview with Antony! I am sure I should effect a great deal. But people think he Won't
          budge from Capua, whither I fear he has gone for a <pb n="38"/> purpose very mischievous
          to the state. <note n="1" anchored="true">This is explained by 2 Phil. §§ 101-102.
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Capua</foreign>, which since the second Punic war had been
            deprived of all status, had been raised to the rank of a <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >colonia</foreign> by Caesar in <date when="-0059">B.C. 59</date>. Antony wanted to
            refound it, or at any rate to introduce a <foreign xml:lang="la">supplementum</foreign>
            or new body of <foreign xml:lang="la">coloni</foreign> which was resisted by the
            existing <foreign xml:lang="la">coloni</foreign>, who were mostly veteran soldiers. He
            appears eventually to have made his colony at <foreign xml:lang="la">Casilinum</foreign>
            on the other side of the river. This involved more loss of revenue from the <foreign
              xml:lang="la">ager</foreign> Campanus. </note> Lucius Caesar was of this opinion also,
          whom I saw yesterday in a very bad state of health at Naples. So I shall have to raise a
          debate on this subject and settle it on the 1st of June. <note n="2" anchored="true">That
            is, at the meeting of the senate always held on the first day of the month. </note> But
          enough of this. The younger Quintus has written a very unpleasant letter to his father,
          which was delivered to him on our arrival at Pompeii. The chief point, however, was that
          he would not put up with Aquilia as a stepmother. Perhaps that was excusable. But what do
          you think of his saying "that he had hitherto owed everything to Caesar, nothing to his
          father, and for the future looked to Antony?" What an abandoned rascal! But we'll see to
          it. <milestone unit="para"/>I have written letters to our friend Brutus, to Cassius, and
          Dolabella. I send you copies; not that I hesitate as to whether they should be
          delivered—for I am clearly of opinion that they should be, and I have no doubt that you
          will be of the same opinion. <milestone unit="para"/>Pray, my dear Atticus, supply my son
          with as much as you think right, and allow me to impose this burden upon you. All you have
          done up to the present time has been exceedingly acceptable to me. My unpublished book I
          have not yet polished up to my satisfaction. <note n="3" anchored="true">We cannot be sure
            what book is meant. It is supposed by some to be the poem <foreign xml:lang="la">de
              Suis</foreign> Temporibus, which was not published till after his death. </note> The
          additional matter which you wish introduced must wait for a second volume of some kind. I
          think, however—and I would have you believe me when I say so—that it was safer to attack
          that abominable party while the tyrant was alive than now that he is dead. For in a manner
          he was surprisingly tolerant of me. Now, whichever way we turn, we are confronted not
          merely by Caesar's enactments, but also by those <pb n="39"/> which he merely
          contemplated. Since Flamma has arrived, please see about Montanus. <note n="1"

          <dateline>POMPEII, 8 MAY</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> Being in my Pompeian villa on the 7th of May I received two letters from you, the first
          dated five days ago, the second three. I will therefore answer the earlier one first. How
          glad I am that Barnaeus delivered my letter at the nick of time! Yes, with Cassius as
          before. It is, however, a lucky coincidence that I had just done what you advise me to do.
          Five days ago I wrote to him and sent you a copy of my letter. But after I had been thrown
          into a great state of despair by Dolabella's avarice <note n="2" anchored="true">No
            doubt—if the reading is sound—he refers to <foreign xml:lang="la">Dolabella</foreign>
            still retaining Tullia's dowry in part. </note> —to use your expression—lo and behold,
          arrives a letter from Brutus and one from you. He is meditating exile: I, however, see
          before me a different port, and one better suited to my time of life. <note n="3"
            anchored="true">That is, "death" (cp. <bibl n="Cic. Sen. 91">de Sen. § 91</bibl>). He
            had just written the essay on Old Age. There he makes <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Cato</foreign> say that at his age death is so pleasant that "as I approach it more,
            I seem to be catching sight of land and to be at length coming into port after a long
            voyage." We often find the sentiment occurring in his letters which he was at the time
            expressing in books. </note> Though, of course, I should prefer entering it with Brutus
          in prosperity and the constitution on a sound footing. As it is indeed, you are right in
          saying that we have now no choice in the matter. For you agree with me that my age is
          unsuitable to a camp, especially in a civil war. Marcus Antonius merely said about
          Clodius, in answer to my letter, that my leniency and placability had been very gratifying
          to him, and would be a source of great pleasure to myself. <pb n="40"/> But Pansa seems to
          be fuming about Clodius as well as about Deiotarus. His words are stern enough, if you
          choose to believe them. Nevertheless, he is not sound—as I think—on the subject of-
          Dolabella's achievement, <note n="1" anchored="true">In executing the rioters collecting
            round the pillar marking the spot in the forum where his body was burnt. See pp.33-35.
          </note> of which he loudly expresses His disapproval. As to the men with the garlands,
            <note n="2" anchored="true">At the <foreign xml:lang="la">Palilia</foreign>. See Letter
            DCCXVI. </note> when your sister's son was reproved by his father, he wrote back to say
          that he had worn a garland in honour of Caesar, that he had laid it aside as a sign of
          mourning; lastly, that he -was quite content to be vilified for loving Caesar even when
          dead. To Dolabella I have written cordially, as you said that you thought I ought to do. I
          have also done so to Sicca. I don't lay the responsibility of this upon you: I don't want
          you to incur his wrath. I recognize Servius's style of talk, in which I see more of
          timidity than wisdom. But since we have all been frightened out of our wits, I have
          nothing to say against Servius. Publilius has taken you in. For Caerellia was sent here by
          them as their envoy; but I convinced her without difficulty that what she asked was not
          even legal, to say nothing of my disliking it. <note n="3" anchored="true">Re—marriage
            with the divorced Publilia. </note> If I see Antony I will seriously press the case of
          Buthrotum. <milestone unit="para"/>I come now to your later letter, though I have already
          answered you in regard to Servius. You say that I am "making a good deal of Dolabella's
          achievement." Well, by heaven, it is my genuine opinion that it could not be surpassed in
          the circumstances and actual state of affairs. But after all, whatever credit I give him
          is founded on what you wrote. However, I agree with you that it would be a still greater
          "achievement" on his part, if he paid me what he owes me. <note n="4" anchored="true">The
            instalment of Tullia's dowry which he had to repay. </note> I should like Brutus to stay
          at Astura. You praise me for coming to no decision about leaving Italy till I see how
          affairs at Rome are likely to turn out. But I have changed my mind about that. I shall
          not, however, do anything till I have seen you. I am pleased that our dear Attica thanks
          me for what I have done for her mother. I have in fact put the whole villa and <pb n="41"

        <p> You are always going on at me for what you consider my extravagance in praising
          Dolabella's achievement to the skies. Now, though I do highly approve of what he did, I
          was after all led to speak of it in such high terms by first one and then another letter
          from you. But Dolabella has entirely lost your favour for the same reason which has made
          me very bitter with him too. A brazen-faced fellow indeed! He should have paidon the 1st
          of January: he has not paid yet, and that though he has freed himself from a vast load of
          debt by the handwriting of Faberius, and has sought an "opening"in the temple of Ops.
            <note n="1" anchored="true">Faberius was Caesar's secretary. Cicero here accuses
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Dolabella</foreign> of sharing in the fraudulent proceedings
            which he afterwards attributed to Antony (2 Phil. §§ 93, 97)-making money by using
            pretended minutes of Caesar, and diverting to his private use the five millions sterling
            left in the public treasury at the temple of <foreign xml:lang="la">Ops</foreign> by
            Caesar. In <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 2.107">Phil. 2.107</bibl>, he attributes Dolabella's
            deterioration to Antony's influence. See Letter DCCXVI. </note> For a pun is
          permissible, lest you should think me very much upset. And, in fact, I wrote to him very
          early in the morning of the 8th. On the same day I received a letter from you at
          Pompeii—which had travelled very quickly, for it reached me on the third day. But, as I
          wrote you word on that very day, I sent Dolabella a fairly stinging letter. Even if that
          does no good, I think he will at any rate be unable to face me when we meet. <milestone
            unit="para"/>I think you have settled the business of Albius. As to the debt from
          Patulcius, your having come to my aid is most <pb n="42"/> kind, and exactly like
          everything you are always doing. But I seem to have deserted Eros, who is the very man to
          settle that business, for it was owing to his serious mistake that they went wrong in
          their accounts. But I will see to that when I meet him. As to Montanus, as I have often
          mentioned to you before, you will please see to the whole business. I am not at all
          surprised that Servius spoke to you in a tone of despair as he was leaving town, and I am
          not a whit behind him in his despairing view of the situation. What our friend Brutus,
          that unequalled hero, is going to do in the forum, if he does not intend to come to the
          senate on the 1st of June, I cannot imagine. But he will settle that himself better than I
          can. Judging from the measures I see in course of preparation, I conclude that little good
          was done by the Ides of March. Accordingly, I think of going to Greece more and more every
          day. For I don't see what good I can do my friend Brutus, who—as he writes me word—is
          contemplating exile for himself. The letter of Leonides did not give me much pleasure.
          About Herodes I agree with you. I could wish I had read that of Saufeius. I am thinking of
          leaving Pompeii on the 10th of May. </p>

          leaving Lucullus, I arrived at my house at Puteoli about the same hour. There I found two

          <milestone unit="para"/>I have answered your first letter: I now Come to your second. I
          will see to the Quinti and Buthrotum when I come, as you say. Thank you for supplying my
          son. You think me mistaken in my idea that the constitution depends on Brutus. The truth
          is that it will all go or will be saved by him and his friends. You urge me to send you a
          written copy of a speech to the people. Well, here, my dear Atticus, you may take it from
          me as a general maxim applicable to the affairs in which we have had a fairly wide
          experience—no one ,whether poet or orator, ever yet thought anyone else better than
          himself This is the case even with bad ones. What can you expect of the brilliant and
          accomplished Brutus. I had actual experience of him recently in the matter of the edict.
            <note n="4" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign> had suggested Cicero sending a draft of a

            deliver Cicero replies that <foreign xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign> would prefer to
            compose his own, as he did in the case of an edict, of which Cicero had supplied a
            sketch. See Letter DCCXXXVII, p.64. </note> I drafted one on your request. I liked mine,
          he his. Nay, more, when in answer to what I may almost call his en treaties I had
          dedicated my book "On the best Style of Oratory" to him, he wrote not only to me, but to
          you also, <pb n="44"/> to say that he did not agree with my choice of style. Wherefore,

          sets up as a leader in a new civil war, no one will follow him, or only such as can be
          easily beaten. <milestone unit="para"/>Now for your third letter. I am glad that Brutus
          and Cassius liked my letter. Accordingly, I have written back to them. They want Hirtius
          made a better citizen by my influence. Well, I am doing my best, and his language is very
          satisfactory, but he passes his time and almost shares houses with Balbus, who also uses
          loyalist language. What to believe of that I must leave you to determine. I see that you
          are much pleased with Dolabella; I am eminently so. I saw a good deal of Pansa at Pompeii.
          He quite convinced me of the soundness of his views and his desire for peace. I can see
          plainly that a pretext for war is being sought. I quite approve of the edict of Brutus and
          Cassius. You wish me to turn over in my mind what course I think they ought to take. We
          must adapt our plans to circumstances, which you see change every hour. Dolabella seems to
          me to have done a great deal of good both by that first move of his and by this speech
          against Antonius. Certainly there is progress. Now, too, we seem likely to have a leader;
          which is the one thing the country towns and loyal citizens want. Do you allude to
          Epicurus and venture to quote: "Engage not in politics "? Does not the frown of our Brutus
          warn you off from such talk? The younger Quintus, as you say, is Antony's right hand. By
          his means, therefore, we shall get what we want. I am anxious to hear, in case Lucius <pb

          what kind of speech he has made. I can add no more, for Cassius's letter-carrier is just

        <p> Only a little while ago I had sent you a letter by Cassius's letter-carrier, when my own
          letter-carrier arrived on the 11th, and, marvellous to say, without a letter from you. But
          I soon concluded that you had been at Lanuvium. Eros, however, made great haste to have
          Dolabella's letter delivered to me. It was not about my money—for he had not received my
          letter: but he wrote in answer to the letter of which I sent you a copy. It was very well
          expressed. Balbus, however, came to see me immediately after I had despatched Cassius's
          letter-carrier. Good heavens! how plainly he shewed his dread of peace! You know, too,
          what a reserved fellow he is, yet he told me Antony's plans. That he was making the round
          of the veterans, to induce them to confirm Caesar's acta, and to take an oath that they
          would do so; to secure that they all had arms; and that two commissioners should inspect
          them every month. <note n="2" anchored="true">The text of this clause is doubtful,

        <p> Having been informed by Pilia that letter-carriers were starting for you on the 15th, I
          scrawl these few lines. First then I want you to know that I am leaving this place for
          Arpinum on the 17th of May. So please direct there if there is anything to write after
          this: though I shall be with you almost immediately myself. For I am anxious that before I
          arrive at Rome very careful inquiry should be made as to what is going to happen. However,
          I fear that my presentiments are not wide of the mark. It is in truth quite plain what
          these fellows are at. For my pupil, <note n="1" anchored="true">Hirtius. See vol. iii.,
            p.93. </note> who dines with me today, is much devoted to the victim of our Brutus's
          dagger: and if you ask my opinion, I see very plainly their attitude—they dread peace.
          Moreover, their constant theme is that "a man of the most illustrious character has been
          killed: that by his death the constitution has been thoroughly shaken: that his acta will
          be rendered nugatory as soon as we cease to be frightened: that his clemency did him harm;
          and that if he had not shewn it, nothing of the sort would have befallen him." It strikes
          me therefore, that if Pompeius arrives with a strong army—as is reasonable to expect—there
          will certainly be war. This idea haunts my imagination and terrifies me. For we shall not
          now be able to do what you did on the former occasion. For I made no secret of my
          triumphant joy. In the next place, they talk of our ingratitude. It certainly will be
          impossible for me on any grounds to take up the position which was then possible for you
          and many others. <note n="2" anchored="true">That is, remain neutral. Cicero has committed

        <p> How sad about Alexio ! <note n="4" anchored="true">A physician. See p.53. </note> you
          would scarcely believe the extent to which it has afflicted me; and, by heaven! not from
          the point of view suggested by most people to me—"Where will you go for a physician now?"
          For what need have I of a physician? Or if I do need one, is there such a dearth of them?
          It is his affection for me, his culture, his gracious manners that I miss. Then there is
          this consideration—what is there that we may not fear when a man of such temperate habits,
          of such eminence as a physician, is carried off by such a sudden illness? But to all such
          thoughts the only consolation is that the conditions of our birth forbid us to shrink from
          anything to which flesh is heir. <pb n="49"/>
          <milestone unit="para"/>As to Antony, I have already told you that I did not meet him. For
          he came to Misenum while I was at my Pompeian house, and left it before I knew of his
          arrival. But, as it happened, Hirtius was with me at Puteoli when I was reading your
          letter. I read it out to him and stated the case. <note n="1" anchored="true">As to the
            confiscation of lands at <foreign xml:lang="la">Buthrotum</foreign>. Hirtius was

              43</date>. </note> As at first advised he would make no concession. At last, however,
          he said that I should be judge, not only in this matter but of the whole of his
          administration as consul. With Antony again I will put the case in such a way as to make
          him perceive that, if he does what we want in that business, I shall be wholly his in the
          future. I hope Dolabella is in town. Let us return to our heroes, of whom you shew that
          you have good hopes owing to the moderate tone of their edicts. Now, when Hirtius left my
          house at Puteoli on the 16th of May for Naples, to visit Pansa, I had a clear view of his
          whole mind. For I took him aside and exhorted him earnestly to preserve the peace. He
          could not of course say that he did not wish for peace: but he indicated that he was no
          less afraid of our side appealing to arms than of Antony doing so: and that after all both
          sides had reason to be on their guard, but that he feared the arms of both. I needn't go
          on: there is nothing sound about him. As to the younger Quintus, I agree with you: at any
          rate your charming letter to him gave the greatest pleasure to his father. Caerellia,
          indeed, I had no difficulty in convincing. She did not seem to me to be very anxious for
          it, and if she had been, I certainly should not have done so. <note n="2" anchored="true"

        <p> I wrote to you yesterday as I was leaving Puteoli, and I then paid a visit to my villa
          at Cumae. There I saw Pilia looking quite well. <note n="3" anchored="true">Cicero had
            lent his villa at <foreign xml:lang="la">Puteoli</foreign> to Pilia, the wife of
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign>. See p.41. </note> Nay, more, I saw her
          afterwards in the town of Cumae: for she had come to a funeral which I also attended. Our
          friend Gnaeus Lucullus was burying his mother. I stayed therefore that day in the lodge at
          Sinuessa, and when on the point of starting early the next day for Arpinum I dash off this
          letter. However, I have nothing new to tell you or to ask you; unless by chance you think
          the following is to the point. Our friend Brutus has sent me his speech delivered at the
          public meeting on the Capitol, and has asked me to correct it before publication without
          any regard to his feelings. It is, I may add, a speech of the utmost finish as far as the
          sentiments are concerned, and in point of language not to be surpassed. Nevertheless, if I
          had had to handle that cause, I should have written with more fire. But the theme and the
          character of the writer being as you see, I was unable to correct it. For, granting the
          kind of orator that our Brutus aims at being, and the opinion he entertains of the best
          style of speech, he has <pb n="51"/> secured an unqualified success. Nothing could be more
          finished. But I have always aimed, rightly or wrongly, at something different. However,
          read the speech yourself, unless indeed you have read it already, and tell me what you
          think of it. However, I fear that, misled by your surname, you will be somewhat
          hyper-Attic in your criticism. But if you will only recall Demosthenes's thunder, you will
          understand that the most vigorous denunciation is consistent with the purest Attic style.
          But of this when we meet. For the present my only wish is that Metrodorus should not go to
          you without a letter, nor with one that had nothing in it. </p>

          regard it as of the first importance. <milestone unit="para"/>I know from your letter and

          find that you approve of my resolution of not writing the sort of thing which you once
          demanded of me, <pb n="52"/> and you will approve all the more when you read the speech of
          which I have written to you today. <note n="1" anchored="true">That of <foreign

          say of the legions is true. But you do not appear to me to have sufficiently convinced
          yourself of it, when you retain a hope that the business of our friends at Buthrotum can
          be settled by the senate. <note n="2" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign> had mentioned the fact of Antony's summoning
            the legions from Macedonia, left there by Caesar. If that were true, Antony evidently
            meant to carry his views by force of arms, and the senate would have little say in this
            or any other matter. </note> In my opinion—for I can see as far as that—I don't think we
          are likely to prevail. But supposing me to be mistaken in that view, you will not be
          disappointed about Buthrotum. As to Octavius's speech my opinion agrees with yours: and I
          don't like his grand set-out for the games, nor Matius and Postumius acting as his agents
          for them. <note n="3" anchored="true">The games which Iulius Caesar had intended to be

          all those fellows, as you perceive, are as much afraid of peace as we are of war. I should
          like to be the means of relieving Balbus of the popular prejudice against him, but he does
          not even himself feel any confidence of that being possible. So he is thinking of other

        <p> ON the 22nd I received two letters from you at Arpinum, in which you answered two of
          mine. One was dated the 18th, the other the 21st. First, then, to the earlier of the two.
          Yes, do make an excursion to Tusculum, as you say, where I think I shall arrive on the
          27th. You say we must yield to the victors. Not I indeed. There are many things I prefer
          to that. For as to the proceedings in the temple of Apollo in the consulship of Lentulus
          and Marcellus <note n="2" anchored="true">
            <date when="-0049">B.C. 49</date>. The senate summoned all good citizens to come to
            town. Antony wished Cicero and others to come to the senate, and <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Atticus</foreign> had quoted the precedent of <date when="-0049">B.C. 49</date>.
          </note> which you recall-neither the merits of the case nor the circumstances are the
          same, especially as you say that Marcellus and others are leaving town. So when we meet we
          must scent out the truth and make up our minds whether it is possible for us to stay at
          Rome with safety. The inhabitants of the new community cause me anxiety. <note n="3"
            anchored="true">Antony had made a <foreign xml:lang="la">colonia</foreign> at <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Casilinum</foreign> (see p.38), which Cicero won't recognize as a

            allowed to return from exile, still had some claims for restitution unsatisfied, for
            which Cicero looked to Dolabella's aid. See vol. iii., p.280. </note> I wrote some time
          ago to Dolabella with the most minute care, if only my letter reached him. I am very
          anxious for his success and I am in duty bound to be so. <milestone unit="para"/>Now for
          the later of your two letters. I know all I want to know about Alexio. Hirtius is
          altogether devoted to you. I wish things were going worse with Antony than they are. About
          the younger Quintus, as you say, <foreign xml:lang="fr">assez</foreign>! About his father
          I will discuss when we meet. Brutus I wish to assist in every way within my power. About
          his little speech—I see you think the same as I do. But I don't understand why you would
          have me compose one as though delivered by Brutus, when he has already published his own.
          How would that do, pray? Should my theme be—a tyrant most righteously put to death? I
          shall have to say much, and write much, but in a different manner, and at another time.
          About Caesar's chair, well done the tribunes ! <note n="2" anchored="true">In his games

          say you don't know what our men are to do. Well, that difficulty has been troubling me all
          along. Accordingly, I was a fool, I now see, to be consoled by the Ides of March. The fact
          is, we shewed the courage of men, the prudence of children. The tree was felled, but not
          cut up by the roots. Accordingly, you see how it is sprouting up. Let us go back, then, to
          the Tusculan Arguments <note n="4" anchored="true">The Tusculan Disputations (1st Book) on
            death, and the reasons for not fearing it. </note> —since <pb n="56"/> you often quote

          shan't get off without a great deal of talk. But I will see to it. <milestone unit="para"

          Buthrotians, for <quote>That in my heart of hearts is fixed.</quote> I only hope, as you
          say, we may have some opportunity of acting in the matter. You must be very keen about
          Brutus's speech, considering the length at which you discuss it again. Would you have me
          treat the subject after he has actually produced a written oration on it? Am I to write
          without being asked by him? That would be putting one's oar in with a vengeance I Nothing
          could be ruder. But some thing, say you, in the style of Heracleides. <note n="3"

          settle on a line of argument, and secondly to wait for a more suitable time for writing.
          For think what you will of me (though of course I should like you to think as well as
          possible), if things go on as they seem to be doing-you will not be vexed at my saying
          it—I feel no pleasure in the Ides of March. For Caesar would never have come back : <note
            n="4" anchored="true">Boot thinks that this means, "Caesar would not have come to life
            again in the person of Antony." But I agree with Tyrrell and Purser in understanding it
            to mean, "would never have come back from the Parthian war." Caesar's health and spirits
            were perhaps failing. See <foreign xml:lang="la">pro</foreign> Marc. §§ 25, 32. </note>
          fear would not have forced us to confirm his acts. Or supposing me to join Saufeius's
          school and abandon the doctrines of the Tusculans, I was so high in his favour (whom may
          the gods confound though dead!) that to a man of my age he <pb n="57"/> was not a master
          to be shunned, since the slaying of the master has not made us free men. I blush-believe
          me. But I have written the words, and will not erase them. I only wish it had been true
          about Menedemus. <note n="1" anchored="true">See p.51. </note> About the Queen I hope it

        <p> MY letter-carrier has come back from Brutus, and has brought me a letter both from him
          and from Cassius. They are very earnest to have my advice-Brutus, indeed, wants to know
          which of the two courses I recommend. What a miserable state of things! I am quite
          uncertain what to say to them. So I think I shall try silence, unless you think I had
          better not. But if anything occurs to you, pray write and tell me. Cassius, however, begs
          and entreats me earnestly to bring Hirtius over to the right side as much as possible. Do
          you think he is in his right senses? <quote>

            <l>Is all our trust.</l>

          <note n="1" anchored="true">The MSS. have the apparently unmeaning words <foreign
              xml:lang="grc">o(/te nau=s a)/nqrakes</foreign>. I venture to propose a proverb which
            makes sense, and which is no violent change in the MSS., considering the hopeless
            confusion with which they generally present Greek words. It is <foreign xml:lang="grc"
              >o( qhsauro/s</foreign>, "the treasure turns out to be dust and ashes," a proverb for
            disappointed hopes (see Lucian, Zeuxis, § 2; Timon, § 41). Cicero says in the next
            letter that Hirtius, though annoyed with Antony, is devoted to the Caesarian party (as
            also to the memory of Caesar, see pp.44, 47, 49). If, therefore, they trust in his
            support, they will find themselves deceived—they will be reckoning without their host,
            and will find only disappointment. </note> I inclose his letter. Balbus also writes to
          the same effect as you do as to the province of Brutus and Cassius to be assigned by
          decree of the senate. And Hirtius, too, says that he shall absent himself. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">That is, from the meeting of the senate on the 1st of June. At this
            meeting Antony was to report on the <foreign xml:lang="la">acta</foreign> of Caesar,
            which he in conjunction with a small committee had been directed to investigate. Cicero,
            however, declares that the committee never met, that Antony decided as to Caesar's
            memoranda and <foreign xml:lang="la">acta</foreign> as he chose, and when the senate met
            surrounded it with armed guards (2 Phil. §§ 100, 108). </note> For he is now in his
          Tusculan villa, and is earnestly advising me to keep away. He does so because of <pb
            n="61"/> the danger which he asserts to have threatened even him: I, however-even
          supposing there to be no danger—am so far from caring to avoid Antony's suspicion and his
          thinking me displeased at his success, that the very cause of my unwillingness to come to
          Rome is to avoid seeing him. Our friend Varro, however, has sent me a letter—I don't know
          from whom, for he had erased the name—in which it was asserted that the veterans whose
          claims are postponed—for a certain number had been disbanded—are using most mutinous
          language, declaring that those who are thought to be against their party will find
          themselves in great danger at Rome. What then will be "our coming and going, our look and
          our gait," among such fellows? Nay, if Lucius Antonius—as you tell me—is attacking Decimus
          Brutus, and the rest our heroes, what am I to do? How am I to bear myself? In short, I
          have made up my mind—at any rate, if things don't alter—to absent myself from a city in
          which I once not only flourished in the highest position, but even when a subject enjoyed
          one of some sort. However, I have not so much resolved to quit Italy—about which I will
          consult you—as not to come to Rome. </p>

        <p> OUR friend Brutus has, as well as Cassius, written to me to urge that I should bring
          over Hirtius to the right side as much as possible. I neither knew that he entertained
          loyal sentiments, nor did I feel any confidence in being able to improve him in that
          respect by my influence : <note n="1" anchored="true">The text is corrupt, and the
            rendering conjectural. </note> for though he is perhaps somewhat irritated with Antony,
          he is devotedly attached to the cause. Nevertheless, I wrote to him and commended to him
          the maintenance of the civil position of <pb n="62"/> Brutus and Cassius. I wished you to
          know the nature of his answer, in case you might entertain the same opinion as myself,
          namely, that that party are even now afraid of those heroes of ours having perhaps more
          courage than they actually do retain. <quote>

                <p>You want to know whether I have yet returned from the country. Am I to be skewing
                  indifference, when all the world is in a state of excitement? I in fact have left
                  town because it is my belief that my absence is more advantageous than my
                  presence. I despatch this letter to you when on the point of starting for my
                  Tusculan villa. Don't imagine me to be so indefatigable as to hurry back by the
                  5th. I can't see that there is anything now requiring my attention, especially as
                  provision for safety has been made for so many years in advance. How I wish that
                  Brutus and Cassius may be induced by your entreaties not to enter upon any
                  hot-headed design, as easily as they can obtain a like promise from you in regard
                  to myself! For you say that they have written what you mention when on the point
                  of leaving the country. Why or whither are they going? Stop them, I beseech you,
                  Cicero: and don't allow the present settlement to be entirely undone, which, on my
                  honour, is being shaken by plunder, arson, and murder. Let them only take
                  precautions against absolute danger: don't let them attempt anything beyond. I
                  assure you they will gain nothing more by the most spirited policy than by
                  resolutely playing the waiting game, so long as they remain on the alert. For
                  things here are in a state of transition, and cannot from their very nature last
                  long as they are. If a struggle occurs they have means to strike an ugly blow.
                  What your hopes are for them write and tell me at my Tusculan villa.</p>

        <p> SINCE you left me I have had two letters from Brutus, without anything new in them. Also
          one from Hirtius, who says that the veterans are much incensed with him. I am still
          uncertain what to do about the 1st. I am therefore sending Tiro, and with Tiro a number of
          men, to each one of whom pray give a letter as each event occurs. I have written also to
          Antony about a legation, for fear that, if I only wrote to Dolabella, that quick-tempered
          man <note n="1" anchored="true">The other <foreign xml:lang="la">consul</foreign> Antony.
          </note> might be stirred up to wrath. As, however, he is said to be somewhat difficult of
          approach, I have written to Eutrapelus, <note n="2" anchored="true">Antony's praeftetus
              <foreign xml:lang="la">fabrum</foreign>. See vol. iii., pp.96, 102. </note> asking him
          to forward my letter to him, saying that I want a legatio. A votive legation would be the
          more honour-able of the two, but I could manage with either one or the other. <note n="3"
            anchored="true">That is, either an ordinary or a votive <foreign xml:lang="la"

          position. If possible I should like to talk it over with you; if you cannot meet me, we
          shall attain the same object by letter. Graeceius writes me word that C. Cassius has
          written to tell him that men are being got ready to send armed to my Tusculan villa. I
          scarcely think that this is true: but, nevertheless, I must take precautions and have
          sundry other villas ready. But tomorrow will bring us something for reflexion on that
          subject. <note n="4" anchored="true">The text of this sentence is very uncertain. I have
            translated that of Tyrrell and Purser, as at any rate making a kind of sense. If it

        <p> ON the evening of the 2nd I received a letter from Balbus telling me that there would be
          a meeting of the senate on the 5th, in order to appoint Brutus to the superintendence of
          the corn-supply in Asia, Cassius in Sicily. What an indignity! To begin with, to take any
          appointment from that party, and then, if they must take some office, such a subordinate
          one as that, which could be done by legati! And yet I don't feel sure that it isn't better
          than sitting idle on the banks of his Eurotas. <note n="1" anchored="true">A stream in the
            property of <foreign xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign> at <foreign xml:lang="la"

          But these things will be governed by fortune. He says also that a decree is going to be
          passed at the same meeting for assigning provinces to them and other ex-praetors. This is
          certainly better than his "Persian Portico"—for I would not have you imagine that I mean a

            Spartan ways. </note> "Are you laughing," you ask, "in such grave matters?" What am I to
          do? I am tired of lamenting. Good heavens, what a fright the first page of your letter
          gave me! Why, how did that warlike outbreak in your house come about? But I rejoice that
          that storm-cloud at any rate has passed quickly away. I am very anxious to hear how you

        <p> WHAT an affectionate letter from Brutus! How unlucky for you that you are unable to go
          to see him! Yet, what am I to say? That they should accept the favour of that party? What
          could be more degrading? That they should attempt some move? They neither have the courage
          nor—as things are now—the power. Well, suppose they take my advice and do nothing. Who can
          guarantee their safety? For if any severe measure is taken as to Decimus, what kind of
          life will our heroes lead, even supposing no one actually attacks them? Again, not to
          preside at his own games, what could be a greater indignity? <note n="1" anchored="true"

            their provinces for the next year. It was not a dignified office like that of Pompey,
            who had authority all over the Empire, while they had it only in a narrow district.
            Cicero calls it a case of " Dion's legation," referring to the removal of Dion from

        <p> I reached Antium on the 8th. Brutus was delighted at my arrival. Thereupon in the

            <foreign xml:lang="la">Servilia</foreign>, mother of <foreign xml:lang="la">Brutus;

              >Cato</foreign>, see vol. ii., p.31 ; cp. vol. i., pp.35, 188. </note> was there too.
          I had thought over what to say as I was on the road, and now advised him to avail himself
          of the corn-purchasing office in Asia. I urged that all we could now do was to consult for
          his safety: that on him depended the defence of the constitution itself. I had just got
          well into my speech when Cassius came in. I repeated the same remarks. At this point
          Cassius with a determined <pb n="69"/> look in his eyes-you would have said he was
          breathing war-declared that "he would not go to Sicily. Was he to accept as a favour what
          was meant as an insult?" "What are you going to do then?" said I. He replied that he would
          go to Achaia. "And you, Brutus?" said I. "To Rome, if you think it right," said he. "I
          don't think so at all," said I, "for you will not be safe." "But if I could be there
          safely, would you think I ought to go?" "Yes," said I, "and that you should not go to a
          province either now or after your praetorship. But I do not advise your trusting yourself
          to the city." Then I stated the reasons, which will doubtless occur to you, why he was not
          likely to be safe there. Then followed a long conversation in which they complained—and
          especially Cassius—that opportunities had been let slip. They were especially hard upon
          Decimus. <note n="1" anchored="true">Because he had used his forces in <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Gallia Cisalpina</foreign> in wars with the natives instead of attacking
            Antony. </note> I said that they should not harp on the past, but I agreed with them all
          the same. When, however, I had begun discussing what ought to have been done—my topics
          were the old ones and such as are in everybody's mouth-without touching upon the question
          as to whether some one else ought to have been attacked, <note n="2" anchored="true">That
            is, Antony. See pp. 41, 48. </note> I said that the senate should have been summoned,
          the people already burning with excitement should have been still farther roused, that the
          whole government of the state should have been taken in hand by them. At that point your
          friend Servilia exclaims: "That indeed I never heard anyone—" Here I stopped her. But I
          not only think that Cassius will go, <note n="3" anchored="true">To <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Achaia</foreign>, on his way to take possession of his province of Syria. </note> for
          Servilia promised to see that this corn-commissionership should be cut out of the
          senatorial decree, but Brutus also was quickly induced to give up that foolish talk of
          being determined to go to Rome. He accordingly settled that the games should be given in
          his name without his presence. He, however, appeared to me to wish to start for Asia from
          Antium. In short, I got no satisfaction from my journey except the consciousness of having
          done my duty. For it was impossible for me to allow him to quit Italy without my having
          had an interview with him. Barring <pb n="70"/> the discharge of this obligation of duty
          and affection, I could only ask myself: <quote>What doth thy journey here avail thee,
            seer?</quote> In good truth I found a ship with timbers all started, or rather gone to
          pieces. No plan, no system, no method! Accordingly, though I had no doubt before, I am now

          reached me yesterday evening. Even you did not approve of my having a "votive legation."
          And indeed it would have been absurd for me to be discharging the vows made in case of the
          constitution being maintained, after that constitution had been overthrown. Besides "free
          legations" have, I think, a fixed limit of time by the Julian law, and an addition is
          difficult to secure. The sort of legation I want is one that admits of my coming back or

        <p> I am glad to hear about Buthrotum. <note n="1" anchored="true">The favourable decision
            of the consuls. See pp.94-95. </note> But I had sent Tiro, as you bade me, to Dolabella
          with a letter. What harm can it do? About our friends at Antium I think my last letter was
          sufficiently full and explicit. It must have convinced you that they intended to take no
          active step, but to avail themselves of Antony's insulting favour. Cassius would have
          nothing to do with the corn business. Servilia said that she would get it cut out of the
          senatorial decree. <note n="2" anchored="true">The decree promoted by Antony seems to have
            had two provisions: (a) an indemnity to <foreign xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign> and
            Cassius for being absent from Rome during their praetorship; (b) an appointment to a
              <foreign xml:lang="la">curatio annonae</foreign> in Sicily and Asia. The compromise
            suggested by <foreign xml:lang="la">Servilia</foreign> seems to have been that the first
            should be passed, but not the second, or if it named Sicily and Asia as the places to
            which they were authorized to go, that the purpose (the <foreign xml:lang="la">curatio
              annonae</foreign>) should not be mentioned. </note> Our friend Brutus, however,
          assumes very tragic airs and says-after agreeing with me that he cannot be safe at
          Rome—that he will start for Asia as soon as he has handed over the equipment for the games
          to those who are to hold them, for he prefers to give them, though he won't be present at
          them. He is collecting vessels. He is full of his voyage. Meanwhile they intend to stay
          where they are. Brutus indeed says that he will visit Astura. Lucius Antonius on his part
          writes to me in a courteous tone bidding me have no anxiety. I owe him one favour, perhaps
          I shall owe him another if he comes to my Tusculan house. <note n="3" anchored="true"
            >Lucius Antonius was a tribune. He seems to have written to Cicero telling him that he
            need have no anxiety as to the rumoured intention of attacking his house at <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Tusculum</foreign>. See p. 65. </note> What unendurable worries! Yet we
          do endure them after all. "Which of the Bruti (oh rightly named!) is to blame for this?"
            <note n="4" anchored="true">Cicero seems to be punning on the word <foreign

            adoption Gajus Julius Caesar Octavianus (instead of Octavius). </note> as I have
          perceived, there is no little ability and spirit; and he seems likely to be as well
          disposed to our heroes as I could wish. But what confidence one can feel in a man of his
          age, name, inheritance, and upbringing may well give us pause. His stepfather, whom I have
          seen at Astura, thinks none at all. However, we must foster him and—if nothing else-keep
          him apart from Antony. Marcellus <note n="2" anchored="true">Husband of Octavia,

        <p> CONFOUND Lucius Antonius, if he makes himself trouble some to the Buthrotians! I have

          every farthing. In a previous letter I mentioned to you a sum of 110 sestertia to be paid
          to Statius. If, then, Fadius applies for the money, I wish it paid to him, and to no one
          except Fadius. I think that amount was put into my hands, and I have written to Eros to
          produce it. I can't stand the Queen: and the voucher for her promises, Hammonius, knows
          that I have good cause for saying <pb n="74"/> so. What she promised, indeed, were all
          things of the learned sort and suitable to my character-such as I could avow even in a
          public meeting. <note n="1" anchored="true">Probably books. Cicero once before jestingly
            said that he could take a present of books without breaking the law. See vol. i., p.60.

          inclined to give himself airs to me. I only saw him once at my house. And when I asked him
          politely what I could do for him, he said that he had come in hopes of finding Atticus.
            <note n="2" anchored="true">The implied discourtesy seems to consist in Sara's
            professing to be at Cicero's levée for the sake of seeing some one else, not Cicero
            himself. </note> The Queen's insolence, too, when she was living in Caesar's
          trans-Tiberine villa, I cannot recall without a pang. I won't have anything to do
          therefore with that lot. They think not so much that I have no spirit, as that I have
          scarcely any proper pride at all. My leaving Italy is hindered by Eros's way of doing
          business. For whereas from the balances struck by him on the 5th of April I ought to be
          well off; I am obliged to borrow, while the receipts from those paying properties of mine
          I think have been put aside for building the shrine. <note n="3" anchored="true">In memory
            of <foreign xml:lang="la">Tullia</foreign> (see vol. iii., p.206, sq.). The design has
            not been mentioned for a long time now, but apparently had not yet definitely been
            abandoned. </note> But I have charged Tiro to see to all this, whom I am sending to Rome
          for the express purpose. <milestone unit="para"/>I did not wish to add to your existing
          embarrassments. The steadier the conduct of my son, the more I am vexed at his being
          hampered. For he never mentioned the subject to me—the first person to whom he should have
          done so. But he said in a letter to Tiro that he had received nothing since the 1st of
          April—for that was the end of his financial year. Now I know that your own kind feeling
          always caused you to be of opinion that he ought to be treated not only with liberality,
          but with splendour and generosity, and that you also considered that to be due to my
          position. Wherefore pray see—I would not have troubled you if I could have done it through
          anyone else—that he has a bill of exchange at Athens for his year's allowance. Eros will
          pay you the money. I am sending Tiro on that business. Pray therefore see to it, and write
          and tell me any idea you may have on the subject. <pb n="75"/>

        <p> I received two letters on the 14th, one dated the same day, the other the day before.
          First, then, to the earlier one. Yes, tell me about Brutus when you know. I am informed

          well-written, that I shouldn't shrink from reading it before company: which makes me all
          the more desirous of indulging him. I don't think Sestius is annoyed about Bucilianus.

        <p> THOUGH I think I told you sufficiently fully what I needed and what I wanted you to do,
          if it was convenient to you, nevertheless, having started on the 15th, and while on board

          him that if he has no objection I wished to start, and asking him for an order for sumpter

        <p> WHAT need is there for any farther venture on behalf of the Buthrotians? I ask, because
          you remark that all your trouble has been thrown away. Why again is Brutus returning? I am
          grieved, on my honour, that you have been so distracted. You have to thank those ten

            land-commissioners for distributing extra-Italian land. </note> Yes, that was a tough
          piece of business, but it had to be borne, and I am exceedingly obliged to you. As to
          taking up arms—I never saw anything more patent. So let me be off; as you say. I don't

            and friend (vol. i., p.90). </note> wants with an interview: he has already written to
          me, and I answered him as best I could. However, he writes to say that he wants to call on
          me, to discuss some business of his own and certain matters affecting myself. I am anxious
          for a letter from you. Pray take care that nothing rash is done. Statius has written to
          tell <pb n="78"/> me that Quintus Cicero <note n="1" anchored="true">The younger Quintus,
            Cicero's nephew. </note> has spoken to him in very strong terms, saying that he cannot
          put up with the present state of affairs: that he is resolved to go over to Brutus and
          Cassius. Of course I am now anxious to learn all about this: I am quite unable to explain
          its meaning. It may be that he is angry with Antony about something; it may be that he now
          wants some new chance of distinguishing himself; it may be a mere passing fancy. And,
          indeed, it is doubtless that. All the same I am nervous about it and his father is quite
          upset. For he knows what he used to say about Antony: in fact he said to me what won't
          bear repetition. I cannot conceive what he has got in his head. I shall only have such
          commissions from Dolabella as I choose—that is, none at all. Tell me about Gaius
          Antonius—did he wish to be on the land-commission? He was at any rate worthy of such a
          company. <note n="2" anchored="true">The seven land-commissioners (for distributing land

          what they received from Antony, I gave it up for lost. And so, my dear Atticus, I would
          have you receive what I am going to say with the same courage as that with which I write
          it. Regarding the kind of death experienced by Catulus <note n="2" anchored="true">Taking
            Madvig's <foreign xml:lang="la">quo</foreign> Catulus <foreign xml:lang="la">usus
              est</foreign>. C. Lutatius Catulus was put to death by Marius or forced to kill
            himself in <date when="-0087">B.C. 87</date>. </note> as shocking, and yet as in a
          manner already pronounced against us by Antony, I have resolved to escape from this net,
          not with a view to flight, but with a hope of a better sort of death. For this Brutus is
          entirely to blame. You say that Pompeius has been received at Carteia, <note n="3"
            anchored="true">Sextus Pompeius. <foreign xml:lang="la">Carteia</foreign> is the modern
            St. Roch, near Gibraltar. </note> so we shall presently see an army sent against him.
          Which camp am I to join then? For Antony makes neutrality impossible. The one is weak, the
          other criminal. Let us make haste therefore. But help me to make up my mind-Brundisium or
          Puteoli? Brutus for his part is starting somewhat suddenly, but wisely. I feel it a good
          deal, for when shall I see him again. <note n="4" anchored="true">He saw him again in July
            at <foreign xml:lang="la">Antium</foreign> and at <foreign xml:lang="la">Velia</foreign>
            in August, but never after <foreign xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign> left Italy. </note>
          But such is life. Even you cannot see him. Heaven confound that dead man for ever meddling
          with Buthrotum! But let us leave the past. Let us look to what there is to do. <milestone
            unit="para"/>The accounts of Eros, though I have not yet seen him personally, I yet know
          pretty thoroughly from his own letter and Tiro's report. You say that I must raise a fresh
          loan for five months, that is, till the 1st of November, of 200 sestertia: <note n="5"
            anchored="true">About £1,600. </note> that on that day a certain sum of money falls in
          owed by Quintus. As Tiro tells me that you would not have me come to Rome on that
          business, please see, if it does not bore you too much, where to raise the money and put
          it down to my account. That is what I see for the <pb n="80"/> present to be necessary. As
          to other details I will demand a stricter account from Eros himself-among other things as
          to the rents of the dower properties. <note n="1" anchored="true">Certain houses at Rome
            which had belonged to <foreign xml:lang="la">Terentia</foreign> and were retained to
            furnish her son's allowance. See p.90. </note> If these are faithfully collected for the
          benefit of my son, though I wish him more liberally provided, yet he will have pretty well
          as much as he needs. And indeed I see that I shall want some journey-money also. But my
          son will be paid from these properties as the money comes in. I, on the contrary, need a
          lump sum. The fact is that though that trembler at shadows <note n="2" anchored="true"
            >Antony, who—as Cicero said before (p. 95)-was pretending to be afraid of <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign> and Cassius. </note> appears to me to have his eye on
          massacre, I am nevertheless not going to budge unless the payment of the money is
          arranged. But whether it has been arranged or not I shall learn when I see you. I thought
          this ought to be written by my own hand, and I have accordingly so written it. Yes, you
          are right about Fadius—not in any case to anyone else. <note n="3" anchored="true">See

        <p> Let me tell you this-Quintus the elder is jumping for joy. For his son has written to
          say that he desired to desert to Brutus, because, when Antony charged him to secure his
          being made dictator, and to seize some fort, he refused. He says also that he refused for
          fear of hurting his father's feelings: and that ever since Antony had been his enemy.
          "Thereupon," says he, "I pulled myself together for fear he should do you some injury. So
          I smoothed him down: and indeed got 400 sestertia from him in cash, and a promise of
          more." Statius, moreover, writes word that the young man <pb n="81"/> desires to share his
          father's house. This is a wonderful story, and my brother is in raptures with it. Did you
          ever know a greater fraud ? <note n="1" anchored="true">The younger Quintus was, it seems,
            much given to romancing. See Letter DCVII (<bibl n="Cic. Att. 13.30">Att. 13.30</bibl>);
            cp. pp.78, 97. His present object seems to have been to get over his father, probably in
            view of money help. Antony revenged himself on him for his change of allegiance by
            putting him on the proscription list in <date when="-0043">B.C. 43</date>. </note>

            Pompeius was in command of a great fleet, and was dominating Southern Spain and Sicily.
            The senate was later on glad to acknowledge him as commander of the Roman fleet against
            Antony. Antony had proposed to restore him to his civil rights, and get about 5,000,000
            sterling voted him as compensation for his father's property, but the negotiations had
            broken down, owing to his demands of a more complete restoration of property (see Letter
            DCCLXVIII; <bibl n="TLG551.17 3.4">Appian, B.C. 3.4</bibl>). At present, therefore, his
            coming would be the beginning of a civil war which Cicero was dreading and hoped to get

          How long are we to be fooled? However, I wrote you word that Sextus Pompeius was coming,
          not because he was actually near, but because he was certainly contemplating that move and
          because he was not shewing any signs of abandoning arms. Doubtless, if he goes on, war is

        <p> ON the 26th I received a letter from Dolabella, a copy of which I inclose. He says in it
          that he has acted in all ways to your satisfaction. I wrote back at once thanking him at
          some length. However, to prevent his wondering why I should do the same a second time, I
          explained that the reason was that I had not been able previously to get any information
          from you when we were together. However, to cut the matter short, my answer was as
          follows: <quote>Cicero to his friend Dolabella, consul. Having on a previous occasion been
            informed by a letter from our friend Atticus of the great liberality and the very great
            kindness which you had shewn him; and you having yourself written to tell me of your
            having done everything that we wished, I wrote to thank you in language meant to shew
            that you could have done me no greater favour. But when Atticus himself came to see me
            with the express purpose of declaring his gratitude to you, whose really eminent and
            surprising kindness in the business of the Buthrotians and marked affection for himself
            he had thoroughly appreciated, I could not be restrained from giving a more open
            expression to the same feeling on my part in this letter. Let me assure you, my dear
            Dolabella, that of all your kindnesses and services to me—eminent as they are—the most
            generous and gratifying in my eyes is this, that you have made Atticus understand how
            much I love you and you me. For the rest, though the claims and political existence of
            the Buthrotians have been set on a firm foundation by you, I would wish you—for I always
            want to make my favours secure—to resolve that, having been taken under your care and
            frequently recommended by me, they shall continue to enjoy the support of your influence
            and active assistance. That will be sufficient protection to the Buthrotians for ever,
            and you will have set both Atticus <pb n="86"/> and myself free from great Care and
            anxiety if you undertake in compliment to me to resolve that they shall always enjoy
            your defence. I warmly and repeatedly entreat you to do so.</quote>

        <p> As to my journey various opinions are expressed: for I have a great number of visitors.
          But pray throw yourself heart and soul into that question. It is a serious matter. Do you
          approve of my idea of returning by the 1st of January? My mind is quite open on the
          subject-only provided that I do not give offence. I should like to know also the day on
          which the Olympic games begin. As you say in your letter, chance will decide the plan of
          my journey. <note n="3" anchored="true">The text of these two sentences is so corrupt that
            it is necessary to state distinctly what reading I have adopted. <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Velim etiam scire quo die</foreign> Olympia (<foreign xml:lang="la">sint). Ut tu

            the idea that <foreign xml:lang="la">olim piaculum</foreign> (for Olympia <foreign
              xml:lang="la">sint</foreign>) can be explained by a reference to Clodius's violation
            of the mysteries of the Bona <foreign xml:lang="la">Dea</foreign>. That was now nearly
            eighteen years ago. Its importance is generally exaggerated owing to its immediate
            effects on Cicero, and it was well forgotten by this time after so many more startling
            events, and we cannot conceive its influencing the date of Cicero's return. I think the
              <foreign xml:lang="la">mysteria scilicet</foreign> grew out of a mistaken explanation
            of a mistaken reading and should be left out. The second reference to <foreign
              xml:lang="la">mysteria</foreign> I think refers to the Eleusinian mysteries. Cicero
            was going to Athens and wished to stay till after their annual celebration (September),
            but did not wish to stay so late as to have to sail home in the winter if he could help
            it. The reason he asks about the Olympia is shewn by <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Att</foreign>. </note> Don't let me <pb n="87"/> make up my mind, therefore. For a
          winter voyage is detestable, and it was on that account I asked you the day of the
          mysteries. Brutus, as you say, I imagine that I shall probably see. I think of leaving
          this place on the 30th. </p>

          That letter-carrier, whom I told you that I sent to Brutus, returned to me at Anagnia on
          the night of the 3oth of June, and brought me a letter, which contained that same
          request—as unlike as could possibly be conceived to his usually conspicuous good
          sense—that I should be present at his games. <note n="3" anchored="true">The games of

              <foreign xml:lang="la">urbanus</foreign> was going to give, though Gaius Antonius as
            praetor was to preside at them in his absence. </note> I wrote back of course to say,
          first, that I have already started on my journey, so that it is no longer in my power to
          do so: and secondly, that it would be the strangest paradox that, while I have not set
          foot in Rome since this arming <note n="4" anchored="true">The enrolling of the six
            thousand veterans as a guard, and Antony's summons to the legions in Macedonia. See p.
            48. </note> began—and that, not so much from consideration of my personal danger as of
          my self-respect—I should suddenly come to the games. For to be giving games at such a
          crisis is honourable enough for him, because he can't help it; but for me to attend them,
          as it is not necessary, so neither is it honourable. Of course I eagerly desire them to be
          largely attended and as popular as possible, and I feel sure they will be so; and I
          bargain with <pb n="91"/> you to send me an account of how they are received from the very
          first hour they begin, and thenceforth all that happens day by day to their close. But
          enough of the games. <milestone unit="para"/>The remainder of his letter may indeed be
          regarded in two different lights, yet, nevertheless, he does at times emit some sparks of
          manly courage. I want you to be able to express what you think of it, and therefore
          inclose a copy of the letter: though our letter-carrier told me that he had brought a
          letter from you also from Brutus, and that it had been forwarded to you from Tusculum. I
          have arranged my journeys so as to be at Puteoli on the 7th of July. For though I am in a
          great hurry, I mean to take every precaution humanly possible as to my voyage. <milestone

          a few feet along the edge of the land—and that under the surface-would have some sort of

          suggest, put it as gently as possible, rather by way of relieving him of anxiety than
          giving him any suspicion of my being annoyed. So also about Tullius's debt, speak to
          Cascellius in a liberal spirit. It's a small matter, but I am obliged to you for attending
          to it. It was a bit of rather sharp practice. And if he had taken me in at all, as he
          nearly did-only that you were too many for him—I should have been seriously annoyed. So,
          whatever is to be the result, I would prefer the transaction being stayed. Remember that
          an eighth share of the aedes Tullianae near the temple of Strenia, is due to Caerellia:
          see that it is conveyed to her at the highest price bid at the auction. I think that was
          380 sestertia. <note n="2" anchored="true">The text in MSS. and editions is hopeless.
            Emendations of all sorts have been attempted. I think the first thing is to get rid of

            therefore conjectured for <foreign xml:lang="la">tuli</foreign> luminarum aedium,

        <p> I am glad that you advise me to do precisely what I did of my own accord yesterday. For
          when I despatched my letter to you on the 2nd, I gave the same letter-carrier one for
          Sestius written in very warm terms. As for him, his intention of escorting <note n="1"
            anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Prosequitur</foreign>, the MS. reading. It is the usual word in
            this connection. Editors change it to <foreign xml:lang="la">persequitur</foreign>
            because Sestius didn't accompany Cicero: wrongly, as I think. Cicero uses the word as
            expressing his intention, as though he had really done it—"he is by way of escorting
            me." </note> me to Puteoli is polite; in complaining about me he is unfair. For I was
          not so much bound to wait for him until he got back from Cosa, as he was not to have gone
          there until he had seen me, or to have hastened his return. For he knew that I was in a
          hurry to start, and he had written to say that he would join me at Tusculum. <pb n="93"/>

          <dateline>(ARPINUM BEFORE 6TH OF JULY)</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> MARCUS Cicero greets Lucius Munatius Plancus, praetor-designate. I know you are fond of
          our friend Atticus, while for my society you show so much taste that upon my word I think
          I have few friends so attentive and affectionate. For to our ancestral ties—so close, old,
          and legitimate—a great additional force has been added by your personal kind feeling <pb
            n="95"/> towards me and an equal and mutual one on my part towards you. Now you are
          acquainted with the case of the Buthrotians, for I have often pleaded it and clearly set
          it forth in your hearing. Its history is as follows. As soon as we observed that the
          territory of Buthrotum was declared confiscate, Atticus in great alarm drew up a petition.
          He put that in my hands to present to Caesar: for I happened to be going to dine with him
          on that day. I presented that petition to Caesar. He approved of the plea and wrote in
          answer to Atticus saying that his demand was fair. He, however, warned him that the
          Buthrotians must pay their arrears to the day. Atticus in his eager desire for the
          preservation of the state paid the money out of his own pocket. That being done I
          approached Caesar, stated the Buthrotian case, and obtained a decree of the most generous
          nature, which was countersigned by men of the highest rank. In these circumstances I own
          that I used to be surprised at Caesar allowing a number of men who had cast greedy eyes on
          the Buthrotian territory to hold meetings; and that he not only allowed that, but even put
          you at the head of the land-commission. Accordingly, on my remonstrating with him, and
          indeed so often that I incurred a rebuke from him for not trusting his fidelity to his
          word, he told both Marcus Messalla and Atticus himself not to be alarmed, and made no
          concealment of the fact that he did not wish—for he was fond of popularity, as you know—to
          hurt the feelings of those who were in possession; but since they had already crossed the
          sea, he would see to their being removed to some other land. This is what happened while
          he was alive. Well, after Caesar's death, as soon as the consuls in accordance with a
          decree of the senate began hearing cases, what I have just told you was laid before them.
          They admitted the plea without any hesitation and said that they would send you a
          despatch. However, my dear Plancus, though I did not doubt that a senatorial decree, a
          law, and the decision and despatch of the consuls would have the greatest weight with you,
          and although I quite understood that you wished to please Atticus himself, yet in view of
          our friendship and mutual goodwill I have ventured to beg of you, what your own unique
          kindness and exquisite goodness of heart would be sure to obtain from you. It is that,
          what I feel sure you <pb n="96"/> will do of your own accord, you should out of compliment
          to me do with heartiness, completeness, and speed. No one is a warmer, more charming, or
          dearer friend than Atticus is to me. Formerly it was only his money, and that a very large
          sum, that was at stake: now it concerns his credit also, that he should by your assistance
          maintain what he had secured by the exertion of great industry and influence both in
          Caesar's lifetime and after it. If I obtain this favour from you, I should wish you to
          consider that I shall construe your liberality as a personal benefit of the highest kind
          to myself. I will attend with zeal and diligence to whatever I may think is your wish or
          to your interest. Take care of your health. </p>

        <p> I send you Brutus's letter. Good heavens, what helplessness! You will understand when
          you have read it. About the celebration of Brutus's games I agree with you. No, don't go

          younger Quintus is going to escort me as far as Puteoli—what an admirable loyalist! you
          might call him a Favonius—Asinius. <note n="2" anchored="true">Favonius was the well-known
            imitator of <foreign xml:lang="la">Cato</foreign>. Asinius Pollio, besides having been a
            Caesarian, was now posing as more or less of a republican, though he afterwards joined
            Antony. He was already known as an orator and man of letters, and perhaps took "high
            ground" in politics. Perhaps Cicero means, "you would suppose young Quintus to take the
            strictly republican views of Favonius (see p.68), with the culture of a Pollio, as he
            professes to value my society." But it is rather recondite. </note> He has two motives
          for doing so: my society, and a wish to make terms with Brutus and Cassius. But what say
          you? For I know you are intimate with the Othones. Quintus says that Tutia offers herself
          to him, as a divorce has been arranged. His father asked me what sort of reputation she
          had. I said—for I didn't know why he asked the question—that I had never heard anything
          except about her looks and her father. "But why do you ask?" said I. Then he said that his
          son wanted her. Thereupon, though I felt disgusted, I said that I didn't believe those
          stories. His aim—for that is the truth—is to make our friend no allowance. But the lady
          says she won't be baulked by the like of him. <note n="3" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ou) para\ tou=ton</foreign>, "not along of him," but Cicero's
            meaning is not at all clear. We don't know whose daughter Tutia was, or to which of the
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Othones</foreign> she was married. For Quintus's character for
            romancing, see p. 8. </note> However, I suspect young Quintus is, as usual, romancing.
          But please make inquiries—for you can easily do so—and let me know. <milestone unit="para"

            come into public use, for it was re-enacted in his honour after his death, Dio, 45, 8.
            It probably had not been used in formal documents, and Cicero thinks it particularly bad

          of it yourself. I will give him a letter such as he desires. Don't let it influence your
          opinion. I am writing this to prevent your supposing that I am convinced. Heaven send that
          he carries out his promises! <pb n="100"/> It will be a satisfaction to everyone
          concerned. But I-well, I will say nothing more. He starts on the 10th. He says he is
          making a consignment of debts for the 15th, but that he is being very hard pressed. You
          will judge from my letter what answer to give him. I will write at greater length when I
          have seen Brutus and am sending Eros back. I quite accept my dear Attica's apology, and
          love her dearly Give my kind regards to her and Pilia. </p>

        <p> BRUTUS is anxious for a letter from you. I told him about the Tereus of Accius, <note
            n="1" anchored="true">Some exhibition of popular feeling at the acting of Accius's
            tragedy of Tereus (see p. 105). Cicero afterwards (<bibl n="Cic. Phil. 2.31">Phil.
              2.31</bibl>) asserted that the populace had shewn extraordinary enthusiasm for
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign> at these games. But this was evidently not the
            case; and on the contrary the outbursts against the assassins seem finally to have
            decided them to leave Italy. See <bibl n="TLG551.17 3.24">App. B.C. 3.24</bibl>. </note>
          though he had heard it before. He thought that it was the Brutus. But, after all, some
          whisper of a report had reached him that at the opening of the Greek games the attendance
          had been small, at which for one I was not surprised. For you know my opinion of Greek
          games. <note n="2" anchored="true">See vol. i., p. 259 (<bibl n="Cic. Fam. 7.1">Fam.
              7.1</bibl>). </note> But now listen to what is of more importance than everything
          else. Young Quintus stayed with me several days, and if I had wished it would have been
          quite willing to stay longer. But as far as his visit went you could hardly believe how
          much delighted I was with him in every particular, but especially in the point in which he
          used most to disappoint me. For he has become such an entirely changed man-partly by
          certain writings of mine on which I am now engaged, and partly by my constantly talking to
          him and impressing my maxims upon him—that he is really going to be all that I wish in
          politics. After having not <pb n="101"/> only declared this to me, but also thoroughly
          convinced me of it, he implored me at great length to guarantee to you that he would in
          the future be worthy of you and of us. And he didn't ask you to believe this at once, but
          that you should only restore your affection to him when you had seen it with your own
          eyes. Had he not convinced me of this, and had I not made up my mind that what I am saying
          might be relied upon, I would not have done what I am going to tell you. I took the young
          man with me to see Brutus. The latter was so convinced of what I am telling you, that he
          took upon himself to believe in him independently, and would have none of me as guarantee.
          He praised him and spoke of you in the most friendly tone, and dismissed him with embraces
          and kisses. Wherefore, though I have more reason to congratulate you than to prefer any
          request to you, yet I do also request you that if there appeared to be certain
          irregularities in his conduct heretofore, owing to the weakness of youth, you should
          believe that he has now rid himself of them, and should trust me when I say that your
          influence will contribute much, or I should rather say more than anything else, to make
          his decision permanent. <note n="1" anchored="true">This favourable report is conveyed by
            Quintus himself. Cicero had already warned <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign> not
            to believe it. See last letter, and infra, p. 108. </note>
          <milestone unit="para"/>Though I made frequent hints to Brutus about our sailing together,
          he didn't seem to catch at the suggestion as eagerly as I had expected. I thought him in
          an uneasy frame of mind, and indeed he was so-especially about the games. But when I had
          got back to my villa Gnaeus Lucceius, who sees a good deal of Brutus, told me that he was
          hesitating a great deal as to his departure, not from any change of policy, but because he
          was waiting to see if any-thing turned up. So I am doubting whether I shall direct my
          steps to Venusia and there wait to hear about the legions : <note n="2" anchored="true"
            >Which Antony was brining over from Macedonia and Epirus, where they had been stationed
            by Caesar. <foreign xml:lang="la">Venusia</foreign> is on the Appian road to <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Brundisium</foreign>. </note> and if they do not come, as some expect—go
          on to Hydruntum: <note n="3" anchored="true">The nearest harbour in <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Calabria</foreign> for Greece. Cicero had before (p. 8) said that he was going to
            embark there in preference to </note> but if neither port is safe-come back to <pb
            n="102"/> where I am. Do you think I am joking? Upon my life you are the only tie that
          keeps me here. For take a careful view of the situation: but do it before I have cause to
          blush for my conduct. Ah! Lepidus's notice of his inauguration days is just like him, and
          just suits with my plan of return. <note n="1" anchored="true">M. Aemilius Lepidus (the
            future triumvir) had taken advantage of the confusion following the murder of Caesar to
            get himself elected Pontifex Maximus in his place. He had fixed his inauguration
            festival for the 29th of November (see p. 151), by which time Cicero meant to be back in
            Rome. </note> Your letter conveys a strong motive for my starting for Greece. And oh,
          that I might find you there! But it must be as you think most to your advantage. I am
          anxious for a letter from Nepos. Can he really want my books, when he thinks the subjects
          on which I plume myself not worth reading? Yes—as you say: <quote>
            <l>in form and face </l>
            <l>Ajax the flower of all the Grecian host </l>
            <l>Next to the flawless son whom Thetis bore.</l>
          </quote>
          <note n="2" anchored="true">Odyssey, 11.469.The aptness of the quotation, of which he only
            gives two words (<foreign xml:lang="grc">met' a)mu/mona</foreign>), is not very evident.
            He appears to mean, "<foreign xml:lang="la">Cornelius Nepos</foreign> is a very eminent
            and even immortal writer-next of course to you in my eyes." <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Nepos</foreign> devoted himself to history, like <foreign xml:lang="la"

          you. I ought to look through and correct them. They shall not be published till I have
          done so. <note n="3" anchored="true">This does not militate against the fact of the
            greater part of Cicero's letters being spontaneous and written with no eye to

            of such that he probably contemplated being published. He draws the distinction himself
            elsewhere (vol. iii., pp.58-59). </note> Brundisium, at which latter Atticus warned him

        <p> So, as I told you yesterday—or perhaps I should say today, for Quintus said he should
          not reach you till the second day—I went to Nesis on the 8th. Brutus was there. How hurt
          he was by the "Nones of July"! <note n="1" anchored="true">See p.98. </note> He was really
          surprisingly upset. Accordingly, he said that he should write orders to advertise the
          beast-hunt, which is to follow the games of Apollo, as to take place on the "3rd day
          before the Ides of Quinctilis." Libo came in while I was there. He said that Philo, a
          freedman of Pompey's, and Hilarus, a freedman of his own, had come from Sextus Pompeius
          with a letter addressed to the consuls, or whatever they are called. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">Cicero regarded the election of Antony, and of course therefore of
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Dolabella</foreign>, as irregular, and that accordingly they
            were not properly to be called consuls. See <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 2.10">Phil. 2.10</bibl>.
          </note> He read us a copy of it, to see if anything occurred to us. There were a few
          ill-expressed sentences: in other respects it was written with considerable dignity and
          without violence. The only addition we decided upon was that instead of being addressed
          "to the consuls" only, it should be addressed "to consuls, praetors, tribunes of the
          plebs, and senate," for fear the consuls should decline to produce a letter addressed to
          themselves personally. They also report that Sextus has been at New Carthage with only one
          legion, and that on the very day on which he captured the town of Barea he received the
          news about Caesar. That after the capture of the town there was great rejoicing and
          recovery of spirits, and people flocked to him from every side; but that he returned to
          the six legions which he had left in lower Spain. He also wrote to Libo saying that be
          cared for nothing unless he were allowed to return to his own house. The upshot of his
          demands was that all armies <pb n="104"/> wherever stationed should be disbanded. That is
          nearly all about Sextus. <note n="1" anchored="true">For <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >ad</foreign> Larem see p.99. Antony was in possession of Pompey's town house (2 Phil.
            §§ 67, 76). </note>
          <milestone unit="para"/>Though I have been asking questions of everybody about the
          Buthrotians, I cannot find out the truth. Some say the land-grabbers were badly mauled,
          others that Plancus for a sum of money abandoned them and fled. So I don't see how I am to
          know the truth of the matter unless I get some sort of letter at once. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">See p. 98. </note>
          <milestone unit="para"/>The route to Brundisium, about which I was hesitating, appears now
          to be out of the question: for the legions are said to be arriving there. But the voyage
          from this place is not without its suspicion of dangers. Therefore I am making up my mind
          to a joint voyage. I found Brutus more advanced in his preparations than I had been told
          was the case. For both he and Domitius have some really good two-banked galleys; there are
          also some fine vessels belonging to Sestius, Bucilianus, and others. For, as to the fleet
          of Cassius, which is a really fine one, I don't count on that beyond the Sicilian Strait.
          One thing does cause me some little uneasiness—that Brutus seems to be in no great hurry.
          In the first place he is waiting for news as to the completion of his games; in the next
          place, as far as I can understand, he is likely to make the voyage slowly, stopping at
          several points. However, I think it is better to sail slowly than not to sail at all. And
          if; when we have got some distance on, things seem more certain we shall take advantage of
          the Etesian winds. </p>

          <dateline>PUTEOLI, 11 JULY</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> ON the 10th I received two letters, one from my own letter-carrier and the other from
          that of Brutus. The story about the <pb n="105"/> Buthrotians was widely different in
          these parts, but that is only one of the many inconveniences with which one must put up..
          I am sending Eros back sooner than I intended; that there might be some one to pay
          Hortensius, and those in fact with whom he says that he has fixed the 15th as the day of
          settlement Hortensius, however, is shameless in his demand; for nothing is due to him
          except in virtue of the third instalment, payable on the 1st of August—and of this very
          instalment the greater part has been paid him considerably before the day. <note n="1"
            anchored="true">This seems to refer to the inheritance of Cluvius (see vol. iii.,
            p.328). Cicero purchased the <foreign xml:lang="la">horti</foreign> from his co-heirs,
            and the money was to be paid in three instalments, the last on 1st August (see p. iii).
            In the former of these passages Hordeonius is mentioned as one of the co-heirs, but
            there is no reason as far as we know against Hortensius being another. Of him we know
            nothing. He may be the Hortensius with whom Cicero has had many transactions before (see
              <foreign xml:lang="la">ad Att</foreign>. xii. 5: vol. iii., p. 271). </note> But Eros
          will see to this on the 15th. As for Publilius, <note n="2" anchored="true">Brother of
            Cicero's second divorced wife, who was to receive back her dowry. </note> however, I
          think there ought to be no delay in paying him the amount for which a draft is due. But
          when you come to look at the concessions I have made from my legal rights in having paid
          in ready money 200 of the balance of 400 sestertia, and in now giving a note for the
          remainder, you will be able, if you think right, to say to him that he ought to wait my
          convenience in consideration of my having surrendered such a considerable proportion of my
          legal right. But, my very dear Atticus—you see how insinuatingly I put it—do pray
          transact, direct, and steer all my business without waiting for directions from me. For
          though my balances are sufficient for the discharge of debts, still it often happens that
          debtors don't come up to time. If anything of that sort occurs, don't regard anything as
          of more importance than my reputation. Preserve my credit not only by raising a fresh
          loan, but even by selling if necessary. Brutus was gratified by your letter. For I spent
          several hours with him at Nesis shortly after having received your letter. He seemed
          delighted with your account of the Tereus, <note n="3" anchored="true">See <foreign
              xml:lang="la">ante</foreign>, p.100. </note> and to be more obliged to Accius than to
          Antony. In my eyes, however, the better the news the more annoyance and regret <pb n="106"
          /> I feel that the Roman people uses up its hands in clapping, rather than in defending
          the constitution. To my mind, indeed, that party appears to be even more inspired to give
          an immediate display of their own disloyalty. However, "so that they feel a pang, no
          matter what." I am not sorry to hear your remark about my designs being daily more
          commended, and I was looking forward to hear what you had to say about it. For I myself
          was hearing remarks made in different senses. Nay, more, I was letting it drag on
          expressly to avoid coHimitting myself as long as possible. But since I am being turned out
          with a pitchfork, I am now thinking of going to Brundisium. For the avoidance of the
          legions <note n="1" anchored="true">The legions being brought from Macedonia by Antony.
            See <foreign xml:lang="la">ante</foreign>, p.104. </note> is easier and more certain
          than that of the pirates, who are said to be shewing themselves. Sestius was expected on
          the 10th, but he has not come, as far as I know. Cassius has arrived with his little
          fleet. On the uth, after having seen him, I am thinking of going to Pompeii and thence to
          Aeculanum. <note n="2" anchored="true">On the road to <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Brundisium</foreign>. See vol. ii., p.217. </note> You know the rest of the road. As
          to Tutia <note n="3" anchored="true">Whom young Quintus declared ready to marry him. See
            p.97. </note> —that's what I thought. About Aebutius, I don't believe it, but I do not
          care any more than you do. I have written of course to Plancus and Oppius, since you asked
          me to do so. But don't think it necessary to deliver the letters, if you consider it
          better not. For, as they have acted entirely from consideration for you, I fear my letters
          may appear superfluous—at any rate to Oppius, whom I know to be devotedly attached to you.
          However, just as you choose. As you say that you mean to winter in Epirus, I shall be very
          grateful if you arrive there before the time comes at which by your advice I am to return
          to Italy. Write to me as often as possible: if it is on matters of little importance,
          employ any messenger you get hold of; but if it is more urgent, send one of your own men.
          If I get safe to Brundisium, I shall attempt something in the vein of Heracleides. <note
            n="4" anchored="true">That is, some political treatise like that of Heracleides Ponticus

          though I know it is not necessary to write, I yet am going to write. Many things distress
          me in my departure-first and foremost, by heaven, that I am being separated from you. But
          I am also distressed by the fatigue of the voyage, so unsuitable not only to my time of
          life, but also to my rank. Moreover, the time of my departure is rather ridiculous. I am
          leaving peace to return to war; and the season which might have been spent in my favourite
          country places—so prettily built and so full of charm—I am wasting on a foreign tour. The
          consolations are that I shall either do my son some good, or make up my mind how much good
          he is capable of receiving. In the next place you will—as I hope and as you
          promise-presently be there. If that happens indeed things will be better all round. But
          what gives me more uneasiness than anything is the making up of my balances. Though they
          have been put straight, yet since Dolabella's debt is on the list, and among the debtors
          assigned to me are some unknown persons, I feel quite at sea, and this matter gives me
          more uneasiness than everything else. Accordingly, I don't think I have been wrong to
          write to Balbus more openly than usual, to ask him that, if it should so happen that the
          debts did not come in at the proper time, he should come to the rescue; and telling him
          that I had commissioned you, in case of such an occurrence, to communicate with him.
          Please do so, if you think proper, and all the more if you are starting for Epirus.
            <milestone unit="para"/>I write this when on the point of embarking from my Pompeian
          house with three ten-oared pinnaces. Brutus is <pb n="109"/> still at Nesis, Cassius at
          Naples. Can you love Deiotarus and yet dislike Hieras? When Blesamius came to me about it,
          though he was charged not to take any step except on the advice of our friend Sextus
          Peducaeus, he never communicated with him or with any one of our party. <note n="1"
            anchored="true">This refers to a transaction of Deiotarus, tetrarch of Galatia, whom
            Cicero in <date when="-0045">B.C. 45</date> had defended before Caesar on a charge of
            having tried to murder the latter in <date when="-0047">B.C. 47</date>. He had been
            deprived of the greater part of his dominions in <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Armenia</foreign>, but by promising an enormous bribe to <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Fulvia</foreign>, or to Antony himself, his agents had induced Antony to assert that
            among the minutes left by Caesar was one granting him restoration. He appears, however,
            on learning of Caesar's death, to have taken the law into his own hands and seized the
            territories. <foreign xml:lang="la">Hieras</foreign> and Blesamius are his agents in
            Rome, who had managed the transaction. And Deiotarus, having got what he wanted, would
            probably disavow them. See <foreign xml:lang="la">ante</foreign>, p.20; and 2 Phil. §§

        <p> As yet—for I have got as far as Sicca's house at Vibo—I have prosecuted my voyage with
          more comfort than energy. For the greater part has been done by rowing, and there have
          been no nor'-nor'-easters. That has been rather lucky, for there were two bays to be
          crossed, that of Paestum and that of Vibo. We crossed both with sheets taut. I arrived at
          Sicca's house therefore on the eighth day from Pompeii, having rested one day at Velia.
          There I stayed at our friend Talna's house, and couldn't possibly have been received more
          hospitably-especially as Talna himself was away from home. So on the 24th I went to
          Sicca's house. There I found myself quite at home. So I put on an extra day to my visit.

          I do not mistake, there is none. For it is precisely to that which you use your influence
          to bid me return. For you say that my quitting the country is praised to the skies, but
          only on the understanding that I return before the 1st of January. That I shall certainly

          Now just notice my carelessness. I have sent you a book "On Glory": but there is the same
          preface in it as in the third book of the Academics. That results from the fact that I
          keep a volume of prefaces. From it I am accustomed to select one when I have begun some
          treatise. So being at the time at Tusculum, as I did not remember that I had already used
          that preface, I put it into the book which I sent you. When, however, I was reading the
          Academics on board ship, I noticed my mistake. Accordingly, I have written out a new
          preface, and am sending it to you. Please cut the other one off and glue this on. Give my

            brother of Lucius and Titus Munatius Plancus. [Neither the exact date nor the place of

          the cause of the Buthrotians having received the approval of the consuls, to whom
          authority had been given both by a law and a senatorial decree, "that they should
          investigate, determine, and decide on Caesar's acta," you would support that decision and
          relieve both our friend Atticus—whom I know you to be anxious to serve—and myself, who am
          no less anxious than he, from all trouble. For as the whole business has been completed
          with much care and much labour, it now rests with you that we should be able to make as
          early an end as possible to our anxiety. Although I am well aware that a man of your
          wisdom must see that, if the decrees of the consuls which have been delivered as to
          Caesar's acta are not observed, a most chaotic state of things will be the result. The
          fact is that though many of Caesar's arrangements—as was inevitable in the multitude of
          his occupations—are not now thought good, I am yet accustomed to sup-port them with the
          utmost vigour for the sake of peace and quietness. I think you ought by all means to do
          the same, though this letter is not meant to persuade but to prefer a request. Therefore,
          my dear Plancus, I beg and beseech you with an earnestness and a heartiness beyond which,
          upon my honour, I cannot plead any cause, to carry on, <pb n="114"/> treat, and settle
          this business in such a way that what we have obtained from the consuls without any
          hesitation, owing to their great kindness and the justice of our cause, you will not only
          acquiesce, but even rejoice, in our having secured. What your disposition towards Atticus
          is you have often shewn him to his face, as well as myself. If you do this you will have
          put me—always closely allied to you by personal feeling and inherited friendship-under the
          greatest possible obligation. I ask you earnestly and repeatedly to do so. </p>

        <p> I never thought that I should have to come to you as a suppliant. But, by heaven, I am
          not sorry that an opportunity has been given me to test your affection. You know how
          highly I value Atticus. Pray do me this favour also: forget for my sake that he wished
          support given to his own friend who happened to be an opponent of yours, when that
          person's reputation was at stake. That you should grant this pardon is demanded by your
          own sense of fairness; for every man is bound to support his own friends. In the next
          place, if you love me—I put Atticus out of the question—let this be a concession made
          entirely to your Cicero your value for whom you constantly avow, in order that I may now
          unmistakably understand, what I have always thought, that I am deeply loved by you.
            <milestone unit="para"/>By a decree—which I in company of many men of the highest rank
          countersigned-Caesar freed the Buthrotians, and indicated to us that, since the assignees
          of land had crossed the sea, he would send a despatch stating into what district they were
          to be taken. After that, as chance would have it, he met with a sudden death. Then, as you
          know—for you were present when the consuls were bound by a sena <pb n="115"/> tonal decree
          to decide on Caesar's acta—the business was deferred by them to the 1st of June. To the
          decree of the senate there was added a law passed on the 2nd of June, which gave the
          consuls power to decide on "all things appointed, decreed, done by Caesar." The case of
          the Buthrotians was brought before the consuls. The decree of Caesar was read and many
          other minutes of Caesar's were also produced. The consuls by the advice of their assessors
          pronounced judgment in favour of the Buthrotians. They commissioned Plancus. Now, my dear
          Capito—as I know how much influence you always exercise over those with whom you are
          associated, especially over a man of the extreme good nature and kindness of Plancus—use
          every exertion, strain every nerve, or rather every power of fascination, to secure that
          Plancus, who, I hope, is likely to be very good to us, should become still better by your
          means. In any case the facts are of such a nature, in my opinion, that without anyone's
          influence Plancus, considering his character and practical wisdom, is himself not likely
          to hesitate in sup-porting a decision of the consuls, to whom by a law as well as a
          senatorial decree the inquiry into and decision of the matter has been committed. More
          especially so as—if this kind of judicial investigation is discredited—the acta of Caesar
          seem likely to be called in question, the maintenance of which is desired not only by
          those whose personal interests are concerned, but for the sake of peace by those also who
          do not approve of them. This being the case, it is yet to our interest that Plancus should
          act with a ready and obliging disposition. And he will certainly do so, if you display
          that fortiter in re of which I have had frequent examples, and that suaviter in modo in
          which no one is your equal. I earnestly beg you to do so. <pb n="116"/>

        <p> CICERO to Plancus, praetor-designate. Pardon me for writing to you frequently on the
          same subject, in spite of having already written on it with the greatest minuteness. I do
          not do so, my dear Plancus, from distrust of your right feeling or of our friendship. The
          reason is the great amount of property <note n="1" anchored="true">Because he had paid
            their arrears to the treasury (see p.95), which he would not be able to recover if they
            were dispossessed. </note> of our friend Atticus—and now of his credit also—involved in

          countersigned by ourselves as being present at the execution of Caesar's decrees and <pb

          control over that business is in your hands, I don't say to approve, but to approve with
          zeal and cheerfulness of what the consuls have decreed in virtue of Caesar's decrees and
          promises. It is impossible for me to be more grateful for anything than I shall be for
          that. But although I hope that by the time you receive this letter what I asked of you in
          my previous letter will have been granted, yet I will not make an end of asking until I
          have received intelligence of your having actually done what I am looking forward to with
          strong hope. Further, I feel confident of being able to employ a different style of
          letter, and to thank you for an instance of your extreme kindness. If that comes to pass I
          would have you think that it is not so much Atticus—whose interests at stake are very

        <p> Having started on the 6th of August from Leucopetra—for that was to be my port of

            favourable, preferring to wait at the latter place, and then was driven back on a second
            attempt to start. </note> I was driven back upon that same Leucopetra by a violent south
          wind. While waiting there for a change of wind—I was staying in the villa of our friend
          Valerius, where I am quite at home and comfortable-certain men of high rank from Rhegium
          came thither, having lately returned from Rome, among others a friend of our Brutus, who
          (as he told me) had left Brutus at Naples. They brought, first, an edict of Brutus and
          Cassius; secondly, intelligence that there would be a full meeting of <pb n="120"/> the
          senate on the 1st, and that a despatch had been sent by Brutus and Cassius to all
          ex-Consuls and ex-praetors asking them to be present. They announced also that there was a
          great hope of Antony yielding, an arrangement being Come to, and our partisans returning
          to Rome. They added also that I was wanted, and that my absence was being somewhat
          unfavourably criticised. On hearing these news I without hesitation threw aside my design
          of leaving the country, which, by heaven! I had never really liked. When, however, I read
          your letter, I was of course surprised that you had so entirely changed your opinion, but
          I thought that you must have some good reason for it. However, though you had never
          advised nor urged my leaving the country, you had at least expressed approval of my doing
          so, provided that I returned to Rome by the 1st of January. The result of that would have
          been that I should have been abroad as long as the danger seemed less imminent, but have
          returned to find everything in a blaze. But this advice, however short-sighted, I have no
          claim to resent; because in the first place what I did was in accordance with my own
          opinion; and in the second place, even if it were adopted on your suggestion, for what is
          an adviser responsible except good faith? It is the following expression of yours at which
          I cannot sufficiently wonder: "Can you with honour, you who talk of a noble death—can you
          with honour abandon your country?" Was I abandoning it, or did I seem to you at that time
          to be abandoning it? Why, you not only did not forbid my doing what I was doing, but even
          expressed approval. Still severer is what you say afterwards: "I wish you would elaborate
          for me some précis of the reasons justifying your action." Is it really so, my dear
          Atticus? Does my action need a defence, and with you of all people, who expressed such
          strong approval of it? I of course will compose the defence which you require, but
          addressed to some one of those against whose wish and advice I started. Vet, what need now
          of a précis? If I had persevered, there would have been such need. "But," say you, "this
          very fact is an instance of vacillation." No philosopher ever yet—and there has been a
          great deal written upon the subject-defined a mere change of plan as vacillation. So next
          you say: "For if the change had been made by our friend <pb n="121"/> Phaedrus, <note
            n="1" anchored="true">An Epicurean of Athens, of whom we have heard before (vol. ii., p.

            <bibl n="Cic. Att. 14.20">Att. 14.20</bibl>). </note> your defence would have been easy.
          As it is, what answer are we to make?" So then my action was one which I could not justify
          to Cato, that is, was criminal and disgraceful—is that so? I only wish you had been of
          that opinion from the first! You would have been my Cato, as you ever are! But your last
          sentence is the most I might say exasperating: "For our friend Brutus says nothing '-that
          is to say, does not venture to remonstrate with a man of my age. I can't imagine what else
          you Can mean by those words, and by heaven that is it! For on the 17th of August, on my
          arrival at Velia, Brutus heard of it. He was with his ships in the river Hales, three
          miles north of Velia. He immediately walked over to see me. Good heavens! with what
          transports of delight at my return, or rather at my abandonment of the journey, did he
          pour out all that he had repressed before! It made me recall those words of yours, "For
          our friend Brutus holds his tongue." But what he most regretted was that I had not been in
          the senate on the 1st of August. He praised Piso <note n="2" anchored="true">See p.122
          </note> to the skies, but remarked that he was delighted at my having avoided two grounds
          of reproach. One of these I was well aware that I was incurring by this journey—that of
          despairing of and abandoning the Republic. Many people remonstrated with me upon it with
          tears in their eyes, and I was unable to console them by promising a quick return. The
          other was one in regard to which Brutus and his following—and its number was large-were
          much pleased: I mean that I escaped the reproach of being thought to be going to attend
          the Olympic games. There Could be nothing more unbecoming than this at any period of the
          Republic, but at this particular crisis it would have been entirely unjustifiable. So I am
          grateful to the South wind for having saved me from such a scandal. There you have the
          avowed motives for my turning back. They are indeed sound and weighty ones, but none could
          be really sounder than what you yourself said in another letter: "Take measures in case of
          any creditor you may have, that there is enough to pay every man his due. For owing to <pb
            n="122"/> the feat of war the money market is wonderfully tight." I read that letter
          when I was in the middle of the strait, with the result that I could think of no way of
          making such provision, except by being on the spot to support my own credit. But enough of
          this, the rest when we meet. I got hold of Antony's edict from Brutus and read it, as well
          as our friends' splendid answer to it. But I do not clearly see the use or object of these
          edicts: and I am not now, as Brutus thought I ought to do, coming to Rome with a view of
          entering upon politics. For what can be done? Did anyone back up Piso? <note n="1"
            anchored="true">The speech of <foreign xml:lang="la">Piso</foreign> delivered on the 1st
            of August was not supported by any member of the senate (see <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 1.10"
              >Phil. 1.10</bibl>). He was Caesar's father-in-law, and though on this occasion he
            seems to have pleased the opponents of Antony, he afterwards opposed his being declared

          man of my age ought not to be far from his place of burial, as people say. But, I beseech
          you, what is this that I hear from Brutus? He said that you had written to say that Pilia
          was suffering from paralysis. I was much alarmed, although he added that you also said
          that you hoped she was better. I devoutly trust so! Give her my very kindest remembrances,
          as also to my dearest Attica. <milestone unit="para"/>I write this at sea on my way to my

        <p> On the 25th I received two letters from you. I will therefore answer the earlier one
          first. I agree with you: but I would neither lead the van or bring up the rear, and yet be
          on that side in sympathy. I am sending you my speech. As to whether it is to be kept
          locked up or published, I leave the decision to you. But when shall we see the day when
          you shall think that it ought to be published? <note n="1" anchored="true">The venomous
            second Philippic—perhaps the most terrible invective ever composed—was never delivered.
            It is a pamphlet in the form of a speech supposed to be delivered in the senate on the
            19th of September in answer to Antony's. </note> I cannot <pb n="142"/> see the
          possibility of the truce which you mention. Better a masterly silence, which I think I
          shall employ. You say that two legions have arrived at Brundisium: you in Rome get all
          news first. So please write and tell me whatever you hear. I am anxious for Varro's
          "Dialogue." <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Varro</foreign> had promised a Dialogue either dedicated to
            Cicero, or in which Cicero was to be one of the speakers. See vol. iii., p.304. </note>
          I am now all for writing something in the Heracleides style, <note n="2" anchored="true"
            >That is, on constitutional theories, like the work of Heracleides of Pontus. See pp.56,
            93. </note> especially as you like it so much. But I should like to know the sort you
          want. As to what I said to you before (or "previously"—as you prefer to express it), you
          have, to confess the honest truth, made me keener for writing. For to your own opinion,
          with which I was already acquainted, you have added the authority of Peducaeus—a very high
          one in my eyes, and among the most weighty. I will therefore do my best to prevent your
          feeling the lack either of industry or accuracy on my part. <milestone unit="para"/>Yes,
          as you suggest in your letter, I am keeping up with Vettienus and Faberius. I don't think
          Clodius meant any harm, although. But it is all one! As to the maintenance of
          liberty-surely the most precious thing in the world— I agree with you. So it is Caninius
          Gallus's <note n="3" anchored="true">Most editions now read C. <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Annio</foreign>, and refer it to C. Annius <foreign xml:lang="la">Cimber</foreign>
              (<bibl n="Cic. Phil. 11.34">Phil. 11.34</bibl>), a follower of Antony's. In this case,
            Oh <foreign xml:lang="la">hominem nequam</foreign> must be referred to Annius. The MS.
            reading is <foreign xml:lang="la">Gallo</foreign> Caninio. For L. Caninius Gallus, see
            infra, p. 156. He seems to have just died, and if the name is retained here, we must
            refer Oh <foreign xml:lang="la">hominem nequam</foreign> to Antony, and suppose <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign> to have told Cicero of some sharp practice of Antony's
            in regard to his will and property. </note> turn now, is it? What a rascal he is! That's
          the only word for him. Oh cautious Marcellus! I am the same-yet not after all the most
          cautious of men! <milestone unit="para"/>I have answered your longer and earlier letter.
          Now for the shorter and later one—what answer am I to make except that it was a most
          delightful one? Events in Spain are going very well. If I do but see Balbilius safe and
          sound, I shall have a support for my old age. As to the estate of Annius your opinion is
          mine. Visellia shews me great attention. But that's the way of the world. Of Brutus <pb
            n="143"/> you say that you know nothing: but Servilia says that Marcus Scaptius <note

            vol. ii., p.329. </note> has arrived, and that he will pay her a secret visit at her
          house without any parade, and that I shall know everything. Meanwhile, she also tells me
          that a slave of Bassus has arrived to announce that the legions at Alexandria are in arms;
          that Bassus <note n="2" anchored="true">For Caecilius Bassus, the Pompeian who had nearly

        <p> Dolabella is a fine fellow! Although, as I am writing this with the dessert on the
          table, I am told that he had arrived at Baiae, he nevertheless wrote to me from Formiae—a
          letter which reached me just as I had left the bath-saying that he had done his best about
          assigning debtors to me. He lays the blame on Vettienus. Of course he is up to some dodge,
          like a true business man. But he says that our friend Sestius has undertaken the whole
          affair. He indeed is an excellent man and very much attached to us. Still, I am at a loss
          to know what in the world Sestius can do in a business like this which any one of us could
          not do. But if anything unexpected happens, please let me know. If; on the other hand, the
          business, as I think, is hopeless, write all the same. It won't disturb me at all. I am
          here philosophizing—what else could I do? I am <pb n="144"/> composing a brilliant essay

        <p> When I know what day I am coming to town I will let you know. I must expect some
          hindrances, and there is illness among my household. On the evening of the 1st I got a
          letter from Octavian. He is entering upon a serious undertaking. He has won over to his
          views all the veterans at Casilinum and Calatia. And no wonder: he gives a bounty of 500
          denarii apiece. Clearly, his view is a war with Antony under his leadership. So I perceive
          that before many days are over we shall be in arms. But whom are we to follow? Consider
          his name, consider his age! <note n="1" anchored="true">Augustus was born in September,
              <date when="-0063">B.C. 63</date>, and was therefore now nineteen. In the <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Monumentum Ancyranum</foreign>, § I, he begins the record of his
            achievements thus: "When nineteen years old I collected an army on my own account and at
            my own expense, by means of which I restored to liberty the Republic, which had been
            enslaved by the tyranny of a faction." By a "faction" Augustus here means, however, the
            anti-Caesarian aristocrats. At this time Cicero hoped that this army was to be used in
            their interests as against Antony's, though, as we see, he had uneasy doubts about it.
          </note> Again, to begin with, he demands a secret interview with me, at Capua of all <pb
            n="146"/> places! It is really quite childish if he supposes that it can be kept
          private. I have written to explain to him that it is neither necessary nor practicable. He
          sent a certain Caecina of Volaterrae <note n="1" anchored="true">Of the <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Caecinae</foreign> of <foreign xml:lang="la">Volaterrae</foreign>. See
            vol. iii., p.123. </note> to me, an intimate friend of his own, who brought me the news
          that Antony was on his way towards the city with the legion Alauda, was imposing a money
          contribution on the municipal towns, and was marching at the head of the legion with
          colours flying. He wanted my opinion whether he should start for Rome with his army of
          3,000 veterans, or should hold Capua, and so intercept Antony's advance, or should join
          the three Macedonian legions now sailing by the Mare Superum, which he hopes are devoted
          to himself. They refused to accept a bounty offered them by Antony, as my informant at
          least says. They even used grossly insulting language to him, and moved off when he
          attempted to address them. In short, Octavian offers himself as our military leader, and
          thinks that our right policy is to stand by him. On my part I advised his making for Rome.
          For I think that he will have not only the city mob, but, if he can impress them with
          confidence, the loyalists also on his side. Oh, Brutus, where are you? What an opportunity
          you are losing I For my part I did not foresee this, but I thought that something of the
          sort would happen. Now, I desire to have your advice. Shall I come to Rome or stay on
          here? Or am I to fly to Arpinum? There is a sense of security about that place! My opinion
          is—Rome, lest my absence should be remarked, if people think that a blow has been struck.

        <p> Two letters on the same day from Octavian! His present view is that I should come to
          Rome at once: and that he wishes to act through the senate. I told him that a meeting of
          the senate was impossible before the 1st of January: <note n="1" anchored="true"
            >Impossible, that is, with safety to the opponents of Antony, the <foreign xml:lang="la"

            and it would be surrounded by his guards. Several meetings of the senate were, as a
            matter of fact, held before Antony's term of office was over. On the 1st of January the
            new consuls, <foreign xml:lang="la">Pansa</foreign> and Hirtius, would preside. </note>
          and I believe it is really so. But he adds also: "And by your advice." In short, he
          insists: while I "suspend judgment." I don't trust his youth. I am in the dark as to his
          disposition. I am not willing to do anything without your friend Pansa. I am afraid of
          Antony succeeding, and I don't like going far from the sea: and at the same time I fear
          some great coup without my being there. Varro, for his part, doesn't like the youth's
          plan. I don't agree with him. He has forces on which he can depend. He can count on
          Decimus Brutus, <note n="2" anchored="true">Now governor of <foreign xml:lang="la">Gallia

        <p> I RECEIVED two letters from you on the 5th, one dated on the 1st, the other on the day
          previous. So first for the earlier one. I am delighted that you like my pamphlet, from
          which you have picked the plums. They seem all the more brilliant to my eyes for your
          approval of them. For I was mortally afraid of those little red wax wafers <note n="1"
            anchored="true">See p. 86. </note> of yours As to Sicca, it is as you say. I could
          scarcely refrain from the subject you mention. <note n="2" anchored="true">Reading
              <foreign xml:lang="la">ab ista</foreign> re. But the text is very uncertain.
            Apparently what Cicero refrained from mentioning was an intrigue of Antony's with
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Septimia</foreign>, the wife of <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Sicca</foreign>. The latter was a great friend of his, and therefore <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign> had suggested that the topic should be avoided. Cicero
            seems to have alluded—though obscurely—to it (<bibl n="Cic. Phil. 2.3">Phil.
            2.3</bibl>), speaking of having espoused the cause of a <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >familiaris</foreign> against Antony. Perhaps in the original draft the allusion was
            more patent, and names were mentioned. </note> So I will pass over the matter lightly,
          and without fixing any opprobrium upon Sicca and Septimia, only just enough to let our
          children's children know, without any Lucilian ambiguity, that Antony had had children by
          the daughter of Fadius Gallus. <note n="3" anchored="true">Q. Fadius Gallus, a freedman.
            Cicero harps on this mésalliance more than once (see <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 2.3">Phil.
              2.3</bibl>; <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 13.23">Phil. 13.23</bibl>). It was probably Antony's
            first marriage, and the motive was apparently money. He afterwards married his cousin
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Antonia</foreign>, whom he divorced in <date when="-0047">B.C.
              47</date>, and in <date when="-0046">B.C. 46</date> or 45 married <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Fulvia</foreign>, widow first of Clodius and then of Curio. The
            expression <foreign xml:lang="la">sine vallo</foreign> luciliano is very doubtful.
            Tyrrell and Purser propose <foreign xml:lang="grc">fragmw=|</foreign> or <foreign
              xml:lang="grc">fra/gmati</foreign>. It in some way seems to mean that Lucilius in his
            personal attacks guarded himself from danger of retaliation. </note> And I only wish I
          may live to see the day when that oration may have such free circulation in Rome as to
          find its way even into Sicca's house. "But we must have a return to the state of things
          under the triumvirs!" <note n="4" anchored="true">This is the literal translation, but it
            seems a poor jest for <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign> to have made. Perhaps he
            did not mean to jest, but said in all seriousness that the present times were so bad
            that they made them look back. to the period when Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus were

          reprimanded me, I should bear it not merely with patience, but with real pleasure, for in
          your reprimand there were both wisdom and kindly purpose. Therefore I shall cheerfully
          correct faults pointed out by you. I will write "by the same right as you did the property
          of Rubrius," instead of "the property of Scipio": <note n="3" anchored="true">The

            refers in this Philippic to the case of Lucius Rubrius, whom he alleges that Antony
            forced to make a will in his favour. L. Rubrius was one of the officers captured and
            released by Caesar with Domitius at <foreign xml:lang="la">Corfinium</foreign> (<bibl

            pressure on him. <foreign xml:lang="la">Scipio</foreign> perhaps refers to Pompey's
            father-in-law, and <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign> seems to have objected to
            accusing Antony of invading his property. </note> and I will soften down my excessive

          Panaetius goes—I have completed in two books. His treatise is in three. But at the
          beginning he had defined the cases in which duty has to be determined to be three: one
          when we deliberate as to whether a thing is right or wrong; another whether it is
          expedient or inexpedient; and a third when there seems to be a contest between the right
          and the expedient; on what principle we are to decide-as, for instance, in the case of
          Regulus, it was right to return, expedient to stay. Well, having begun by defining these
          three categories, he discussed the first two in brilliant style; on the third he promised
          an essay in due course, but never wrote it. That topic was taken up by Posidonius. I,
          however, both sent for the latter's book, and also wrote to Athenodorus Calvus to send me
          an analysis of it. I am now waiting for this, and I should be obliged if you would give
          him a reminder and ask him to send it as soon as possible. In that treatise there are
          remarks upon "relative duty." As to your question about the title, I have no doubt about
          officium representing <foreign xml:lang="grc">kaqh=kon</foreign>—unless you have something

          for they say he travels with Caesarian rapidity. I therefore turned off at Minturnae by

          However, in regard to what you have said in your letters—for I received three from you on
          the 11th—I quite agree with you that, if Octavian gets much power, the acta of the tyrant

        <p> Don't put it down to idleness that I do not write with my own hand—and yet, by heaven,
          do put it down to idleness; for I have no other excuse to give: and, after all, I think I
          recognize the hand of Alexis in your letters. But to come to business. If Dolabella had
          not treated me in the most dishonourable manner, I should perhaps have considered whether
          to be somewhat easy with him or to press for my strict rights. As it is, however, I even
          rejoice that an opportunity has been presented me of making both him and everybody else
          perceive that I have become alienated from him. I will avow it openly, and shew indeed
          that it is not only for my own sake, but for that of the Republic also, that I detest him:
          because, after having undertaken under my advice to support it, he has not only deserted
          it for a money bribe, but has also, as far as in him lay, contributed to its ruin. Well,
          you ask what proceedings I wish to be taken. As soon as the day comes, I should like them
          to be of such a nature as to make it natural for me to be at Rome. But in regard to that,
          as in regard to everything else, I will yield to your opinion. On the main question,
          however, I wish the matter pressed with all vigour and severity. Though it does not look
          well to call upon sureties for payment, yet I would have you consider how far such a step
          is justifiable. For it is open to me, with a view to his sureties being eventually called
          upon, to bring his agents into the case. I am sure the latter will <pb n="159"/> not
          defend the suit. Though, if they do, I am aware that the sureties are thereby relieved
          from obligation. But I think that it would be a stigma on him not to free his agents from
          a debt for which he gave security; and that my character requires me to enforce my right
          without inflicting signal disgrace upon him. Pray write and tell me what you think of
          this. I have no doubt that you will conduct the whole case with all proper mildness.
            <milestone unit="para"/>I return to public affairs. I have received-heaven knows—many a
          prudent word from you under the head of politics, but never anything wiser than your last
          letter: "Though that youth is powerful and has given Antony a fine check: yet, after all,
          we must wait to see the end." Why, what a speech! <note n="1" anchored="true">The <foreign
              xml:lang="la">contio</foreign> delivered by Octavian on his first visit to Rome.
          </note> It has been sent to me. He qualifies his oath by the words: "So may I attain to
          the honours of my father !" and at the same time he held out his right hand in the
          direction of his statue. Nec servatoribus istis! But, as you say in your letter, the most
          certain source of danger I see to be the tribuneship of this Caesar of ours. This is what
          I spoke about to Oppius. When he urged me to open my arms to the young man, the whole
          cause, and the levy of veterans, I replied that I could by no means do so unless I was
          completely satisfied that he would be not only not hostile to the tyrannicides, but
          actually their friend. When he remarked that it would be so, I said, "What is our hurry
          then? For Octavian does not require my services till the 1st of January: whereas we
          meanwhile shall learn his disposition before the 13th of December in the case of Casca."
            <note n="2" anchored="true">One of the assassins. He was tribune-elect, and would come
            into office 10th December. </note> He cordially assented. Wherefore, so far so good. For
          the rest you shall have a letter-carrier every day, and, as I think, you will have
          something to write to me every day. I inclose a copy of Lepta's letter, from which I
          gather that that braggart captain <note n="3" anchored="true">Antony, some of whose men
            had been deserting to Octavian. </note> has lost his footing. But you will judge when
          you read it. <milestone unit="para"/>P.S.—When I had already sealed this letter I got one
          from you and Sextus. <note n="4" anchored="true">Sextus Peducaeus. </note> Nothing could
          be more delightful and <pb n="160"/> loving than Sextus's letter. For yours was only a
          short note. Your previous one was fuller of matter. Your advice is as prudent as it is
          friendly—that I should remain in this neighbourhood by preference, until I hear how the
          present movements end. But for myself, my dear Atticus, it isn't the Republic that at this
          moment gives me great anxiety-not because there is anything dearer than it in my eyes or
          ought to be so, but Hippocrates himself forbids medical treatment in desperate cases. So
          good-bye to all that! It is my personal property that affects me. Property, do I say? Nay,
          rather my personal reputation. For great as my balances are, I have not yet realized
          enough even to pay Terentia. Terentia, do I say? You know that we some time ago settled to
          pay twenty-five sestertia for the debt to Montanus. My son, from a very keen sense of
          honour, asked us to pay this out of his allowance: and very liberal too it was of him, as
          you also thought. I promised him, and told Eros to earmark it. Not only did he not do so;
          but Aurelius <note n="1" anchored="true">The agent of Montanus. </note> was forced to
          raise a fresh loan at a most oppressive rate of interest. For as to the debt to Terentia,
          Tiro wrote me word that you said that there would be cash from Dolabella. I believe that
          he misunderstood you—if ever a man did misunderstand—or rather that he did not understand
          anything about it. For you wrote and told me the answer made by Cocceius, and so did Eros
          in nearly the same words. <milestone unit="para"/>We must come therefore to Rome—however
          hot the conflagration. For personal insolvency is more discreditable than public disaster.
          Accordingly, on the other subjects, on which you wrote to me in a most charming style, I
          was too completely upset to be able to reply in my usual way. Give your mind to enabling
          me to extricate myself from the anxiety in which I now am. By what measures I am to do so,
          some ideas do occur to my mind, but I can settle nothing for certain until I have seen
          you. Why should I be less safe at Rome than Marcellus? But that is not now the question;
          nor is that the thing about which I am chiefly anxious. You see what is occupying my
          thoughts. I am with you directly therefore. <note n="2" anchored="true">Cicero reached
