              Quintus is hardly a letter, and there is some doubt as to its authenticity. I have
              therefore relegated it to an appendix. </note> partly, no doubt, because Atticus was
            in <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> a great deal during these years. We
            take up the correspondence, therefore, after an interval of two years, which in many
            respects were the most important in <persName><surname>Cicero</surname></persName>'s
            life. In <date when="-0064">B.C. 64</date> he attained his chief ambition by being
            elected to the consulship, but we have little trace of his public actions that year,
            only the fragments of one speech remaining, in defence of Q. Gallius on a charge of
              <foreign xml:lang="la">ambitus</foreign>. The animus of the popular party, however, is
            shown by the prosecution of some surviving partisans of Sulla on charges of homicide,
            among them Catiline, who by some means escaped conviction (<bibl n="TLG385.1 37.10">Dio,
              37.10</bibl>). <milestone unit="para"/>In the year of the consulship (<date
              when="-0063">B.C. 63</date>) some of <persName><surname>Cicero</surname></persName>'s
            most important speeches were delivered. The three on the agrarian proposals of Rullus
            present him to us for the first time as discussing an important question of home
            politics, the disposal of the <foreign xml:lang="la">ager publicus</foreign> a question
            which had become again prominent owing to the great additions made to it by the
            confiscations of Sulla. He also defended C. Rabirius, prosecuted by Iulius Caesar for
            the murder of Saturninus as long ago as <date when="-0100">B.C. 100</date>, and later
            in the year defended Murena on a charge of <foreign xml:lang="la">ambitus</foreign>.
            Finally, the three Catilinarian speeches illustrate the event which coloured the whole
            of <placeName key="tgn,2068515">Cicero</placeName>'s life. <milestone unit="para"/>In
              <date when="-0062">B.C. 62</date> his brother Quintus was praetor and
                <persName><surname>Cicero</surname></persName> defended in his court P. Sulla,
            accused of complicity with Catiline. On the 29th of December (<date when="-0063">B.C.
              63</date>) the tribune Q. Caecilius Metellus Nepos prevented
                <persName><surname>Cicero</surname></persName> from making a speech when laying down
            his consulship, and went on to propose summoning Pompey to <placeName key="tgn,7013962"
              >Rome</placeName>, "to protect the lives of the citizens." This led to scenes of

        <p> M. Tullius Cicero, son of Marcus, greets Cn. Pompeius, son of Cneius, Imperator.
            <milestone unit="para"/>If you and the army are well I shall be glad. From your official
          despatch I have, in common with everyone else, received the liveliest satisfaction; for
          you have given us that strong hope of peace, of which, in sole reliance on you, I was
          assuring everyone. But I must inform you that your old enemies—now posing as your
          friends—have received a stunning blow by this despatch, and, being disappointed in the
          high hopes they were entertaining, are thoroughly depressed. Though your private letter to
          me contained a somewhat slight expression of your affection, yet I can assure you it gave
          me pleasure: for there is nothing in which I habitually find greater satisfaction than in
          the consciousness of serving my friends; and if on any occasion I do not meet with an
          adequate return, I am not at all sorry to have the balance of kindness in my favour. Of
          this I feel no doubt—even if my extraordinary zeal in your behalf has failed to unite you
          to me—that the interests of the state will certainly effect a mutual attachment and
          coalition between us. To let you know, however, what I missed in your letter I will write
          with the candour which my own disposition and our common friendship demand. I did expect
          some congratulation in your letter on my achievements, for the sake at once of the ties
          between us and of the Republic. This I presume to have been omitted by you from a fear of
          hurting anyone's feelings. But let me tell you that what I did for the salvation of the
          country is approved by the judgment and testimony of the whole world. You are a much
          greater man than Africanus, but I am not much inferior to Laelius either; and when you
          come home you will recognize that I <pb n="19"/> have acted with such prudence and spirit,
          that you will not be ashamed of being coupled with me in politics as well as in private
          friendship. </p>

        <p> Q. Metellus Celer, son of Quintus, proconsul, greets M. Tullius Cicero. <note n="1"

            proconsul in <foreign xml:lang="la">Gallia Cisalpina</foreign>, engaged against the
            remains of the Catilinarian Conspiracy. Meanwhile his brother (or cousin) Q. Caecilius
            Metellus <foreign xml:lang="la">Nepos</foreign>, a tribune after trying in vain to bring
            Cicero to trial for the execution of the conspirators at last proposed to summon Pompey
            to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> to prevent danger to the lives of
            citizens. This attempt led to riots and contests with <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Cato</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="la">Nepos</foreign> finally fled from
              <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> to Pompey. By leaving <placeName
              key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> he broke the law as to the tribunes, and the senate
            declared his office vacant, and this letter would even seem to show that the senate
            declared him a public enemy. This letter of remonstrance is peremptory if not insolent,
            in tone, and the reader will observe that the formal sentences, dropped in more familiar
            letters, are carefully used. </note> If you are well I am glad. I had thought,
          considering our mutual regard and the reconciliation effected between us, that I was not
          likely to be held up to ridicule in my absence, nor my brother attacked by you in his
          civil existence and property for the sake of a mere word. If his own high character was
          not a sufficient protection to him, yet either the position of our family, or my own loyal
          conduct to you and the Republic ought to have been sufficient to support him. As it is I
          see that he has been ruined and I abandoned by the last people in the world who ought to
          have done so. I am accordingly in sorrow and wearing mourning dress, while actually in
          command of a province and army and conducting a war. And seeing that your conduct in this
          affair has neither been reasonable nor in accordance <pb n="20"/> with the milder methods
          of old times, you must not be surprised if you live to repent it. I did not expect to find
          you so fickle towards me and mine. For myself, meanwhile, neither family sorrow nor
          ill-treatment by any individual shall withdraw me from the service of the state. </p>

        <p> M. Tullius, son of Marcus, to Q. Metellus Celer, son of Quintus, proconsul wishes
          health. If you and the army are well I shall be glad. You say in your letter that you
          "thought, considering our mutual regard and the reconciliation effected between us, that
          you were not likely to be held up to ridicule by me." To what you refer I do not clearly
          understand, but I suspect that you have been informed that, while arguing in the senate
          that there were many who were annoyed at my having saved the state, I said that your
          relations, whose wishes you had been unable to withstand, had induced you to pass over in
          silence what you had made up your mind you ought to say in the senate in my praise. But
          while saying so I also added this—that the duty of supporting the Republic had been so
          divided between us that I was defending the city from internal treachery and the crime of
          its own citizens, you <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> from armed enemies
          and covert conspiracy <note n="1" anchored="true">Metellus had been employed with Antonius
            against the camp at <foreign xml:lang="la">Faesulae</foreign>, but was now engaged
            against some Alpine tribes. </note> yet that this association in a task so noble and so
          glorious had been imperilled by your relations, who, while you had been complimented by me
          in the fullest and most laudatory terms, had been afraid of any display of mutual regard
          on your part being put to my credit. As this sentence betrayed how much I had looked
          forward to your speech, and how mistaken I had <pb n="21"/> been in that expectation, my
          speech caused some amusement, and was received with a moderate amount of laughter; but the
          laugh was not against you, it was rather at my mistake, and at the open and naive
          confession of my eagerness to be commended by you. Surely it cannot but be a compliment to
          you that in the hour of my greatest triumph and glory I yet wished for some testimony of
          approval from your lips. As to your expression, "considering our mutual regard "—I don't
          know your idea of what is "mutual" in friendship; mine is an equal interchange of good
          feeling. Now if I were to mention that I passed over a province for your sake, you might
          think me somewhat insincere; for, in point of fact, it suited my convenience, and I feel
          more and more every day of my life the advantage and pleasure which I have received from
          that decision. But this I do say—the moment I had announced in public meeting my refusal
          of a province, I began at once thinking how I might hand it on to you. I say nothing as to
          the circumstances of your allotment: I only wish you to suspect that nothing was done in
          that matter by my colleague without my cognizance. Recall the other circumstances: how
          promptly I summoned the senate on that day after the lots had been drawn, at what a length
          I spoke about you. You yourself said at the time that my speech was not merely
          complimentary to you, but absolutely a reflection on your colleagues. Further, the decree
          of the senate passed on that day has such a preamble that, so long as it is extant, there
          can never be any doubt of my services to you. Subsequently, when you had gone out of town;
          I would have you recall my motions in the senate, my speeches in public meetings, my
          letters to yourself. And having reviewed all these together, I would like you to judge
          yourself whether you think that your approach to <placeName key="tgn,7013962"
            >Rome</placeName> the last time you came quite showed an adequate return for all these
          services. <note n="1" anchored="true">When Metellus was commanding against <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Catiline</foreign>, it is suggested that he marched towards <placeName
              key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> to support his brother, but this is conjecture.
          </note> Again, as to your expression, "the reconciliation effected between us "—I do not
          understand why you speak of "reconciliation" in the case of a friendship that had never
          been broken. As to what you say, that your brother Metellus ought not "to have been <pb
            n="22"/> attacked by me for a mere word," in the first place I would like to assure you
          that your feeling and fraternal partiality—so full of human kindness and natural
          affection—meet with my warmest approbation; in the next place I must claim your indulgence
          if I have in any matter opposed your brother in the interests of the Republic, for my
          devotion to the Republic is paramount. If however, it is my personal safety that I have
          defended against a most ruthless assault of his, I think you should be content that I make
          no complaint even to you of your brother's injurious conduct. Now, when I had become aware
          that he was deliberately making every preparation to use his tribunician office to my
          ruin, I appealed to your wife Claudia <note n="1" anchored="true">Sister of P. Clodius. Of
            this famous woman we shall hear often again. She is believed to be the <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Lesbia</foreign> of Catullus, and she is the Palatine Medea" of the
            speech <title>pro Caelio</title>. Yet, in spite of Cicero's denunciations of her, he
            seems at one time to have been so fond of her society as to rouse Terentia's jealousy.
          </note> and your sister Mucia <note n="2" anchored="true">Wife of Pompey—divorced by him
            on his return from the East. </note> (of whose kindness to me for the sake of my
          friendship with Pompey I had satisfied myself by many instances) to deter him from that
          injurious conduct. And yet, as I am sure you have heard, on the last day of December he
          inflicted upon me—a consul and the preserver of my country—an indignity such as was never
          inflicted upon the most disloyal citizen in the humblest office : that is to say, he
          deprived me when laying down my office of the privilege of addressing the people—an
          indignity, however, which after all redounded to my honour. For, upon his forbidding me to
          do anything but take the oath, I pronounced an oath at once the most absolutely true and
          the most glorious in a loud voice—an oath which the people swore also in a loud voice to
          be absolutely true. Though I had actually suffered this signal indignity, I yet on that
          same day sent common friends to Metellus to persuade him to alter his resolution; to whom
          he answered that he was no longer free to do so. And, in fact, a short time previously he
          had said in a public meeting that a man who had punished others without trial ought not
          himself to be allowed the privilege of speech. What a model of consistency! What an
          admirable citizen! So he deemed the <pb n="23"/> man who had saved the senate from
          massacre, the city from the incendiary, <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>
          from war, deserving of the same penalty as that inflicted by the senate with the unanimous
          approval of all loyal citizens, upon those who had intended to set fire to the city,
          butcher magistrates and senate, and stir up a formidable war! Accordingly, I did withstand
          your brother Metellus to his face: for on the 1st of January, in the senate, I maintained
          a debate with him on the state of the Republic, such as taught him that he had to contend
          with a man of courage and firmness. On the 3rd of January, <note n="1" anchored="true">On
            the next meeting of the senate. The second was a <foreign xml:lang="la">dies

              n="Caes. Civ. 1.1">Caes. B. Civ. 1.1</bibl>). </note> on again opening the debate, he
          kept harping on me and threatening me at every third word of his speech; nor could any
          intention be more deliberate than his was to overthrow me by any means in his power, not
          by calm and judicial argument, but by violence and mere browbeating. If I had not shown
          some boldness and spirit in opposing his intemperate attack, would not everyone have
          concluded that the courage I had displayed in my consulship was the result of accident
          rather than design? If you did not know that Metellus was contemplating these measures in
          regard to me you must consider that you have been kept in the dark by your brother on
          matters of the utmost importance: if, on the other hand, he did entrust any part of his
          designs to you, then surely I ought to be regarded by you as a man of placable and
          reasonable temper for not addressing a word of reproach to you even on such occurrences as
          these Understanding then that it was by no "mere word" (as you express it) of Metellus
          that I was roused, but by his deliberate policy and extraordinary animosity towards me
          next observe my forbearance—if "forbearance" is the name to be given to irresolution and
          laxity under a most galling indignity. I never once delivered a vote in a speech against
          your brother every time a motion was before the house I assented without rising to those
          whose proposal appeared to me to be the mildest. I will also add that, though in the
          circumstances there was no obligation upon me to do so, yet so far from raising objections
          I actually did my best to secure that my enemy, <pb n="24"/> because he was your brother,
          should be relieved from penalties by a decree of the senate. <note n="1" anchored="true"
            >For the riots caused by his contests with <foreign xml:lang="la">Cato</foreign> (on

              >Rome</placeName> while tribune. </note> Wherefore I have not "attacked" your brother,
          but only defended myself from your brother's attack; nor have I been "fickle" (to quote
          your word), but, on the contrary, so constant, that I remained faithful to my friendship
          to you, though left without any sign of kindness from you. For instance, at this moment,
          though your letter amounts almost to a threat, I am writing back an answer such as you
          see. I not only pardon your vexation, I even applaud it in the highest degree; for my own
          heart tells me how strong is the influence of fraternal affection. I ask you in your turn
          to put a liberal construction upon my vexation, and to conclude that when attacked by your
          relatives with bitterness, with brutality, and without cause, I not only ought not to
          retract anything, but, in a case of that kind, should even be able to rely upon the aid of
          yourself and your army. I have always wished to have you as a friend: I have taken pains
          to make you understand that I am a warm friend to you. I abide by that sentiment, and
          shall abide by it as long as you will let me; and I shall more readily cease to be angry
          with your brother for love of you, than I shall from anger with him abate in the smallest
          degree my kindness for you. </p>

          character and attached to you, yet, remembering the tenor of your previous letter to me, I
          could not feel certain that the wishes of a cautious man of the world like yourself had
          undergone so complete a change. But after your wife Cornelia had called on Terentia, and I
          had had a conversation with Q. Cornelius, I took care to be present at every meeting of
          the senate, and found that the greatest trouble was to make Fufius the tribune, and the
          others to whom you had written, believe me rather than your own letters. The whole
          business has, after all, been postponed till January, but there is no difficulty about it.
          Roused by your congratulations—for in a letter sometime ago you wished me good luck on the
          completion of my purchase of a house from Crassus—I have bought that very house for 3,500
          sestertia, a good while subsequent to your congratulation. Accordingly, you may now look
          upon me as being so deeply in debt as to be eager to join a conspiracy if anyone would
          admit me! But, partly from personal dislike they shut their doors in my face and openly
          denounce me as the punisher of conspiracy, partly are incredulous and afraid that I am
          setting a trap for them! Nor do they suppose that a man can be short of money who has
          relieved the money-lenders from a state of siege. In point of fact, money is plentiful at
          six per cent., and the success of my measures has caused me to be regarded as a good
          security. Your own house, and all the details of its construction, I have examined and
          strongly approve. As for Antonius, <note n="1" anchored="true">Gaius Antonius, Cicero's

        </opener>
        <p> M. Cicero wishes health to Gaius Antonius, son of Marcus, Imperator. Though I had
          resolved to write you nothing but formal letters of introduction (not because I felt that
          they had much weight with you, but to avoid giving those who asked me for them an idea
          that there had been any diminution in our friendship), yet since Titus Pomponius is
          starting for your province, who knows better than anyone else all that I feel and have
          done for you, who desires your friendship and is most devotedly attached to me, I thought
          I must write something, especially as I had no other way of satisfying Pomponius himself.
          Were I to ask from you services of the greatest moment, it ought not to seem surprising to
          anyone: for you have not wanted from me any that concerned your interests, honour, or
          position. That no return has been made by you for these you are the best witness : that
          something even of a contrary nature has proceeded from you I have been told by many. I say
          "told," for I do not venture to say "discovered," <note n="1" anchored="true">The word
              (<foreign xml:lang="la">comperisse</foreign>) used by Cicero in regard to the
            Catilinarian conspiracy; it had apparently become a subject of rather malignant chaff.
          </note> lest I should chance to use the word which people tell me is often falsely
          attributed to me by you. But the story which has reached my ears I would prefer your
          learning from Pomponius (who was equally hurt by it) rather than from my letter. How
          singularly loyal my feelings have been to you the senate and Roman people are both
          witnesses. How far you have been grateful to me you may yourself estimate: how much you
          owe me the rest of the world estimates. I was induced to do what I did for you at first by
          affection, and afterwards by consistency. Your future, believe me, stands in need of much
          greater zeal on my part, <pb n="29"/> greater firmness and greater labour. <note n="1"
            anchored="true">Cicero is hinting at the danger of prosecution hanging over the head of
            Antonius. </note> These labours, unless it shall appear that I am throwing away and
          wasting my pains, I shall support with all the strength I have; but if I see that they are

          What the meaning of all this is you will be able to learn from Pomponius. In commending
          Pomponius to you, although I am sure you will do anything in your power for his own sake,
          yet I do beg that if you have any affection for me left, you will display it all in
          Pomponius's business. You can do me no greater favour than that. </p>

        <p>
          <milestone unit="section" n="1"/> Though I have no doubt that many messengers,<note
            anchored="true">Quintus Cicero was praetor in <date when="-0062">B.C. 62</date>. In
              <date when="-0061">B.C. 61</date> (March) he went out to "<placeName key="tgn,1000004"
              >Asia</placeName>" as propraetor; his first year of office would be up in March, <date
              when="-0060">B.C. 60</date>, but his governorship was, as was very common, extended
            till March, <date when="-0059">B.C. 59</date>. Towards the end of <date when="-0060"
              >B.C. 60</date> the senate seems to have arranged not to appoint his successor, that
            is, he would be left in office till about March, <date when="-0058">B.C. 58</date>. It
            is in view of this third year of office that Cicero writes this essay-letter to him on
            the duties of a provincial governor. Apparently Quintus bad faults of temper which had
            caused some scandals to reach <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. We have
            seen how he was one of the few who managed to quarrel with <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Atticus;</foreign> and in <date when="-0048">B.C. 48</date> we shill find how
            fiercely he resented the exercise of his brother's influence which had led him to take
            the losing side, which from his attachment to Caesar he may have been half inclined to
            think the wrong side. His constant squabbles with his wife (though the fault was
            evidently in great part hers) also go towards forming our conclusion about him that,
            with some ability and honesty, he was <foreign xml:lang="fr">un peu
            difficile</foreign>.</note> and even common rumour, with its usual speed, will
          anticipate this letter, and that you will already have heard from others that a third year
          has been added to my loss and your labour, yet I thought you ought to receive from me also
          the news of this tiresome circumstance. For not in one, but in several of my previous
          letters, in spite of others having given up the idea in despair, I gave you hope of being
          able at an early date to quit your province, not only that I might as <pb n="71"/> long as
          possible cheer you with a pleasurable belief, but also because I and the praetors took
          such pains in the matter, that I felt no misgiving as to the possibility of its being
          arranged. As it is, since matters have so turned out that neither the praetors by the
          weight of their influence, nor I by my earnest efforts, have been able to prevail, it is
          certainly difficult not to be annoyed, yet our minds, practised as they are in conducting
          and supporting business of the utmost gravity, ought not to be crushed or weakened by
          vexation. And since men ought to feel most vexed at what has been brought upon them by
          their own fault, it is I who ought in this matter to be more vexed than you. For it is the
          result of a fault on my part, against which you had protested both in conversation at the
          moment of your departure, and in letters since, that your successor was not named last
          year. In this, while consulting for the interests of our allies, and resisting the
          shameless conduct of some merchants, and while seeking the increase of our reputation by
          your virtues, I acted unwisely, especially as I made it possible for that second year to
          entail a third. And as I confess the mistake to have been mine, it lies with your wisdom
          and kindness to remedy it, and to see that my imprudence is turned to advantage by your
          careful performance of your duties. And truly, if you exert yourself in every direction to
          earn men's good word, not with a view to rival others, but henceforth to surpass yourself,
          if you rouse your whole mind and your every thought and care to the ambition of gaining a
          superior reputation in all respects, believe me, one year added to your labour will bring
          us, nay, our posterity also, a joy of many years' duration. Wherefore I begin by
          entreating you not to let your soul shrink and be cast down, nor to allow yourself to be
          overpowered by the magnitude of the business as though by a wave; but, on the contrary, to
          stand upright and keep your footing, or even advance to meet the flood of affairs. For you
          are not administering a department of the state, in which fortune reigns supreme, but one
          in which a well-considered policy and an attention to business are the most important
          things. But if I had seen you receiving the prolongation of a command in a great and
          dangerous war, I should have trembled in spirit, because I should have <pb n="72"/> known
          that the dominion of fortune over us had been at the same time prolonged. As it is,
          however, a department of the state has been entrusted to you in which fortune occupies no
          part, or, at any rate, an insignificant one, and which appears to me to depend entirely on
          your virtue and self-control. We have no reason to fear, as far as I know, any designs of
          our enemies, any actual fighting in the field, any revolts of allies, any default in the
          tribute or in the supply of corn, any mutiny in the army: things which have very often
          befallen the wisest of men in such a way, that they have been no more able to get the
          better of the assault of been granted profound peace, a dead calm: yet if the pilot
          fortune, than the best of pilots a violent tempest. You have falls asleep, it may even so
          overwhelm him, though if he keeps awake it may give him positive pleasure. For your
          province consists, in the first place, of allies of a race which; of all the world, is the
          most civilized; and, in the second place, of Citizens, who, either as being <foreign
            xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign> are very closely connected with me, or, as being
          traders who have made money, think that they owe the security of their property to my
          consulship. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But it may be said that among even such men
          as these there occur serious disputes, many wrongful acts are committed, and hotly
          contested litigation is the result. As though I ever thought that you had no trouble to
          contend with! I know that the trouble is exceedingly great, and such as demands the very
          greatest prudence; but remember that it is prudence much more than fortune on which, in my
          opinion, the result of your trouble depends. For what trouble is it to govern those over
          whom you are set, if you do but govern yourself? That may be a great and difficult task to
          others, and indeed it is most difficult: to you it has always been the easiest thing in
          the world, and indeed ought to be so, for your natural disposition is such that, even
          without discipline, it appears capable of self-control; whereas a discipline has, in fact,
          been applied that might educate the most faulty of characters. But while you resist, as
          you do, money, pleasure, and every kind of desire yourself, there will, I am to be told,
          be a risk of your not being able to suppress some fraudulent banker or some rather
          over-extortionate tax-collector! For as to the Greeks, they will think, as they behold the
          innocence of <pb n="73"/> your life, that one of the heroes of their history, or a demigod
          from heaven, has come down into the province. And this I say, not to induce you to act
          thus, but to make you glad that you are acting or have acted so. It is a splendid thing to
          have been three years in supreme power in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>
          without allowing statue, picture, plate, napery, slave, anyone's good looks, or any offer
          of money—all of which are plentiful in your province—to cause you to swerve from the most
          absolute honesty and purity of life. What can be imagined so striking or so desirable as
          that a virtue, a command over the passions, a self-control such as yours, are not
          remaining in darkness and obscurity, but have been set in the broad daylight of <placeName
            key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, before the eyes of a famous province, and in the
          hearing of all nations and peoples? That the inhabitants are not being ruined by your
          progresses, drained by your charges, agitated by your approach? That there is the
          liveliest joy, public and private, wheresoever you come, the city regarding you as a
          protector and not a tyrant, the private house as a guest and not a plunderer? <milestone
            unit="section" n="3"/></p>
        <p>But in these matters I am sure that mere experience has by this time taught you that it
          is by no means sufficient to have these virtues yourself, but that you must keep your eyes
          open and vigilant, in order that in the guardianship of your province you may be
          considered to vouch to the allies, the citizens, and the state, not for yourself alone,
          but for all the subordinates of your government. However, you have in the persons of your
            <foreign xml:lang="la">legati</foreign> men likely to have a regard for their own
          reputation. Of these in rank, position, and age Tubero is first; who, I think,
          particularly as he is a writer of history, could select from his own Annals many whom he
          would like and would be able to imitate. Allienus, again, is ours, as well in heart and
          affection, as in his conformity to our principles. I need not speak of Gratidius: I am
          sure that, while taking pains to preserve his own reputation, his fraternal affection for
          us makes him take pains for ours also. <note n="1" anchored="true">Of the persons
            mentioned, L. Aelius <foreign xml:lang="la">Tubero</foreign> is elsewhere praised as a
            man of learning (<bibl n="Cic. Lig. 10">pro Lig. § 10</bibl>); A. Allienus (praetor
              <date when="-0049">B.C. 49</date>) was a friend and Correspondent; M. Gratidius is
            mentioned in <bibl n="Cic. Flac. 49">pro Flacco, § 49</bibl>, as acting in a judicial
            capacity, and was perhaps a cousin of Cicero's. </note> Your quaestor is not of your own
          selection, but the one assigned you by lot. He is bound both to act with propriety <pb
            n="74"/> of his own accord, and to conform to the policy and principles which you lay
          down. But should any one of these adopt a lower standard of conduct, you should tolerate
          such behaviour, if it goes no farther than a breach, in his private capacity, of the rules
          by which he was bound, but not if it goes to the extent of employing for gain the
          authority which you granted him as a promotion. For I am far from thinking, especially
          since the moral sentiments of the day are so much inclined to excessive laxity and
          self-seeking, that you should investigate every case of petty misconduct, and thoroughly
          examine every one of these persons; but that you should regulate your confidence by the
          trustworthiness of its recipient. And among such persons you will have to vouch for those
          whom the Republic has itself given you as companions and assistants in public affairs, at
          least within the limits which I have before laid down. <milestone unit="section" n="4"
          /></p>
        <p>In the case, however, of those of your personal staff or official attendants whom you
          have yourself selected to be about you—who are usually spoken of as a kind of praetor's
          cohort—we must vouch, not only for their acts, but even for their words. But those you
          have with you are the sort of men of whom you may easily be fond when they are acting
          rightly, and whom you may very easily check when they show insufficient regard for your
          reputation. By these, when you were raw to the work, your frank disposition might possibly
          have been deceived—for the better a man is the less easily does he suspect others of being
          bad—now, however, let this third year witness an integrity as perfect as the two former,
          but still more wary and vigilant. Listen to that only which you are supposed to listen to;
          don't let your ears be open to whispered falsehoods and interested suggestions. Don't let
          your signet ring be a mere implement, but, as it were, your second self: not the minister
          of another's will, but a witness of your own. Let your marshal hold the rank which our
          ancestors wished him to hold, who, looking upon this place as not one of profit, but of
          labour and duty, scarcely ever conferred it upon any but their freedmen, whom they indeed
          controlled almost as absolutely as their slaves. Let the lictor be the dispenser of your
          clemency, not his own; and let the fasces and axes which they carry before you constitute
          ensigns rather of rank than of power. Let it, in fact, <pb n="75"/> be known to the whole
          province that the life, children, fame, and fortunes of all over whom you preside are
          exceedingly dear to you. Finally, let it be believed that you will, if you detect it, be
          hostile not only to those who have accepted a bribe, but to those also who have given it.
          And, indeed, no one will give anything, if it is made quite clear that nothing is usually
          obtained from you through those who pretend to be very influential with you. Not, however,
          that the object of this discourse is to make you over-harsh or suspicious towards your
          staff. For if any of them in the course of the last two years has never fallen under
          suspicion of rapacity, as I am told about Caesius and Chaerippus and Labeo—and think it
          true, because I know them—there is no authority, I think, which may not be entrusted to
          them, and no confidence which may not be placed in them with the utmost propriety, and in
          anyone else like them. But if there is anyone of whom you have already had reason to
          doubt, or concerning whom you have made some discovery, in such a man place no confidence,
          intrust him with no particle of your reputation. V. If, however, you have found in the
          province itself anyone, hitherto unknown to us, who has made his way into intimacy with
          you, take care how much confidence you repose in him; not that there may not be many good
          provincials, but, though we may hope so, it is risky to be positive. For everyone's real
          character is covered by many wrappings of pretence and is concealed by a kind of veil:
          face, eyes, expression very often lie, speech most often of all. Wherefore, how can you
          expect to find in that class <note n="1" anchored="true">The class of Romans who have
            practically become provincials. </note> any who, while foregoing for the sake of money
          all from which we can scarcely tear ourselves away, <note n="2" anchored="true"><placeName
              key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and its society and interests. </note> will yet
          love you sincerely and not merely pretend to do so from interested motives? I think,
          indeed, it is a hard task to find such men, especially if we notice that the same persons
          care nothing for almost any man out of office, yet always with one consent show affection
          for the praetors. But of this class, if by chance you have discovered any one to be fonder
          of you—for it may so happen—than of your office, such a man indeed gladly admit upon <pb
            n="76"/> your list of friends: but if you fail to perceive that, there is no Class of
          people you must be more on your guard against admitting to intimacy, just because they are
          acquainted with all the ways of making money, do everything for the sake of it, and have
          no consideration for the reputation of a man with whom they are not destined to pass their
          lives. And even among the Greeks themselves you must be on your guard against admitting
          close intimacies, except in the case of the very few, if such are to be found, who are
          worthy of ancient <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>. As things now stand,
          indeed, too many of them are untrustworthy, false, and schooled by long servitude in the
          arts of extravagant adulation. My advice is that these men should all be entertained with
          courtesy, but that close ties of hospitality or friendship should only be formed with the
          best of them: excessive intimacies with them are not very trustworthy—for they do not
          venture to oppose our wishes—and they are not only jealous of our countrymen, but of their
          own as well. VI. And now, considering the caution and care that I would show in matters of
          this kind—in which I fear I may be somewhat over-severe—what do you suppose my sentiments
          are in regard to slaves? Upon these we ought to keep a hold in all places, but especially
          in the provinces. On this head many rules may be laid down, but this is at once the
          shortest and most easily maintained—that they should behave during your progresses in
            <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> as though you were travelling on the
          Appian way, and not suppose that it makes any difference whether they have arrived at
            <placeName key="tgn,7002359">Tralles</placeName> or <placeName key="perseus,Formiae"
            >Formiae</placeName>. But if, again, any one of your slaves is conspicuously
          trustworthy, employ him in your domestic and private affairs; but in affairs pertaining to
          your office as governor, or in any department of the state, do not let him lay a finger.
          For many things which may, with perfect propriety, be in-trusted to slaves, must yet not
          be so entrusted, for the sake of avoiding talk and hostile remark. But my discourse, I
          know not how, has slipped into the didactic vein, though that is not what I proposed to
          myself originally. For what right have I to be laying down rules for one who, I am fully
          aware, in this subject especially, is not my inferior in wisdom, while in experience he is
          even my superior? Yet, after all, if your actions had the additional weight of my
          approval, I <pb n="77"/> thought that they would seem more satisfactory to yourself.
          Wherefore, let these be the foundations on which your public character rests: first and
          foremost your own honesty and self-control, then the scrupulous conduct of all your staff,
          the exceedingly cautious and careful selection in regard to intimacies with provincials
          and Greeks, the strict and unbending government of your slaves. These are creditable even
          in the conduct of our private and everyday business: in such an important government,
          where morals are so debased and the province has such a corrupting influence, they must
          needs seem divine. Such principles and conduct on your part are sufficient to justify the
          strictness which you have displayed in some acts of administration, owing to which I have
          encountered certain personal disputes with great satisfaction, unless, indeed, you suppose
          me to be annoyed by the complaints of a fellow like Paconius—who is not even a Greek, but
          in reality a Mysian or Phrygian—or by the words of Tuscenius, a madman and a knave, from
          whose abominable jaws you snatched the fruits of a most infamous piece of extortion with
          the most complete justice. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/></p>
        <p>These and similar instances of your strict administration in your province we shall find
          difficulty in justifying, unless they are accompanied by the most perfect integrity:
          wherefore let there be the greatest strictness in your administration of justice, provided
          only that it is never varied from favour, but is kept up with impartiality. But it is of
          little avail that justice is administered by yourself with impartiality and care, unless
          the same is done by those to whom you have entrusted any portion of this duty. And,
          indeed, in my view there is no very great variety of business in the government of
            <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>: the entire province mainly depends on the
          administration of justice. In it we have the whole theory of government, especially of
          provincial government, clearly displayed: all that a governor has to do is to show
          consistency and firmness enough, not only td resist favouritism, but even the suspicion of
          it. To this also must be added courtesy in listening to pleaders, consideration in
          pronouncing a decision, and painstaking efforts to convince suitors of its justice, and to
          answer their arguments. It is by such habits that C. Octavius has recently made himself
            <pb n="78"/> very popular; <note n="1" anchored="true">Father of Augustus, governor of
              <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, <date when="-0060">B.C.

              61</date>) at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; at any rate, as well as
            to his conduct in <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>. </note> in whose
          court, for the first time, <note n="2" anchored="true">Reading <foreign xml:lang="la"

          kept silence, while every suitor spoke as often and as long as he chose. In which conduct
          he would perhaps have been thought over-lax, had it not been that this laxity enabled him
          to maintain the following in stance of severity. The partisans of Sulla were forced to
          restore what they had taken by violence and terrorism. Those who had made inequitable
          decrees; while in office, were now as private citizens forced to submit to the principles
          they had established. This strictness on his part would have been thought harsh, had it
          not been rendered palatable by many sweetening influences of courtesy. But if this
          gentleness was sufficient to make him popular at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
            >Rome</placeName>, where there is such haughtiness of spirit, such unrestrained liberty,
          such unlimited licence of individuals, and, in fine, so many magistrates, so many means of
          obtaining protection, such vast power in the hands of the popular assembly, and such
          influence exercised by the senate, how welcome must a praetor's courtesy be in <placeName
            key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, in which there is such a numerous body of citizens
          and allies, so many cities, so many communities, all hanging on one man's nod, and in
          which there are no means of protection, no one to whom to make a complaint, no senate, no
          popular assembly! Wherefore it requires an exalted character, a man who is not only
          equitable from natural impulse, but who has also been trained by study and the refinements
          of a liberal education, so to conduct himself while in the possession of such immense
          power, that those over whom he rules should not feel the want of any other power.
            <milestone unit="section" n="8"/></p>
        <p>Take the case of the famous Cyrus, portrayed by Xenophon, not as an historical character,
          but as a model of righteous government, the serious dignity of whose character is
          represented by that philosopher as combined with a peculiar courtesy. And, indeed, it is
          not without reason that our hero Africanus used perpetually to have those books in his
          hands, for there is no duty pertaining to a careful and equitable governor which is not to
          be found in them. Well, if he <pb n="79"/> cultivated those qualities, though never
          destined to be in a private station, how carefully ought those to maintain them to whom
          power is given with the understanding that it must be surrendered, and given by laws under
          whose authority they must once more come? In my opinion all who govern others are bound to
          regard as the object of all their actions the greatest happiness of the governed. That
          this is your highest object, and has been so since you first landed in <placeName
            key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, has been published abroad by Consistent rumour and
          the conversation of all. It is, let me add, not only the duty of one who governs allies
          and citizens, but even of one who governs slaves and dumb animals, to serve the interests
          and advantage of those under him. In this point I notice that everyone agrees that you
          take the greatest pains: no new debt is being contracted by the states, while many have
          been relieved by you from a heavy and long-standing one. Several cities that had become
          dilapidated and almost deserted—of which one was the most famous state in <placeName
            key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName>, the other in <placeName key="tgn,7002358"
            >Caria</placeName>, Samus and Halicarnassus—have been given a new life by you: there is
          no party fighting, no civil strife in the towns: you take care that the government of the
          states is administered by the best class of citizens: brigandage is abolished in
            <placeName key="tgn,7016748">Mysia</placeName>; murder suppressed in many districts;
          peace is established throughout the province; and not only the robberies usual on highways
          and in country places, but those more numerous and more serious ones in towns and temples,
          have been completely stopped: the fame, fortunes, and repose of the rich have been
          relieved of that most oppressive instrument of praetorial rapacity-vexatious prosecution;
          the expenses and tribute of the states are made to fall with equal weight on all who live
          in the territories of those states: access to you is as easy as possible: your ears are
          open to the complaints of all: no man's want of means or want of friends excludes him, I
          don't say from access to you in public and on the tribunal, but -even from your house and
          chamber: in a word, throughout your government there is no harshness or cruelty-everywhere
          clemency, mildness, and kindness reign supreme. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/></p>
        <p>What an immense benefit, again, have you done in having liberated <placeName
            key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> from the tribute exacted by the aediles, a measure
          which cost me some violent controversies! For <pb n="80"/> if one of our nobles complains
          openly that by your edict, "No moneys shall be voted for the games," you have robbed him
          of 200 sestertia, what a vast sum of money would have been paid, had a grant been made to
          the Credit of every magistrate who held games, as had become the regular custom! However,
          I stopped these Complaints by taking up this position—what they think of it in <placeName
            key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> I don't know, in <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
            >Rome</placeName> it meets with no little approval and praise—I refused to accept a sum
          of money which the states had decreed for a temple and monument in our honour, though they
          had done so with the greatest enthusiasm in view both of my services and of your most
          valuable benefactions; and though the law contained a special and distinct exception in
          these words, "that it was lawful to receive for temple or monument"; and though again the
          money was not going to be thrown away, but would be employed on decorating a temple, and
          would thus appear to have been given to the Roman people and gift in its favour, I
          determined that I must not accept it, for the immortal Gods rather than to myself—yet, in
          spite of its having desert, law, and the wishes of those who offered the this reason among
          others, namely, to prevent those, to whom such an honour was neither due nor legal, from
          being jealous. Wherefore adhere with all your heart and soul to the policy which you have
          hitherto adopted—that of being devoted to those whom the senate and people of <placeName
            key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> have committed and entrusted to your honour and
          authority, of doing your best to protect them, and of desiring their greatest happiness.
          Even if the lot had made you governor of Africans, or Spaniards, or Gauls—uncivilized and
          barbarous nations—it would still have been your duty as a man of feeling to consult for
          their interests and advantage, and to have contributed to their safety. But when we rule
          over a race of men in which civilization not only exists, but from which it is believed to
          have spread to others, we are bound to repay them, above all things, what we received from
          them. For I shall not be ashamed to go so far—especially as my life and achievements have
          been such as to exclude any suspicion of sloth or frivolity—as to confess that, whatever I
          have accomplished, I have accomplished by means of those studies and principles which have
          been transmitted to us in Greek literature and schools of thought. Wherefore, over and
          above the <pb n="81"/> general good faith which is due to all men, I think we are in a
          special sense under an obligation to that nation, to put in practice what it has taught us
          among the very men by whose maxims we have been brought out of barbarism. <milestone

        <p>And indeed Plato, the fountain-head of genius and learning, thought that states would
          only be happy when scholars and philosophers began being their rulers, or when those who
          were their rulers had devoted all their attention to learning and philosophy. It was
          plainly this union of power and philosophy that in his opinion might prove the salvation
          of states. And this perhaps has at length fallen to the fortune of the whole empire:
          certainly it has in the present instance to your province, to have a man in supreme power
          in it, who has from boyhood spent the chief part of his zeal and time in imbibing the
          principles of philosophy, virtue, and humanity. Wherefore be careful that this third year,
          which has been added to your labour, may be thought a prolongation of prosperity to
            <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>. And since <placeName key="tgn,1000004"
            >Asia</placeName> was more fortunate in retaining you than I was in my endeavour to
          bring you back, see that my regret is softened by the exultation of the province. For if
          you have displayed the very greatest activity in earning honours such as, I think, have
          never been paid to anyone else, much greater ought your activity to be in preserving these
          honours. What I for my part think of honours of that kind I have told you in previous
          letters. I have always regarded them, if given indiscriminately, as of little value, if
          paid from interested motives, as worthless: if, however, as in this case, they are
          tributes to solid services on your part, I hold you bound to take much pains in preserving
          them. Since, then, you are exercising supreme power and official authority in cities, in
          which you have before your eyes the consecration and apotheosis of your virtues, in all
          decisions, decrees, and official acts consider what you owe to those warm opinions
          entertained of you, to those verdicts on your character, to those honours which have been
          rendered you. And what you owe will be to consult for the interests of all, to remedy
          men's misfortunes, to provide for their safety, to resolve that you will be both called
          and believed to be the "father of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>."
            <milestone unit="section" n="11"/></p>
        <p>However, to such a resolution and deliberate policy on your part the great obstacle are
          the <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign>: for, if <pb n="82"/> we oppose them, we
          shall alienate from ourselves and from the Republic an order which has done us most
          excellent service, and which has been brought into sympathy with the Republic by our
          means; if, on the other hand, we comply with them in every case, we shall allow the
          complete ruin of those whose interests, to say nothing of their preservation, we are bound
          to consult. This is the one difficulty, if we look the thing fairly in the face, in your
          whole government. For disinterested conduct on one's own part, the suppression of all
          inordinate desires, the keeping a check upon one's staff, courtesy in hearing causes, in
          listening to and admitting suitor—all this is rather a question of credit than of
          difficulty: for it does not depend on any special exertion, but rather on a mental resolve
          and inclination. But how much bitterness of feeling is caused to allies by that question
          of the <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign> we have had reason to know in the case
          of citizens who, when recently urging the removal of the port-dues in <placeName
            key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, did not complain so much of the dues themselves, as
          of certain extortionate conduct on the part of the collectors. Wherefore, after hearing
          the grievances of citizens in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, I can
          comprehend what happens to allies in distant lands. To conduct oneself in this matter in
          such a way as to satisfy the <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign> especially when
          contracts have been undertaken at a loss, and yet to preserve the allies from ruin, seems
          to demand a virtue with something divine in it, I mean a virtue like yours. To begin with,
          that they are subject to tax at all, which is their greatest grievance, ought not to be
          thought so by the Greeks, because they were so subject by their own laws without the Roman
          government. Again, they cannot despise the word <foreign xml:lang="la"
            >publicanus</foreign>, for they have been unable to pay the assessment according to
          Sulla's poll-tax without the aid of the publican. But that Greek <foreign xml:lang="la"
            >publicani</foreign> are not more considerate in exacting the payment of taxes than our
          own may be gathered from the fact that the Caunii, and all the islands assigned to the
          Rhodians by Sulla, recently appealed to the protection of the senate, and petitioned to be
          allowed to pay their tax to us rather than to the Rhodians. Wherefore neither ought those
          to revolt at the name of a <foreign xml:lang="la">publicanus</foreign> who have always
          been subject to tax, nor those to despise it who have been unable to make up the tribute
          by themselves, <pb n="83"/> nor those to refuse his services who have asked for them. At
          the same time let <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> reflect on this, that if
          she were not under our government, there is no calamity of foreign war or internal strife
          from which she would be free. And since that government cannot possibly be maintained
          without taxes, she should be content to purchase perpetual peace and tranquillity at the
          price of a certain proportion of her products. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/></p>
        <p>But if they will fairly reconcile themselves to the existence and name of publican, all
          the rest may be made to appear to them in a less offensive light by your skill and
          prudence. They may, in making their bargains with the <foreign xml:lang="la"
            >publicani</foreign>, not have regard so much to the exact conditions laid down by the
          censors as to the convenience of settling the business and freeing themselves from farther
          trouble. You also may do, what you have done splendidly and are still doing, namely, dwell
          on the high position of the <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign>, and on your
          obligations to that order, in such a way as—putting out of the question all considerations
          of your <foreign xml:lang="la">imperium</foreign> and the power of your official authority
          and dignity—to reconcile the Greeks with the <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign>;
          and to beg of those, whom you have served eminently well, and who owe you everything, to
          suffer you by their compliance to maintain and preserve the bonds which unite us with the
            <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign>. But why do I address these exhortations to
          you, who are not only capable of carrying them out of your own accord without anyone's
          instruction, but have already to a great extent thoroughly done so? For the most
          respectable and important companies do not cease offering me thanks daily, and this is all
          the more gratifying to me because the Greeks do the same. Now it is an achievement of
          great difficulty to unite in feeling things which are opposite in interests, aims, and, I
          had almost said, in their very nature. But I have not written all this to instruct you—for
          your wisdom requires no man's instruction—but it has been a pleasure to me while writing
          to set down your virtues, though I have run to greater length in this letter than I could
          have wished, or than I thought I should. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/></p>
        <p>There is one thing on which I shall not cease from giving you advice, nor will I, as far
          as in me lies, allow your praise to be spoken of with a reservation. For all who <pb
            n="84"/> come from your province do make one reservation in the extremely high praise
          which they bestow on your virtue, integrity, and kindness—it is that of sharpness of
          temper. That is a fault which, even in our private and everyday life, seems to indicate
          want of solidity and strength of mind; but nothing, surely, can be more improper than to
          combine harshness of temper with the exercise of supreme power. Wherefore I will not
          undertake to lay before you now what the greatest philosophers say about anger, for I
          should not wish to be tedious, and you can easily ascertain it yourself from the writings
          of many of them: but I don't think I ought to pass over what is the essence of a letter,
          namely, that the recipient should be informed of what he does not know. Well, what nearly
          everybody reports to me is this: they usually say that, as long as you are not out of
          temper, nothing can be pleasanter than you are, but that when some instance of dishonesty
          or wrong-headedness has stirred you, your temper rises to such a height that no one Can
          discover any trace of your usual kindness. Wherefore, since no mere desire for glory, but
          circumstances and fortune have brought us upon a path of life which makes it inevitable
          that men will always talk about us, let us be on our guard, to the utmost of our means and
          ability, that no glaring fault may be alleged to have existed in us. And I am not now
          urging, what is perhaps difficult in human nature generally, and at our time of life
          especially, that you should change your disposition and suddenly pluck out a deeply-rooted
          habit, but I give you this hint: if you cannot completely avoid this failing, because your
          mind is surprised by anger before cool calculation has been able to prevent it,
          deliberately prepare yourself beforehand, and daily reflect on the duty of resisting
          anger, and that, when it moves your heart most violently, it is just the time for being
          most careful to restrain your tongue. And that sometimes seems to me to be a. greater
          virtue than not being angry at all. For the latter is not always a mark of superiority to
          weakness, it is sometimes the result of dullness; but to govern temper and speech, however
          angry you may be, or even to hold your tongue and keep your indignant feelings and
          resentment under control, although it may not be a proof of perfect wisdom, yet requires
          no ordinary force of character. And, <pb n="85"/> indeed, in this respect they tell me
          that you are now much more gentle and less irritable. No violent outbursts of indignation
          on your part, no abusive words, no insulting language are reported to me: which, while
          quite alien to culture and refinement, are specially unsuited to high power and place. For
          if your anger is implacable, it amounts to extreme harshness; if easily appeased, to
          extreme weakness. The latter, however, as a choice of evils, is, after all, preferable to
          harshness. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/></p>
        <p>But since your first year gave rise to most talk in regard to this particular complaint—I
          believe because the wrong-doing, the covetousness, and the arrogance of men came upon you
          as a surprise, and seemed to you unbearable-while your second year was much milder,
          because habit and refection, and, as I think, my letters also, rendered you more tolerant
          and gentle, the third ought to be so completely reformed, as not to give even the smallest
          ground for anyone to find fault. And here I go on to urge upon you, not by way of
          exhortation or admonition, but by brotherly entreaties, that you would set your whole
          heart, care, and thought on the gaining of praise from everybody and from every quarter.
          If, indeed, our achievements were only the subject of a moderate amount of talk and
          commendation, nothing eminent, nothing beyond the practice of others, would have been
          demanded of you. As it is, however, owing to the brilliancy and magnitude of the affairs
          in which we have been engaged, if we do not obtain the very highest reputation from your
          province, it seems scarcely possible for us to avoid the most violent abuse. Our position
          is such that all loyalists support us, but demand also and expect from us every kind of
          activity and virtue, while all the disloyal, seeing that we have entered upon a lasting
          war with them, appear contented with the very smallest excuse for attacking us. Wherefore,
          since fortune has allotted to you such a theatre as <placeName key="tgn,1000004"
            >Asia</placeName>, completely packed with an audience, of immense size, of the most
          refined judgment, and, moreover, naturally so capable of conveying sound, that its
          expressions of opinion and its remarks reach <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
            >Rome</placeName>, put out all your power, I beseech you, exert all your energies to
          appear not only to have been worthy of the part we played here, but to have surpassed
          everything done there by your high qualities. <pb n="86"/>
          <milestone unit="section" n="15"/></p>
        <p>And since chance has assigned to me among the magistracies the Conduct of public business
          in the city, to you that in a province, if my share is inferior to no one's, take care
          that yours surpasses others. At the same time think of this: we are not now working for a
          future and prospective glory, but are fighting in defence of what has been already gained;
          which indeed it was not so much an object to gain as it is now our duty to defend. And if
          anything in me could be apart from you, I should desire nothing more than the position
          which I have already gained. The actual fact, however, is that unless all your acts and
          deeds in your province correspond to my achievements, I shall think that I have gained
          nothing by those great labours and dangers, in all of which you have shared. But if it was
          you who, above all others, assisted me to gain a most splendid reputation, you will
          certainly also labour more than others to enable me to retain it. You must not be guided
          by the opinions and judgments of the present generation only, but of those to come also:
          and yet the latter will be a more candid judgment, for it will not be influenced by
          detraction and malice. Finally, you should think of this—that you are not seeking glory
          for yourself alone (and even if that were the case, you still ought not to be careless of
          it, especially as you had determined to consecrate the memory of your name by the most
          splendid monuments), but you have to share it with me, and to hand it down to our
          children. In regard to which you must be on your guard lest by any excess of carelessness
          you should seem not only to have neglected your own interests, but to have begrudged those
          of your family also. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/></p>
        <p>And these observations are not made with the idea of any speech of mine appearing to have
          roused you from your sleep, but to have rather "added speed to the runner. For you will
          continue to compel all in the future, as you have compelled them in the past, to praise
          your equity, self-control, strictness, and honesty. But from my extreme affection I am
          possessed with a certain insatiable greed for glory for you. However, I am convinced that,
          as <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> should now be as well-known to you as
          each man's own house is to himself, and since to your supreme good sense such great
          experience has now been added, there is nothing that affects reputation which you do not
          know as well as possible yourself, and <pb n="87"/> which does not daily occur to your
          mind without anybody's exhortation. But I, who when I read your writing seem to hear your
          voice, and when I write to you seem to be talking to you, am therefore always best pleased
          with your longest letter, and in writing am often somewhat prolix myself. My last prayer
          and advice to you is that, as good poets and painstaking actors always do, so you should
          be most attentive in the last scenes and conclusion of your function and business, so that
          this third year of your government, like a third act in a play, may appear to have been
          the most elaborated and most highly finished. You will do that with more ease if you will
          think that I, whom you always wished to please more than all the world besides, am always
          at your side, and am taking part in everything you say and do. It remains only to beg you
          to take the greatest care of your health, if you wish me and all your friends to be well
          also. Farewell. </p>

        <p> Statius arrived at my house on the 25th October. His arrival gave me uneasiness, because
          you said in your letter that you would be plundered by your household in his absence.
          However, I thought it a very happy circumstance that he anticipated the expectation of his
          arrival, and the company that would have assembled to meet him, if he had <pb n="126"/>
          left the province with you, and had not appeared before. For people have exhausted their
          remarks, and many observations have been made and done with of the "Nay, but I looked for
          a mighty man" <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)ll' ai)ei]\ tina fw=ta me/gan kai\ kalo\n e)de/gmhn</foreign>
            "but I ever expected some big and handsome man" (<bibl n="Hom. Od. 9.513">Hom. Od.
              9.513</bibl>). Statius had been manumitted by Quintus Cicero, and there had been much
            talk about it, as we have already heard. See XLIV, p. 109, and XLV, </note> kind, which
          I am glad to have all over before you come. But as for the motive for your sending
          him—that he might clear himself with me—that was not at all necessary. For, to begin with,
          I had never suspected him, nor in what I wrote to you about him was I expressing my own
          judgment; but since the interest and safety of all of us who take part in public business
          depends, not on truth alone, but on report also, I wrote you word of what people were
          saying, not what I thought myself. How prevalent and how formidable that talk was Statius
          ascertained himself on his arrival. For he was present when certain persons at my house
          gave vent to some complaints on that very subject, and had the opportunity of perceiving
          that the observations of the malevolent were being directed at himself especially. But it
          used to annoy me most when I was told that he had greater influence with you, than your
          sober time of life and the wisdom of a governor required. How many people, do you suppose,
          have solicited me to give them a letter of introduction to Statius? How often, do you
          suppose, has he himself, while talking without reserve to me, made such observations as,
          "I never approved of that," "I told him so," "I tried to persuade him," "I warned him not
          to"? And even if these things show the highest fidelity, as I believe they do, since that
          is your judgment, yet the mere appearance of a freedman or slave enjoying such influence
          cannot but lower your dignity: and the long and short of it is—for I am in duty bound not
          to say anything without good grounds, nor to keep back anything from motives of
          policy—that Statius has supplied all the material for the gossip of those who wished to
          decry you; that formerly all that could be made out was that certain persons were. angry
          at your strictness; but that after his manumission the angry had something to talk about.
            <pb n="127"/>
          <milestone unit="para"/>Now I will answer the letters delivered to me by L. Caesius, whom,
          as I see you wish it, I will serve in every way I can. One of them is about Zeuxis of
          Blaundus, whom you say was warmly recommended to you by me though a most notorious
          matricide. In this matter, and on this subject generally, please listen to a short
          statement, lest you should by chance be surprised at my having become so conciliatory
          towards Greeks. Seeing, as I did, that the complaints of Greeks, because they have a
          genius for deceit, were allowed an excessive weight, whenever I was told of any of them
          making complaint of you, I appeased them by every means in my power. First, I pacified the
          Dionysopolitans, who were very bitter: whose chief man, Hermippus, I secured not only by
          my conversation, but by treating him as a friend. I did the same to Hephaestus of
            <placeName key="tgn,7017535">Apameia</placeName>; the same to that most untrustworthy
          fellow, Megaristus of Antandrus; the same to Nicias of <placeName key="perseus,Smyrna"
            >Smyrna</placeName>; I also embraced with all the courtesy I possessed the most trumpery
          of men, even Nymphon of <placeName key="perseus,Colophon">Colophon</placeName>. And all
          this I did from no liking for these particular people, or the nation as a whole: I was
          heartily sick of their fickleness and obsequiousness, of feelings that are not affected by
          our kindness, but by our position. <milestone unit="para"/>But to return to Zeuxis. When
          he was telling me the same story as you mention in your letter about what M. Cascellius
          had said to him in conversation, I stopped him from farther talk, and admitted him to my
          society. I cannot, however, understand your virulence when you say that, having sewn up in
          the parricide's-sack two Mysians at <placeName key="perseus,Smyrna">Smyrna</placeName>,
          you desired to display a similar example of your severity in the upper part of your
          province, and that, therefore, you had wished to inveigle Zeuxis into your hands by every
          possible means. For if he had been brought into court, he ought perhaps not to have been
          allowed to escape: but there was no necessity for his being hunted out and inveigled by
          soft words to stand a trial, as you say in your letter—especially as he is one whom I
          learn daily, both from his fellow citizens and from many others, to be a man of higher
          character than you would expect from such an obscure town as his. <note n="1"
            anchored="true">Reading <foreign xml:lang="la">quam pro civitate sua</foreign> for

            would hardly do so here, where he is making a grave excuse. </note> But, you will say,
          it is only Greeks <pb n="128"/> to whom I am indulgent. What! did not I do everything to
          appease L. Caecilius? What a man! how irritable! how violent! In fact, who is there except
          Tuscenius, <note n="1" anchored="true">Whom he called (Letter XXIX) "a madman and a
            knave." </note> whose case admitted of no cure, have I not softened? See again, I have
          now on my hands a shifty, mean fellow, though of equestrian rank, called Catienus: even he
          is going to be smoothed down. I don't blame you for having been somewhat harsh to his
          father, for I am quite sure you have acted with good reason: but what need was there of a
          letter of the sort which you sent to the man himself? "That the man was rearing the cross
          for himself from which you had already pulled him off once; that you would take care to
          have him smoked to death, and would be applauded by the whole province for it." Again, to
          a man named C. Fabius—for that letter also T. Catienus is handing round—"that you were
          told that the kidnapper Licinius, with his young kite of a son, was collecting taxes." And
          then you go on to ask Fabius to burn both father and son alive if he can; if not, to send
          them to you, that they may be burnt to death by legal sentence. That letter sent by you in
          jest to C. Fabius, if it really is from you, exhibits to ordinary readers a violence of
          language very injurious to you. <milestone unit="para"/>Now, if you will refer to the
          exhortations in all my letters, you will perceive that I have never found fault with you
          for anything except harshness and sharpness of temper, and occasionally, though rarely,
          for want of caution in the letters you write. In which particulars, indeed, if my
          influence had had greater weight with you than a somewhat excessive quickness of
          disposition, or a certain enjoyment in indulging temper, or a faculty for epigram and a
          sense of humour, we should certainly have had no cause for dissatisfaction. And don't you
          suppose that I feel no common vexation when I am told how Vergilius is esteemed, and your
          neighbour <pb n="129"/> C. Octavius? <note n="1" anchored="true">C. Vergilius Balbus,

          </note> I For if you only excel your neighbours farther up country, in Cilicia and
            <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, that is a pretty thing to boast of! And
          that is just the sting of the matter, that though the men I have named are not more
          blameless than yourself, they yet outdo you in the art of winning favour, though they know
          nothing of Xenophon's Cyrus or Agesilaus; from which kings, in the exercise of their great
          office, no one ever heard an irritable word. But in giving you this advice, as I have from
          the first, I am well aware how much good I have done. <note n="2" anchored="true">I have
            endeavoured to leave the English as ambiguous as the Latin. Cicero may mean that he has
            done some good, for at the end of Letter XXIX he says that Quintus has improved in these
            points, and had been better in his second than in his first year. On the other hand, the
            context here seems rather to point to the meaning "how little good I have
            done"—impatiently dismissing the subject of temper. </note>
          <milestone unit="para"/>Now, however, as you are about to quit your province, pray do
          leave behind you—as I think you are now doing—as pleasant a memory as possible. You have a
          successor of very mild manners; in other respects, on his arrival, you will be much
          missed. In sending letters of requisition, as I have often told you, you have allowed
          yourself to be too easily persuaded. Destroy, if you can, all such as are inequitable, or
          contrary to usage, or contradictory to others. Statius told me that they were usually put
          before you ready written, read by himself, and that, if they were inequitable, he informed
          you of the fact: but that before he entered your service there had been no sifting of
          letters; that the result was that there were volumes containing a selection of letters,
          which were usually adversely criticised. <note n="3" anchored="true">These "requisitionary
            letters" were granted by a provincial governor to certain persons requiring supplies,
            payment of debts, or legal decisions in their favour in the provinces, or other
            privileges, and, if carelessly granted, were open to much abuse. Cicero, in his own
            government of <foreign xml:lang="la">Cilicia</foreign>, boasted that he had signed none
            such in six months. The ill-wishers of Quintus had apparently got hold of a number of
            these letters signed by him (having been first written out by the suitors themselves and
            scarcely glanced at by him), and a selection of them published to prove his injustice or
            carelessness. </note> On this subject I am not going to give you any advice at this time
          of day, for <pb n="130"/> it is too late; and you cannot but be aware that I have often
          warned you in various ways and with precision. But I have, on a hint from Theopompus,
          entrusted him with this message to you: do see by means of persons attached to you, which
          you will find no difficulty in doing, that the following classes of letters are
          destroyed—first, those that are inequitable; next, those that are contradictory; then
          those expressed in an eccentric or unusual manner; and lastly, those that contain
          reflections on anyone. I don't believe all I hear about these matters, and if, in the
          multiplicity of your engagements, you have let certain things escape you, now is the time
          to look into them and weed them out. I have read a letter said to have been written by
          your nomenclator Sulla himself, which I cannot approve: I have read some written in an
          angry spirit. But the subject of letters comes in pat: for while this sheet of paper was
          actually in my hands, L. Flavius, praetor-designate and a very intimate friend, came to
          see me. He told me that you had sent a letter to his agents, which seemed to me most
          inequitable, prohibiting them from taking anything from the estate of the late L. Octavius
          Naso, whose heir L. Flavius is, until they had paid a sum of money to C. Fundanius; and
          that you had sent a similar letter to the Apollonidenses, not to allow any payment on
          account of the estate of the late Octavius till the debt to Fundanius had been discharged.
          It seems to me hardly likely that you have done this; for it is quite unlike your usual
          good sense. The heir not to take anything? What if he disowns the debt? What if he doesn't
          owe it at all? Moreover, is the praetor wont to decide whether a debt is due ? <note n="1"
            anchored="true">The governor of a province would stand in such a matter in the place of
            the praetor in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, i.e., he would decide on
            questions of law, not of fact, as, whether a debt was due or not. However, Quintus
            perhaps only erred in the form of his injunction. He might forbid the deceased's estate
            being touched till the question of Fundanius's debt was decided; but in his letter he
            assumed (as he had no right to do) that the claim was good. Substantially it seems to me
            that Quintus was right, and certainly in his appeal to him Cicero does not follow his
            own injunction to disregard personal feelings. </note> Don't I, again, wish well to
          Fundanius? Am I not his friend? Am I not touched with compassion? No one more so: but in
          certain matters the course of law is so clear as to leave no place for personal feeling.
          And Flavius told me that expressions were used in the letter, <pb n="131"/> which he said
          was yours, to the effect that you would "either thank them as friends, or make yourself
          disagreeable to them as enemies." In short, he was much annoyed, complained of it to me in
          strong terms, and begged me to write to you as seriously as I could. This I am doing, and
          I do strongly urge you again and again to withdraw your injunction to Flavius's agents
          about taking money from the estate, and not to lay any farther injunction on the
          Apollonidenses contrary to the rights of Flavius. Pray do everything you can for the sake
          of Flavius and, indeed, of Pompey also. I would not, upon my honour, have you think me
          liberal to him at the expense of any inequitable decision on your part: but I do entreat
          you to leave behind you some authority, and some memorandum of a decree or of a letter
          under your hand, so framed as to support the interests and cause of Flavius. For the man,
          who is at once very attentive to me, and tenacious of his own rights and dignity, is
          feeling extremely hurt that he has not prevailed with you either on the grounds of
          personal friendship or of legal right; and, to the best of my belief, both Pompey and
          Caesar have, at one time or another, commended the interests of Flavius to you, and
          Flavius has written to you personally, and certainly I have. Wherefore, if there is
          anything which you think you ought to do at my request, let it be this. If you love me,
          take every care, take every trouble, and insure Flavius's cordial thanks both to yourself
          and myself. I cannot use greater earnestness in making any request than I use in this.
            <milestone unit="para"/>As to what you say about Hermias, it has been in truth a cause
          of much vexation to me. I wrote you a letter in a rather unbrotherly spirit, which I
          dashed off in a fit of anger and now wish to recall, having been irritated by what
          Lucullus's freedman told me, immediately after hearing of the bargain. For this letter,
          which was not expressed in a brotherly way, you ought to have brotherly feeling enough to
          make allowance. As to Censorinus, Antonius, the Cassii, Scaevola—I am delighted to hear
          from you that you possess their friendship. The other contents of that same letter of
          yours were expressed more strongly than I could have wished, such as your "with my ship at
          least well trimmed" <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">o)rqa\n ta\n nau=n</foreign>. Quintus had written, it seems,
            defiantly about the slanders afloat against him, and had quoted two Greek proverbial
            sayings. The first is found in Stobaeus, 108 (extract from <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Teles</foreign>): "It was a fine saying of the pilot, 'At least, Poseidon, a ship
            well trimmed,'" i.e., if you sink my ship, she shall at least go down with honour.
            Quintus means, "whatever my enemies may do afterwards, I will keep my province in a
            sound state as long as I am here." </note> and your "die <pb n="132"/> once for all."

            </quote> But I don't feel sure that this is the passage alluded to. </note> You will
          find those expressions to be unnecessarily strong. My scoldings have always been very full
          of affection. They mention certain things for complaint, <note n="2" anchored="true"
            >Reading <foreign xml:lang="la">queruntur</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="la">quae
              sunt</foreign>. </note> but these are not important, or rather, are quite
          insignificant. For my part, I should never have thought you deserving of the least blame
          in any respect, considering the extreme purity of your conduct, had it not been that our
          enemies are numerous. Whatever I have written to you in a tone of remonstrance or reproach
          I have written from a vigilant caution, which I maintain, and shall maintain; and I shall
          not cease imploring you to do the same. Attalus of Hypaepa has begged me to intercede with
          you that you should not prevent his getting the money paid which has been decreed for a
          statue of Q. Publicius. In which matter I both ask as a favour and urge as a duty, that
          you should not consent to allow the honour of a man of his character, and so close a
          friend of mine, to be lowered or hindered by your means. Furthermore, Licinius, who is
          known to you, a slave of my friend Aesopus, has run away. He has been at <placeName
            key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, living in the house of Patron the Epicurean as
          a free man. Thence he has made his way to <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>.
          Afterwards a certain Plato of Sardis, who is often at <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
            >Athens</placeName>, and happened to be at <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
            >Athens</placeName> at the time that Licinius arrived there, having subsequently learnt
          by a letter from Aesopus that he was an escaped slave, arrested the fellow, and put him
          into confinement at <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>; but whether into the
          public prison, or into a slave mill, we could not clearly make out from his letter. But
          since he is at <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>, I should be obliged if
          you would trace him in any manner open to you, and with all care <pb n="133"/> either
          [send him] or bring him home with you. Don't take into consideration the fellow's value:
          such a good-for-nothing is worth very little; but Aesopus is so much vexed at his slave's
          bad conduct and audacity, that you can do him no greater favour than by being the means of
          his recovering him. <milestone unit="para"/>Now for the news that you chiefly desire. We
          have so completely lost the constitution that Cato, <note n="1" anchored="true">Gaius
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Cato</foreign>, tribune <date when="-0056">B.C. 56</date>.
          </note> a young man of no sense, but yet a Roman citizen and a Cato, scarcely got off with
          his life because, having determined to prosecute Gabinius for bribery, when the praetors
          could not be approached for several days, and refused to admit anyone to their presence,
          he mounted the rostra in public meeting and called Pompey an "unofficial dictator." No one
          ever had a narrower escape of being killed. From this you may see the state of the whole
          Republic. People, however, show no inclination to desert my cause. They make wonderful
          professions, offers of service, and promises: and, indeed, I have the highest hopes and
          even greater spirit—so that I hope to get the better in the struggle, and feel confident
          in my mind that, in the present state of the Republic, I need not fear even an accident.
          However, the matter stands thus: if Clodius gives notice of an action against me, the
          whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> will rush to my support, so that I
          shall come off with many times greater glory than before; but if he attempts the use of
          violence, I hope, by the zeal not only of friends but also of opponents, to be able to
          meet force with force. All promise me the aid of themselves, their friends, clients,
          freedmen, slaves, and, finally, of their money. Our old regiment of loyalists is warm in
          its zeal and attachment to me. If there were any who had formerly been comparatively
          hostile or lukewarm, they are now uniting themselves with the loyalists from hatred to
          these despots. Pompey makes every sort of promise, and so does Caesar: but my confidence
          in them is not enough to induce me to drop any of my preparations. The tribunes-designate
          are friendly to us. The consuls-designate make excellent professions. Some of the new
          praetors are very friendly and very brave citizens-Domitius, Nigidius, Memmius, <pb

          For the rest, though I have no doubt that as you acted before for my sake, so now, for the
          sake of your own consistency, you will abide by your liberal intentions, yet I reiterate
          my request to you with all earnestness, that what you first gave us reason to hope, and
          then actually carried out, you would be so good as to see extended and brought to a final
          completion by your means. I assure you, and I pledge my credit to it, that such a course
          will be exceedingly gratifying to both Lucceius and Pompey, and that you will be making a
          most excellent investment with them. About politics, and about the business going on here,
          and what we are all thinking about, I wrote to you in full detail a few days ago, and
          delivered the letter to your servants. Farewell. </p>

        <p> Yes, I do write to you less often than I might, because, though I am always wretched,
          yet when I write to you or read a letter from you, I am in such floods of tears that I
          cannot endure it. Oh, that I had clung less to life! I should <pb n="141"/> at least never
          have known real sorrow, or not much of it, in my life. Yet if fortune has reserved for me
          any hope of recovering at any time any position again, I was not utterly wrong to do so:
          if these miseries are to be permanent, I only wish, my dear, to see you as soon as
          possible and to die in your arms, since neither gods, whom you have worshipped with such
          pure devotion, nor men, whom I have ever served, have made us any return. I have been
          thirteen days at <placeName key="tgn,7004094">Brundisium</placeName> in the house of M.
          Laenius Flaccus, a very excellent man, who has despised the risk to his fortunes and civil
          existence in comparison to keeping me safe, nor has been induced by the penalty of a most
          iniquitous law to refuse me the rights and good offices of hospitality and friendship. May
          I some time have the opportunity of repaying him! Feel gratitude I always shall. I set out
          from <placeName key="tgn,7004094">Brundisium</placeName> on the 29th of April, <note n="1"
            anchored="true">Reading <foreign xml:lang="la">prid. Kal.</foreign> instead of <foreign
              xml:lang="la">a. d. II. Kal.</foreign>, which Tyrrell calls <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >audacius</foreign> in Schütz. But absolute nonsense is not to be kept even for a MS.
              <list type="simple">
              <item>(1) Cicero says that he has been thirteen days at <foreign xml:lang="la"
                  >Brundisium</foreign>. In the next letter he tells <foreign xml:lang="la"
                  >Atticus</foreign> he arrived on the 17th. That, in the Roman way of counting,
                brings it to <foreign xml:lang="la">prid.</foreign> (29th).</item>
              <item>(2) Either the date at the end of the letter is wrong, or <foreign xml:lang="la"
                  >prid.</foreign> must be used here</item>
              <item>(3) There is no such date properly as <foreign xml:lang="la">a. d. II.
                  Pal.</foreign> The day before <foreign xml:lang="la">prid.</foreign> is <foreign
                  xml:lang="la">a. d. III.</foreign></item>
            </list> In regard to dates we must remember that Cicero is using the pre-Julian
            calendar, in which all months, except February, March, May, July, and October, had
            twenty-nine days. These last four had thirty-one and February twenty-eight. </note> and
          intend going through <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> to <placeName
            key="perseus,Cyzicus">Cyzicus</placeName>. What a fall! What a disaster! What can I say?
          Should I ask you to come—a woman of weak health and broken spirit? Should I refrain from
          asking you? Am I to be without you, then? I think the best course is this : if there is
          any hope of my restoration, stay to promote it and push the thing on: but if, as I fear,
          it proves hopeless, pray come to me by any means in your power. Be sure of this, that if I
          have you I shall not think myself wholly lost. But what is to become of my darling Tullia?
          You must see to that now: I can think of nothing. But certainly, however things turn out,
          we must do everything to promote that poor little girl's married happiness and reputation.
          Again, what is my boy Cicero to <pb n="142"/> do? Let him, at any rate, be ever in my
          bosom and in my arms. <note n="1" anchored="true">Cicero does not mean that young Marcus
            is to come to him at once, but that, when Tullia's marriage portion is settled, <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Terentia</foreign> is to bring him with her if she comes. Really he
            didn't mean any of them to come, at any rate for a long while. <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Piso</foreign> is Tullia's husband. </note> I can't write more. A fit of weeping
          hinders me. I don't know how you have got on; whether you are left in possession of
          anything, or have been, as I fear, entirely plundered. Piso, as you say, I hope will
          always be our friend. As to the manumission of the slaves you need not be uneasy. To begin
          with, the promise made to yours was that you would treat them according as each severally
          deserved. So far Orpheus has behaved well, besides him no one very markedly so. With the
          rest of the slaves the arrangement is that, if my property is forfeited, they should
          become my freedmen, supposing them to be able to maintain at law that status. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">If Cicero's property was confiscated, it might be held that the slaves
            went with it, and would be sold with it, and that his manumission of them was an
            evasion, which could not hold good at law. If his property was not confiscated, they
            were to remain in their status as slaves. See Letter CXCII. </note> But if my property
          remained in my ownership, they were to continue slaves, with the exception of a very few.
          But these are trifles. To return to your advice, that I should keep up my courage and not
          give up hope of recovering my position, I only wish that there were any good grounds for
          entertaining such a hope. As it is, when, alas ! shall I get a letter from you? Who will
          bring it me? I would have waited for it at <placeName key="tgn,7004094"
            >Brundisium</placeName>, but the sailors would not allow it, being unwilling to lose a
          favourable wind. For the rest, put as dignified a face on the matter as you can, my dear
          Terentia. Our life is over: we have had our day: it is not any fault of ours that has
          ruined us, but our virtue. I have made no false step, except in not losing my life when I
          lost my honours. But since our children preferred my living, let us bear every-thing else,
          however intolerable. And yet I, who encourage you, cannot encourage myself. I have sent
          that faithful fellow Clodius Philhetaerus home, because he was hampered with weakness of
          the eyes. Sallustius seems likely to outdo everybody in his attentions. Pescennius is
          exceedingly kind to me; and I have hopes that he will always be attentive to you. Sica had
          said that he would accompany me; but he <pb n="143"/> has left <placeName
            key="tgn,7004094">Brundisium</placeName>. Take the greatest possible care of your
          health, and believe me that I am more affected by your distress than my own. My dear
          Terentia, most faithful and best of wives, and my darling little daughter, and that last
          hope of my race, Cicero, good-bye! <milestone unit="para"/>29 April, from <placeName

        </opener>
        <p> BROTHER! Brother! Brother! did you really fear that I had been induced by some angry
          feeling to send slaves to you without a letter? Or even that I did not wish to see you? I
          to be angry with you! Is it possible for me to be angry with you? Why, one would think
          that it was you that brought me low! Your enemies, your unpopularity, that miserably
          ruined me, and not I that unhappily ruined you! The fact is, the much-praised consulate of
          mine has deprived me of you, of children, country, fortune; from you I should hope it will
            <pb n="149"/> have taken nothing but myself. Certainly on your side I have experienced
          nothing but what was honourable and gratifying: on mine you have grief for my fall and
          fear for your own, regret, mourning, desertion. Not wish to see you? The truth is rather
          that I was unwilling to be seen by you. For you would not have seen your brother-not the
          brother you had left, not the brother you knew, not him to whom you had with mutual tears
          bidden farewell as he followed you on your departure for your province: not a trace even
          or faint image of him, but rather what I may call the likeness of a living corpse. And oh
          that you had sooner seen me or heard of me as a corpse! Oh that I could have left you to
          survive, not my life merely, but my undiminished rank! But I call all the gods to witness
          that the one argument which recalled me from death was, that all declared that to some
          extent your life depended upon mine. In which matter I made an error and acted Culpably.
          For if I had died, that death itself would have given clear evidence of my fidelity and
          love to you. As it is, I have allowed you to be deprived of my aid, though I am alive, and
          with me still living to need the help of others; and my voice, of all others, to fail when
          dangers threatened my family, which had so often been successfully used in the defence of
          the merest strangers. For as to the slaves coming to you without a letter, the real reason
          (for you see that it was not anger) was a deadness of my faculties, and a seemingly
          endless deluge of tears and sorrows. How many tears do you suppose these very words have
          Cost me? As many as I know they will cost you to read them! Can I ever refrain from
          thinking of you or ever think of you without tears? For when I miss you, is it only a
          brother that I miss? Rather it is a brother of almost my own age in the charm of his
          companionship, a son in his consideration for my wishes, a father in the wisdom of his
          advice! What pleasure did I ever have without you, or you without me? And what must my
          case be when at the same time I miss a daughter: How affectionate! how modest! how clever!
          The express image of my face, of my speech, of my very soul! Or again a son, the prettiest
          boy, the very joy of my heart? Cruel inhuman monster that I am, I dismissed him from my
          arms better schooled in the world than I could have wished: for the poor child began to
          understand <pb n="150"/> what was going on. So, too, your own son, your own image, whom my
          little Cicero loved as a brother, and was now beginning to respect as an elder brother!
          Need I mention also how I refused to allow my unhappy wife—the truest of helpmates—to
          accompany me, that there might be some one to protect the wrecks of the calamity which had
          fallen on us both, and guard our common children? Nevertheless, to the best of my ability,
          I did write a letter to you, and gave it to your freedman Philogonus, which, I believe,
          was delivered to you later on; and in this I repeated the advice and entreaty, which had
          been already transmitted to you as a message from me by my slaves, that you should go on
          with your journey and hasten to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. For, in
          the first place, I desired your protection, in case there were any of my enemies whose
          cruelty was not yet satisfied by my fall. In the next place, I dreaded the renewed
          lamentation which our meeting would cause : while I could not have borne your departure,
          and was afraid of the very thing you mention in your letter—that you would be unable to
          tear yourself away. For these reasons the supreme pain of not seeing you—and nothing more
          painful or more wretched could, I think, have happened to the most affectionate and united
          of brothers-was a less misery than would have been such a meeting followed by such a
          parting. Now, if you can, though I, whom you always regarded as a brave man, cannot do so,
          rouse yourself and collect your energies in view of any contest you may have to confront.
          I hope, if my hope has anything to go upon, that your own spotless character and the love
          of your fellow citizens, and even remorse for my treatment, may prove a certain protection
          to you. But if it turns out that you are free from personal danger, you will doubtless do
          whatever you think can be done for me. In that matter, indeed, many write to me at great
          length and declare that they have hopes; but I personally cannot see what hope there is,
          since my enemies have the greatest influence, while my friends have in some cases
          deserted, in others even betrayed me, fearing perhaps in my restoration a censure on their
          own treacherous conduct. But how matters stand with you I would have you ascertain and
          report to me. In any case I shall continue to live as long as you shall need me, in view
          of any danger you may <pb n="151"/> have to undergo: longer than that I cannot go on in
          this kind of life. For there is neither wisdom nor philosophy with sufficient strength to
          sustain such a weight of grief. I know that there has been a time for dying, more
          honourable and more advantageous; and this is not the only one of my many omissions,
          which, if I should choose to bewail, I should merely be increasing your sorrow and
          emphasizing my own stupidity. But one thing I am not bound to do, and it is in fact
          impossible-remain in a life so wretched and so dishonoured any longer than your
          necessities, or some well-grounded hope, shall demand. For I, who was lately supremely
          blessed in brother, children, wife, wealth, and in the very nature of that wealth, while
          in position, influence, reputation, and popularity, I was inferior to none, however
          distinguished—I cannot, I repeat, go on longer lamenting over myself and those dear to me
          in a life of such humiliation as this, and in a state of such utter ruin. Wherefore, what
          do you mean by writing to me about negotiating a bill of exchange? As though I were not
          now wholly dependent on your means! And that is just the very thing in which I see and
          feel, to my misery, of what a culpable act I have been guilty in squandering to no purpose
          the money which I received from the treasury in your name, <note n="1" anchored="true">See
            pp. 92, 107. </note> while you have to satisfy your creditors out of the very vitals of
          yourself and your son. However, the sum mentioned in your letter has been paid to M.
          Antonius, and the same amount to Caepio. For me the sum at present in my hands is
          sufficient for what I contemplate doing. For in either case-whether I am restored or given
          up in despair—I shall not want any more money. For yourself, if you are molested, I think
          you should apply to Crassus and Calidius. I don't know how far Hortensius is to be
          trusted. Myself, with the most elaborate pretence of affection and the closest daily
          intimacy, he treated with the most utter want of principle and the most consummate
          treachery, and Q. Arrius helped him in it: acting under whose advice, promises, and
          injunctions, I was left helpless to fall into this disaster. But this you will keep dark
          for fear they might injure you. Take care also—and it is on this account that I <pb
            n="152"/> think you should Cultivate Hortensius himself by means of Pomponius—that the
          epigram on the <foreign xml:lang="la">lex Aurelia</foreign>
          <note n="1" anchored="true">Quintus was a candidate in <date when="-0066">B.C. 66</date>
            for the aedileship of the following year. The <foreign xml:lang="la">lex
              Aurelia</foreign>, which divided the juries between the senators, <foreign
              xml:lang="la">equites</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="la">tribuni aerarii</foreign>,
            was passed in Pompey's first consulship, <date when="-0070">B.C. 70</date>. As this was
            the compromise in the matter of the <foreign xml:lang="la">iudicia</foreign> favoured by
            Pompey, Hortensius, and the like, an attack on it would be likely to give offence.
          </note> attributed to you when Candidate for the aedileship is not proved by false
          testimony to be yours. For there is nothing that I am so afraid of as that, when people
          understand how much pity for me your prayers and your acquittal will rouse, they may
          attack you with all the greater violence. Messalla I reckon as really attached to you :
          Pompey I regard as still pretending only. But may you never have to put these things to
          the test! And that prayer I would have offered to the gods had they not ceased to listen
          to prayers of mine. However, I do pray that they may be content with these endless
          miseries of ours; among which, after all, there is no discredit for any wrong thing
          done-sorrow is the beginning and end, sorrow that punishment is most severe when our
          conduct has been most unexceptionable. As to my daughter and yours and my young Cicero,
          why should I recommend them to you, my dear brother? Rather I grieve that their orphan
          state will cause you no less sorrow than it does me. Yet as long as you are uncondemned
          they will not be fatherless. The rest, by my hopes of restoration and the privilege of
          dying in my fatherland, my tears will not allow me to write! Terentia also I would ask you
          to protect, and to write me word on every subject. Be as brave as the nature of the case
          admits. <placeName key="tgn,7011182">Thessalonica</placeName>, 13 June. </p>

        <p> I beg you, my dear brother, if you and all my family have been ruined by my single
          misfortune, not to attribute it to dishonesty and bad conduct on my part, rather than to
          shortsightedness and the wretched state I was in. I have committed no fault except in
          trusting those whom I believed to be bound by the most sacred obligation not to deceive
          me, or whom I thought to be even interested in not doing so. All my most intimate, nearest
          and dearest friends were either alarmed for themselves or jealous of me: the result was
          that all I lacked was good faith on the part of my friends and caution on my own. <note

              xml:lang="la">fuit</foreign>. </note> But if your own blameless character and the
          compassion of the world prove sufficient to preserve you at this juncture from
          molestation, you can, of course, observe whether any hope of restoration is left for me.
          For Pomponius, Sestius, and my son-in-law Piso have caused me as yet to stay at <placeName
            key="tgn,7011182">Thessalonica</placeName>, forbidding me, on account of certain
          impending movements, to increase my distance. But in truth I am awaiting the result more
          on account of their letters than from any firm hope of my own. For what can I hope with an
          enemy possessed of the most formidable power, with my detractors masters of the state,
          with friends unfaithful, with numbers of people jealous? However, of the new tribunes
          there is one, it is true, most warmly attached to me—Sestius—and I hope Curius, Milo,
          Fadius, <pb n="159"/> Fabricius; but still there is Clodius in violent opposition, who
          even when out of office will be able to stir up the passions of the mob by the help of
          that same gang, and then there will be found some one also to veto the bill. Such a state
          of things was not put before me when I was leaving <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
            >Rome</placeName>, but I often used to be told that I was certain to return in three
          days with the greatest <foreign xml:lang="fr">>éclat</foreign>. "What made you go, then?"
          you will say. What, indeed! Many circumstances concurred to throw me off my balance—the
          defection of Pompey, the hostility of the consuls, and of the praetors also, the timidity
          of the <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign>, the armed bands. The tears of my
          friends prevented me seeking refuge in death, which would certainly have been the best
          thing for my honour, the best escape from unbearable sorrows. But I have written to you on
          this subject in the letter I gave to Phaetho. Now that you have been plunged into griefs
          and troubles, such as no one ever was before, if the compassion of the world can lighten
          our common misfortune, you will, it seems, score a success beyond belief! But if we are
          both utterly ruined—ah me-I shall have been the absolute destruction of my whole family,
          to whom I used to be at least no discredit! But pray, as I said in a previous letter to
          you, look into the business, test it thoroughly, and write to me with the candour which
          our situation demands, and not as your affection for me would dictate. I shall retain my
          life as long as I shall think that it is in your interest for me to do so, or that it
          ought to be preserved with a view to future hope. You will find Sestius most friendly to
          us, and I believe that Lentulus, the coming consul, will also be so for your sake.
          However, deeds are not so easy as words. You will see what is wanted and what the truth
          is. On the whole, supposing that no one takes advantage of your unprotected position and
          our common calamity, it is by your means, or not at all, that something may be effected.
          But even if your enemies have begun to annoy you, don't flinch: for you will be attacked
          by legal process, not by swords. However, I hope that this may not occur. I beg you to
          write me back word on all subjects, and to believe that though I have less spirit and
          resource than in old times, I have quite as much affection and loyalty. <pb n="160"/>

        <p> GREETINGS to Terentia, and Tulliola, and Cicero. Don't suppose that I write longer
          letters to anyone else, unless some one has written at unusual length to me, whom I think
          myself bound to answer. For I have nothing to write about, and there is nothing at such a
          time as this that I find it more difficult to do. Moreover, to you and my dear Tulliola I
          cannot write without many tears. For I see you reduced to the greatest misery—the very
          people whom I desired to be ever enjoying the most complete happiness, a happiness which
          it was my bounden duty to secure, and which I should have secured if I had not been such a
          coward. Our dear Piso I love exceedingly for his noble conduct. I have to the best of my
          ability encouraged him by letter to proceed, and thanked him, as I was bound to do. I
          gather that you entertain hopes in the new tribunes. We shall have reason to depend on
          that, if we may depend on Pompey's goodwill, but yet I am nervous about Crassus. I gather
          that you have behaved in every respect with the greatest courage and most loyal affection,
          nor am I surprised at it; but I grieve that the position should be such that my miseries
          are relieved by such heavy ones on your part. For a kind friend of ours, Publius Valerius,
          has told me in a letter which I could not read without violent weepmg, how you had been
          dragged from the temple of Vesta to the Valerian bank. <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Terentia</foreign>, whose half-sister was a Vestal, seems to have
            taken sanctuary with the Vestals, as did the mother and sister of Augustus in <date
              when="-0043">B.C. 43</date>. The special indignity of which Cicero complains is that
            she had been forced to leave the sanctuary and appear at the bank of Valerius, but for
            what purpose we cannot now tell. It is suggested that it was to make some solemn
            declaration as to her husband's property, some of which she may be supposed to have
            tried to conceal. The term <foreign xml:lang="la">ducta esses</foreign> is that applied
            to prisoners led through the streets, but we may regard it as used <foreign
              xml:lang="la">ad invidiam</foreign>. </note> To think of it, my dear, my love! <pb
            n="171"/> You from whom everybody used to look for help ! <note n="1" anchored="true">In
            securing her husband's advocacy. </note> That you, my Terentia, should now be thus
          harassed, thus prostrate in tears and humiliating distress ! And that this should be
          brought about by my fault, who have preserved the rest of the citizens only to perish
          myself! As to what you say about our town house, or rather its site, I shall not consider
          myself fully restored, until it has also been restored for me. <milestone unit="para"
          />However, these things are not yet within our grasp. I am only sorry that you,
          impoverished and plundered as you are, should be called upon to bear any part of the
          present expenses. Of course, if the business is successfully accomplished we shall get
          everything back: but if the same evil fortune keeps us down, will you be so foolish as to
          throw away even the poor remains of your fortune? <note n="2" anchored="true">Mention is
            made of Terentia's separate estate in Letters XXX and LXXXI. </note> I beseech you, my
          life, as far as expense goes, allow others to bear it, who are well able if they are only
          willing to do so; and do not, as you love me, try your delicate constitution. For I have
          you day and night before my eyes : I see you eagerly undertaking labours of every kind: I
          fear you cannot endure them. Yet I see that everything depends on you! Wherefore, to
          enable us to attain what you hope and are striving for, attend carefully to your health. J
          don't know to whom to write except to those who write to me, or to those about whom you
          say something in your letters. I will not go farther off, since that is your wish, but
          pray send me a letter as often as possible, especially if there is anything on which we
          may safely build our hope. Good-bye, my loves, good-bye! <milestone unit="para"

        </opener>
        <p> Greetings to his Terentia, Tulliola, and Cicero. I learn, both from the letters of many
          and the conversation of all whom I meet, that you are shewing a virtue and courage
          surpassing belief; and that you give no sign of fatigue <pb n="174"/> in mind or body from
          your labours. Ah me! To think that a woman of your virtue, fidelity, uprightness, and
          kindness should have fallen into such troubles on my account! And that my little Tullia
          should reap such a harvest of sorrow from the father, from whom she used to receive such
          abundant joys! For why mention my boy Cicero, who from the first moment of conscious
          feeling has been made aware of the bitterest sorrows and miseries? And if, as you say, I
          had thought these things the work of destiny, I could have borne them somewhat more
          easily, but they were really all brought about by my own fault, in thinking myself beloved
          by those who were really jealous of me, and in not joining those who really wanted me.
            <note n="1" anchored="true">The party of the triumvirs. </note> But if I had followed my
          own judgment, and had not allowed the observations of friends, who were either foolish or
          treacherous, to have such great influence with me, we should have been living at the
          height of bliss. As it is, since friends bid us hope, I will do my best to prevent my
          weakness of health from failing to second your efforts. I fully understand the magnitude
          of the difficulty, and how much easier it will turn out to have been to stay at home than
          to get back. However, if we have all the tribunes on our side, if we find Lentulus as
          zealous as he appears to be, if, finally, we have Pompey and Caesar, there is no reason to
          despair. About our slaves, <note n="2" anchored="true">See Letter LXI, p. 142. </note> we
          will do what you say is the opinion of our friends. As to this place, by this time the
          epidemic has taken its departure; but while it lasted, it did not touch me. Plancius, the
          kindest of men, desires me to stay with him and still keeps me from departing. I wanted to
          be in a less frequented district in <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName>, to
          which neither Hispo <note n="3" anchored="true">A centurion or other officer in the army
            of <foreign xml:lang="la">Piso</foreign> crossing to <placeName key="tgn,7006667"
              >Macedonia</placeName>. But the name is otherwise unknown, and some have thought that
            it is an intentional disguise for the name of <foreign xml:lang="la">Piso</foreign>
            himself. </note> nor soldiers would come, but as yet Plancius keeps me from going; he
          hopes that he may possibly quit his province for <placeName key="tgn,1000080"
            >Italy</placeName> in my company. And if ever I see that day, and come once more into
          your arms, and if I ever recover you all and myself, I shall consider that I have reaped a
          sufficient harvest both of your piety and my own. Piso's <note n="4" anchored="true"
            >Cicero's son-in-law. </note> kindness, virtue, and affection toward us all are so <pb
            n="175"/> great that nothing can surpass them. I hope his conduct may be a source of
          pleasure to him, a source of glory I see clearly that it will be. I did not mean to find
          fault with you about my brother Quintus, but I wished that you all, especially considering
          how few there are of you, should be as closely united as possible. Those whom you wished
          me to thank I have thanked, and told them that my information came from you. As to what
          you say in your letter, my dear Terentia, about your intention of selling the village,
          alas! in heaven's name, what will become of you? And if the same ill-fortune continues to
          pursue us, what will become of our poor boy? I cannot write the rest—so violent is my
          outburst of weeping, and I will not reduce you to the same tearful condition. I only add
          this: if my friends remain loyal to me, there will be no lack of money; if not, you will
          not be able to effect our object out of your own purse. In the name of our unhappy
          fortunes, beware how we put the finishing stroke to the boy's ruin. If he has something to
          keep him from absolute want, he will need only moderate character and moderate luck to
          attain the rest. See to your health, and mind you send me letter-carriers, that I may know
          what is going on and what you are all doing. I have in any case only a short time to wait.
          Give my love to Tulliola and Cicero. Good-bye. <milestone unit="para"/><placeName

        <p> Greetings to his Terentia, Tulliola, and Cicero. I have received three letters from the
          hands of Aristocritus, which I almost obliterated with tears. For I am thoroughly weakened
          with sorrow, my dear Terentia, and it is not my own miseries that torture me more than
          yours—and yours, my children! Moreover, I am more miserable than you in this, that whereas
          the disaster is shared by us both, yet the fault is all my own. It was my duty to have
          avoided the danger by accepting a legation, <note n="1" anchored="true">Either the
              <foreign xml:lang="la">libera legatio</foreign> or the acting <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >legatio</foreign> in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, both of which
            Caesar offered him. </note> or to resist it by careful management and the resources at
          my command, or to fall like a brave man. Nothing was more pitiful, more base, or more
          unworthy of myself than the line I actually took. Accordingly, it is with shame as well as
          grief that I am overpowered. For I am ashamed of not having exhibited courage and care to
          a most excellent wife and most darling children. I have, day and night, before my eyes the
          mourning dresses, the tears of you all, and the weakness of your own health, while the
          hope of recall presented to me is slender indeed. Many are hostile, nearly all jealous. To
          expel me had been difficult, to keep me out is easy. However, as long as you entertain any
          hope, I will not give way, lest all should seem lost by my fault. As to your anxiety for
          my personal safety, that is now the easiest thing in the world for me, for even my enemies
          desire me to go on living in this utter wretchedness. I will, however, do as you bid me. I
          have thanked the friends you desired me to thank, and I have delivered the letters to
          Dexippus, and have mentioned that you had informed me of their kindness. That our Piso has
          shewn surprising zeal and kindness to us I can see for myself, but everybody also tells me
          of it. God grant that I may be <pb n="180"/> allowed, along with you and our children, to
          enjoy the actual society of such a son-in-law! For the present our one remaining hope is
          in the new tribunes, and that, too, in the first days of their office; if the matter is
          allowed to get stale, it is all over with us. It is for that reason that I have sent
          Aristocritus back to you at once, in order that you may be able to write to me on the spot
          as to the first official steps taken, and the progress of the whole business; although I
          have also given Dexippus orders to hurry back here at once, and I have sent a message to
          my brother to despatch letter-carriers frequently. For the professed object of my being at
            <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrachium</placeName> at the present juncture is that I
          may hear as speedily as possible what is being done; and I am in no personal danger, for
          this town has always been defended by me. When I am told that enemies are on their way
          here I shall retire into <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName>. As to your
          coming to me, as you say you will if I wish it—for my part, knowing that a large part of
          this burden is supported by you, I should like you to remain where you are. If you succeed
          in your attempt I must come to you: but if, on the other hand—but I needn't write the
          rest. From your first, or at most, your second letter, I shall be able to decide what I
          must do. Only be sure you tell me everything with the greatest minuteness, although I
          ought now to be looking out for some practical step rather than a letter. Take care of
          your health, and assure yourself that nothing is or has ever been dearer to me than you
          are. Good-bye, my dear Terentia, whom I seem to see before my eyes, and so am dissolved in
          tears. Good-bye! <milestone unit="para"/>29 November. <pb n="181"/>

        <p> A letter from my brother Quintus, and one from my friend Titus Pomponius, had given me
          so much hope, that I depended on your assistance no less than on that of your <pb n="185"
          /> colleague. Accordingly, I at once sent you a letter in which, as my present position
          required, I offered you thanks and asked for the continuance of your assistance. Later on,
          not so much the letters of my friends, as the conversation of travellers by this route,
          indicated that your feelings had undergone a change; and that circumstance prevented my
          venturing to trouble you with letters. Now, however, my brother Quintus has sent me a copy
          which he had made of your exceedingly kind speech delivered in the senate. Induced by this
          I have attempted to write to you, and I do ask and beg of you, as far as I may without
          giving you offence, to preserve your own friends along with me, rather than attack me to
          satisfy the unreasonable vindictiveness of your connexions. You have, indeed, conquered
          yourself so far as to lay aside your own enmity for the sake of the Republic : will you be
          induced to support that of others agaznst the interests of the Republic? But if you will
          in your clemency now give me assistance, I promise you that I will be at your service
          henceforth: but if neither magistrates, nor senate, nor people are permitted to aid nie,
          owing to the violence which has proved too strong for me, and for the state as well, take
          care lest—though you may wish the opportunity back again for retaining all and sundry in
          their rights-you find yourself unable to do so, because there will be nobody to be
          retained. <note n="1" anchored="true">This intentionally enigmatical sentence is meant to
            contain a menace against Clodius, who is hinted at in the word <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >omnium</foreign>, just as he is earlier in the letter in the word <foreign
              xml:lang="la">tuorum</foreign>. Clodius was a connexion by marriage of Metellus
            (through his late brother, the husband of <foreign xml:lang="la">Clodia</foreign>), and
            Cicero assumes that Metellus is restrained from helping him by regard for Clodius. He
            knows, however, by this time, that one of the new tribunes, <foreign xml:lang="la"

            he countenances Clodius's violence he may some day find that there is no Clodius to
            save—if that is his object. In Letter LXXXIX he shews how early he had contemplated

          But Licinius was polite enough to call on me in the evening after the senate had risen,
          that, in case of any business having been done there, I might, if I thought good, write an
          account of it to you. The senate was fuller than I had thought possible in the month of
          December just <pb n="199"/> before the holidays. Of us consulars there were P. Servilius,
          M. Lucullus, Lepidus, Volcatius, Glabrio: the two consuls-designate; the praetors. We were
          a really full house: two hundred in all. <note n="1" anchored="true">Full,"that is, for

            and not only to his speeches against Rullus. It was because Caesar disregarded the
            ancient exception of this land from such distribution that Cicero opposed his bill, and
            refused to serve on the commission. </note> There were some sharp thrusts at Caesar,
          some denunciations of Gellius, some appeals to the absent Pompey. After concluding his
          speech at a late hour, he said that he would not ask for our votes lest he might burden us
          with a personal controversy; he quite understood the sentiments of the senate from the
          denunciations of past times and the silence on the present occasion. Milo spoke. Lupus

            one said anything, the senate was dismissed; but any magistrate, or
            magistrate-designate, could speak, and so continue the sitting up to nightfall, when the
            house stood adjourned. </note> when Marcellinus says: " Don't infer from our silence,
          Lupus, what we approve or disapprove of at this particular time. As far as I am concerned,
          and I think it is the same with the rest, I am only silent because I do not think it
          suitable that the case of the Campanian land should be debated in Pompey's absence." Then
          Lupus said that he would not detain the senate. <note n="5" anchored="true">Because

          incendiaries, massacres, and stonings, proposed a resolution that "Clodius himself should,

          </note> I made a long speech upon the whole story of P. Clodius's mad proceedings and

          his trial, amidst frequent murmurs of approbation from the whole senate. My speech was
          praised oratorical skill by Antistius Vetus, who also supported the priority of the legal
          proceedings, and declared that he should consider it of the first importance. The senators
          were crossing the floor in support of this view, <note n="6" anchored="true">They went and
            sat or stood near the speaker they wished to support. It was not, however, a formal

            the division easier. </note> when Clodius, being called on, began trying to talk out the

          <note n="1" anchored="true">The year of this letter has been inferred from the mention of

              57</date>, was in this year elected into the college of augurs. Yet as we know that
            Cicero's Tusculan villa was dismantled by Clodius, and was advertised for sale (though
            not sold), it seems rather extraordinary that Cicero should have gone there for his
            health. The Fadii <foreign xml:lang="la">Galli</foreign> were a family of Cicero's
            native place, <foreign xml:lang="la">Arpinum</foreign>. </note> (? DECEMBER) Having been
          suffering for nine days past from a severe disorder of the bowels, and being unable to
          convince those who desired my services that I was ill because I had no fever, I fled to my
          Tusculan villa, after having, in fact, observed for two days so strict a fast as not even
          to drink a drop of water. Accordingly, being thoroughly reduced by weakness and hunger, I
          was more in want of your services than I thought mine could be required by you. For
          myself, while skrinking from all illnesses, I especially shrink from that in regard to
          which the Stoics attack your friend Epicurus for saying that "he suffered from strangury
          and pains in the bowels"—the latter of which complaints they attribute to gluttony, the
          former to a still graver indulgence. I had been really much afraid of dysentery. But
          either the change of residence, or the mere relaxation of anxiety, or perhaps the natural
          abatement of the complaint from lapse of time, seems to me to have done me good. However,
          to prevent <pb n="202"/> your wondering how this Came about, or in what manner I let
          myself in for it, I must tell you that the sumptuary law, supposed to have introduced
          plain living, was the origin of my misfortune. For whilst your epicures wish to bring into
          fashion the products of the earth, which are not forbidden by the law, they flavour
          mushrooms, <foreign xml:lang="fr">petits choux</foreign>, and every kind of pot-herb so as
          to make them the most tempting dishes possible. <note n="1" anchored="true">There were
            several sumptuary laws. Those which may possibly be referred to here are (1) the
              <foreign xml:lang="la">lex Licinia</foreign> (? <date when="-0103">B.C. 103</date>),
            which defined certain foods as illegal at banquets, but excepted <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >quod ex terra vite arbore ve sit natum</foreign> (Macrobius, Sat. 211.17, 9; Gell.
            2.24, 7); (2) the <foreign xml:lang="la">lex Aemilia</foreign> (<date when="-0068">B.C.
              68</date>), which also defined both the quantity and quality of food allowable at
            banquets (Gell. 2.24,12). </note> Having fallen a victim to these in the augural banquet
          at the house of Lentulus, I was seized with a violent diarrhoea, which, I think, has been
          checked today for the first time. And so I, who abstain from oysters and lampreys without
          any difficulty, have been beguiled by beet and mallows. Henceforth, therefore, I shall be
          more cautious. Yet, having heard of it from Anicius <note n="2" anchored="true">C.
            Anicius, a senator and intimate friend of Cicero's. </note> —for he saw me turning
          sick—you had every reason not only for sending to inquire, but even for coming to see me.
          I am thinking of remaining here till I am thoroughly restored, for I have lost both
          strength and flesh. However, if I can once get completely rid of my complaint, I shall, I
          hope, easily recover these. </p>

            but as Pompey wished to have the business, the senate found itself in a difficulty, not
            wishing to put him in military command, or daring to offend him by an open refusal
              (<bibl n="TLG385.1 39.12">Dio, 39.12</bibl>). The tribune C. <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Cato</foreign> found up a Sibylline oracle forbidding the employment of an army for
            the purpose, which served the senate as a decent excuse. The commission to Lentulus was
            eventually withdrawn by an <foreign xml:lang="la">auctoritas senatus</foreign>, and
            Lentulus did not venture to do it. Ptolemy, finding that he could not succeed in getting
            Pompey commissioned, retired to <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>, and
            afterwards succeeded by an enormous bribe in inducing Gabinius, the proconsul of

          king's agent, Hammonius, is openly attacking us by bribery. The business is being carried
          out by means of the same money-lenders as it was when you were in town. Such people as
          wish it done for the king's sake—and they are few—are all for intrusting the business to
          Pompey. The senate supports the trumped—up religious scruple, not from any respect to
          religion, but from ill-feeling towards him, and disgust at the king's outrageous bribery.
          I never cease advising and instigating Pompey—even frankly finding fault with and

          him from his motion as to the religious difficulty, which he made up his mind to bring,
          and has, in fact, brought several times before the senate. The debate up to the Ides (for
          I am writing early in the morning of the Ides <note n="2" anchored="true">I.e., before
            going to the senate on the Ides of January (13th). See next letter. </note> ) has been
          as follows: Hortensius and I and Lucullus voted for yielding to the religious scruple as

          detriment to the state": so that while the religious difficulty prohibits the employment
          of an army, the senate might still retain you as the person authorized. Crassus votes for
          sending three legates, not excluding Pompey: for he would allow them to be selected even
          from such as are at present in possession of imperlum. Bibulus is for three legates

          wishes: for it was noticed that Pompey's intimates agreed with Volcatius. We are in a very
          great difficulty: the day seems going against us. The notorious colloguing and eagerness
          of Libo and Hypsaeus, and the earnestness displayed by Pompey's intimates, have produced

          wishes, for they think they are gratifying him. We are in much the same position as we
          were long before your departure: now, as then, the sore has been fomented secretly by the

        <p> NOTHING was done on the i3th of January in the senate, because the day was to a great
          extent spent in an altercation between the consul Lentulus and the tribune Caninius. On
          that day I also spoke at considerable length, and thought that I made a very great
          impression on the senate by dwelling on your affection for the house. Accordingly, next
          day we resolved that we would deliver our Opinions briefly: for it appeared to us that the
          feelings of the senate had been softened towards us—the result not only of my speech, but
          of my personal appeal and application to individual senators. Accordingly, the first
          proposition, that of Bibulus, having been delivered, that three legates should restore the
          king: the second, that of Hortensius, that you should restore him without an army: the
          third, that of Volcatius, that Pompey should do it, a demand was made that the proposal of
          Bibulus should be taken in two parts. <note n="1" anchored="true">The proposal of Bibulus
            to send "three legates" implied a concession to the Sibylline verse, in not sending "an
            army." It was therefore to be voted on as two questions—(1) Shall the Sibylline verse be
            obeyed, and an army not sent? (2) Shall three legates be sent? </note> As far as he <pb
            n="206"/> dealt with the religious difficulty—a point which was now past being
          opposed—his motion was carried; his proposition as to three legates was defeated by a
          large majority. The next was the proposition of Hortensius. Thereupon the tribune Lupus,
          on the ground that he had himself made a proposal about Pompey, starts the contention that
          he ought to divide the house before the consuls. His speech was received on all sides by
          loud cries of "No": for it was both unfair and unprecedented. The consuls would not give
          in, and yet did not oppose with any vigour. Their object was to waste the day, and in that
          they succeeded <note n="1" anchored="true">That is, the debate went off on the side issue
            as to who had the prior right of dividing the house. Lupus said <emph>he</emph> had,
            because the proposal of Volcatius was really made before the others, i.e., in the
            previous day's debate (see last letter). The consuls were only too glad thus to avoid
            having the main question brought to a vote, and let this technical point be spun out in
            a languid debate. </note> for they saw very well that many times the number would vote
          for the proposal of Hortensius, although they openly professed their agreement with
          Volcatius. Large numbers were called upon for their opinion, and that, too, with the
          assent of the consuls: for they wanted the proposal of Bibulus carried. This dispute was
          protracted till nightfall, and the senate was dismissed. I happened to be dining with
          Pompey on that day, and I seized the opportunity—the best I have ever had, for since your
          departure I have never occupied a more honourable position in the senate than I had on
          that day—of talking to him in such a way, that I think I induced him to give up every
          other idea and resolve to support your claims. And, indeed, when I actually hear him talk,
          I acquit him entirely of all suspicion of personal ambition: but when I regard his
          intimates of every rank, I perceive, what is no secret to anybody, that this whole
          business has been long ago corruptly manipulated by a certain coterie, not without the
          king's own consent and that of his advisers. I write this on the 15th of January, before
          daybreak. Today there is to be a meeting of the senate. We shall maintain, as I hope, our
          position in the senate as far as it is possible to do so in such an age of perfidy and
          unfair dealing. <pb n="207"/> As to an appeal to the people on the subject, we have, I
          think, secured that no proposition can be brought before them without neglect of the
          auspices or breach of the laws, or, in fine, without downright violence. <note n="1"

          </note> The day before my writing these words a resolution of the senate on these matters
          of the most serious character was passed, and though Cato and Caninius vetoed it, it was

            thus on record as an <foreign xml:lang="la">auctoritas senatus</foreign>, "resolution of

          important business in your province, both of wide extent and sound, is an intimate friend
          of mine of many years standing. As before this. he has always, both from his brilliant
          position and the recommendations of myself and his other friends, enjoyed the highest
          popularity in the province, so at the present time, trusting to your affection for me and
          our close ties, he feels sure that this letter of mine will give him a high place in your
          esteem. That he may not be disappointed in tbat hope I earnestly beg of you, and I commend
          to you all his business concerns, his freedmen, agents, and servants; and specially <pb

        <p> Though in the senate of the 15th of January we made a most glorious stand, seeing that
          on the previous day we had defeated the proposal of Bibulus about the three legates, and
          the only contest left was with the proposal of Volcatius, yet the business was spun out by
          our opponents by various obstructive tactics. For we were carrying our view in a full
          senate, in spite of the multifarious devices and inveterate jealousy of those who were for
          transferring the cause of the king from you to some one else. That day we found Curio very
          bitterly opposed, Bibulus much more fair, almost friendly even. Caninius and Cato declared
          that they would not propose any law before the elections. By the <foreign xml:lang="la"
            >lex Pupia</foreign>, as you know, no senate could be held before the 1st of February,
          nor in fact during the whole of February, <note n="2" anchored="true">I.e., no meeting of
            the senate for ordinary business. During the month of February the senate usually
            devoted all its time to hearing and answering deputations from the provinces or foreign
            states. The <foreign xml:lang="la">lex Pupia</foreign> forbade the meeting of the senate
            on <foreign xml:lang="la">dies comitiales</foreign>, and after the 14th the days in
            January were all <foreign xml:lang="la">comitiales</foreign>: but another law (<foreign
              xml:lang="la">lex Vatinia</foreign>) ordered it to meet every day in February for the
            business of the legations. If this business was concluded or deferred it remained a moot
            point whether a magistrate was not still bound or, at least, allowed to summon it for
            other business (<foreign xml:lang="la">ad</foreign>
            <bibl n="Cic. Q. Fr. 2.13">Q. Fr. 2.13</bibl>). </note> unless the business of the
          legations were finished or adjourned. However, <pb n="209"/> the Roman people are
          generally of opinion that the pretext of a trumped—up religious scruple has been
          introduced by your jealous detractors, not so much to hinder you, as to prevent anyone
          from wishing to go to <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName> with a
          view of getting the command of an army. However, everyone thinks that the senate has had a
          regard for your position. For there is no one that is ignorant of the fact that it was all
          the doing of your opponents that no division took place: and if they, under the pretext of
          a regard for the people, but really from the most unprincipled villainy, attempt to carry
          anything, I have taken very good care that they shall not be able to do so without
          violating the auspices or the laws, or, in fact, without absolute violence. I don't think
          I need write a word either about my own zeal or the injurious proceedings of certain
          persons. For why should I make any display myself-since, if I were even to shed my blood
          in defence of your position, I should think that I had not covered a tithe of your
          services to me? Or why complain of the injurious conduct of others, which I cannot do
          without the deepest pain? I cannot at all pledge myself to you as to the effect of open
          violence, especially with such feeble magistrates but, open violence out of the question,
          I can assure you that you will retain your high position, if the warmest affections both
          of the senate and the Roman people can secure it to you. </p>

          your position as I experienced in the matter of my restoration, I have understood from
          your letter. Just when I was depending most securely on my policy, zeal, activity, and
          influence in the matter of the king, there was suddenly sprung on us the abominable bill
          of Cato's, <note n="1" anchored="true">That of the tribune C. <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Cato</foreign> for the recall of Lentulus. </note> to hamper all our zeal and
          withdraw our thoughts from a lesser anxiety to a most serious alarm. However, in a
          political upset of that kind, though there is nothing that is not a source of terror, yet
          the thing to be chiefly feared is treachery: and Cato, at any rate, whatever happens, we
          have no hesitation in opposing. As to the business of <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria"

          that I will to the utmost of my power satisfy both you, who are absent, and your friends
          who are here. But I fear the king's cause may either be snatched from our hands or
          abandoned altogether, and I cannot easily make up my mind which of the two alternatives I
          would least wish. But if the worst comes to the worst, there is a third alternative, which

        <p> It was not from the multiplicity of business, though I am very much engaged, but from a
          slight inflammation of the eyes that I was induced to dictate this letter, and not, as is
          my usual habit, write it with my own hand. And, to begin with, I wish to excuse myself to

          gratifying Pompey's wishes: but the detractors of Lentulus Contrived to talk the matter
          out by obstructive speeches. Then followed the comitial days, on which a meeting of the
          senate was impossible. What the villainy of the tribunes is going to accomplish I cannot

        </opener>
        <p> I have already told you the earlier proceedings; now let me describe what was done
          afterwards. The legations were post-poned from the 1st of February to the 13th. On the
          former day our business was not brought to a settlement. On the 2nd of February Milo
          appeared for trial. Pompey came to support him. Marcellus spoke on being called upon by
          me. <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Milo</foreign> impeached by Clodius before the <foreign
              xml:lang="la">comitia tributa</foreign> for his employment of gladiators. Dio (xxxix.
            18) says that Clodius thus impeached <foreign xml:lang="la">Milo</foreign>, not with any
            hope of securing his conviction against the powerful support of Cicero and Pompey, but
            to get the chance of insulting these latter. Marcellus was one of the candidates for the
            aedileship with Clodius. See Letter XCI. </note> We came off with flying colours. The
          case was adjourned to the 7th. Meanwhile (in the senate), the legations having been
          postponed to the i3th, the business of allotting the quaestors and furnishing the outfit
          of the praetors was brought before the house. But nothing was done, because many speeches
          were interposed denouncing the state of the Republic. Gaius Cato published his bill for
          the recall of Lentulus, whose son thereupon put on mourning. On the 7th Milo appeared.
          Pompey spoke, or rather wished to speak. For as soon as he got up Clodius's ruffians
          raised a shout, and throughout his whole speech he was interrupted, not only by hostile
          cries, but by personal abuse and insulting remarks. However, when he had finished his
          speech—for he shewed great courage in these circumstances, he was <pb n="214"/> not cowed,
          he said all he had to say, and at times had by his Commanding presence even secured
          silence for his words —well, when he had finished, up got Clodius. Our party received him
          with such a shout—for they had determined to pay him out—that he lost all presence of
          mind, power of speech, or control over his countenance. This went on up to two
          o'clock-Pompey having finished his speech at noon —and every kind of abuse, and finally
          epigrams of the most outspoken indecency were uttered against Clodius and Clodia. Mad and
          livid with rage Clodius, in the very midst of the shouting, kept putting questions to his
          claque: "Who was it who was starving the commons to death?" His ruffians answered,
          "Pompey." "Who wanted to be sent to <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria"
            >Alexandria</placeName>?" They answered, "Pompey." "Who did they wish to go?" They
          answered, "Crassus." The latter was present at the time with no friendly feelings to Milo.
          About three o'clock, as though at a given signal, the Clodians began spitting at our men.
          There was an outburst of rage. They began a movement for forcing us from our ground. Our
          men charged: his ruffians turned tail. Clodius was pushed off the rostra: and then we too
          made our escape for fear of mischief in the riot. The senate was summoned into the Curia:
          Pompey went home. However, I did not myself enter the senate-house, lest I should be
          obliged either to refrain from speaking on matters of such gravity, or in defending Pompey
          (for he was being attacked by Bibulus, Curio, Favonius, and Servilius the younger) should
          give offence to the loyalists. The business was adjourned to the next day. Clodius fixed
          the Quirinalia (17th of February) for his prosecution. On the 8th the senate met in the
          temple of Apollo, that Pompey might attend. Pompey made an impressive speech. That day
          nothing was concluded. On the 9th in the temple of Apollo a decree passed the senate "that
          what had taken place on the 7th of February was treasonable." On this day Cato warmly
          inveighed against Pompey, and throughout his speech arraigned him as though he were at the
          bar. He said a great deal about me, to my disgust, though it was in very laudatory terms.
          When he attacked Pompey's perfidy to me, he was listened to in profound silence on the
          part of my enemies. Pompey answered him boldly with a palpable allusion to Crassus, and
          said outright that "he would take <pb n="215"/> better precautions to protect his life
          than Mricanus had done, whom C. Carbo had assassinated." <note n="1" anchored="true">In
              <date when="-0129">B.C. 129</date>, after making a speech in favour of the claims of

              >Scipio</foreign> Aemilianus, the younger Africanus, was found dead in his bed. The
            common report was that he had been assassinated by <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Carbo</foreign>, or with his privity, but it was never proved (see <bibl
              n="Cic. Orat. 2.170"/><bibl n="Cic. Off. 2">de Orat. 2</bibl>.170). Cicero does not
            here assume the truth of the story he merely repeats Pompey's words. </note>
          Accordingly, important events appear to me to be in the wind. For Pompey understands what
          is going on, and imparts to me that plots are being formed against his life, that Gaius
          Cato is being supported by Crassus, that money is being supplied to Clodius, that both are
          backed by Crassus and Curio, as well as by Bibulus and his other detractors: that he must
          take extraordinary precautions to prevent being overpowered by that demagogue-with a
          people all but wholly alienated, a nobility hostile, a senate ill-affected, and the
          younger men corrupt. So he is making his preparations and summoning men from the country.
          On his part, Clodius is rallying his gangs: a body of men is being got together for the
          Quirinalia. For that occasion we are considerably in a majority, owing to the forces
          brought up by Pompey himself: and a large contingent is expected from Picenum and
            <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gallia</placeName>, to enable us to throw out Cato's bills
          also about 'Milo and Lentulus. On the ioth of February an indictment was lodged against

          the way beforehand for a refutation of the charges which are being got up against Sestius,
          and I passed a well-deserved encomium upon him with the cordial approval of everybody. He

        <p> WHAT is being done and has been done here I imagine you know from letters of numerous
          correspondents and from messengers but what are still matters for conjecture, and seem
          likely to take place, I think I ought to write and tell you. After Pompey had been roughly
          treated with shouts and insulting remarks, while speaking before the people on the 7th of
          February in defence of Milo, and had been accused in the senate by Cato in exceedingly
          harsh and bitter terms amidst profound silence, he appeared to me to be very much upset in
          his mind. Accordingly, he seems to me to have quite given up any idea of the Alexandrine
          business-which, as far as we are concerned, remains exactly where it was, for the senate
          has taken nothing from you except what, owing to the same religious difficulty, cannot be
          granted to anyone else. My hope and my earnest endeavour now is that the king, when he
          understands that he cannot obtain what he had in his mind-restoration by Pompey—and that,
          unless restored by you, he will be abandoned, and neglected, should pay you a visit. <note
            n="2" anchored="true">Ptolemy was at <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>.
          </note> This he will do without any hesitation, if Pompey gives the least hint of his
          approval. But you know that man's deliberate ways and obstinate reserve. However, I will
          omit nothing that may contribute to that result. The other injurious proceedings
          instituted by Cato I shall, I hope, have no difficulty in resisting. I perceive that none
          of the consulars are friendly to you except Hortensius and Lucullus; the rest are either
          hostile, <pb n="218"/> without openly shewing it, or undisguisedly incensed. Keep a brave
          and high spirit, and feel Confident that the result will be to utterly repulse the attack
          of a most Contemptible fellow, and to retain your high position and fame. </p>

        </opener>
        <p> Our friend Sestius was acquitted on the uth of March, and, what was of great importance
          to the Republic—that there should be no appearance of difference of opinion in a case of
          that sort—was acquitted unanimously. As to what I had often gathered from your letters,
          that you were anxious about—that I should not leave any loophole for abuse to an
          unfriendly critic on the score of my being ungrateful, if I did not treat with the utmost
          indulgence his occasional wrong-headedness—let me tell you that in this trial I
          established my character for being the most grateful of men. For in conducting the defence
          I satisfied in the fullest manner possible a man of difficult temper, and, what he above
          all things desired, I cut up Vatinius (by whom he was being openly attacked) just as I
          pleased, with the applause of gods and men. And, farther, when our friend Paullus <note

              >Gaul</placeName>. Cicero spoke against him for perjury; but afterwards we shall find
            them ostensibly reconciled. </note> if Licinius Macer hesitated to do so, and Macer,
          rising from Sestius's benches, declared that he would not fail. Need I say more? That
          impudent swaggering fellow Vatinius was overwhelmed with confusion and thoroughly
          discredited. That most excellent boy, your son Quintus, is getting on splendidly with his
          education. I notice this the more because Tyrannio <note n="3" anchored="true">A Greek
            grammarian and geographer, of whom we have heard before, and shall hear of again in
            connexion with Cicero's library. </note> gives his lessons in my house. The building of
          both your house and mine is being pushed on <pb n="220"/> energetically. I have caused
          half the money to be paid to your contractor. I hope before winter we may be under the
          same roof. As to our Tullia, who, by Hercules, is very warmly attached to you, I hope I
          have settled her engagement with Crassipes. <note n="1" anchored="true">P. Furius
            Crassipes. Tullia's first husband, C. Calpurnius <foreign xml:lang="la">Piso

          beating the covert for it. <note n="3" anchored="true">Not going the right way to work to

          Marcellinus is splendid as consul, and his colleague does not put any difficulty in his

            proposed to recall Lentulus. </note> on whom, however, our friend Milo played a very
          pretty trick. For that defender of the employment of gladiators and beast-fighters had
          bought some beast-fighters from Cosconius and Pomponius, and had never appeared in public
          without them in their full armour. He could not afford to maintain <pb n="221"/> them, and
          accordingly had great difficulty in keeping them together. Milo found this out. He
          commissioned an individual, with whom he was not intimate, to buy this troop from Cato
          without exciting his suspicion. As soon as it had been removed, Racilius—at this time
          quite the only real tribune-revealed the truth, acknowledged that the men had been
          purchased for himself—for this is what they had agreed—and put up a notice that he
          intended to sell "Cato's troop." This notice caused much laughter. Accordingly, Lentulus
          has prevented Cato from going on with his laws, and also those who published bills of a
          monstrous description about Caesar, with no tribune to veto them. Caninius's proposal,
          indeed, about Pompey has died a natural death. For it is not approved of in itself, and
          our friend Pompey is also spoken of with great severity for the breach of his friendship
          with Publius Lentulus. He is not the man he was. The fact is that to the lowest dregs of
          the populace his support of Milo gives some offence, while the aristocrats are
          dissatisfied with much that he omits to do, and find fault with much that he does. This is
          the only point, however, in which I am not pleased with Marcellinus- that he handles him
          too roughly. Yet in this he is not going counter to the wishes of the senate: consequently
          I am the more glad towithdrawfrom the senate-house and from politics altogether. In the
          courts I have the same position as I ever had: never was my house more crowded. One
          untoward circumstance has occurred owing to Milo's rashness—the acquittal of Sext. Clodius
            <note n="1" anchored="true">A <foreign xml:lang="la">scriba</foreign> or public clerk,
            and a client of the patrician Clodii. </note> -whose prosecution at this particular
          time, and by a weak set of accusers, was against my advice. In a most Corrupt panel his
          conviction failed by only three votes. Consequently the people clamour for a fresh trial,
          and he must surely be brought back into court. For people will not put up with it, and
          seeing that, though pleading before a panel of his own kidney, he was all but condemned,
          they look upon him as practically condemned. Even in this matter the unpopularity of
          Pompey was an obstacle in our path. For the votes of the senators were largely in his
          favour, those of the knights were equally divided, while the <foreign xml:lang="la"
            >tribuni aerarii</foreign> voted for his condemntion. <pb n="222"/> But for this
          eon'rekmps I am consoled by the daily condemnations of my enemies, among whom, to my great
          delight, Servius <note n="1" anchored="true">Unknown. Cicero's words seem to imply that he
            nearly got convicted, but not quite. </note> got upon the rocks: the rest are utterly
          done for. Gaius Cato declared in public meeting that he would not allow the elections to
          be held, if he were deprived of the days for doing business with the people. Appius has
          not yet returned from his visit to Caesar. I am looking forward with extraordinary
          eagerness to a letter from you. Although I know the sea is still closed, yet they tell me
          that certain persons have, nevertheless, arrived from <placeName key="tgn,7001663"
            >Olbia</placeName> full of your praises, and declaring you to be very highly thought of
          in the province. They said also that these persons reported that you intended to cross as
          soon as navigation became possible. That is what I desire: but although it is yourself, of
          course, that I most look forward to, yet meanwhile I long for a letter. Farewell, my dear

        </opener>
        <p> I have already sent you a letter containing the information of my daughter Tullia having
          been betrothed to Crassipes on the 4th of April, and other intelligence public and
          private. The following are the events since then. On the 5th of April, by a decree of the
          senate, a sum of money amounting to 40,000 sestertia (about £320,000) was voted to Pompey
          for the business of the corn-supply. But on the same day there was a vehement debate on
          the Campanian land, the senators making almost as much noise as a public meeting. The
          shortness of money and the high price of corn increased the exasperation. Nor will I omit
          the following: the members of the colleges of the Capitolini and the Mercuriales <note
            n="2" anchored="true">In <date when="-0357">B.C. 357</date> a "college" was established
            for celebrating the <foreign xml:lang="la">ludi Capitolini</foreign>, in celebration of
            the failure of the Gauls to take it. It consisted of men living on the Capitoline (<bibl
              n="Liv. 5.50">Livy, 5.50</bibl>). The Mercuriates were a "college" or company of

          <pb n="223"/> expelled from their society a Roman knight named M. Furius Flaccus, a man of
          bad character: the expulsion took place when he was at the meeting, and though he threw
          himself at the feet of each member. On the 6th of April, the eve of my departure from
          town, I gave a betrothal party to Crassipes. That excellent boy, your and my Quintus, was
          not at the banquet owing to a very slight indisposition. On the 7th of April I visited
          Quintus and found him quite restored. He talked a good deal and with great feeling about
          the quarrels between our wives. What need I say more? Nothing could have been pleasanter.
          Pomponia, however, had some Complaints to make of you also: but of this when we meet.
          After leaving your boy I went to the site of your house: the building was going on with a
          large number of workmen. I urged the contractor Longilius to push on. He assured me that
          he had every wish to satisfy us. The house will be splendid, for it Can be better seen now
          than we could judge from the plan: my own house is also being built with despatch. On this
          day I dined with Crassipes. After dinner I went in my sedan to visit Pompey at his
          suburban villa. I had not been able to call on him in the daytime as he was away from
          home. However, I wished to see him, because I am leaving <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
            >Rome</placeName> tomorrow, and he is on the point of starting for <placeName

          <salute>TO L. LUCCEIUS</salute>
          <dateline><placeName key="perseus,Arpinum">ARPINUM</placeName> (APRIL)</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> I have often tried to say to you<note n="3" anchored="true">L. Lucceius, of whom we have
            heard before, as having some quarrel with <foreign xml:lang="la">Atticus</foreign>. His
            work has not survived. No letter of the correspondence has brought more adimadversion on
            Cicero, and yet log-rolling and the appealing to friends on the press to review one's
            book are not wholly unknown even in our time. </note>personally what I am about to
          write, but was prevented by a kind of almost clownish bashfulness. Now that I am not in
          your presence I shall speak out more boldly: a letter does not blush. I am inflamed with
          an inconceivably ardent desire, and one, as I <pb n="227"/> think, of which I have no
          reason to be ashamed, that in a history written by you my name should be conspicuous and
          frequently mentioned with praise. And though you have often shewn me that you meant to do
          so, yet I hope you will pardon my impatience. For the style of your composition, though I
          had always entertained the highest expectations of it, has yet surpassed my hopes, and has
          taken such a hold upon me, or rather has so fired my imagination, that I was eager to have
          my achievements as quickly as possible put on record in your history. For it is not only
          the thought of being spoken of by future ages that makes me snatch at what seems a hope of
          immortality, but it is also the desire of fully enjoying in my lifetime an authoritative
          expression of your judgment, or a token of your kindness for me, or the charm of your
          genius. Not, however, that while thus writing I am unaware under what heavy burdens you
          are labouring in the portion of history you have undertaken, and by this time have begun
          to write. But because I saw that your history of the Italian and Civil Wars was now all
          but finished, and because also you told me that you were already embarking upon the
          remaining portions of your work, I determined not to lose my chance for the want of
          suggesting to you to consider whether you preferred to weave your account of me into the
          main context of your history, or whether, as many Greek writers have done-Callisthenes,
          the Phocian War; Timaeus, the war of Pyrrhus; Polybius, that of <placeName
            key="tgn,7017511">Numantia</placeName>; all of whom separated the wars I have named from
          their main narratives-you would, like them, separate the civil conspiracy from public and
          external wars. For my part, I do not see that it matters much to my reputation, but it
          does somewhat concern my impatience, that you should not wait till you come to the proper
          place, but should at once anticipate the discussion of that question as a whole and the
          history of that epoch. And at the same time, if your whole thoughts are engaged on one
          incident and one person, I can see in imagination how much fuller your material will be,
          and how much more elaborately worked out. I am quite aware, however, what little modesty I
          display, first, in imposing on you so heavy a burden (for your engagements may well
          prevent your compliance with my request), and in the second place, in asking <pb n="228"/>
          you to shew me off to advantage. What if those transaCtions are not in your judgment so
          very deserving of Cornmendation? Yet, after all, a man who has once passed the border-line
          of modesty had better put a bold face on it and be frankly impudent. And so I again and
          again ask you outright, both to praise those actions of mine in warmer terms than you
          perhaps feel, and in that respect to neglect the laws of history. I ask you, too, in
          regard to the personal predilection, on which you wrote in a certain introductory chapter
          in the most gratifying and explicit terms—and by which you shew that you were as incapable
          of being diverted as Xenophon's Hercules by Pleasure—not to go against it, but to yield to
          your affection for me a little more than truth shall justify./ But if I can induce you to
          undertake this, you will have, I am persuaded, matter worthy of your genius and your
          wealth of language. For from the beginning of the conspiracy to my return from exile it
          appears to me that a moderate-sized monograph might be composed, in which you will, on the
          one hand, be able to utilize your special knowledge of civil disturbances, either in
          unravelling the causes of the revolution or in proposing remedies for evils, blaming
          lishing the righteousness of what you approve by explaining meanwhile what you think
          deserves denunciation, and estabthe principles on which they rest: and on the other hand,
          if you think it right to be more outspoken (as you generally do), you will bring out the
          perfidy, intrigues, and treachery of many people towards me. For my vicissitudes will
          supply you in your composition with much variety, which has in itself a kind of charm,
          capable of taking a strong hold on the imagination of readers, when you are the writer.
          For nothing is better fitted to interest a reader than variety of Circumstance and
          vicissitudes of fortune, which, thought he reverse of welcome to us in actual experience,
          will make very pleasant reading: for the untroubled recollection of a past sorrow has a
          charm of its own. To the rest of the world, indeed, who have had no trouble themselves,
          and who look upon the misfortunes of others without any suffering of their own, the
          feeling of pity is itself a source of pleasure. For what man of us is not delighted,
          though feeling a certain c6mpassion too, with the death-scene of Epa minondas at
            <placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName>? He, you know, did not allow <pb
            n="229"/> the dart to be drawn from his body until he had been told, in answer to his
          question, that his shield was safe, so that in spite of the agony of his wound he died
          calmly and with glory. Whose interest is not roused and sustained by the banishment and
          return of Themistocles? <note n="1" anchored="true">Cicero appears by a slip to have
            written Themistocles instead of Aristeides. The dramatic return of the latter just
            before the battle of <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> is narrated in
            Herodotus : whereas the former never returned, though his dead body was said to have
            been brought to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. </note> Truly the
          mere chronological record of the annals has very little charm for us-little more than the
          entries in the fasti: but the doubtful and varied fortunes of a man, frequently of eminent
          character, involve feelings of wonder, suspense, joy, sorrow, hope, fear: if these
          fortunes are crowned with a glorious death, the imagination is satisfied with the most
          fascinating delight which reading can give. 'Therefore it will be more in accordance with
          my wishes if you come to the resolution to separate from the main body of your narrative,
          in which you embrace a continuous history of events, what I may call the drama of my
          actions and fortunes: for it includes varied acts, and shifting scenes both of policy and
          circumstance. Nor am I afraid of appearing to lay snares for your favour by flattering
          suggestions, when I declare that I desire to be complimented and mentioned with praise by
          you above all other writers. For you are not the man to be ignorant of your own powers, or
          not to be sure that those who withhold their admiration of you are more to be accounted
          jealous, than those who praise you flatterers. Nor, again, am I so senseless as to wish to
          be consecrated to an eternity of fame by one who, in so consecrating me, does not also
          gain for himself the glory which rightfully belongs to genius. For the famous Alexander
          himself did not wish to be painted by Apelles, and to have his statue made by Lysippus
          above all others, merely from personal favour to them, but because he thought that their
          art would be a glory at once to them and to himself. And, indeed, those artists used to
          make images of the person known to strangers: but if such had never existed, illustrious
          men would yet be no less illustrious. The Spartan Agesilaus, who would not allow a
          portrait of himself to be painted or a statue made, deserves to be quoted as an example
          quite as much as those <pb n="230"/> who have taken trouble about such representations:
          for a single pamphlet of Xenophon's in praise of that king has proved much more effective
          than all the portraits and statues of them all. And, moreover, it will more redound to my
          present exultation and the honour of my memory to have found my way into your history,
          than if I had done so into that of others, in this, that I shall profit not only by the
          genius of the writer—as Timoleon did by that of Timaeus, Themistocles by that of
          Herodotus—but also by the authority of a man of a most illustrious and well-established
          character, and one well known and of the first repute for his conduct in the most
          important and weighty matters of state; so that I shall seem to have gained not only the
          fame which Alexander on his visit to Sigeum said had been bestowed on Achilles by Homer,
          but also the weighty testimony of a great and illustrious man. For I like that saying of
          Hector in Naevius, who not only rejoices that he is "praised," but adds, "and by one who
          has himself been "praised." But if I fail to obtain my request from you, which is
          equivalent to saying, if you are by some means prevented —for I hold it to be out of the
          question that you would refuse a request of mine—I shall perhaps be forced to do what
          certain persons have often found fault with, wnte my own panegyric, a thing, after all,
          which has a precedent of many illustrious men. But it will not escape your notice that
          there are the following drawbacks in a composition of that sort: men are bound, when
          writing of themselves, both to speak with greater reserve of what is praiseworthy, and to
          omit what calls for blame. Added to which such writing carries less conviction, less
          weight; many people, in fine, carp at it, and say that the heralds at the public games are
          more modest, for after having placed garlands on the other recipients and proclaimed their
          names in a loud voice, when their own turn comes to be presented with a garland before the
          games break up, they call in the services of another herald, that they may not declare
          themselves victors with their own voice. I wish to avoid all this, and, if you undertake
          my cause, I shall avoid it: and, accordingly, I ask you this favour. But why, you may well
          ask, when you have already often assured me that you intended to record in your book with
          the utmost minuteness the policy and events of <pb n="231"/> my consulship, do I now make
          this request to you with such earnestness and in so many words? The reason is to be found
          in that burning desire, of which I spoke at the beginning of my letter, for something
            <emph>prompt</emph>: because I am in a flutter of impatience, both that men should learn
          what I am from your books, while I am still alive, and that I may myself in my lifetime
          have the full enjoyment of my little bit of glory. What you intend doing on this subject I
          should like you to write me word, if not troublesome to you. For if you do undertake the
          subject, I will put together some notes of all occurrences: but if you put me off to some
          future time, I will talk the matter over with you. Meanwhile, do not relax your efforts,
          and thoroughly polish what you have already on the stocks, and continue to love me. </p>

        </opener>
        <p> I have read your letter in which you say that you are obliged for the frequent
          information I give you about all current events, and for the clear proof you have of my
          kindness to yourself. The latter—the regarding you with <pb n="236"/> warm affection—it is
          my duty to do, if I wish to maintain the character which you desired for me; the former it
          is a pleasure to do, namely, separated as we are by length of space and time, to converse
          with you as frequently as possible by means of letters. But if this shall occur less
          frequently than you expect, the reason will be that my letters are of such a kind that I
          dare not trust them to everybody promiscuously. As often as I get hold of trustworthy
          persons to whom I may safely deliver them, I will not omit to do so. As to your question
          about each particular person's loyalty and friendly feelings towards you, it is difficult
          to speak in regard to individuals. I can venture on this one assertion, which I often
          hinted to you before, and now write from close observation and knowledge—that certain
          persons, and those, above all others, who were most bound and most able to help you, have
          been exceedingly jealous of your claims: and that, though the point in question is
          different, your present position is exceedingly like what mine was some time ago in this,
          that those whom you had attacked on public grounds now openly assail you, while those
          whose authority, rank, and policy you had defended, are not so much mindful of your
          kindness as enemies to your reputation. In these circumstances, as I wrote you word
          before, I perceive that Hortensius is very warmly your friend, Lucullus anxious to serve
          you: while of the magistrates L. Racilius shews special loyalty and affection. For my
          taking up the cudgels for you, and advocating your claims, would seem in the eyes of most
          people to be the measure of my obligation to you rather than of my deliberate opinion.
          Besides these I am, in fact, not able to bear witness to any one of the consulars shewing
          zeal or kindness or friendly feeling towards you. For you are aware that Pompey, who is
          very frequently accustomed, not on my instigation but of his own accord, to confide in me
          about you, did not often attend the senate during these discussions. It is true your last
          letter, as I could easily conceive, was very gratifying to him. To me, indeed, your
          reasonableness, or rather your extreme wisdom, seemed not only charming, but simply
          admirable. For by that letter you retained your hold on a man of lofty character, who was
          bound to you by the signal generosity of your conduct towards him, but who was
          entertaining some <pb n="237"/> suspicions that, owing to the impression prevailing among
          certain persons as to his own ambitious desires, you were alienated from him. I always
          thought that he wished to support your reputation, even in that very dubious episode of
          Caninius's proposal; <note n="1" anchored="true">See Letter XCV</note> but when he had
          read your letter, I could plainly see that he was thinking with his whole soul of you,
          your honours, and your interests. Wherefore look upon what I am going to write as written
          after frequent discussions with him, in accordance with his opinion, and with the weight
          of his authority. It is this: "That, since no senatorial decree exists taking the
          restoration of the Alexandrine king out of your hands, and since the resolution written
          out upon that restoration (which, as you are aware, was vetoed) to the effect that no one
          was to restore the king at all, <note n="2" anchored="true">See Letter CII.</note> has
          rather the weight of a measure adopted by men in anger than of a deliberate decision of
          the senate—you can yourself see, since you are in possession of <placeName
            key="tgn,7002470">Cilicia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000112"

            Lentulus is not to <emph>take</emph> Ptolemy back, but to go to <placeName
              key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> and make it ready for him.</note> what it is
          within your power to effect and secure; and that, if circumstances seem to make it
          possible for you to occupy <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName> and
            <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, it is for your own dignity and that of
          the empire that, after having first placed the king at <placeName key="tgn,7001354"
            >Ptolemais</placeName> or some neighbouring place, you should proceed with fleet and
          army to <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>, in order that, when
          you have secured it by restoring peace and placing a garrison in it, Ptolemy may go back
          to his kingdom: thus it will be brought about that he is restored at once by your agency,
          as the senate originally voted, and without a 'host,' as those who are scrupulous about
          religion said was the order of the Sibyl." <milestone unit="para"/>But though both he and
          I agreed in this decision, we yet thought that men would judge of your policy by its
          result: if it turns out as we wish and desire everybody will say that you acted wisely and
          courageously if any hitch occurs, those same men will say that you acted ambitiously and
          rashly. Wherefore what you really can do it is not so easy for us to judge as for you who
          have <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> almost within sight For us, our view
          is this if you are certain that you can get <pb n="238"/> possession of that kingdom, you
          should not delay: if it is doubtful, you should not make the attempt. I can guarantee you
          this, that, if you succeed, you will be applauded by many while abroad, by all when you
          return. I see great danger in any failure, on account of the senatorial resolution and the
          religious scruple that have been introduced into the question. But for me, as I exhort you
          to snatch at what is certain to bring you credit, so I warn you against running any risks,
          and I return to what I said at the beginning of my letter—that men will judge all you do,
          not so much from the policy which prompted it as from its result. But if this method of
          procedure appears to you to be dangerous, our opinion is that, if the king fulfils his
          obligations to those of your friends, who throughout your province and sphere of
          government have lent him money, you should assist him both with troops and supplies: such
          is the nature and convenient situation of your province, that you either secure his
          restoration by giving him aid, or hinder it by neglecting to do so. In carrying out this
          policy you will perceive better and more easily than anyone else what the actual state of
          affairs, the nature of the case, and the circumstances of the hour admit: what our opinion
          was I thought that I was the person, above all others, to tell you. <milestone unit="para"
          />As to your congratulations to myself on my present position, on my intimacy with Milo,
          on the frivolity and impotency of Clodius—I am not at all surprised that, like a
          first-rate artist, you take pleasure in the brilliant works of your own hands. However,
          people's wrong-headedness—I don't like to use a harsher word—surpasses belief; they might
          have secured me by their sympathy in a cause in which they were all equally interested,
          yet they have alienated me by their jealousy: for by their carping and most malicious
          criticisms I must tell you that I have been all but driven from that old political
          standpoint of mine, so long maintained, not, it is true, so far as to forget my position,
          but far enough to admit at length some consideration for my personal safety also. Both
          might have been amply secured if there had been any good faith, any solidity in our
          consulars : but such is the frivolity of most of them, that they do not so much take
          pleasure in my political consistency, as offence at my brilliant position. I am the more
          outspoken in writing <pb n="239"/> this to you, because you lent your support, not only to
          my present position, which I obtained through you, but also long ago to my reputation and
          political eminence, when they were, so to speak, but just coming into existence; and at
          the same time because I see that it was not, as I used formerly to think, my want of
          curule pedigree that excited prejudice: for I have noticed in your case, one of the
          noblest of the land, a similar exhibition of base jealousy, and though they did not object
          to class you among the <foreign xml:lang="fr">oblesse</foreign>, they were unwilling that
          you should take any higher flight. I rejoice that your fortune has been unlike mine: for
          there is a great difference between having one's reputation lowered and one's personal
          safety abandoned to the enemy. In my case it was your noble conduct that prevented me from
          being too much disgusted with my own; for you secured that men should consider more to
          have been added to my future glory than had been taken from my present fortune. As for
          you—instigated both by your kindness to myself and my affection for you, I urge you to use
          all your care and industry to obtain the full glory, for which you have burned with such
          generous ardour from boyhood, and never, under anyone's injurious conduct, to bend that
          high spirit of yours, which I have always admired and always loved. Men have a high
          opinion of you; they loudly praise your liberality; they vividly remember your consulship.
          You must surely perceive how much more marked, and how much more prominent these
          sentiments will be, if backed up by some considerable repute from your province and your
          government. However, in every administrative act which you have to perform by means of
          your army and in virtue of your <foreign xml:lang="la">imperium</foreign>, I would have
          you reflect on these objects long before you act, prepare yourself with a view to them,
          turn them over in your mind, train yourself to obtain them, and convince yourself that you
          can with the greatest ease maintain the highest and most exalted position in the state.
          This you have always looked for, and I am sure you understand that you have attained it.
          And that you may not think this exhortation of mine meaningless or adopted without reason,
          I should explain that the consideration which has moved me to make it was the conviction
          that you required to be warned by the incidents, which our careers <pb n="240"/> have had
          in common, to be careful for the rest of your life as to whom to trust and against whom to
          be on your guard. <milestone unit="para"/>As to your question about the state of public
          affairs—there is the most profound difference of opinion, but the energy is all on one
          side. For those who are strong in wealth, arms, and material power, appear to me to have
          scored so great a success from the stupidity and fickleness of their opponents, that they
          are now the stronger in moral weight as well. Accordingly, with very few to oppose them,
          they have got everything through the senate, which they never expected to get even by the
          popular vote without a riot: for a grant for military pay and ten legates have been given
          to Caesar by decree, <note n="1" anchored="true">Cicero says elsewhere that he supported
            this (<bibl n="Cic. Balb. 61">pro Balbo, 61</bibl>; <foreign xml:lang="la">de</foreign>

          his successor, as required by the Sempronian law. <note n="2" anchored="true"> The law of

          less to you on this point because this position of public affairs is no pleasure to me: I
          mention it, however, in order to urge you to learn, while you can do so without suffering
          for it, the lesson which I myself, though devoted from boyhood to every kind of reading,
          yet learnt rather from bitter experience than from study, that we must neither consider
          our personal safety to the exclusion of our dignity, nor our dignity to the exclusion of
          our safety. <milestone unit="para"/>In your congratulations as to my daughter and
          Crassipes I am obliged to you for your kindness, and do indeed expect and hope that this
          connexion may be a source of pleasure to us. Our dear Lentulus, a young man who gives such
          splendid promise of the highest qualities, be sure you instruct both in those
          accomplishments which you have yourself ever been forward in pursuing, and also, above
          all, in the imitation of yourself: he can study in no better school than that. He holds a
          very high place in my regard and affection, as well because he is yours, as because he is
          worthy of such a father, and because he is devoted to me, and has always been so. <pb

        <p> If you are well I shall be glad. I am quite well. I presume that you will remember that,
          when escorting you on the commencement of your official journey, <note anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Paludatum</foreign>, lit. dressed in the <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >paludamentum</foreign>, the military dress in which provincial governors left
              <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> with <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >imperium</foreign>.</note> I mentioned to you in the presence of Publius Cuspius, and
          also afterwards urged you privately at some length, that whomsoever I might recommend to
          you as connexions of his, you should regard as among connexions of my own. You, as was to
          be expected from your extreme regard and uninterrupted attentions to me, undertook to do
          this for me with the utmost liberality and kindness. Cuspius, who is most careful in his
          duties towards all connected with him, takes a surprising interest in the well-being of
          certain persons of your province, because he has been twice in <placeName
            key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName> when presiding over the very large concerns of his
          revenue-company. Accordingly, this patronage of his, which he exercises on their behalf, I
          am accustomed as far as I can to back up by such means and influence as I possess.
          Wherefore I thought it necessary to explain to you in this letter why I give letters of
          introduction to all the friends of Cuspius. In future letters I will merely append the
          mark <note n="2" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="la">Notam</foreign>, some cipher,
            which he had agreed upon with Valerius to indicate that the commendation was not to be
            looked upon as a mere matter of course.</note> agreed upon between you and me, and at
          the same time indicate that he is one of Cuspius's friends. But the recommendation which I
          have resolved to subscribe to in this present letter, let me tell you, is more serious
          than any of them. For P. Cuspius has pressed me with particular earnestness to recommend
          Lucius Iulius to you as warmly as possible. I appear to be barely able to satisfy his
          eagerness by using the words which I generally use when most in earnest. He asks for
          something <pb n="242"/> out of the common way from me, and thinks I have a special knack
          in that style of writing. I have promised him to produce a masterpiece of commendation—a
          specimen of my choicest work. Since I cannot reach that standard, however, I would beg you
          to make him think that some astonishing effect has been produced by the style of my
          letter. You will secure that, if you treat him with all the liberality which your kindness
          can suggest and your official power make feasible—I don't mean merely in the way of
          material assistance, but also in words and even in looks: and what influence such things
          have in a province I could have wished that you had already learnt by experience, though I
          have an idea that you soon will do so. This man himself, whom I am recommending to you, I
          believe to be thoroughly worthy of your friendship, not only because Cuspius says so
          (though that should be enough), but because I know the keenness of his judgment of men and
          in the selection of his friends. I shall soon be able to judge what has been the effect of
          this letter, and shall, I feel certain, have reason to thank you. For myself, I shall with
          zeal and care see to all that I think to be your wish or to concern your interests. Take
          care of your health. </p>

        <p> How delighted I was to get your letter! It had been expected by me at first, it is true,
          only with longing, but recently with alarm also. And, in fact, let me tell you that this
          is the only letter which has reached me since the one brought me by your sailor and dated
            <placeName key="tgn,7001663">Olbia</placeName>. But let everything else, as you say, be
          reserved till we can talk it over together. One thing, however, I cannot put off: on the
          15th of May the senate covered itself with glory by refusing Gabinius a <foreign

          such a slight was never inflicted on anyone. Out of doors there is much applause. To me,
          gratifying as it is on its own account, it is even more so because it was done when I was
          not in the house. For it was an unbiassed <note n="2" anchored="true"><foreign
              xml:lang="grc">ei)likrine/s</foreign>, ''pure," '' clear."</note> judgment of the
          senate, without any attack or exercise of influence on my part. The debate previously
          arranged for the 15th and 16th, namely, the question of the Campanian land, did not come
          on. In this matter I don't quite see my way. <note n="3" anchored="true"><foreign

        </opener>
        <p> What debates have taken place in the senate, what determination has been come to in your
          business, and what Pompey has undertaken to do, all this you will best learn from Marcus
          Plaetorius, who has not only been engaged in these matters, but has even taken the lead in
          them, and left nothing undone which the greatest affection for you, the greatest good
          sense, and the greatest care could do. From the same man you will ascertain the general
          position of public affairs, which are of such a nature as is not easy to put in writing.
          They are, it is true, all in the power of our friends, and to such an extent that it does
          not seem probable that the present generation will witness a change. For my part, as in
          duty bound, as you advised, and as personal affection and expediency compel, I am
          attaching myself to the fortunes of the man whose alliance you thought you must court when
          my fortunes were in question. But you must feel how difficult it is to put away a
          political conviction, especially when it happens to be right and proved up to the hilt.
          However, I conform myself to the wishes of him from whom I cannot dissent with any
          dignity: and this I do not do, as perhaps some may think, from insincerity; for deliberate
          purpose and, by heaven! affection for Pompey are so powerful with me, that whatever is to
          his interest, and whatever he wishes, appears to me at once to be altogether right and
          reasonable. Nor, as I think, would even his opponents be wrong if, seeing that they cannot
          possibly be his equals, they were to cease to struggle against him. For myself I have
          another consolation—my character is such that all the world thinks me justified beyond all
          others, whether I support Pompey's views, or hold my tongue, or even, what is above
          everything else to my taste, return to my literary pursuits. And this last I certainly
          shall do, if my friendship for this same man permits it. For those objects which I had at
          one time in view, after having held the <pb n="247"/> highest offices and endured the
          greatest fatigues—the power of intervening with dignity in the debates of the senate, and
          a free hand in dealing with public affairs—these have been entirely abolished, and not
          more for me than for all. For we all have either to assent to a small clique, to the utter
          loss of our dignity, or to dissent to no purpose. My chief object in writing to you thus
          is that you may consider carefully what line you will also take yourself. The whole
          position of senate, law courts, and indeed of the entire constitution has undergone a
          complete change. The most we can hope for is tranquillity: and this the men now in supreme
          power seem likely to give us, if certain persons <note n="1" anchored="true">The extreme
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Optimates</foreign>, such as <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Cato</foreign>.</note> shew somewhat more tolerance of their despotism. The old
          consular prestige, indeed, of a courageous and consistent senator we must no longer think
          of: that has been lost by the fault of those who have alienated from the senate both an
          order once very closely allied to it, and an individual of the most illustrious character.
          But to return to what more immediately affects your interests—I have ascertained that
          Pompey is warmly your friend, and with him as consul, to the best of my knowledge and
          belief, you will get whatever you wish. In this he will have me always at his elbow, and
          nothing which affects you shall be passed over by me. Nor, in fact, shall I be afraid of
          boring him, for he will be very glad for his own sake to find me grateful to him. I would
          have you fully persuaded that there is nothing, however small, affecting your welfare that
          is not dearer to me than every interest of my own. And entertaining these sentiments, I
          can satisfy myself indeed, as far as assiduity is concerned, but in actual achievement I
          cannot do so, just because I cannot reach any proportion of your services to me, I do not
          say by actual return in kind, but by any return even of feeling. There is is a report that
          you have won a great victory. <note n="2" anchored="true">Against the predatory and

              (<foreign xml:lang="la">Urania</foreign>) ends with a speech of Iupiter, who
            recommends his leaving politics for literature.</note> which comes at the end of that
          book, I do indeed remember it, and that whole passage was aimed at myself rather than at
          the rest of the world. Nevertheless, the day after you started I went long before daybreak
          with Vibullius to call on Pompey; and upon addressing him on the subject of the works and
          inscriptions in your honour, <note n="3" anchored="true">A statue in the temple of
            Tellus.</note> he answered me very kindly, gave me great hopes, said he would like to
          talk to Crassus about it, and advised me to do so too. I joined in escorting Crassus to
          his house on his assuming the consulate: he undertook the affair, and said that Clodius
          would at this juncture have something that wanted to get by means of himself and Pompey:
          he thought that, if I did not baulk Clodius's views, I might get what I wanted without any
          opposition. I left the matter entirely in his hands and told him that I would do exactly
          as he wished. Publius Crassus the younger was present at this conversation, who, as you
          know, is very warmly attached to me. What Clodius wants is an honorary mission (if not by
          decree of the senate, then by popular vote) to <placeName key="perseus,Byzantium"
            >Byzantium</placeName> or to Brogitarus, or to both. <note n="4" anchored="true"
            >Brogitarus was a Galatian and connexion of Deiotarus. Clodius, as tribune, had done
            some services to <placeName key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</placeName>, and had also
            got Brogitarus the office of high priest of <foreign xml:lang="la">Cybele</foreign>. He
            wants now to go and get his money for these favours.</note> There is a good deal of
          money in it. It is a thing I don't trouble myself about much, even if I don't get what I
          am trying to get. Pompey, however, has spoken <pb n="249"/> to Crassus. They seem to have
          taken the business in hand. If they carry it through, well and good: if not, let us return
          to my "Iupiter." On the 11th of February a decree passed the senate as to bribery on the
          motion of Afranius, against which I had spoken when you were in the house. To the loudly
          expressed disapprobation of the senate the consuls did not go on with the proposals of
          those who, while agreeing with Afranius's motion, added a rider that after their election
          the praetors were to remain private citizens for sixty days. <note n="1" anchored="true"
            >The praetorian elections, like the consular, had been put off till February. Those

            which they would have been liable if, as in ordinary years, they had been "praetors

        <p> I had only just arrived from <placeName key="perseus,Arpinum">Arpinum</placeName> when
          your letter was delivered to me; and from the same bearer I received a letter from
          Arrianus, <note n="2" anchored="true">C. Arrianus <foreign xml:lang="la"
            >Evander</foreign>, a dealer in statues, it seems, from whom Fadius had bought some for
            Cicero. He offers to let the debt for them (and so the interest) run from any day Cicero
            pleases.</note> in which there was this most liberal offer, that when he came to
            <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> he would enter my debt to him on whatever
          day I chose. Pray put yourself in my place : is it consistent with your modesty or mine,
          first to prefer a request as to the day, and then to ask more than a year's credit? But,
          my dear Gallus, everything would have been easy, if you had bought the things I wanted,
          and only up to the price that I wished. However, the purchases which, according to your
          letter, you have made shall not only be ratified by me, but with gratitude besides: for I
          fully understand that you have displayed zeal and affection in purchasing (because you
          thought them worthy of me) things which pleased yourself—a man, as I have ever thought, of
          the most fastidious judgment in all matters of taste. Still, I should like Damasippus
            <note n="3" anchored="true">A well.known connoisseur, mentioned by <bibl n="Hor. S. 2.3"
              >Horace, Sat. 2.3</bibl>.64, seq.). He seems to have offered to take the bargain off
            Cicero's hands.</note> to abide by his decision: for there <pb n="256"/> is absolutely
          none of those purchases that I care to have. But you, being unacquainted with my habits,
          have bought four or five of your selection at a price at which I do not value any statues
          in the world. You compare your Bacchae with Metellus's Muses. Where is the likeness? To
          begin with, I should never have considered the Muses worth all that money, and I think all
          the Muses would have approved my judgment: still, it would have been appropriate to a
          library, and in harmony with my pursuits. But Bacchae! What place is there in my house for
          them? But, you will say, they are pretty. I know them very well and have often seen them.
          I would have commissioned you definitely in the case of statues known to me, if I had
          decided on them. The sort of statues that I am accustomed to buy are such as may adorn a
          place in a <foreign xml:lang="la">palaestra</foreign> after the fashion of gymnasia. <note
            n="1" anchored="true"> That is, for his pa'astra or gymnasium, as he calls it, in his
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Tusculanum</foreign>. See Letters I, II, VII.</note> What,
          again, have I, the promoter of peace, to do with a statue of Mars? I am glad there was not
          a statue of Saturn also: for I should have thought these two statues had brought me debt!
          I should have preferred some representation of Mercury: I might then, I suppose, have made
          a more favourable bargain with Arrianus. You say you meant the table-stand <note n="2"
            anchored="true"> An ornamental leg or stand for table or sideboard (abacus). See picture
            in Rich's Dictionary ofAntiquities.</note> for yourself; well, if you like it, keep it.
          But if you have changed your mind I will, of course, have it. For the money you have laid
          out, indeed, I would rather have purchased a place of call at <placeName
            key="perseus,Tarracina">Tarracina</placeName>, <note n="3" anchored="true">"On the via
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Appia</foreign>", where the canal across the marshes began.

            7.5</bibl>).</note> to prevent my being always a burden on my host. Altogether I
          perceive that the fault is with my freedman, whom I had distinctly commissioned to
          purchase certain definite things, and also with Iunius, whom I think you know, an intimate
          friend of Arrianus. I have constructed some new sitting-rooms in a miniature colonnade on
          my Tusculan property. I want to ornament them with pictures: for if I take pleasure in
          anything of that sort it is in painting. However, if I am to have what you have bought, I
          should like you to inform me where they are, when they are to be fetched, and by what <pb
            n="257"/> kind of conveyance. For if Damasippus doesn't abide by hs decision, I shall
          look for some would-be Damasippus, <note n="1" anchored="true">One who professes to be an
            amateur of art like Damasippus.</note> even at a loss. <milestone unit="para"/>As to
          what you say about the house, as I was going out of town I intrusted the matter to my
          daughter Tullia : <note n="2" anchored="true">As in Letter CVI, <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Tullia</foreign>, not <foreign xml:lang="la">Terentia</foreign>, seems to be in
            Cicero's confidence and presiding in his house. <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Terentia</foreign> must already have been on bad terms with him, and perhaps was
            residing on her own property.</note> for it was at the very hour of my departure that I
          got your letter. I also discussed the matter with your friend Nicias, because he is, as
          you know, intimate with Cassius. On my return, however, before I got your last letter, I
          asked Tullia what she had done. She said that she had approached Licinia <note n="3"
            anchored="true"> Half-sister of Gaius Cassius.</note> (though I think Cassius is not
          very intimate with his sister), and that she at once said that she could not venture, in
          the absence of her husband (Dexius is gone to <placeName key="tgn,1000095"
            >Spain</placeName>), to change houses without his being there and knowing about it. I am
          much gratified that you should value association with me and my domestic life so highly,
          as, in the first place, to take a house which would enable you to live not only near me,
          but absolutely with me, and, in the second place, to be in such a hurry to make this
          change of residence. But, upon my life, I do not yield to you in eagerness for that
          arrangement. So I will try every means in my power. For I see the advantage to myself,
          and, indeed, the advantages to us both. If I succeed in doing anything, I will let you
          know. Mind you also write me word back on everything, and let me know, if you please, when
          I am to expect you. <pb n="258"/>

        </opener>
        <p> If some bodily pain or weakness of health has prevented your coming to the games, I put
          it down to fortune rather than your own wisdom: but if you have made up your mind that
          these things which the rest of the world admires are only worthy of contempt, and, though
          your health would have allowed of it, you yet were unwilling to come, then I rejoice at
          both facts—that you were free from bodily pain, and that you had the sound sense to
          disdain what others causelessly admire. Only I hope that some fruit of your leisure may be
          forthcoming, a leisure, indeed, which you had a splendid opportunity of enjoying to the
          full, seeing that you were left almost alone in your lovely country. For I doubt not that
          in that study of yours, from which you have opened a window into the Stabian waters of the
          bay, and obtained a view of <placeName key="perseus,Misenum">Misenum</placeName>, you have
          spent the morning hours of those days in light reading, while those who left you there
          were watching the ordinary farces <note n="1" anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Communis</foreign>, which is not satisfactory. But neither is the emendation
            proposed, <foreign xml:lang="la">cominus</foreign>. For <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >communis</foreign>, "common," "vulgar," see <bibl n="Cic. Off. 2.45">de Off.
              2.45</bibl>.</note> half asleep. The remaining parts of the day, too, you spent in the
          pleasures which you had yourself arranged to suit your own taste, while we had to endure
          whatever had met with the approval of Spurius Maecius. <note n="2" anchored="true">Whom
            Pompey employed to select the plays to be exhibited in his new theatre.</note> On the
          whole, if you care to know, the games were most splendid, but not to your taste. I judge
          from my own. For, to begin with, as a special honour to the occasion, those actors had
          come back to the stage who, I thought, had left it for their own. Indeed, your favourite,
          my friend Aesop, was in such a state that no one could say a word against his retiring
          from the profession. On beginning to recite the oath his voice failed him at the <pb
            n="259"/> words "If I knowingly deceive." Why should I go on with the story? You know
          all about the rest of the games, which hadn't even that amount of charm which games on a
          moderate scale generally have: for the spectacle was so elaborate as to leave no room for
          cheerful enjoyment, and I think you need feel no regret at having missed it. For what is
          the pleasure of a train of six hundred mules in the "Clytemnestra," or three thousand
          bowls in the "Trojan Horse," or gay-coloured armour of infantry and cavalry in some
          battle? These things roused the admiration of the vulgar; to you they would have brought
          no delight. But if during those days you listened to your reader Protogenes, so long at
          least as he read anything rather than my speeches, surely you had far greater pleasure
          than any one of us. For I don't suppose you wanted to see Greek or Oscan plays, especially
          as you can see Oscan farces in your senate-house over there, while you are so far from
          liking Greeks, that you generally won't even go along the Greek road to your villa. Why,
          again, should I suppose you to care about missing the athletes, since you disdained the
          gladiators? in which even Pompey himself confesses that he lost his trouble and his pains.
          There remain the two wild-beast hunts, lasting five days, magnificent—nobody denies it—and
          yet, what pleasure can it be to a man of refinement, when either a weak man is torn by an
          extremely powerful animal, or a splendid animal is transfixed by a hunting spear? Things
          which, after all, if worth seeing, you have often seen before; nor did I, who was present
          at the games, see anything the least new. The last day was that of the elephants, on which
          there was a great deal of astonishment on the part of the vulgar crowd, but no pleasure
          whatever. Nay, there was even a certain feeling of compassion aroused by it, and a kind of
          belief created that that animal has something in common with mankind. <note n="1"
            anchored="true">Pliny (<bibl n="Plin. Nat. 8.21">Plin. N. H. 8.21</bibl>) says that the
            people were so moved that they loudly cursed Pompey.</note> However, for my part, during
          this day, while the theatrical exhibitions were on, lest by chance you should think me too
          blessed, I almost split my lungs in defending your friend Caninius Gallus. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">L. Caninius Gallus (see p. 210). What he was accused of does not
            appear.</note> But if the people were as indulgent <pb n="260"/> to me as they were to
          Aesop, I would, by heaven, have been glad to abandon my profession and live with you and
          others like us. The fact is I was tired of it before, even when both age and ambition
          stirred me on, and when I could also decline any defence that I didn't like; but now, with
          things in the state that they are, there is no life worth having. For, on the one hand, I
          expect no profit of my labour; and, on the other, I am sometimes forced to defend men who
          have been no friends to me, at the request of those to whom I am under obligations.
          Accordingly, I am on the look-out for every excuse for at last managing my life according
          to my own taste, and I loudly applaud and vehemently approve both you and your retired
          plan of life: and as to your infrequent appearances among us, I am the more resigned to
          that because, were you in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, I should be
          prevented from enjoying the charm of your society, and so would you of mine, if I have
          any, by the overpowering nature of my engagements; from which, if I get any relief—for
          entire release I don't expect—I will give even you, who have been studying nothing else
          for many years, some hints as to what it is to live a life of cultivated enjoyment. Only
          be careful to nurse your weak health and to continue your present care of it, so that you
          may be able to visit my country houses and make excursions with me in my litter. I have
          written you a longer letter than usual, from superabundance, not of leisure, but of
          affection, because, if you remember, you asked me in one of your letters to write you
          something to prevent you feeling sorry at having missed the games. And if I have succeeded
          in that, I am glad: if not, I yet console myself with this reflexion, that in future you
          will both come to the games and come to see me, and will not leave your hope of enjoyment
          dependent on my letters. <note anchored="true">Ido not like to think this letter a mere
            rhetorical exercise, as has been suggested, rather than a true account of Cicero's
            feelings as to the theatre and amphitheatre. He often expresses his want of interest in
            the latter. The vulgar display in the theatre, unlike the severe simplicity of Greek
            art, was an old evil (see <bibl n="TLG543.1 30.14">Polyb. 30.14</bibl>).</note>

              key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>. Cicero himself kept up a correspondence with
            Caesar, and seems to nurse his friendship with him with an almost feverish eagerness,
            which, however, lacks spontaneity. He was engaged this year in composing his treatise on
            the Republic. </p>

        <p> I have no doubt all your friends have written to tell you what zeal I displayed on the
          —— <note n="1" anchored="true">The date has been lost. </note> in the defence, or you
          might call it the promotion, of your official position. For it was neither half-hearted
          nor inconspicuous, nor of a sort that could be passed over in silence. In fact, I
          maintained a controversy against both the consuls and many consulars with a vehemence such
          as I have never shewn in any cause before, and I took upon myself the standing defence of
          all your honours, and paid the duty I owed to our friendship—long in arrears, but
          interrupted by the great complexity of events—to the very utmost. Not, believe me, that
          the will to shew you attention and honour was ever wanting to me; but certain pestilent
          persons—vexed at another's fame—did at times alienate you from me, and sometimes changed
          my feelings towards you. But I have got the opportunity, for which I had rather wished
          than hoped, of shewing you in the very height of your prosperity that I remember our
          mutual kindness and am faithful to our friendship. For I have secured not only that your
          whole family, but that the entire city should know that you have no warmer friend than
          myself. Accordingly, that most <pb n="264"/> noble of women, your wife, as well as your
          two most affectionate, virtuous, and popular sons, place full confidence in my counsel,
          advice, zeal, and public actions; and the senate and Roman people understand that in your
          absence there is nothing upon which you can so absolutely count and depend as upon my
          exertions, care, attention, and influence in all matters which affect your interests. What
          has been done and is being done in the senate I imagine that you are informed in the
          letters from members of your family. For myself, I am very anxious that you should think
          and believe that I did not stumble upon the task of supporting your dignity from some
          sudden whim or by chance, but that from the first moment of my entering on public life I
          have always looked out to see how I might be most closely united to you. And, indeed, from
          that hour I never remember either my respect for you, or your very great kindness and
          liberality to me, to have failed. If certain interruptions of friendship have occurred,
          based rather on suspicion than fact, let them, as groundless and imaginary, be uprooted
          from our entire memory and life. For such is your character, and such I desire mine to be,
          that, fate having brought us face to face with the same condition of public affairs, I
          would fain hope that our union and friendship will turn out to be for the credit of us
          both. Wherefore how much consideration should in your judgment be shewn to me, you will
          yourself decide, and that decision, I hope, will be in accordance with my position in the
          state. I, for my part, promise and guarantee a special and unequaled zeal in every service
          which may tend to your honour and reputation. And even if in this I shall have many
          rivals, I shall yet easily surpass them all in the judgment of the rest of the world as
          well as that of your sons, for both of whom I have a particular affection; but while
          equally well-disposed to Marcus, I am more entirely devoted to Publius for this reason,
          that, though he always did so from boyhood, he is at this particular time treating me with
          the respect and affection of a second father. <milestone unit="para"/>I would have you
          believe that this letter will have the force of a treaty, not of a mere epistle; and that
          I will most sacredly observe and most carefully perform what I hereby promise and
          undertake. The defence of your <pb n="265"/> political position which I have taken up in
          your absence I will abide by, not only for the sake of our friendship, but also for the
          sake of my own character for consistency. Therefore I thought it sufficient at this time
          to tell you this that if there was anything which I understood to be your wish or for your
          advantage or for your honour, I should do it without waiting to be asked; but that if I
          received a hint from yourself or your family on any point, I should take care to convince
          you that no letter of your own or any request from any of your family has been in vain.
          Wherefore I would wish you to write to me on all matters, great, small, or indifferent, as
          to a most cordial friend; and to bid your family so to make use of my activity, advice,
          authority, and influence in all business matters—public or private, forensic or domestic,
          whether your own or those of your friends, guests, or clients—that, as far as such a thing
          is possible, the loss of your presence may be lessened by my labour. </p>

        <p> Your note by its strong language has drawn out this letter. For as to what actually
          occurred on the day of your start, it supplied me with absolutely no subject for writing.
          But as when we are together we are never at a loss for something to say, so ought our
          letters at times to digress into loose chat. Well then, to begin, the liberty of the

          was made by the legates from <placeName key="tgn,7002751">Magnesia</placeName> ad Sipylum,
          they saying that you were the man who alone <pb n="266"/> had resisted the demand of L.

          every day. On the 12th I will not fail you or Pomponius. The poems of Lucretius are as you
          say—with many flashes of genius, yet very technical. <note n="2" anchored="true">Lucretius
            seems to have been now dead, according to Donatus 15 October (<date when="-0055">B.C.

              Natura</foreign> and the mass of technical exposition of philosophy which must have
            repelled the "general reader" at all times. It suggests at once to Cicero to mention
            another poem on a similar subject, the <title>Empedoclea</title> of Sallustius, of which
            and its writer we know nothing. It was not the historian. </note> But when you return,

        <p> I am glad you like my letter: however, I should not even now have had anything to write
          about, if I had not received yours. For on the 12th, when Appius had got together a
          thinly-attended meeting of the senate, the cold was so great that he was compelled by the
          general clamour <note n="3" anchored="true">Retaining <foreign xml:lang="la">populi
              convicio</foreign>, and explaining <foreign xml:lang="la">populi</foreign> to have the
            general meaning of the crowd, including senators and spectators. Cicero uses <foreign
              xml:lang="la">populus</foreign> in this vague way elsewhere. </note> to dismiss us. As
          to the Commagenian, because I have blown that proposition to the winds, Appius makes
          wonderful advances to me both personally and through Pomponius; for he sees that if I
          adopt a similar style of discussion in the other business, February will not bring him
          anything in. And <pb n="267"/> certainly I did chaff him pretty well, and not only
          wrenched from his grasp that petty township of his—situated in the territory of <placeName
            key="tgn,7017540">Zeugma</placeName> on the <placeName key="tgn,1123842"

          <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Zeugma</foreign> I take to mean the "territory of <foreign

              >Euphrates</placeName>, part of the Roman province of <placeName key="tgn,1000140"
              >Syria</placeName>, and close to the frontier of <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Commagene</foreign>. Antiochus had asked that some stronghold should be reckoned as
            his rather than as belonging to the province. </note> —but also raised a loud laugh by
          my satire on the man's purple-edged toga, which he had been granted when Caesar was
          consul. <note n="2" anchored="true">Appius, he insinuates, hoped to make money by granting
            the request of Antiochus, left king of <foreign xml:lang="la">Commagene</foreign> by
            Pompey, for some special privileges, among which was the right of wearing the <foreign
              xml:lang="la">toga praetexta</foreign>, which symbolized some position with a shadow
            of Roman' <foreign xml:lang="la">imperium</foreign>, while at the same time conveying a
            compliment to the Roman suzerainty. See Polyb. xxvi; 30.26; <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 60"
              >Suet. Aug. 60</bibl>. </note> "His wish," said I, "for a renewal of the same honour,
          to save the yearly re-dying of his purple-edged toga, I do not think calls for any decree
          of the house; but you, my lords, who could not endure that the Bostrian <note n="3"

          should wear the <foreign xml:lang="la">toga praetexta</foreign>, will you allow the
          Commagenian to do so?" You see the style of chaff, and the line I took. I spoke at length
          against the petty princeling, with the result that he was utterly laughed out of court.
          Alarmed by this exhibition, as I said, Appius is making up to me For nothing could be
          easier than to explode the rest of his proposals. But I will not go so far as to trip him
          up, lest he appeal to the god of hospitality, and summon all his Greeks—it is they who
          make us friends again. I will do what Theopompus wants. I had forgotten to write to you
          about Caesar: for I perceive what sort of letter you have been expecting. But the fact is,
          he has written word to Balbus that the little packet of letters, in which mine and
          Balbus's were packed, had been so drenched with rain that he was not even aware that there
          was a letter from me. He had, however, made out a few words of Balbus's letter, to which
          he answered as follows: "I perceive that you have written something about Cicero, which I
          have not fully made out: but, as far I could guess, it was of a kind that I thought was
          more to be wished than hoped for." Accordingly, I afterwards sent Caesar a duplicate copy
          of the letter. Don't be put off by that passage <pb n="268"/> about his want of means. In
          answer to it I wrote back saying that he must not stop payment from any reliance on my
          money chest, and descanted playfully on that subject, in familiar terms and yet without
          derogating from my dignity. His good feeling towards us, however, according to all
          accounts, is marked. The letter, indeed, on the point of which you expect to hear, will
          almost coincide with your return : <note n="1" anchored="true">Quintus was expecting, what
            he got, the offer of serving under Caesar as <foreign xml:lang="la">legatus</foreign>.

            news to send you. </note> that there is very great danger that Appius may find his house

            probably be nowhere so evident as in the deserted state of the Consul Appius's house,
            which in all probability will miss its usual bevy of callers. This explanation—put
            forward by Prof. Tyrrell—is not wholly satisfactory, yet it is the best that has been

        <p> Cicero greets Caesar, <foreign xml:lang="la">Imperator</foreign>. Observe how far I have
          convinced myself that you are my second self, not only in matters which concern me
          personally, but even in those which concern my friends. It had been my intention to take
          Gaius Trebatius with me for whatever destination I should be leaving town, in order to
          bring him home again honoured as much as my zeal and favour could make him. But when
          Pompey remained at home longer than I expected, and a certain hesitation on my part (with
          which you are not unacquainted) appeared to hinder, or at any rate to retard, my <pb
            n="269"/> departure, <note n="1" anchored="true">Pompey had two functions at this time:
            he was governor of <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> and <foreign
              xml:lang="la">praefectus annonae</foreign>. The latter office, as being extraordinary,
            might be, perhaps, held with the other without an actual breach of law, but it was
            certainly against the spirit of the constitution. Cicero knows that Pompey's staying in
              <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> and governing his province by <foreign
              xml:lang="la">legati</foreign> will not be acceptable to Caesar, and he alludes to it
            in carefully guarded terms. He had been named his <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >legatus</foreign> when Pompey first undertook the care of the corn-supply, but it
            does not seem as if he ever seriously contemplated going on actual service. </note> I
          presumed upon what I will now explain to you. I begin to wish that Trebatius should look
          to you for what he had hoped from me, and, in fact, I have been no more sparing of my
          promises of goodwill on your part than I had been wont to be of my own. Moreover, an
          extraordinary coincidence has occurred which seems to support my opinion and to guarantee
          your kindness. For just as I was speaking to our friend Balbus <note n="2" anchored="true"
            >L. <foreign xml:lang="la">Cornelius</foreign> Balbus, whom Cicero defended, and who
            acted as Caesar's agent. </note> about this very Trebatius at my house, with more than
          usual earnestness, a letter from you was handed to me, at the end of which you say:
          "Miscinius Rufus, <note n="3" anchored="true">The name of the person jocosely referred to
            by Caesar is uncertain from corruption of the text. Q. <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Lepta</foreign> is Caesar's <foreign xml:lang="la">praefectus fabrum</foreign>.
          </note> whom you recommend to me, I will make king of <placeName key="tgn,1000070"
            >Gaul</placeName>, or, if you choose, put him under the care of Lepta. Send me some one
          else to promote." I and Balbus both lifted our hands in surprise: it came so exactly in
          the nick of time, that it appeared to be less the result of mere chance than something
          providential. I therefore send you Trebatius, and on two grounds, first that it was my
          spontaneous idea to send him, and secondly because you have invited me to do so. I would
          beg you, dear Caesar, to receive him with such a display of kindness as to concentrate on
          his single person all that you can be possibly induced to bestow for my sake upon my
          friends. As for him I guarantee—not in the sense of that hackneyed expression of mine, at
          which, when I used it in writing to you about Milo, you very properly jested, but in good
          Roman language such as sober men use—that no honester, better, or more modest man exists.
          Added to this, he is at the top of his profession as a jurisconsult, possesses an
          unequaled memory, and the most profound learning. For such a man I ask neither a
          tribuneship, prefecture, nor any definite office, I ask only <pb n="270"/> your goodwill
          and liberality: and yet I do not wish to prevent your complimenting him, if it so please
          you, with even these marks of distinction. In fact, I transfer him entirely from my hand,
          so to speak, to yours, which is as sure a pledge of good faith as of victory. Excuse my
          being somewhat importunate, though with a man like you there can hardly be any pretext for
          it—however, I feel that it will be allowed to pass. Be careful of your health and continue
          to love me as ever. </p>

          ready for a joke. As to Pompey, I agree with you, or rather you agree with me. For, as you
          know, I have long been singing the praises of your Caesar. Believe me, he is very close to
          my heart, and I am not going to let him slip from his place. Now for the history of the
          Ides (13th). It was Caelius's tenth day. <note n="2" anchored="true">I.e. the day he had
            to appear for trial, usually fixed by the praetor on the tenth day from the notice of
            prosecution. Caelius had been acquitted in <date when="-0056">B.C. 56</date>, when
            Cicero defended him; this second trial appears to have in some way fallen through. The
            praetor Domitius is said to be Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus, son of Lucius, but he was much
            too young to have been praetor this year. The former trial of Caelius (<date
              when="-0056">B.C. 56</date>) had been before Cn. Domitius Calvinus, hence a difficulty
            about this passage. For the praetor Domitius of this year is not known. Domitius
            Calvinus was praetor <date when="-0056">B.C. 56</date>. </note> Domitius had not
          obtained a full panel. I am afraid that foul ruffian, Servius Pola, will appear for the
          prosecution. For our friend Caelius has a dead set made at him by the Clodian gens. There
          is nothing certain as yet, but I am afraid. On the same day there was a full house for the

              >publicani</foreign> of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> were enraged

              >Egypt</placeName>, thus allowing the pirates so to plunder that they could not
            collect enough dues to recoup them for their bargain to the state (<bibl

            >publicani</foreign> were also denounced by (the consul) Domitius for having escorted
          him on his start on horseback. Our friend Lucius Lamia was somewhat insolent: for on
          Domitius saying, "It is your fault, equites of <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
            >Rome</placeName>, that such things have happened: for you give verdicts laxly," he
          said, "Yes, we give verdicts, but you senators give evidence of character." <note n="2"

          Nothing was done that day: the house stood adjourned at nightfall. On the comitial days
          which follow the Quirinalia (17th February), Appius holds the view that he is not
          prevented by the <foreign xml:lang="la">lex Pupia</foreign> from holding a meeting of the
          senate, and that by the <foreign xml:lang="la">lex Gabinia</foreign> he is even compelled
          to have a meeting for the legations from the 1st of February to the 1st of March. <note

        <p> In all my letters to Caesar or Balbus there is a sort of statutory appendix containing a
          recommendation of you, and not one of the ordinary kind, but accompanied by some signal
          mark of my warm feeling towards you. See only that you get rid of that feeble regret of
          yours for the city and city ways, and carry out with persistence and courage what you had
          in your mind when you set out. We, your friends, shall pardon your going away for that
          purpose as much as <quote>

          </quote> In which latter category you would have certainly been, had I not forced you
          abroad. But I will write more another time. You who learnt to look out for others, look
          out, while in <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>, that you are not yourself

        <p> For my part, I never cease recommending you, but I am eager to know from you how far my
          recommendation is of service. My chief hope is in Balbus, to whom I write about you with
          the greatest earnestness and frequency. It often excites my wonder that I don't hear from
          you as often as from my brother Quintus. In <placeName key="tgn,7008653"
            >Britain</placeName> I am told there is no gold or silver. If that turns out to be the
          case, I advise you to capture a war-chariot and hasten back to us at the earliest
          opportunity. But if—letting <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName> alone—we can
          still obtain what we want, take care to get on intimate terms with Caesar. In that respect
          my brother will be of much use to you, so will Balbus, but most of all, believe me, your
          own modesty and industry. You have an <foreign xml:lang="la">imperator</foreign> of the
          most liberal character, your age is exactly the best one for employment, and your
          recommendation at any rate is quite unique, so that all you have to fear is not doing

        <p> Caesar has written me a very courteous letter saying that he has not yet seen as much of

          have answered his letter and told him how much obliged I shall be if he bestows on you as
          much attention, kindness, and liberality as he can. But I gathered from your letters that
          you are in somewhat too great a hurry: and at the same time I wondered why you despised
          the profits of a military <pb n="276"/> tribuneship, especially as you are exempted from

        <p> On the 2nd of June, the day of my return to <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
            >Rome</placeName>, I received your letter dated <placeName key="perseus,Placentia"
            >Placentia</placeName>: then next day another dated Blandeno, along with a letter from
          Caesar filled full of courteous, earnest, and pleasant expressions. These expressions are
          indeed valuable, or rather <foreign xml:lang="la">most</foreign> valuable, as tending very
          powerfully to secure our reputation and exalted position in the state. But believe me—for
          you know my heart—that what I value most in all this I already possess, that is, first of
          all, your active contribution to our common position; and, secondly, all that warm
          affection of Caesar for me, which I prefer to all the honours which he desires me to
          expect at his hands. His letter too, despatched at the same time as your own—which begins
          by saying what pleasure your arrival and the renewed memory of our old affection had given
          him, and goes on to say that he will take care that, in the midst of my sorrow and regret
          at losing you, I shall have reason to be <pb n="277"/> glad that you are with him of all
          people—gave me extraordinary delight. Wherefore you, of course, are acting in a truly
          brotherly spirit when you exhort me, though, by heaven, I am now indeed forward enough to
          do so, to concentrate all my attentions upon him alone. Yes, I will do so, indeed, with a
          burning zeal: and perhaps I shall manage to accomplish what is frequently the fortune of
          travellers when they make great haste, who, if they have got up later than they intended,
          have, by increasing their speed, arrived at their destination sooner than if they had
          waked up before daylight. Thus I, since I have long overslept myself in cultivating that
          great man, though you, by heaven, often tried to wake me up, will make up for my slowness
          with horses and (as you say he likes my poem) a poet's chariots. Only let me have
            <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName> to paint in colours supplied by
          yourself, but with my own brush. But what am I saying? What prospect of leisure have I,
          especially as I remain at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> in accordance
          with his request? But I will see. For perhaps, as usual, my love for you will overcome all
          difficulties. For my having sent Trebatius to him he even thanks me in very witty and
          polite terms, remarking that there was no one in the whole number of his staff who knew
          how to draw up a recognizance. I have asked him for a tribuneship for M. Curtius—since
          Domitius (the consul) would have thought that he was being laughed at, if my petition had
          been addressed to him, for his daily assertion is that he hasn't the appointment of so
          much as a military tribune: he even jested in the senate at his colleague Appius as having
          gone to visit Caesar, <note n="1" anchored="true">At <foreign xml:lang="la">Luca</foreign>
            in the year <date when="-0056">B.C. 56</date>. </note> that he might get from him at
          least one tribuneship. But my request was for next year, for that was what Curtius wished.
          Whatever line you think I ought to take in politics and in treating my opponents, be sure
          I shall take, and shall be "gentler than any ear-lap." Affairs at <placeName
            key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> stand thus: there is some hope of the elections
          taking place, but it is an uncertain one. There is some latent idea of a dictatorship,

        <p> Well! this time I'll use a good pen, well-mixed ink, and superfine paper. For you say
          you could hardly read my previous letter, for which, my dear brother, the reason was none
          of those which you suppose. For I was not busy, nor agitated, nor out of temper with some
          one: but it is always my way to take the first pen that turns up and use it as if it were
          a good one. But now attend, best and dearest of brothers, to my answer to what you wrote
          in this same short letter in such a very business-like way. On this subject you beg that I
          should write back to you with brotherly candour, without concealment, or reserve, or
          consideration for your feelings—I mean whether you are to hasten home, as we had talked
          of, or to stay where you are, if there is any excuse for doing so, in order to extricate
          yourself from your embarrassments. If, my dear Quintus, it were some small matter on which
          you were asking my opinion, though I should have left it to you to do what you chose, I
          should yet have shewn you what mine was. But on this subject your question amounts to
          this—what sort of year I expect the next to be? Either quite undisturbed as far as we are
          concerned, or at any rate one that will find us in the highest state of preparation for
          defence. This is shewn by the daily throng at my house, my reception in the forum, the
          cheers which greet me in the theatre. My friends feel no anxiety, because they know the
          strength of my position in my hold upon the favour <pb n="279"/> both of Caesar and
          Pompey. These things give me entire confidence. But if some furious outbreak of that
          madman occurs, everything is ready for crushing him. This is my feeling, my deliberate
          opinion: I write to you with entire confidence. I bid you have no doubts, and I do so with
          no intention of pleasing you, but with brotherly frankness. Therefore, while I should wish
          you to come at the time you arranged, for the sake of the pleasure we should have in each
          other's society, yet I prefer the course you yourself think the better one. I, too, think
          these objects of great importance—ample means for yourself and extrication from your load
          of debt. Make up your mind to this, that, free from embarrassments, we should be the
          happiest people alive if we keep well. For men of our habits the deficiency is small, and
          such as can be supplied with the greatest ease, granted only that we keep our health.
            <milestone unit="para"/>There is an enormous recrudescence of bribery. Never was there
          anything equal to it. On the 15th of July the rate of interest rose from four to eight per

          as much as 10,000 sestertia for the vote of the first century. The matter is a burning
          scandal. The candidates for the tribuneship have made a mutual compact—having deposited
          500 sestertia apiece with Cato, they agree to conduct their canvass according to his
          direction, with the understanding that anyone offending against it is to be condemned by
          him. If this election then turns out to be pure, Cato will have been of more avail than

        <p> It is a long time since I heard how you were getting on: for you don't write, nor have I
          written to you for the last two months. As you were not with my brother Quintus I did not
          know where to send a letter, or to whom to give it. I am anxious to know how you are and
          where you mean to winter. For my part, my opinion is that you should do so with Caesar;
          but I have not ventured to write to him owing to his mourning. <note n="1" anchored="true"
            >For the death (in September) of his daughter Iulia, wife of Pompey. </note> I would
          rather you put off your return to us, so long as you come with fuller pockets. There is
          nothing to make you hurry home, especially since "Battara" <note n="2" anchored="true">A

        <p> From what I gather from your letter I have thanked my brother Quintus, and can besides
          at last heartily commend you, because you at length seem to have come to some fixed
          resolution. For I was much put out by your letters in the first months of your absence,
          because at times you seemed to me—pardon the expression—to be light-minded in your longing
          for the city and city life, at others timid in undertaking military work, and often even a
          little inclined to presumption—a thing as unlike your usual self as can be. For, as though
          you had brought a bill of exchange, and not a letter of recommendation to your
          commander-in-chief, you were all in a hurry to get your money and return home ; and it
          never occurred to you that those who went to <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria"
            >Alexandria</placeName>
          <note n="1" anchored="true">To Ptolemy <foreign xml:lang="la">Auletes</foreign>, who had
            agreed to pay large sums to certain persons for supporting his interests in the senate.
          </note> with real bills of exchange have as yet not been able to get a farthing. If I
          looked only to my own interests, I should wish, above all things, to have you with me: for
          I used to find not only pleasure of no ordinary kind in your society, but also much
          advantage from your advice and active assistance. But since from your earliest manhood you
          had devoted yourself to my friendship and protection, I thought it my duty not only to see
          that you came to no harm, but to advance your fortunes and secure your promotion.
          Accordingly, as long as I thought I should be going abroad to a province, I am sure you
          remember the voluntary offers I made you. After that plan had been changed, perceiving
          that I was being treated by Caesar with the highest consideration, and was regarded by him
          with unusual affection, and knowing as I did his incredible liberality and unsurpassed
          loyalty to his word, I recommended you to him in the weightiest and most earnest words at
          my command. <pb n="289"/> And he accepted this recommendation in a gratifying manner, and
          repeatedly indicated to me in writing and shewed you by word and deed, that he had been
          powerfully affected by my recommendation. Having got such a man as your patron, if you
          believe me to have any insight, or to be your well-wisher, do not let him go; and if by
          chance something at times has annoyed you, when from being busy or in difficulties he has
          seemed to you somewhat slow to serve you, hold on and wait for the end, which I guarantee
          will be gratifying and honourable to you. I need not exhort you at any greater length: I
          only give you this warning, that you will never find a better opportunity, if you let this
          slip, either of securing the friendship of a most illustrious and liberal man, or of
          enjoying a wealthier province or a more suitable time of life. "Quintus Cornelius
          concurred," as you say in your law books. I am glad you didn't go to <placeName
            key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>, because you have been saved some hard work, and I
          the necessity of listening to your stories about that expedition. Pray write to me at full
          length as to where you are going to winter, and what your hopes and present position are.

        <p> When you receive a letter from me by the hand of an amanuensis, you may be sure that I
          have not even a little leisure; when by my own—a little. For let me tell you that in
          regard to causes and trials in court, I have never been closer tied, and that, too, at the
          most unhealthy season of the year, and in the most oppressively hot weather. But these
          things, since you so direct me, I must put up with, and must not seem to have come short
          of the ideas and expectations which you and Caesar entertain of me, especially since, even
          if it were somewhat difficult not to do that, I am yet likely from this labour to reap
          great popularity and <pb n="290"/> prestige. Accordingly, as you wish me to do, I take
          great pains not to hurt anyone's feelings, and to secure being liked even by those very
          men who are vexed at my close friendship with Caesar, while by those who are impartial, or
          even inclined to this side, I may be warmly courted and loved. When some very violent
          debates took place in the senate on the subject of bribery for several days, because the
          candidates for the consulship had gone to such lengths as to be past all bearing, I was
          not in the house. I have made up my mind not to attempt any Cure of the political
          situation without powerful protection. The day I write this Drusus has been acquitted on a
          charge of collusion by the <foreign xml:lang="la">tribuni aerarii</foreign>, in the grand
          total by four votes, for the majority of senators and equites were for condemnation. On
          the same day I am to defend Vatinius. That is an easy matter. The <foreign xml:lang="la"
            >comitia</foreign> have been put off to September. Scaurus's trial will take place
          immediately, and I shall not fail to appear for him. I don't like your "Sophoclean
          Banqueters" at all, though I see that you played your part with a good grace. <note n="1"
            anchored="true">In the "Banqueters" (<foreign xml:lang="grc">su/ndeipnoi</foreign>) of

          </note> I come now to a subject which, perhaps, ought to have been my first. How glad I
          was to get your letter from <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>! I was afraid
          of the ocean, afraid of the coast of the island. The other parts of the enterprise I do
          not underrate; but yet they inspire more hope than fear, and it is the suspense rather
          than any positive alarm that renders me uneasy. You, however, I can see, have a splendid
          subject for description, topography, natural features of things and places, manners,
          races, battles, your commander himself—what themes for your pen! I will gladly, as you
          request, assist you in the points you mention, and will send you the verses you ask for,
          that is, "An owl to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>." <note n="2"

          </note> But, look you ! I think you are keeping me in the dark. Tell me, my dear brother,
          what Caesar thinks of my verses. For he wrote before to tell me he had read my first book.
          Of the first part, he said that he had never read anything better even in Greek: the rest,
          up to a particular passage, somewhat "careless " <note n="3" anchored="true">

          needn't be afraid: I shall not admire myself one whit the less. On this subject speak like
          a lover of truth, and with your usual brotherly frankness. </p>

          <dateline>ARPINUM AND ROME, 28 SEPTEMBER</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> After extraordinarily hot weather—I never remember greater heat—I have refreshed myself
          at <placeName key="perseus,Arpinum">Arpinum</placeName>, and enjoyed the extreme
          loveliness of the river during the days of the games, having left my tribesmen under the
          charge of Philotimus. <note n="1" anchored="true">That is, to get them seats at the games.
            See Letter XXVI, p.63. </note> I was at Arcanum on the 10th of September. There I found
          Mescidius and Philoxenus, and saw the water, for which they were making a course not far
          from your villa, running quite nicely, especially considering the extreme drought, and
          they said that they were going to collect it in much greater abundance. Everything is
          right with <placeName key="tgn,7017431">Herus</placeName>. In your Manilian property I
          came across Diphilus outdoing himself in dilatoriness. Still, he had nothing left to
          construct, except baths, and a promenade, and an aviary. I liked that villa very much,
          because its paved colonnade gives it an air of very great dignity. I never appreciated
          this till now that the colonnade <note n="2" anchored="true">The <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >porticus</foreign> is a kind of cloister round the <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >peristylium</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="la">atrium</foreign>. </note> itself has
          been all laid open, and the columns have been polished. It all depends—and this I will
          look to—upon the stuccoing being prettily done. The pavements seemed to be being well
          laid. Certain of the ceilings I did not like, and ordered them to be changed. As to the
          place in which they say that you write word that a small entrance hall is to be
          built—namely, in the colonnade—I liked it better as it is. For I did not think there was
          space sufficient for an entrance hall; nor is it usual to have one, except in those
          buildings which have a larger court; nor could it have bedrooms and apartments of that
          kind attached <pb n="292"/> to it. As it is, from the very beauty of its arched roof, it
          will serve as an admirable summer room. However, if you think differently, write back word
          as soon as possible. In the bath I have moved the hot chamber to the other corner of the
          dressing-room, because it was so placed that its steam-pipe was immediately under the
          bedrooms. A fair-sized bedroom and a lofty winter one I admired very much, for they were
          both spacious and well-situated—on the side of the promenade nearest to the bath. Diphilus
          had placed the columns out of the perpendicular, and not opposite each other. These, of
          course, he shall take down; he will learn some day to use the plumb-line and measure. On
          the whole, I hope Diphilus's work will be completed in a few months: for Caesius, who was
          with me at the time, keeps a very sharp lookout upon him. Thence I started straight along
          the <foreign xml:lang="la">via Vitularia</foreign> to your Fufidianum, the estate which we
          bought for you a few weeks ago at <placeName key="perseus,Arpinum">Arpinum</placeName> for
          100,000 sesterces. I never saw a shadier spot in summer-water springs in many parts of it,
          and abundant into the bargain. In short, Caesius thought that you would easily irrigate
          fifty <foreign xml:lang="la">jugera</foreign> of the meadow land. For my part, I can
          assure you of this, which is more in my line, that you will have a villa marvellously
          pleasant, with the addition of a fish-pond, spouting fountains, a <foreign xml:lang="la"
            >palaestra</foreign>, and a shrubbery. I am told that you wish to keep this Bovillae
          estate. You will determine as you think good. Calvus said that, even if the control of the
          water were taken from you, and the right of drawing it off were established by the vendor,
          and thus an easement were imposed on that property, we could yet maintain the price in
          case we wished to sell. He said that he had agreed with you to do the work at three
          sesterces a foot, and that he had stepped it, and made it three miles. It seemed to me
          more. But I will guarantee that the money could nowhere be better laid out. I had sent for
          Cillo from <placeName key="perseus,Venafrum">Venafrum</placeName>, but on that very day
          four of his fellow servants and apprentices had been crushed by the falling in of a tunnel
          at <placeName key="perseus,Venafrum">Venafrum</placeName>. On the 13th of September I was
          at Laterium. I examined the road, which appeared to me to be so good as to seem almost
          like a high road, except a hundred and fifty paces—for I measured it myself from the
          little bridge at the temple of Furina, in the direction of <placeName
            key="perseus,Satricum">Satricum</placeName>. There they had put <pb n="293"/> down dust,
          not gravel (this shall be changed), and that part of the road is a very steep incline. But
          I understood that it could not be taken in any other direction, particularly as you did
          not wish it to go through the property of Locusta or Varro. The latter alone had made the
          road very well where it skirted his own property. Locusta hadn't touched it but I will
          call on him at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and think I shall be able
          to stir him up, and at the same time I shall ask M. Taurus, who is now at <placeName
            key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and whom I am told promised to allow you to do so,
          about making a watercourse through his property. I much approved of your steward
          Nicephorius, and I asked him what orders you had given about that small building at
          Laterium, about which you spoke to me. He told me in answer that he had himself contracted
          to do the work for sixteen sestertia, but that you had afterwards made many additions to
          the work, but nothing to the price, and that he had therefore given it up. I quite
          approve, by Hercules, of your making the additions you had determined upon; although the
          villa as it stands seems to have the air of a philosopher, meant to rebuke the
          extravagance of other villas. Yet, after all, that addition will be pleasing. I praised
          your landscape gardener: he has so covered everything with ivy, both the foundation-wall
          of the villa and the spaces between the columns of the walk, that, upon my word, those
          Greek statues seemed to be engaged in fancy gardening, and to be shewing off the ivy.
          Finally, nothing can be cooler or more mossy than the dressing-room of the bath. That is
          about all I have to say about country matters. The gardener, indeed, as well as Philotimus
          and Cincius are pressing on the ornamentation of your town house; but I also often look in
          upon it myself, as I can do without difficulty. Wherefore don't be at all anxious about
          that. <milestone unit="para"/>As to your always asking me about your son, of course I
          "excuse you"; but I must ask you to "excuse" me also, for I don't allow that you love him
          more than I do. And oh that he had been with me these last few days at <placeName
            key="perseus,Arpinum">Arpinum</placeName>, as he had himself set his heart on being, and
          as I had no less done! As to Pomponia, please write and say that, when I go out of town
          anywhere, she is to come with me and bring the boy. I'll do wonders with him, if I get him
          to myself when I am at leisure: for at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>
          there is no time to breathe. You <pb n="294"/> know I formerly promised to do so for
          nothing. What do you expect with such a reward as you promise me? I now come to your
          letters which I received in several packets when I was at <placeName key="perseus,Arpinum"
            >Arpinum</placeName>. For I received three from you in one day, and, indeed, as it
          seemed, despatched by you at the same time—one of considerable length, in which your first
          point was that my letter to you was dated earlier than that to Caesar. Oppius at times
          cannot help this: the reason is that, having settled to send letter-carriers, and having
          received a letter from me, he is hindered by something turning up, and obliged to despatch
          them later than he had intended; and I don't take the trouble to have the day altered on a
          letter which I have once handed to him. You write about Caesar's extreme affection for us.
          This affection you must on your part keep warm, and I for mine will endeavour to increase
          it by every means in my power. About Pompey, I am carefully acting, and shall continue to
          act, as you advise. That my permission to you to stay longer is a welcome one, though I
          grieve at your absence and miss you exceedingly, I am yet partly glad. What you can be
          thinking of in sending for such people as Hippodamus and some others, I do not understand.
          There is not one of those suburban estate. However, there is no reason for your fellows
          that won't expect a present from you equal to a classing my friend Trebatius with them. I
          sent him to Caesar, and Caesar has done all I expected. If he has not done quite what
            <emph>he</emph> expected himself, I am not bound to make it up to him, and I in like
          manner free and absolve you from all claims on his part. Your remark, that you are a
          greater favourite with Caesar every day, is a source of undying satisfaction to me. As to
          Balbus, who, as you say, promotes that state of things, he is the apple of my eye. I am
          indeed glad that you and my friend Trebonius like each other. As to what you say about the
          military tribuneship, I, indeed, asked for it definitely for Curtius, and Caesar wrote
          back definitely to say that there was one at Curtius's service, and chided me for my
          modesty in making the request. If I have asked one for anyone else—as I told Oppius to
          write and tell Caesar—I shall not be at all annoyed by a refusal, since those who pester
          me for letters <emph>are</emph> annoyed at a refusal from me. I like Curtius, as I have
          told him, not only <pb n="295"/> because you asked me to do so, but from the character you
          gave of him; for from your letter I have gathered the zeal he shewed for my restoration.
          As for the British expedition, I conclude from your letter that we have no occasion either
          for fear or exultation. As to public affairs, about which you wish Tiro to write to you, I
          have written to you hitherto somewhat more carelessly than usual, because I knew that all
          events, small or great, were reported to Caesar. I have now answered your longest letter.
            <milestone unit="para"/>Now hear what I have to say to your small one. The first point
          is about Clodius's letter to Caesar. In that matter I approve of Caesar's policy, in not
          having given way to your request so far as to write a single word to that Fury. The next
          thing is about the speech of Calventius "Marius." <note n="1" anchored="true">Calventius
            is said to stand for L. Calpurnius <foreign xml:lang="la">Piso</foreign> Caesoninus, the
              <foreign xml:lang="la">consul</foreign> of <date when="-0058">B.C. 58</date>, against
            whom Cicero's speech was spoken in <date when="-0055">B.C. 55</date> in the senate. He
            calls him Calventius from his maternal grandfather, and Marius because—as he had said,
            in the speech, 20—he had himself gone into exile rather than come to open fight with
            him; just as Q. Metellus had done in <date when="-0100">B.C. 100</date>, when,
            declining to take the oath to the agrarian law of Saturninus, rather than fight Marius,
            who had taken the oath, he went into exile. This seems rather a roundabout explanation;
            but no better has been proposed, and, of course, Quintus, who had lately read the
            speech, would be able better to understand the allusion. </note> I am surprised at your
          saying that you think I ought to answer it, particularly as, while no one is likely to
          read that speech, unless I write an answer to it, every schoolboy learns mine against him
          as an exercise. My books, all of which you are expecting, I have begun, but I cannot
          finish them for some days yet. The speeches for Scaurus and Plancius which you clamour for
          I have finished. The poem to Caesar, which I had begun, I have cut short. I will write
          what you ask me for, since your poetic springs are running dry, as soon as I have time.
            <milestone unit="para"/>Now for the third letter. It is very pleasant and welcome news
          to hear from you that Balbus is soon coming to <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
            >Rome</placeName>, and so well accompanied! <note n="2" anchored="true">I.e., with
            money. </note> and will stay with me continuously till the 15th of May. As to your
          exhorting me in the same letter, as in many previous ones, to ambition and labour, I
          shall, of course, do as you say: but when am I to enjoy any real life? <milestone
            unit="para"/>Your fourth letter reached me on the 13th of September, <pb n="296"/> dated
          on the 10th of August from <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>. In it there
          was nothing new except about your <title>Erigona</title>, and if I get that from Oppius I
          will write and tell you what I think of it. I have no doubt I shall like it. <note n="1"
            anchored="true">This tragedy of Quintus's never reached Cicero. It was lost in transit.
            Perhaps no great loss. </note> Oh yes I had almost forgotten to remark as to the man
          who, you say in your letter, had written to Caesar about the applause given to Milo—I am
          not unwilling that Caesar should think that it was as warm as possible. And in point of
          fact it was so, and yet that applause, which is given to him, seems in a certain sense to
          be given to me. <note n="2" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Milo</foreign> was aedile and had just given some splendid games. </note>
          <milestone unit="para"/>I have also received a very old letter, but which was late in
          coming into my hands, in which you remind me about the temple of Tellus and the colonnade
          of Catulus. Both of these matters are being actively carried out. At the temple of Tellus
          I have even got your statue placed. So, again, as to your reminder about a suburban villa
          and gardens, I was never very keen for one, and now my town house has all the charm of
          such a pleasure-ground. On my arrival in Rome on the 18th of September I found the roof on
          your house finished: the part over the sitting-rooms, which you did not wish to have many
          gables, now slopes gracefully towards the roof of the lower colonnade. Our boy, in my
          absence, did not cease working with his rhetoric master. You have no reason for being
          anxious about his education, for you know his ability, and I see his application.
          Everything else I take it upon myself to guarantee, with full consciousness that I am
          bound to make it good. <milestone unit="para"/>As yet there are three parties prosecuting
          Gabinius: first, L. Lentulus, son of the <foreign xml:lang="la">flamen</foreign>, who has
          entered a prosecution for <foreign xml:lang="fr">lèse majesté</foreign>; <note n="3"
            anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Majestas</foreign>. He would be liable to this charge, under a
            law of Sulla's, for having left his province to interfere in Egypt. </note> secondly,
          Tib. Nero, with good names at the back of his indictment; thirdly, C. Memmius the tribune
          in conjunction with L. Capito. He came to the walls of the city on the 19th of September,
          undignified and neglected to the last degree. But in the present state of the law courts I
          do not venture to be confident of anything. As Cato is unwell, he has not yet been
          formally indicted for extortion. Pompey <pb n="297"/> is trying hard to persuade me to be
          reconciled to him, but as yet he has not succeeded at all, nor, if I retain a shred of
          liberty, will he succeed. I am very anxious for a letter from you. You say that you have
          been told that I was a party to the Coalition of the consular candidates—it is a lie. The
          compacts made in that coalition, afterwards made public by Memmius, were of such a nature
          that no loyal man ought to have been a party to them ; <note n="1" anchored="true">See
            p.300. </note> nor at the same time was it possible for me to be a party to a coalition
          from which Messalla was excluded, who is thoroughly satisfied with my conduct in every
          particular, as also, I think, is Memmius. To Domitius himself I have rendered many
          services, which he desired and asked of me. I have put Scaurus under a heavy obligation by
          my defence of him. It is as yet very uncertain both when the elections will be and who
          will be consuls. <milestone unit="para"/>Just as I was folding up this epistle
          letter-carriers arrived from you and Caesar (20th September) after a journey of twenty
          days. How anxious I was! How painfully I was affected by Caesar's most kind letter! <note
            n="2" anchored="true">Apparently referring to the death of his daughter Iulia. </note>
          But the kinder it was, the more sorrow did his loss occasion me. But to turn to your
          letter. To begin with, I reiterate my approval of your staying on, especially as,
          according to your account, you have consulted Caesar on the subject. I wonder that Oppius
          has anything to do with Publius, for I advised against it. Farther on in your letter you
          say that I am going to be made <foreign xml:lang="la">legatus</foreign> to Pompey on the
          13th of September: I have heard nothing about it, and I wrote to Caesar to tell him that
          neither Vibullius nor Oppius had delivered his message to Pompey about my remaining at
          home. Why, I know not. However, it was I who restrained Oppius from doing so, because it
          was Vibullius who should take the leading part in that matter: for with him Caesar had
          communicated personally, with Oppius only by letter. I indeed can have no "second thoughts
          " <note n="3" anchored="true">

              sofw/terai</foreign>. </note> in matters connected with Caesar. He comes next after
          you and our children in my regard, and not much after. I think I act in this with
          deliberate <pb n="298"/> judgment, for I have by this time good cause for it, yet warm
          personal feeling no doubt does influence me also. <milestone unit="para"/>Just as I had
          written these last words—which are by my own hand—your boy came in to dine with me, as
          Pomponia was dining out. He gave me your letter to read, which he had received shortly
          before—a truly Aristophanic mixture of jest and earnest, with which I was greatly charmed.
            <note n="1" anchored="true">Or, "as kindly and critical at once as <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Aristophanes</foreign> (of Byzantium), "as though Quintus had written a
            Caxtonian criticism of his son's style. </note> He gave me also your second letter, in
          which you bid him cling to my side as a mentor. How delighted he was with those letters!
          And so was I. Nothing could be more attractive than that boy, nothing more affectionate to
          me !—This, to explain its being in another handwriting, I dictated to Tiro while at
          dinner. <milestone unit="para"/>Your letter gratified Annalis very much, as shewing that
          you took an active interest in his concerns, and yet assisted him with exceedingly candid
          advice. Publius Servilius the elder, from a letter which he said he had received from
          Caesar, declares himself highly obliged to you for having spoken with the greatest
          kindness and earnestness of his devotion to Caesar. After my return to Rome from Arpinum I
          was told that Hippodamus had started to join you. I cannot say that I was surprised at his
          having acted so discourteously as to start to join you without a letter from me: I only
          say this, that I was annoyed. For I had long resolved, from an expression in your letter,
          that if I had anything I wished conveyed to you with more than usual care, I should give
          it to him : for, in truth, into a letter like this, which I send you in an ordinary way, I
          usually put nothing that, if it fell into certain hands, might be a source of annoyance. I
          reserve myself for Minucius and Salvius and Labeo. Labeo will either be starting late or
          will stay here altogether. Hippodamus did not even ask me whether he could do anything for
          me. T. Penarius sends me a kind letter about you: says that he is exceedingly charmed with
          your literary pursuits, conversation, and above all by your dinners. He was always a
          favourite of mine, and I see a good deal of his brother. Wherefore continue, as you have
          begun, to admit the young man to your intimacy. <pb n="299"/> From the fact of this letter
          having been in hand during many days, owing to the delay of the letter-carriers, I have
          jotted down in it many various things at odd times, as, for instance, the following. Titus
          Anicius has mentioned to me more than once that he would not hesitate to buy a suburban
          property for you, if he found one. In these remarks of his I find two things surprising:
          first, that when you write to him about buying a suburban property, you not only don't
          write to me to that effect, but write even in a contrary sense; and, secondly, that in
          writing to him you totally forget his letters which you shewed me at Tusculum, and as
          totally the rule of Epicharmus, "Notice how he has treated another": <note n="1"
            anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">gnw=qi pw=s a)/llw| ke/xrhtai</foreign>. </note> in fact, that
          you have quite forgotten, as I think, the lesson conveyed by the expression of his face,
          his conversation, and his spirit. But this is your concern. As to a suburban property, be
          sure to let me know your wishes, and at the same time take care that that fellow doesn't
          get you into trouble. What else have I to say? Anything? Yes, there is this: Gabinius
          entered the city by night on the 27th of September, and today, at two o'clock, when he
          ought to have appeared on his trial for <foreign xml:lang="fr">lèse majesté</foreign>, in
          accordance with the edict of C. Alfius, he was all but crushed to the earth by a great and
          unanimous demonstration of the popular hatred. Nothing could exceed his humiliating
          position. However, Piso comes next to him. So I think of introducing a marvellous episode
          into my second book <note n="2" anchored="true">Of his poem "On his own Times." <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Piso</foreign> in Macedonia, where he had been unsuccessful with border
            tribes: Gabinius in going to Egypt to support Ptolemy. He left many of his soldiers
            there. </note> —Apollo declaring in the council of the gods what sort of return that of
          the two commanders was to be, one of whom had lost, and the other sold his army. From
          Britain I have a letter of Caesar's dated the 1st of September, which reached me on the
          27th, satisfactory enough as far as the British expedition is concerned, in which, to
          prevent my wondering at not getting one from you, he tells me that you were not with him
          when he reached the coast. To that letter I made no reply, not even a formal
          congratulation, on account of his mourning. Many, many wishes, dear brother, for your
          health. <pb n="300"/>

          <salute>TO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN GAUL)</salute>
          <dateline>ROME, OCTOBER</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> In the evening of the 10th of October Salvius started on board ship for Ostia with the
          things you wished sent to you from home. On that same day Memmius <note n="4"
            anchored="true">C. Memmius, a tribune of this year, not the same as the C. Memmius
            Gemellus of the last letter. </note> gave Gabinius such a splendid warming in public
          meeting that Calidius couldn't say a word for him. Tomorrow (which is strictly the day
          after tomorrow, for I am writing before daybreak) there is a trial before Cato for the
          selection of his prosecutor between Memmius, Tiberius Nero, and Gaius and Lucius, sons of
          M. Antonius. I think the result will be in favour of Memmius, though a strong case is
          being made out for Nero. In short, he is in a fairly tight fix, unless our friend Pompey,
          to the disgust of gods and men, upsets the whole concern. Let me give you a specimen of
          the fellow's impudence, and extract something amusing from the public disasters. Gabinius
          having given out wherever he came that he was demanding a triumph, and having suddenly,
          the <pb n="304"/> excellent general! invaded the city of his enemies by night, <note n="1"
            anchored="true">Referring to the fact that Gabinius, on his arrival outside Rome,
            without the usual procession of friends which met a returning proconsul, skulked about
            till nightfall, not venturing to enter Rome (the city of his enemies!) in daylight. By
            entering Rome he gave up his <foreign xml:lang="la">imperium</foreign> and could no
            longer ask a triumph. </note> did not venture to enter the senate. Meanwhile, exactly on
          the tenth day, on which he was bound to report the number of the enemy and of his own
          soldiers who had been killed, he slunk into the house, which was very thinly attended.
          When he made as if to go out, he was stopped by the consuls. The <foreign xml:lang="la"
            >publicani</foreign> were introduced. The fellow was assailed on every side, and my
          words stinging him more than all, he lost patience, and in a voice quivering with anger
          called me "Exile." Thereupon—Heavens I never had such a compliment paid me in all my life
          —the senate rose up to a man with a loud shout and made a menacing movement in his
          direction : the <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign> made an equal noise and a
          similar movement. In fine, they all behaved exactly as you would have done. It is the
          leading topic of conversation out of the house. However, I refrain from prosecuting, with
          difficulty, by Hercules ! yet refrain I do : either because I don't want to quarrel with
          Pompey—the impending question of Milo is enough in that direction—or because we have no
          jurors worthy of the name. I fear a fiasco: besides, there is the ill-will of certain
          persons to me, and I am afraid my conducting the prosecution might give him some
          advantage: besides, I do not despair of the thing being done both without me and yet
          partly through my assistance. All the candidates for the consulships have had prosecutions
          for bribery lodged against them: Domitius Calvinus by Memmius (the tribune), Memmius (the
          candidate) by Q. Acutius, an excellent young man and a good lawyer, Messalla by Q.
          Pompeius, Scaurus by Triarius. The affair causes great commotion, because it is a plain
          alternative between shipwreck for the men concerned or for the laws. Pressure is being
          applied to prevent the trials taking place. It looks like an <foreign xml:lang="la"
            >interregnum</foreign> again. The consuls desire to hold the <foreign xml:lang="la"
            >comitia</foreign>: the accused don't wish it, and especially Memmius, because he hopes
          that Caesar's approach <note n="2" anchored="true">Caesar was accustomed to come to North
            Italy (<foreign xml:lang="la">Gallia Cisalpina</foreign>) for the winter to <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Ravenna</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="la">Luca</foreign>, and there he
            could be communicated with and exercise great influence. </note>
          <pb n="305"/> may secure him the consulship. But he is at a very low ebb. Domitius, with
          Messalla as his colleague, I think is a certainty. Scaurus has lost his chance. Appius
          declares that he will relieve Lentulus even without a curiate law, <note n="1"
            anchored="true">That is, he would go to his province of <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Cilicia</foreign> on the strength of his nomination or allotment by the senate. There
            was some doubt as to the question whether such allotment did not give <foreign
              xml:lang="la">imperium</foreign> even without a <foreign xml:lang="la">lex
              curiata</foreign>. Besides, the <foreign xml:lang="la">consul</foreign> had already
              <foreign xml:lang="la">imperium</foreign>, and he might consider it to be
            uninterrupted if he left Rome immediately. However, as there was always an interval
            between the end of the consulship and the quitting Rome <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >paludatus</foreign>, the <foreign xml:lang="la">lex</foreign>
            <foreign xml:lang="la">curiata</foreign> had generally been considered necessary (<bibl
              n="Caes. Civ. 1.6">Caes. B.C. 1.6</bibl>). After <date when="-0052">B.C. 52</date> the
              <foreign xml:lang="la">lex Pompeia</foreign> enacted a five years' interval, when, of
            course, a law would be necessary. </note> and, indeed, he distinguished himself
          amazingly that day (I almost forgot to mention it) in an attack upon Gabinius. He accused
          him of <foreign xml:lang="fr">lèse majesté</foreign>, and gave the names of his witnesses
          without Gabinius answering a word. That is all the public news. At home all is well : your
          house itself is being proceeded with by the contractors with fair expedition. </p>

          <salute>TO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN GAUL)</salute>
          <dateline>ROME (OCTOBER)</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> The writing of an amanuensis must shew you the amount of my engagements. I assure you
          that no day passes without my appearing for the defence of some one. Accordingly, all
          composition or reflexion I reserve for the hour of my walk. So stands my business: matters
          at home, however, are everything I could wish. Our boys are well, diligent in their
          studies, and affectionate to me and each other. The decoration of both of our houses is
          still in hand: but your rural works at Arcanum and Laterium are now completed. For the
          rest, as to the water and the road, I went into the case thoroughly, in a certain letter
          of mine, without Omitting anything. <pb n="306"/> But, in truth, the anxiety which is now
          giving me great uneasiness and pain is that for a period of fifty days I have heard
          nothing from you or from Caesar—nothing has found its way from those parts, either in the
          shape of a letter, or even of a rumour. Moreover, both the sea and land out there make me
          uneasy, and I never cease imagining, as one does when one's affections are deeply
          involved, all that I least desire. Wherefore I do not, indeed, for the present ask you to
          write me an account of yourself and your doings, for that you never omit doing when
          possible, but I wish you to know this—that I have scarcely ever been so anxious for
          anything as at the moment of writing I am for a letter from you. Now for what is going on
          in politics. One day after another for the <foreign xml:lang="la">comitia</foreign> is
          struck out by notices of bad omens, to the great satisfaction of all the loyalists: so
          great is the scandal in which the consuls are involved, owing to the suspicion of their
          having bargained for a bribe from the candidates. The four candidates for the consulship
          are all arraigned : their cases are difficult of defence, but I shall do my best to secure
          the safety of our friend Messalla—and that is inseparable from the acquittal of the
          others. Publius Sulla has accused Gabinius of bribery—his stepson Memmius his cousin
          Caecilius, and his son Sulla backing the indictment. L. Torquatus put in his claim to the
          conduct of the prosecution, and, to everybody's satisfaction, failed to establish it. You
          ask, "What will become of Gabinius?" We shall know in three days' time about the charge of
            <foreign xml:lang="la">lèse majesté</foreign>. In that case he is at a disadvantage from
          the hatred entertained by all classes for him; witnesses against him as damaging as can
          be: accusers in the highest degree inefficient: the panel of jurors of varied character:
          the president a man of weight and decision—Alfius: Pompey active in soliciting the jurors
          on his behalf. What the result will be I don't know; I don't see, however, how he can
          maintain a position in the state. I shew no rancour in promoting his destruction, and
          await the result with the utmost good temper. That is nearly all the news. I will add this
          one item: your boy (who is mine also) is exceedingly devoted to his rhetoric master
          Paeonius, a man, I think, of great experience in his profession, and of very good
          character. But you are aware that my method of instruction aims at a somewhat more <pb
            n="307"/> scholarly and philosophical style. <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">qetikw/teron</foreign>. From <foreign xml:lang="grc"
              >qe/sis</foreign>, a philosophical proposition or thesis. In Paradox. praef. he uses
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">qetika/</foreign> of subjects suited to such theses. </note>
          Accordingly I, for my part, am unwilling that his course of training should be
          interrupted, and the boy himself seems to be more drawn to that declamatory style, and to
          like it better; and as that was the style in which I was myself initiated, let us allow
          him to follow in my path, for I feel sure it will eventually bring him to the same point;
          nevertheless, if I take him with me somewhere in the country, I shall guide him to the
          adoption of my system and practice. For you have held out before me a great reward, which
          it certainly shall not be my fault if I fail to fully obtain. I hope you will write and
          tell me most carefully in what district you are going to pass the winter, and what your
          prospects are. </p>

          <salute>TO HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN GAUL)</salute>
          <dateline>ROME, 24 OCTOBER</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> Gabinius has been acquitted. Nothing could be more absolutely futile than his accuser,
          Lentulus, and the backers of the indictment, or more corrupt than the jury. Yet, after
          all, had it not been for incredible exertions and entreaties on Pompey's part, and even an
          alarming rumour of a dictatorship, he would not have been able to answer even Lentulus;
          for even as it was, with such an accuser and such a jury, he had thirty-two votes out of
          seventy recorded against him. This trial is altogether so scandalous, that he seems
          certain to be convicted in the other suits, especially in that for extortion. But you must
          see that the Republic, the senate, the law courts are mere ciphers, and that not one of us
          has any constitutional position at all. What else should I tell you about the jurors? Two
          men of praetorian rank were on the panel—Domitius Calvinus, who voted for acquittal so
          openly that everybody could see; and Cato, who, as soon as the voting tablets had <pb
            n="308"/> been counted, withdrew from the ring of people, and was the first to tell
          Pompey the news. Some people—for instance, Sallust—say that I ought to have been the
          prosecuting counsel. Was I to have exposed myself to such a jury as this? What would have
          been my position, if he had escaped when I conducted the case? But there were other
          considerations which influenced me. Pompey would have looked upon it as a contest with me,
          not for that man's safety, but for his own position: he would have entered the city; <note
            n="1" anchored="true">Pompey was outside the <foreign xml:lang="la">pomerium</foreign>
              (<foreign xml:lang="la">ad Romam</foreign>) as having <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >imperium</foreign>. </note> it would have become a downright quarrel; I should have
          seemed like a Pacideianus matched with the Samnite Aeserninus <note n="2" anchored="true"
            >Two gladiators, one incomparably superior to the other. </note> —he would, perhaps,
          have bitten off my ear, <note n="3" anchored="true">A proverbial expression, cp. "snapped
            my nose off." </note> and at least he would have become reconciled to Clodius. For my
          part, especially if you do not disapprove of it, I strongly approve my own policy. That
          great man, though his advancement had been promoted by unparalleled exertions on my part,
          and though I owed him nothing, while he owed me all, yet could not endure that I should
          differ from him in politics—to put it mildly—and, when in a less powerful position, shewed
          me what he could do against me when in my zenith. At this time of day, when I don't even
          care to be influential, and the Republic certainly has no power to do anything, while he
          is supreme in everything, was I to enter upon a contest with him? For that is what I
          should have had to have done. I do not think that you hold me bound to have undertaken it.
          "Then, as an alternative," says the grave Sallust, "you should have defended him, and have
          made that concession to Pompey's earnest wish, for he begged you very hard to do so." An
          ingenious friend is Sallust, to give me the alternative of a dangerous quarrel or undying
          infamy! I, however, am quite pleased with the middle course which I have steered; and
          another gratifying circumstance is that, when I had given my evidence with the utmost
          solemnity, in accordance with my honour and oath, the defendant said that, if he retained
          his right to remain in the city, he would repay me, and did not attempt to cross-question
          me. <milestone unit="para"/>As to the verses which you wish me to compose, it is true <pb
            n="309"/> that I am deficient in industry in regard to them, which requires not only
          time, but also a mind free from all anxiety, but I am also wanting in inspiration. For I
          am not altogether without anxiety as to the coming year, though without fear. At the same
          time, and, upon my word, I speak without irony, I consider you a greater master of that
          style of writing than myself. As to filling up your Greek library, effecting interchanges
          of books, and purchasing Latin books, I should be very glad that your wishes should be
          carried out, especially as they would be very useful to me. But I have no one to employ
          for myself in such a business: for such books as are really worth getting are not for
          sale, and purchases cannot be effected except by an agent who is both well-informed and
          active. However, I will give orders to Chrysippus and speak to Tyrannio. I will inquire
          what Scipio has done about the treasury. I will see that what seems to be the right thing
          is done. As to Ascanio, do what you like: I shall not interfere. As to a suburban
          property, I commend your not being in a hurry, but I advise your having one. I write this
          on the 24th of October, the day of the opening of the games, on the point of starting for
          my Tusculan villa, and taking my dear young Cicero with me as though to school (a school
          not for sport, but for learning), since I did not wish to be at any greater distance from
          town, because I purposed supporting Pomptinus's <note n="1" anchored="true">C. Pomptinus,

          <salute>TO P. LENTULUS SPINTHER (IN CILICIA)</salute>
          <dateline>ROME (OCTOBER)</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> M. Cicero desires his warmest regards to P. Lentulus, <foreign xml:lang="la"
            >imperator</foreign>. <note n="1" anchored="true">Cicero gives him this title, by which
            he had been greeted by his soldiers after some victory over the predatory tribes in
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Cilicia</foreign>. This letter is Cicero's most elaborate
            apology for his change of policy in favour of the triumvirs. </note> Your letter was
          very gratifying to me, from which I gathered that you fully appreciated my devotion to
          you: for why use the word kindness, when even the word "devotion" itself, with all its
          solemn and holy associations, seems too weak to express my obligations to you? As for your
          saying that my services to you are gratefully accepted, it is you who in your overflowing
          affection make things, which cannot be omitted without criminal negligence, appear
          deserving of even gratitude. However, my feelings towards you would have been much more
          fully known and conspicuous, if during all this time that we have been separated, we had
          been together, and together at Rome. For precisely in what you declare your intention of
          doing—what no one is more capable of doing, and what I confidently look forward to from
          you—that is to say, in speaking in the senate, and in every department of public life and
          political activity, we should together have been in a very strong position (what my
          feelings and position are in regard to politics I will explain shortly, and will answer
          the questions you ask), and at any rate I should have found in you a supporter, at once
          most warmly attached and endowed with supreme wisdom, while in me you would have found an
          adviser, perhaps not the most unskillful in the world, and at least both faithful and
          devoted to your interests. However, for your own sake, of course, I rejoice, as I am bound
          to do, that you have been greeted with the title of <foreign xml:lang="la"
            >Imperator</foreign>, and are holding your province and victorious army after a
          successful campaign. But certainly, if you had been here, you would have enjoyed to a
          fuller extent and more directly the benefit of the services which <pb n="311"/> I am bound
          to render you. Moreover, in taking vengeance on those whom you know in some cases to be
          your enemies, because you championed the cause of my recall, in others to be jealous of
          the splendid position and renown which that measure brought you, I should have done you
          yeoman's service as your associate. However, that perpetual enemy of his own friends, who,
          in spite of having been honoured with the highest compliments on your part, has selected
          you of all people for the object of his impotent and enfeebled violence, has saved me the
          trouble by punishing himself. For he has made attempts, the disclosure of which has left
          him without a shred, not only of political position, but even of freedom of action. <note
            n="1" anchored="true">Cicero has been variously supposed to refer to C. <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Cato</foreign> (who proposed the recall of Lentulus), to Appius the
            Consul, and finally to Pompey. The last seems on the whole most likely, though the
            explanation is not without difficulties. In that case the "disclosure" will refer to
            Pompey's intrigues as to the restoration of Ptolemy <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Auletes</foreign>, of which he wished to have the management. </note> And though I
          should have preferred that you should have gained your experience in my case alone, rather
          than in your own also, yet in the midst of my regret I am glad that you have learnt what
          the fidelity of mankind is worth, at no great cost to yourself, which I learnt at the
          price of excessive pain. And I think that I have now an opportunity presented me, while
          answering the questions you have addressed to me, of also explaining my entire position
          and view. You say in your letter that you have been informed that I have become reconciled
          to Caesar and Appius, and you add that you have no fault to find with that. But you
          express a wish to know what induced me to defend and compliment Vatinius. In order to make
          my explanation plainer I must go a little farther back in the statement of my policy and
          its grounds. Well, Lentulus ! At first—after the success of your efforts for my recall—I
          looked upon myself as having been restored not alone to my friends, but to the Republic
          also; and seeing that I owed you an affection almost surpassing belief, and every kind of
          service, however great and rare, that could be bestowed on your person, I thought that to
          the Republic, which had much assisted you in restoring me, I at least was bound to
          entertain the feeling which I had in old times <pb n="312"/> shewed merely from the duty
          incumbent on all citizens alike, and not as an obligation incurred by some special
          kindness to myself. That these were my sentiments I declared to the senate when you were
          consul, and you had yourself a full view of them in our conversations and discussions. Yet
          from the very first my feelings were hurt by many circumstances, when, on your mooting the
          question of the full restoration of my position, I detected the covert hatred of some and
          the equivocal attachment of others. For you received no support from them either in regard
          to my monuments, or the illegal violence by which, in common with my brother, I had been
          driven from my house; nor, by heaven, did they shew the goodwill which I had expected in
          regard to those matters which, though necessary to me owing to the shipwreck of my
          fortune, were yet regarded by me as least valuable—I mean as to indemnifying me for my
          losses by decree of the senate. And though I saw all this—for it was not difficult to
          see—yet their present conduct did not affect me with so much bitterness as what they had
          done for me did with gratitude. And therefore, though according to your own assertion and
          testimony I was under very great obligation to Pompey, and though I loved him not only for
          his kindness, but also from my own feelings, and, so to speak, from my unbroken admiration
          of him, nevertheless, without taking any account of his wishes, I abode by all my old
          opinions in politics. <note n="1" anchored="true">I.e., to keep in with the <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Optimates</foreign>, who were at this time suspicious of; and hostile to
            Pompey. </note> With Pompey sitting in court, <note n="2" anchored="true">At the trial
            of Sestius. </note> upon his having entered the city to give evidence in favour of
          Sestius, and when the witness Vatinius had asserted that, moved by the good fortune and
          success of Caesar, I had begun to be his friend, I said that I preferred the fortune of
          Bibulus, which he thought a humiliation, to the triumphs and victories of everybody else;
          and I said during the examination of the same witness, in another part of my speech, that
          the same men had prevented Bibulus from leaving his house as had forced me from mine: my
          whole cross-examination, indeed, was nothing but a denunciation of his tribuneship; <note
            n="3" anchored="true">
            <date when="-0059">B.C. 59</date>, when Vatinius proposed the law for Caesar's five
            years' rule in Gaul. </note>
          <pb n="313"/> and in it I spoke throughout with the greatest freedom and spirit about
          violence, neglect of omens, grants of royal titles. Nor, indeed, in the support of this
          view is it only of late that I have spoken. I have done so consistently on several
          occasions in the senate. Nay, even in the consulship of Marcellinus and Philippus, <note
            n="1" anchored="true">
            <date when="-0056">B.C. 56</date>. </note> on the 5th of April the senate voted on my
          motion that the question of the Campanian land should be referred to a full meeting of the
          senate on the 15th of May. Could I more decidedly invade the stronghold of his policy, or
          shew more clearly that I forgot my own present interests, and remembered my former
          political career? On my delivery of this proposal a great impression was made on the minds
          not only of those who were bound to have been impressed, but also of those of whom I had
          never expected it. For, after this decree had passed in accordance with my motion, Pompey,
          without shewing the least sign of being offended with me, started for Sardinia and Africa,
          and in the course of that journey visited Caesar at Luca. There Caesar complained a great
          deal about my motion, for he had already seen Crassus at Ravenna also, and had been
          irritated by him against me. It was well known that Pompey was much vexed at this, as I
          was told by others, but learnt most definitely from my brother. For when Pompey met him in
          Sardinia, a few days after leaving Luca, he said: "You are the very man I want to see;
          nothing could have happened more conveniently. Unless you speak very strongly to your
          brother Marcus, you will have to pay up what you guaranteed on his behalf." <note n="2"
            anchored="true">Pompey is only speaking metaphorically. Quintus had guaranteed Cicero's
            support. Pompey half-jestingly speaks as though he had gone bail for him for a <foreign
              xml:lang="la">sum</foreign> of money. </note> I need not go on. He grumbled a great
          deal: mentioned his own services to me: recalled what he had again and again said to my
          brother himself about the "acts" of Caesar, and what my brother had undertaken in regard
          to me; and called my brother himself to witness that what he had done in regard to my
          recall he had done with the consent of Caesar: and asked him to commend to me the latter's
          policy and claims, that I should not attack, even if I would not or could not support
          them. My brother having conveyed these remarks <pb n="314"/> to me, and Pompey having,
          nevertheless, sent Vibullius to me with a message, begging me not to Commit myself on the
          question of the Campanian land till his return, I reconsidered my position and begged the
          state itself, as it were, to allow me, who had suffered and done so much for it, to fulfil
          the duty which gratitude to my benefactors and the pledge which my brother had given
          demanded, and to suffer one whom it had ever regarded as an honest citizen to shew himself
          an honest man. Moreover, in regard to all those motions and speeches of mine which
          appeared to be giving offence to Pompey, the remarks of a particular set of men, whose
          names you must surely guess, kept on being reported to me; who, while in public affairs
          they were really in sympathy with my policy, and had always been so, yet said that they
          were glad that Pompey was dissatisfied with me, and that Caesar would be very greatly
          exasperated against me. This in itself was vexatious to me: but much more so was the fact
          that they used, before my very eyes, so to embrace, fondle, make much of, and kiss my
          enemy—mine do I say? rather the enemy of the laws, of the law courts, of peace, of his
          country, of all loyal men—that they did not indeed rouse my bile, for I have utterly lost
          all that, but imagined they did. In these circumstances, having, as far as is possible for
          human prudence, thoroughly examined my whole position, and having balanced the items of
          the account, I arrived at a final result of all my reflexions, which, as well as I can, I
          will now briefly put before you. <milestone unit="para"/>If I had seen the Republic in the
          hands of bad or profligate citizens, as we know happened during the supremacy of Cinna,
          and on some other occasions, I should not under the pressure, I don't say of rewards,
          which are the last things to influence me, but even of danger, by which, after all, the
          bravest men are moved, have attached myself to their party, not even if their services to
          me had been of the very highest kind. As it is, seeing that the leading statesman in the
          Republic was Pompey, a man who had gained this power and renown by the most eminent
          services to the state and the most glorious achievements, and one of whose position I had
          been a supporter from my youth up, and in my praetorship and consulship an active promoter
          also, and seeing that this same statesman had assisted me, in his own person by the weight
            <pb n="315"/> of his influence and the expression of his opinion, and, in conjunction
          with you, by his counsels and zeal, and that he regarded my enemy as his own supreme enemy
          in the state—I did not think that I need fear the reproach of inconsistency, if in some of
          my senatorial votes I somewhat changed my standpoint, and contributed my zeal to the
          promotion of the dignity of a most distinguished man, and one to whom I am under the
          highest obligations. In this sentiment I had necessarily to include Caesar, as you see,
          for their policy and position were inseparably united. Here I was greatly influenced by
          two things—the old friendship which you know that I and my brother Quintus have had with
          Caesar, and his own kindness and liberality, of which we have recently had clear and
          unmistakable evidence both by his letters and his personal attentions. I was also strongly
          affected by the Republic itself, which appeared to me to demand, especially considering
          Caesar's brilliant successes, that there should be no quarrel maintained with these men,
          and indeed to forbid it in the strongest manner possible. Moreover, while entertaining
          these feelings, I was above all shaken by the pledge which Pompey had given for me to
          Caesar, and my brother to Pompey. Besides, I was forced to take into consideration the
          state maxim so divinely expressed by our master Plato—"Such as are the chief men in a
          republic, such are ever wont to be the other citizens." I called to mind that in my
          consulship, from the very 1st of January, such a foundation was laid of encouragement for
          the senate, that no one ought to have been surprised that on the 5th of December there was
          so much spirit and such commanding influence in that house. I also remember that when I
          became a private citizen up to the consulship of Caesar and Bibulus, when the opinions
          expressed by me had great weight in the senate, the feeling among all the loyalists was
          invariable. Afterwards, while you were holding the province of hither Spain with <foreign
            xml:lang="la">Imperium</foreign> and the Republic had no genuine consuls, but mere
          hucksters of provinces, mere slaves and agents of sedition, an accident threw my head as
          an apple of discord into the midst of contending factions and civil broils. And in that
          hour of danger, though a unanimity was displayed on the part of the senate that was
          surprising, on the part of all Italy surpassing <pb n="316"/> belief, and of all the
          loyalists unparalleled, in standing forth in my defence, I will not say what happened—for
          the blame attaches to many, and is of various shades of turpitude—I will only say briefly
          that it was not the rank and file, but the leaders, that played me false. And in this
          matter, though some blame does attach to those who failed to defend me, no less attaches
          to those who abandoned me: and if those who were frightened deserve reproach, if there are
          such, still more are those to be blamed who pretended to be frightened. At any rate, my
          policy is justly to be praised for refusing to allow my fellow citizens (preserved by me
          and ardently desiring to preserve me) to be exposed while bereft of leaders to armed
          slaves, and for preferring that it should be made manifest how much force there might be
          in the unanimity of the loyalists, if they had been permitted to champion my cause before
          I had fallen, when after that fall they had proved strong enough to raise me up again. And
          the real feelings of these men you not only had the penetration to see, when bringing
          forward my case, but the power to encourage and keep alive. In promoting which measure—I
          will not merely not deny, but shall always remember also and gladly proclaim it—you found
          certain men of the highest rank more courageous in securing my restoration than they had
          been in preserving me from my fall: and, if they had chosen to maintain that frame of
          mind, they would have recovered their own commanding position along with my salvation. For
          when the spirit of the loyalists had been renewed by your consulship, and they bad been
          roused from their dismay by the extreme firmness and rectitude of your official conduct;
          when, above all, Pompey's support had been secured; and when Caesar, too, with all the
          prestige of his brilliant achievements, after being honoured with unique and unprecedented
          marks of distinction and compliments by the senate, was now supporting the dignity of the
          house, there could have been no opportunity for a disloyal citizen of outraging the
          Republic. <milestone unit="para"/>But now notice, I beg, what actually ensued. First of
          all, that intruder upon the women's rites, who had shewn no more respect for the Bona Dea
          than for his three sisters, secured immunity by the votes of those men who, when a tribune
          wished by a legal action to exact penalties from a <pb n="317"/> seditious citizen by the
          agency of the loyalists, deprived the Republic of what would have been hereafter a most
          splendid precedent for the punishment of sedition. And these same persons, in the case of
          the monument, which was not mine, indeed—for it was not erected from the proceeds of
          spoils won by me, and I had nothing to do with it beyond giving out the contract for its
          construction—well, they allowed this monument of the senate's to have branded upon it the
          name of a public enemy, and an inscription written in blood. That those men wished my
          safety rouses my liveliest gratitude, but I could have wished that they had not chosen to
          take my bare safety into consideration, like doctors, but, like trainers, my strength and
          complexion also! As it is, just as Apelles perfected the head and bust of his Venus with
          the most elaborate art, but left the rest of her body in the rough, so certain persons
          only took pains with my head, and left the rest of my body unfinished and unworked. Yet in
          this matter I have falsified the expectation, not only of the jealous, but also of the
          downright hostile, who formerly conceived a wrong opinion from the case of Quintus
          Metellus, son of Lucius—the most energetic and gallant man in the world, and in my opinion
          of surpassing courage and firmness—who, people say, was much cast down and dispirited
          after his return from exile. <note n="1" anchored="true">Q. Caecilius Metellus Numidius,
            expelled from the senate and banished B.C. ion for refusing the oath to the agrarian law
            of Saturninus, but recalled in the following year. Cicero is fond of comparing himself
            with him. See Letter CXLVII. </note> Now, in the first place, we are asked to believe
          that a man who accepted exile with entire willingness and remarkable cheerfulness, and
          never took any pains at all to get recalled, was crushed in spirit about an affair in
          which he had shewn more firmness and constancy than anyone else, even than the pre-eminent
          M. Scaurus himself! <note n="2" anchored="true">M. Aemilius Scaurus, <foreign

          again, the account they had received, or rather the conjectures they were indulging in
          about him, they now transferred to me, imagining that I should be more than usually broken
          in spirit: whereas, in fact, the Republic was inspiring me with even greater courage than
          I had ever had <pb n="318"/> before, by making it plain that I was the one citizen it
          could not do without; and by the fact that while a bill proposed by only one tribune had
          recalled Metellus, the whole state had joined as one man in recalling me—the senate
          leading the way, the whole of Italy following after, eight of the tribunes publishing the
          bill, a consul putting the question at the centuriate assembly, all orders and individuals
          pressing it on, in fact, with all the forces at its command. Nor is it the case that I
          afterwards made any pretension, or am making any at this day, which can justly offend
          anyone, even the most malevolent: my only effort is that I may not fail either my friends
          or those more remotely connected with me in either active service, or counsel, or personal
          exertion. This course of life perhaps offends those who fix their eyes on the glitter and
          show of my professional position, but are unable to appreciate its anxieties and
          laboriousness. <milestone unit="para"/>Again, they make no concealment of their
          dissatisfaction on the ground that in the speeches which I make in the senate in praise of
          Caesar I am departing from my old policy. But while giving explanations on the points
          which I put before you a short time ago, I will not keep till the last the following,
          which I have already touched upon. You will not find, my dear Lentulus, the sentiments of
          the loyalists the same as you left them—strengthened by my consulship, suffering relapse
          at intervals afterwards, crushed down before your consulship, revived by you: they have
          now been abandoned by those whose duty it was to have maintained them: and this fact they,
          who in the old state of things as it existed in our day used to be called <foreign
            xml:lang="la">Optimates</foreign>, not only declare by look and expression of
          countenance, by which a false pretence is easiest supported, but have proved again and
          again by their actual sympathies and votes. Accordingly, the entire view and aim of wise
          citizens, such as I wish both to be and to be reckoned, must needs have undergone a
          change. For that is the maxim of that same great Plato, whom I emphatically regard as my
          master: "Maintain a political controversy only so far as you can convince your fellow
          citizens of its justice: never offer violence to parent or fatherland." <note n="1"
            anchored="true">Plato, Crit. xii. </note> He, it is true, alleges this as his motive for
          having abstained from politics, because, <pb n="319"/> having found the Athenian people
          all but in its dotage, and seeing that it could not be ruled by persuasion, or by anything
          short of compulsion, while he doubted the possibility of persuasion, he looked upon
          compulsion as criminal. My position was different in this: as the people was not in its
          dotage, nor the question of engaging in politics still an open one for me, I was bound
          hand and foot. Yet I rejoiced that I was permitted in one and the same cause to support a
          policy at once advantageous to myself and acceptable to every loyalist. An additional
          motive was Caesar's memorable and almost superhuman kindness to myself and my brother, who
          thus would have deserved my support whatever he undertook; while as it is, considering his
          great success and his brilliant victories, he would seem, even if he had not behaved to me
          as he has, to claim a panegyric from me. For I would have you believe that, putting you
          aside, who were the authors of my recall, there is no one by whose good offices I would
          not only confess, but would even rejoice, to have been so much bound. <milestone
            unit="para"/>Having explained this matter to you, the questions you ask about Vatinius
          and Crassus are easy to answer. For, since you remark about Appius, as about Caesar, "that
          you have no fault to find," I can only say that I am glad you approve my policy. But as to
          Vatinius, in the first place there had been in the interval a reconciliation effected
          through Pompey, immediately after his election to the praetorship, though I had, it is
          true, impugned his canditature in some very strong speeches in the senate, and yet not so
          much for the sake of attacking him as of defending and complimenting Cato. Again, later
          on, there followed a very pressing request from Caesar that I should undertake his
          defence. But my reason for testifying to his character I beg you will not ask, either in
          the case of this defendant or of others, lest I retaliate by asking you the same question
          when you come home: though I can do so even before you return : for remember for whom you
          sent a certificate of character from the ends of the earth. However, don't be afraid, for
          those same persons are praised by myself, and will continue to be so. Yet, after all,
          there was also the motive spurring me on to undertake his defence, of which, during the
          trial, when I appeared for him, I remarked that I was <pb n="320"/> doing just what the
          parasite in the <title>Eunuchus</title> advised the captain to do: <quote>
            <l>As oft as she names Phaedria, you retort</l>
            <l>With Pamphila. If ever she suggest,</l>
            <l>'Do let us have in Phaedria to our revel:'</l>
            <l>Quoth you, 'And let us call on Pamphila</l>
            <l>To sing a song.' If she shall praise <emph>his</emph> looks,</l>
            <l>Do you praise <emph>hers</emph> to match them: and, in fine,</l>
            <l>Give tit for tat, that you may sting her soul.</l>
          </quote> So I asked the jurors, since certain men of high rank, who had also done me very
          great favours, were much enamoured of my enemy, and often under my very eyes in the senate
          now took him aside in grave consultation, now embraced him familiarly and cheerfully—since
          these men had their Publius, to grant me another Publius, in whose person I might repay a
          slight attack by a moderate retort. <note n="1" anchored="true">Like the character in the
            play (<bibl n="Ter. Eu. 3.1">Terence, Eun. 440</bibl>), if the nobles annoyed Cicero by
            their attentions to P. Clodius, he would annoy them by his compliments to Publius
            Vatinius. </note> And, indeed, I am often as good as my word, with the applause of gods
          and men. So much for Vatinius. Now about Crassus. I thought I had done much to secure his
          gratitude in having, for the sake of the general harmony, wiped out by a kind of voluntary
          act of oblivion all his very serious injuries, when he suddenly undertook the defence of
          Gabinius, whom only a few days before he had attacked with the greatest bitterness.
          Nevertheless, I should have borne that, if he had done so without casting any offensive
          reflexions on me. But on his attacking me, though I was only arguing and not inveighing
          against him, I fired up not only, I think, with the passion of the moment—for that perhaps
          would not have been so hot—but the smothered wrath at his many wrongs to me, of which I
          thought I had wholly got rid, having, unconsciously to myself, lingered in my soul, it
          suddenly shewed itself in full force. And it was at this precise time that certain persons
          (the same whom I frequently indicate by a sign or hint), while declaring that they had
          much enjoyed my outspoken style, and had never before fully realized that I was restored
          to the Republic in all my old character, and when my conduct of that controversy had
          gained me much credit outside the house also, began saying that they were glad both that
          he was now <pb n="321"/> my enemy, and that those who were involved with him would never
          be my friends. So when their ill-natured remarks were reported to me by men of most
          respectable character, and when Pompey pressed me as he had never done before to be
          reconciled to Crassus, and Caesar wrote to say that he was exceedingly grieved at that
          quarrel, I took into consideration not only my circumstances, but my natural inclination :
          and Crassus, that our reconciliation might, as it were, be attested to the Roman people,
          started for his province, it might almost be said, from my hearth. For he himself named a
          day and dined with me in the suburban villa of my son-in-law Crassipes. On this account,
          as you say that you have been told, I supported his cause in the senate, which I had
          undertaken on Pompey's strong recommendation, as I was bound in honour to do. <milestone
            unit="para"/>I have now told you with what motives I have supported each measure and
          cause, and what my position is in politics as far as I take any part in them: and I would
          wish you to make sure of this—that I should have entertained the same sentiments, if I had
          been still perfectly uncommitted and free to choose. For I should not have thought it
          right to fight against such overwhelming power, nor to destroy the supremacy of the most
          distinguished citizens, even if it had been possible; nor, again, should I have thought
          myself bound to abide by the same view, when circumstances were changed and the feelings
          of the loyalists altered, but rather to bow to circumstances. For the persistence in the
          same view has never been regarded as a merit in men eminent for their guidance of the helm
          of state ; but as in steering a ship one secret of the art is to run before the storm,
          even if you cannot make the harbour; yet, when you can do so by tacking about, it is folly
          to keep to the course you have begun rather than by changing it to arrive all the same at
          the destination you desire: so while we all ought in the administration of the state to
          keep always in view the object I have very frequently mentioned, peace combined with
          dignity, we are not bound always to use the same language, but to fix our eyes on the same
          object. Wherefore, as I laid down a little while ago, if I had had as free a hand as
          possible in everything, I should yet have been no other than I now am in politics. When,
          moreover, I am at once <pb n="322"/> induced to adopt these sentiments by the kindness of
          certain persons, and driven to do so by the injuries of others, I am quite content to
          think and speak about public affairs as I conceive best conduces to the interests both of
          myself and of the Republic. Moreover, I make this declaration the more openly and
          frequently, both because my brother Quintus is Caesar's legate, and because no word of
          mine, however trivial, to say nothing of any act, in support of Caesar has ever
          transpired, which he has not received with such marked gratitude, as to make me look upon
          myself as closely bound to him. Accordingly, I have the advantage of his popularity, which
          you know to be very great, and his material resources, which you know to be immense, as
          though they were my own. Nor do I think that I could in any other way have frustrated the
          plots of unprincipled persons against me, unless I had now combined with those
          protections, which I have always possessed, the goodwill also of the men in power. I
          should, to the best of my belief, have followed this same line of policy even if I had had
          you here. For I well know the reasonableness and soberness of your judgment: I know your
          mind, while warmly attached to me, to be without a tinge of malevolence to others, but on
          the contrary as open and candid as it is great and lofty. I have seen certain persons
          conduct themselves towards you as you might have seen the same persons conduct themselves
          towards me. The same things that have annoyed me would certainly have annoyed you. But
          whenever I shall have the enjoyment of your presence, you will be the wise critic of all
          my plans: you who took thought for my safety will also do so for my dignity. Me, indeed,
          you will have as the partner and associate in all your actions, sentiments, wishes—in
          fact, in everything; nor shall I ever in all my life have any purpose so steadfastly
          before me, as that you should rejoice more and more warmly every day that you did me such
          eminent service. <milestone unit="para"/>As to your request that I would send you any
          books I have written since your departure, there are some speeches, which I will give
          Menocritus, not so very many, so don't be afraid! I have also written—for I am now rather
          withdrawing from oratory and returning to the gentler Muses, which now give me greater
          delight than any others, as they have <pb n="323"/> done since my earliest youth—well,
          then, I have written in the Aristotelian style, at least that was my aim, three books in
          the form of a discussion in dialogue <title>On the Orator</title>, which, I think, will be
          of some service to your Lentulus. For they differ a good deal from the current maxims, and
          embrace a discussion on the whole oratorical theory of the ancients, both that of
          Aristotle and Isocrates. I have also written in verse three books <title>On my own
            Times</title>, which I should have sent you some time ago, if I had thought they ought
          to be published—for they are witnesses, and will be eternal witnesses, of your services to
          me and of my affection—but I refrained because I was afraid, not of those who might think
          themselves attacked, for I have been very sparing and gentle in that respect, but of my
          benefactors, of whom it were an endless task to mention the whole list. Nevertheless, the
          books, such as they are, if I find anyone to whom I can safely commit them, I will take
          care to have conveyed to you: and as far as that part of my life and conduct is concerned,
          I submit it entirely to your judgment. All that I shall succeed in accomplishing in
          literature or in learning—my old favourite relaxations—I shall with the utmost
          cheerfulness place before the bar of your criticism, for you have always had a fondness
          for such things. As to what you say in your letter about your domestic affairs, and all
          you charge me to do, I am so attentive to them that I don't like being reminded, can
          scarcely bear, indeed, to be asked without a very painful feeling. As to your saying, in
          regard to Quintus's business, that you could not do anything last summer, because you were
          prevented by illness from crossing to Cilicia, but that you will now do everything in your
          power to settle it, I may tell you that the fact of the matter is that, if he can annex
          this property, my brother thinks that he will owe to you the consolidation of this
          ancestral estate. I should like you to write about all your affairs, and about the studies
          and training of your son Lentulus (whom I regard as mine also) as confidentially and as
          frequently as possible, and to believe that there never has been anyone either dearer or
          more congenial to another than you are to me, and that I will not only make you feel that
          to be the case, but will make all the world and posterity itself to the latest generation
          aware of it. <pb n="324"/>
          <milestone unit="para"/>Appius used some time back to repeat in conversation, and
          afterwards said openly, even in the senate, that if he were allowed to carry a law in the
            <foreign xml:lang="la">comitia curiata</foreign>, he would draw lots with his colleague
          for their provinces; but if no curiatian law were passed, he would make an arrangement
          with his colleague and succeed you: that a curiatian law was a proper thing for a consul,
          but was not a necessity: that since he was in possession of a province by a decree of the
          senate, he should have <foreign xml:lang="la">imperium</foreign> in virtue of the
          Cornelian law until such time as he entered the city. I don't know what your several
          connexions write to you on the subject: I understand that opinion varies. There are some
          who think that you can legally refuse to quit your province, because your successor is
          named without a curiatian law: some also hold that, even if you do quit it, you may leave
          some one behind you to conduct its government. For myself, I do not feel so certain about
          the point of law—although there is not much doubt even about that—as I do of this, that it
          is for your greatest honour, dignity, and independence, which I know you always value
          above everything, to hand over your province to a successor without any delay, especially
          as you cannot thwart his greediness without rousing suspicion of your own. I regard my
          duty as twofold—to let you know what I think, and to defend what you have done. <milestone
            unit="para"/>P.S.—I had written the above when I received your letter about the <foreign
            xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign>to whom I could not but admire the justice of your
          conduct. I could have wished that you had been able by some lucky chance to avoid running
          counter to the interests and wishes of that order, whose honour you have always promoted.
          For my part, I shall not cease to defend your decrees: but you know the ways of that class
          of men; you are aware how bitterly hostile they were to the famous Q. Scaevola himself.
          However, I advise you to reconcile that order to yourself, or at least soften its
          feelings, if you can by any means do so. Though difficult, I think it is, nevertheless,
          not beyond the reach of your sagacity. <pb n="325"/>

        <p> You ask me what I have done about the books which I begun to write when in my Cuman
          villa: I have not been idle and am not being idle now; but I have frequently changed the
          whole plan and arrangement of the work. I had already completed two books, in which I
          represented a conversation taking place on the Novendialia held in the consulship of
          Tuditanus and Aquilius, <note n="1" anchored="true">

            an instance (in <date when="-0202">B.C. 202</date>), see Livy, 30, 38. The book
            referred to is that "On the Republic." </note> between Africanus, shortly before his
          death, and Laelius, Philus, Manilius, P. Rutilius, Q. Tubero, and Laelius's sons-in-law,
          Fannius and Scaevola; a conversation which was extended to nine days and the same number
          of books "On the best Constitution of the State" and "On the best Citizen." The work was
          excellently composed, and the rank of the speakers added considerable weight to the style.
          But when these books were read to me in the presence of Sallustius at Tusculum, it was
          suggested to me by him that a discourse on such subjects would come with much greater
          force if I were myself the speaker on the Republic, especially as I was a no mere
          Heraclides Ponticus, <note n="2" anchored="true">I.e., a mere theorist like <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Heraclides</foreign> Ponticus, a pupil of Plato's, whose work "On
            Constitutions" still exists. </note> but an ex-consul, and one who had been engaged in
          the most important affairs in the state: that when I put them in the mouth of men of such
          ancient date they would have an air of unreality: that I had shewn good taste in my books
          about the science of rhetoric in keeping the dialogue of the orators apart from myself,
          and yet had attributed it to men whom I had personally seen: and, finally, that Aristotle
          delivers in the first person his essays "On the Republic "and "On the Eminent Man." I was
          influenced the more by this from the fact that I was unable to touch on <pb n="329"/> the
          most important commotions in our state, because they were subsequent to the age of the
          speakers. Moreover, my express object then was not to offend anyone by launching into the
          events of my own time: as it is, I shall avoid that and at the same time be the speaker
          with you. Nevertheless, when I come to Rome I will send you the dialogues as they
          originally stood. For I fancy that those books will convince you that they have not been
          abandoned by me without some chagrin. <milestone unit="para"/>I am extremely gratified by
          Caesar's affection of which you write to me. The offers which he holds out I do not much
          reckon on, nor have I any thirst for honours or longing for glory; and I look forward more
          to the continuation of his kindness than to the fulfillment of his promises. Still, I live
          a life so prominent and laborious that I might seem to be expecting the very thing that I
          deprecate. As to your request that I should compose some verses, you could hardly believe,
          my dear brother, how short of time I am: nor do I feel much moved in spirit to write
          poetry on the subject you mention. Do you really come to me for disquisitions on things
          that I can scarcely conceive even in imagination—you who have distanced everybody in that
          style of vivid and descriptive writing? Yet I would have done it if I could, but, as you
          will assuredly not fail to notice, for writing poetry there is need of a certain freshness
          of mind of which my occupations entirely deprive me. I withdraw myself, it is true, from
          all political anxiety and devote myself to literature; still, I will hint to you what, by
          heaven, I specially wished to have concealed from you. It cuts me to the heart, my dearest
          brother, to the heart, to think that there is no Republic, no law courts, and that my
          present time of life, which ought to have been in the full bloom of senatorial dignity, is
          distracted with the labours of the forum or eked out by private studies, and that the
          object on which from boyhood I had set my heart, <quote>
            <l>Far to excel, and tower above the crowd,</l>
          </quote>
          <note n="1" anchored="true">Hom. 51.6.208. </note> is entirely gone: that my opponents
          have in some cases been left unattacked by me, in others even defended: that <pb n="330"/>
          not only my sympathies, but my very dislikes, are not free: and that Caesar is the one man
          in the world who has been found to love me to my heart's Content, or even, as others
          think, the only one who was inclined to do so. However, there is none of all these
          vexations of such a kind as to be beyond the reach of many daily consolations; but the
          greatest of consolations will be our being together. As it is, to those other sources of
          vexation there is added my very deep regret for your absence. If I had defended Gabinius,
          which Pansa thought I ought to have done, I should have been quite ruined: those who hate
          him—and that is entire orders—would have begun to hate me for the sake of their hatred for
          him. I confined myself, as I think with great dignity, to doing only that which all the
          world saw me do. And to sum up the whole case, I am, as you advise, devoting all my
          efforts to tranquillity and peace. As to the books: Tyrannio is a slow-coach : I will
          speak to Chrysippus, but it is a laborious business and requires a man of the utmost
          industry. I find it in my own case, for, though I am as diligent as possible, I get
          nothing done. As to the Latin books, I don't know which way to turn—they are copied and
          exposed for sale with such a quantity of errors! However, whatever can possibly be done I
          will not neglect to do. Gaius Rebilus, as I wrote to you before, is at Rome. He solemnly
          affirms his great obligations to you, and reports well of your health. <note n="1"

          <dateline>ROME (NOVEMBER)</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> The earlier of your two letters is full of irritability and complainings, and you say
          you gave another of the same sort the day before to Labienus, who has not yet arrived—but
          I have nothing to say in answer to it, for your more recent letter has obliterated all
          trace of vexation from my mind. I will only give you this hint and make this request, that
          in the midst of your vexations and labours you should recall what our notion was as to
          your going to Caesar. For our object was not the acquisition of certain small and
          unimportant gains. For what was there of that kind which we should have thought worth the
          price of our separation? What we sought was the strongest possible security for the
          maintenance of our entire political position by the countenance of a man of the highest
          character and most commanding influence. Our interest is not so much in the acquisition of
          sums of money, as in the realization of this hope: all else that you get is to be regarded
          only as a security against actual loss. <note n="1" anchored="true">Cicero means, "the
            substantial gain to be got from your serving under Caesar in Gaul is the securing of his
            protection in the future : all other gains, such as money etc., are merely to be
            regarded as securing you from immediate loss in thus going to Gaul: they don't add
            anything fresh to our position and prospects." </note> Wherefore, if you will frequently
          turn your thoughts back upon what we originally proposed to ourselves and hoped to do, you
          will bear with less impatience the labours of military service of which you speak and the
            <pb n="335"/> other things which annoy you, and, nevertheless, will resign them whenever
          you choose. But the right moment for that step is not yet come, though it is now not far
          off. Furthermore, I give you this hint—don't commit anything at all to writing, the
          publication of which would be annoying to us. There are many things that I would rather
          not know than learn at some risk. I shall write at greater length to you with a mind less
          preoccupied, when my boy Cicero is, as I hope he will be, in a good state of health. Pray
          be careful to let me know to whom I should give the letter which I shall then send you—to
          Caesar's letter-carriers, for him to forward them direct to you, or to those of Labienus?
          For where your Nervii dwell, and how far off, I have no idea. <note n="1" anchored="true"
            >Quintus had his winter quarters among the <foreign xml:lang="la">Nervii</foreign>, in a
            town near the modern Charleroi. In this winter he was in great danger from a sudden
            rising of the <foreign xml:lang="la">Nervii</foreign> and other tribes (<bibl
              n="Caes. Gal. 5.24">Caes. B. G. 5.24</bibl>-49). </note> I derived great pleasure from
          your letter describing the courage and dignity displayed (as you say) by Caesar in his
          extreme sorrow. You bid me finish the poem in his honour which I had begun; and although I
          have been diverted from it by business, and still more by my feelings, yet, since Caesar
          knows that I did begin something, I will return to my design, and will complete in these
          leisure days of the "supplications," <note n="2" anchored="true">Twenty days of <foreign
              xml:lang="la">supplicatio</foreign> had been decreed in honour of Caesar's campaigns

          </note> during which I greatly rejoice that our friend Messalla and the rest are at last
          relieved from worry. In reckoning on him as certain to be consul with Domitius, you are
          quite in agreement with my own opinion. I will guarantee Messalla to Caesar: but Memmius
          Cherishes a hope, founded on Caesar's return to Italy, in which I think he is under a
          mistake. He is, indeed, quite out of it here. Scaurus, again, has been long ago thrown
          over by Pompey. The business has been put off: the <foreign xml:lang="la"
            >comitia</foreign> postponed and postponed, till we may expect an <foreign xml:lang="la"
            >interregnum</foreign>. The rumour of a dictator is not pleasing to the aristocrats; for
          myself, I like still less what they say. But the proposal, as a whole, is looked upon with
          alarm, and grows unpopular. Pompey says outright that he doesn't wish it: to me previously
          he used not personally to deny the wish. Hirrus seems likely to be the proposer. Ye gods !
          what folly! <pb n="336"/> How in love with himself and without—a rival! He has
          Commissioned me to choke off Caelius Vinicianus, a man much attached to me. Whether Pompey
          wishes it or not, it is difficult to be sure. However, if it is Hirrus who makes the
          proposal, he will not convince people that he does not wish it. There is nothing else
          being talked about in politics just now; at any rate, nothing else is being done. The
          funeral of the son of Serranus Domesticus took place in very melancholy circumstances on
          the 23rd of November. His father delivered the funeral Oration which I composed for him.
          Now about Milo. Pompey gives him no support, and is all for Gutta, saying also that he
          will secure Caesar on his side. Milo is alarmed at this, and no wonder, and almost gives
          up hope if Pompey is created dictator. If he assists anyone who vetoes the dictatorship by
          his troop and bodyguard, <note n="1" anchored="true">His gladiators, which he kept in
            training for the games he was going to give in honour of a deceased friend. </note> he
          fears he may excite Pompey's enmity: if he doesn't do so, he fears the proposal may be
          carried by force. He is preparing games on a most magnificent scale, at a cost, I assure
          you, that no one has ever exceeded. It is foolish, on two or even three accounts, to give
          games that were not demanded—he has already given a magnificent show of gladiators : he
          cannot afford it: he is only an executor, and might have reflected that he is now an
          executor, not an aedile. That is about all I had to write. Take care of yourself, dearest
          brother. </p>

          also with the greatest consideration. <pb n="337"/> I neither bore hardly on him nor
          helped him. I gave strong evidence, in other respects I did not stir. The disgraceful and
          mischievous result of the trial I bore with the utmost serenity. And this is the advantage
          which, after all that has happened, has accrued to me—that I am not even affected in the
          least by those evils in the state and the licentious conduct of the shameless, which used
          formerly to make me burst with indignation : for anything more abandoned than the men and
          the times in which we are living there cannot be. Accordingly, as no pleasure can possibly
          be got from politics, I don't know why I should lose my temper. Literature and my
          favourite studies, along with the retirement of my country houses, and above all our two
          boys, furnish my enjoyments. The one man who vexes me is Milo. But I hope an end will be
          put to my anxieties by his getting the consulship: and to obtain this for him I shall
          struggle as hard as I did for my own, and you, I am sure, will continue to give assistance
          from over there. In his case other things are all secure, unless it is snatched from his
          grasp by downright violence: it is about his means that I am frightened: <quote>

            The numerals seem doubtful. According to some MSS. the amount would be 10,000,000.
          </note> to spend 1,000,000 sesterce on his games. His want of prudence in this one
          particular I shall put up with as well as I can, and you should be strong-minded enough to
          do the same. In mentioning the changes to be expected next year, I didn't mean you to
          understand me to refer to domestic alarms : the reference was wholly to the state of the
          Republic, in which, though not charged with any actual duty, I can scarcely discharge
          myself from all anxiety. Yet how cautious I would have you be in writing you may guess
          from the fact that I do not mention in my letters to you even open acts of disorder in the
          state, lest my letter should be intercepted and give offence to the feelings of anyone.
          Wherefore, as far as domestic affairs are concerned, I would have you be quite easy: in
          politics I know how anxious you always are. I can see that our friend Messalla will <pb
            n="338"/> be consul, if by means of an <foreign xml:lang="la">interrex</foreign>,
          without any prosecution, if by that of a dictator, without danger of conviction. He is not
          disliked by anyone. Hortensius's warm support will stand him in good stead. Gabinius's
          acquittal is looked upon as a general act of indemnity. <foreign xml:lang="fr">En
            passant</foreign>: nothing has, after all, been done as yet about a dictatorship. Pompey
          is out of town; Appius is intriguing darkly; Hirrus is paving the way: there are many
          tribunes calculated on to veto it: the people are indifferent: the leading men disinclined
          to it: I don't stir a finger. I am exceedingly obliged for your promises as to slaves, and
          I am indeed, as you say, shorthanded both at Rome and on my estates. But pray do nothing
          for my convenience unless it entirely suits your own, and your means. About the letter of
          Vatinius I laughed heartily. But though I know I am being watched by him, I can swallow
          his hatred and digest it too. You urge me to "finish": well, I have finished what, in my
          own opinion at least, is a very pretty "epic " on Caesar, but I am in search of a
          trustworthy letter-carrier, lest it should share the fate of your <title>Erigona</title>

            <milestone unit="para"/>What? because I had no good stone was I to pull down the whole

          and the chambers attached to it are admirable. As to Arcanum, it is a building worthy of
          Caesar, or, by heaven, of some one even more tasteful still. For your statues, <foreign

          you will complain more when you know all. For the document which he believed himself to
          have sealed, in which your name was most certainly entered as heir to a twelfth, this, by
          a mistake of his own and of his slave Sicura, he did not seal: while the one which he did
          not intend to seal he did seal. But let it go hang, so long as we keep well! I am as
          devoted to your son Cicero as you can wish, and as he deserves, and as I am bound to be.
          However, I am letting him leave me, both to <pb n="339"/> avoid keeping him from his
          teachers, and because his mother is leaving, without whom I am very much alarmed as to the

        <p> I have read your letter which informs me that our Caesar considers you a great lawyer.
          You must be glad to have found a country where you have the credit of knowing something.
          But if you had gone to Britain also, I feel sure that there would not have been in all
          that great island anyone more learned in the law than you. However—you won't mind my
          laughing, for you invited me to do so—I am becoming positively a little jealous of you!
          That you should have been actually sent for by a man whom other people—not because of his
          pride, but of his many engagements—cannot venture to approach! <milestone unit="para"/>But
          in that letter you told me nothing about your success, which, by heaven, is of no less
          concern to me than my own. I am very much afraid you may be frozen in your winter
          quarters: and therefore I think you ought to use a good stove. Mucius and Manilius
          "concur" in this opinion, especially on the ground of your being short of military cloaks.
          However, I am told that you are having a sufficiently warm time of it where you are—news
          which made me much alarmed for you. <note n="1" anchored="true">He seems to refer to the
            rising of the <foreign xml:lang="la">Nervii</foreign> against the Roman winter quarters

          matters you are much more cautious than at the bar, seeing that you wouldn't take a swim
          in the ocean, fond of swimming as you are, and wouldn't take a look at the British
          charioteers, though in old time I could never cheat you even out of a blind-folded <pb

            the face, who thus fought without seeing his adversary. </note> But enough of joking.
          You know how earnestly I have written to Caesar about you; I know bow often. Yet, in
          truth, I have lately ceased doing so, lest I should appear to distrust the kindness of a
          man who has been most liberal and affectionate to me. However, in the very last letter I
          wrote I thought he ought to be reminded. I did so. Please tell me what effect it had, and
          at the same time tell me about your position in general and all your plans. For I am
          anxious to know what you are doing, what you are expecting, how long your separation from
          us you think is to last. I would wish you to believe that the one consolation, enabling me
          to bear your absence, is the knowledge that it is for your advantage. But if that is not
          so, nothing can be more foolish than both the one and the other of us: me for not inducing
          you to come back to Rome—you for not flying thither. By heavens, our conversation, whether
          serious or jesting, will be worth more not only than the enemy, but even than our

        <p> M. Cicero wishes health to L. Valerius, learned in the law. For why I should not pay you
          this compliment I don't know, especially considering that in these times one may employ
          impudence to supply the place of learning. I have written to our friend Lentulus, thanking
          him earnestly in your name. But I could wish that you would now cease using my letter <pb
            n="341"/> of introduction and at last come back to us, and prefer a city where you are
          of some account, to a place where you appear to be the only man of legal learning.
          However, those who come from where you are either say you are proud because you give no
          "opinions," or insulting because you give bad ones. <note n="1" anchored="true">Cicero
            perhaps means that Valerius's "opinions" are too right to suit such a set as are to be
            found in the province. Valerius will not mind people there thinking him a bad lawyer.
            "At Rome you are considered a good lawyer, in <foreign xml:lang="la">Cilicia</foreign>
            they don't think so!" </note> But I am now longing to crack a joke with you face to
          face. So come as soon as ever you can, and don't go and visit your native Apulia, that we
          may have the joy of welcoming your safe return. For if you go there, like another Ulysses,
          you will not recognize any of your friends. <note n="2" anchored="true">

          thanked you for having looked after L. Egnatius, my most intimate friend, who is still
          absent, and L. Oppius, who is here. With Antipater of Derbe I have become not merely on
          visiting terms, but really very intimate. I have been told that you are exceedingly angry
          with him, and I was very sorry to hear it. I have no means of judging the merits of the

          without good reason. However, I do beg of you again and again that, in consideration of
          our old friendship, you will, for my sake if for anyone's, grant his sons, who are in your
          power, their liberty, unless you consider that in doing so your reputation may be injured.
          If I had thought that, I would never have made the request, for your fame is of more
          importance in my eyes than any friendship with him. But I persuade myself—though I may
          possibly be mistaken—that this measure will bring you honour rather than abuse. What can

          neglect, yet it was not so annoying to me to have my lack of attention <pb n="344"/> found
          fault with, as delightful to have it missed by you; especially as in the particular point
          on which you accuse me I happen to be innocent, while in shewing that you miss a letter
          from me, you avow an affection for me, of which, indeed, I was fully aware, but which,
          nevertheless, is very soothing and gratifying to my feelings. The fact is that I have
          never let anyone go, so long, that is, as I thought him likely to reach you, without
          giving him a letter. Why, was there ever such an untiring correspondent as I? From you,
          however, I have received two, or at the most three letters—and those extremely brief.
          Wherefore, if you are a harsh judge of me, I shall find you guilty on precisely the same
          charge. But if you don't want me to do that, you will have to be considerate to me.
          However, enough about writing; for I am not afraid of failing to satiate you with my
          correspondence, especially if you shew a just appreciation of my zeal in that department.
          I have been grieved on the one hand at your long absence from us, because I have lost the
          advantage of a most delightful intimacy; and yet on the other hand I rejoice at it,
          because while on this foreign service you have gained all your objects with infinite
          credit to yourself, and because in all you have undertaken fortune has answered to my
          wishes. There is one injunction, a very short one, which my unspeakable affection for you
          compels me to give you. Such lofty expectations are entertained of your spirit, shall I
          say? or of your ability, that I cannot refrain from imploring and beseeching you to return
          to us with a character so finished, as to be able to support and maintain the expectations
          which you have excited. And since no loss of memory will ever obliterate my recollection
          of your services to me, I beg you not to forget that, whatever increase of fortune or
          position may befall you, you would not have been able to attain it, had you not as a boy
          obeyed my most faithful and affectionate counsels. <note n="1" anchored="true">Curio had

          service and stay on: I shall console myself for my loss of you by the hope that it will be
          your gain: but if, on the other hand, things are not paying with you, come back to us. For
          either something will turn up sooner or later here, or, if not, one conversation between
          you and me, by heaven, will be worth more than all the Samobrivae <note n="3"

          Finally, if you return speedily, there will be no talk about it; but if you stay away much
          longer without getting anything, I am in terror not only of Laberius, but of our comrade
          Valerius also. For it <pb n="346"/> would make a capital character for a farce—a British

          this time sick and tired of them. But I am not acting as I said I would do, for I am
          embarking on a statement of the reasons for my opinion. So I will put off this entire
          discussion to your arrival. Believe me, you are expected with the greatest interest, and
          hopes are entertained of you such as can only be entertained of the highest virtue and
          ability. If you are as prepared for this as you ought to be—and I feel certain you are—you
          will be bestowing on us, your friends, on the whole body of your fellow citizens, and on
          the entire state, the most numerous <pb n="348"/> and most excellent of exhibitions. You
          will certainly become aware that no one can be dearer or more precious than you are to me.

        <p> I was wondering what had made you cease writing to me. My friend Pansa <note n="1"
            anchored="true">C. Vibius <foreign xml:lang="la">Pansa</foreign> had been in Gaul, and
            was now home to stand for the tribuneship, which he obtained for <date>B.C. <date

          had sent you to Tarentum <note n="2" anchored="true">Where he would have been in luxury.
          </note> instead of Samobriva? I was already a little doubtful about you, when I found you
          supporting the same doctrine as my friend Selius ! <note n="3" anchored="true">A follower
            of the new academy, with which Cicero was more in sympathy than with the Epicurean
            ethics, but apparently only partly so. The leading doctrine was the denial of the
            possibility of knowledge, and, applied to ethics, this might destroy all virtue. </note>
          But on what ground will you support the principles of civil law, if you act always in your
          own interest and not in that of your fellow citizens? What, too, is to become of the legal
          formula in cases of trust, "as should be done among honest men"? For who can be called
          honest who does nothing except on his own behalf? What principle will you lay down "in
          dividing a common property," when nothing can be "common" among men who measure all things
          by their own pleasure ? <note n="4" anchored="true">All these jesting objections to a
            lawyer being an Epicurean are founded on the Epicurean doctrine that individual feeling
            is the standard of morals, and the <foreign xml:lang="la">summum bonum</foreign> is the
            good of the individual. The logical deduction that a man should therefore hold aloof
            from politics and social life, as involving social obligations and standards, was, of
            course, evaded in practice. </note> How, again, can you ever think it right to swear by
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Jupiter lapis</foreign>, when you know that Jupiter cannot <pb
            n="349"/> be angry with anyone? <note n="1" anchored="true">For the Epicureans believed
            the gods to exist, but not to trouble themselves with the affairs of men. In taking an
            oath by <foreign xml:lang="la">Jupiter lapis</foreign> the swearer took a stone in his
            hand and said, "If I abide by this oath may he bless me: but if I do otherwise in
            thought or deed, may all others be kept safe, each in his own country, under his own
            laws, in enjoyment of his own goods, household gods, and tombs—may I alone be cast out,
            even as this stone is now." Then he throws down the stone. This passage from Polybius
            (iii. 25) refers to treaties, but the same form seems to have been used in suits about
            land. </note> What is to become of the people of Ulubrae, <note n="2" anchored="true"

        <p> Chrysippus Vettius, a freedman of the architect Cyrus, made me think that you had not

          mighty fine gentleman, that you can't take the trouble of writing a letter to me—a man, I
          might almost say, of your own family! But if you have forgotten how to write, all the

          quite faded out of your mind. If it is a terror of the summer camp that is disheartening
          you, think of some excuse to get off, as you did in the Case of Britain. I was glad to
          hear one thing from that same Chrysippus, that you were on friendly terms with Caesar.
          But, by Hercules, I should have preferred, as I might fairly have expected, to be informed

        </opener>
        <p> I have received several letters from you at the same time, written at various times, in
          which everything else gave me great pleasure; for they shewed that you were now sustaining
            <pb n="352"/> your military service with a brave spirit, and were a gallant and resolute
          man. These are qualities which for a short time I felt to be lacking in you, though I
          attributed your uneasiness not so much to any weakness of your own spirit, as to your
          feeling your absence from us. Therefore go on as you have begun: endure your service with
          a stout heart: believe me, the advantages you will gain are many; for I will reiterate my
          recommendation of you, though I shall wait for the right moment of doing so. Be assured
          that you are not more anxious that your separation from me should be as profitable as
          possible to yourself than I am. Accordingly, as your "securities" are somewhat weak, I
          have sent you one in my poor Greek, written by my own hand. <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Graeculum tibi misi cautionem chirographi mei</foreign>. Various
            interpretations have been given to this : (1) "a truly Greek security," i.e., not to be
            depended on"; (2) referring to a poem in Greek, perhaps the one in praise of Caesar's
            achievements, mentioned before (p.338), in which some compliment to Trebatius was
            introduced; (3) Prof. Tyrrell would make it refer to this letter itself, which he
            supposes to have been written in Greek, and afterwards translated by <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Tiro</foreign>. But this letter does not read like a translation, and,
            after all, is not of a nature to shew as a "commendation." It is conceived in too
            jocular a vein. I have taken it to refer to some enclosure written in Greek which he
            might use in this way, and the mention of his "own handwriting" to refer to the fact
            that he would naturally have employed a Greek secretary to write Greek. The diminutive
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Graeculam</foreign>I take to be apologetic for the Greek. But
            it is not at all certain. </note> For your part, I should wish you to keep me informed
          of the course of the war in Gaul: for the less warlike my informant, the more inclined I
          am to believe him. <milestone unit="para"/>But to return to your letters. Everything else
          (as I said) is prettily written, but I do wonder at this : who in the world sends several
          identical letters, when he writes them with his own hand? For your writing on paper that
          has been used before, I commend your economy: but I can't help wondering what it was that
          you preferred to rub out of this bit of paper rather than not write such poor stuff as
          this—unless it were, perhaps, some of your legal formulas. For I don't suppose you rub out
          my letters to replace them with your own. Can it mean that there is no business going on,
          that you are out of work, that you haven't even a supply of paper? Well, that is entirely
          your own fault, for taking your modesty abroad with you instead of leaving it behind here
          with us. I <pb n="353"/> will commend you to Balbus, when he starts to join you, in the
          good old Roman style. Don't be astonished if there is a somewhat longer interval than
          usual between my letters: for I intend being out of town in April. I write this letter in
          the Pomptine district, having put up at the villa of M. Aemilius Philemo, from which I
          could hear the noise of my clients, I mean those you confided to me For at Ulubrae it is
          Certain that an enormous mass of frogs have bestirred themselves to do me honour. Take

        <p> You are aware that letters are of many kinds; but there is one kind which is undeniable,
          for the sake of which, indeed, the thing was invented, namely, to inform the absent of
          anything that is to the interest of the writer or recipient that they should know. You,
          however, certainly don't expect a letter of that kind from me. For of your domestic
          concerns you have members of your family both to write and to act as messengers. Besides,
          in my personal affairs there is really nothing new. There are two other kinds of letters
          which give me great pleasure: the familiar and sportive, and the grave and serious. Which
          of these two I ought least to employ I do not understand. Am I to jest with you by letter?
          Upon my word, I don't think the man a good citizen who could laugh in times like these.
          Shall I write in a more serious style? What could be written of seriously by Cicero to
          Curio except public affairs? And yet, under this head, my position is such that I neither
          dare write what I think, nor choose to write what I don't think. Wherefore, since I have
          no subject left to write about, I will employ my customary <pb n="355"/> phrase, and
          exhort you to the pursuit of the noblest glory. For you have a dangerous rival already in
          the field, and fully prepared, in the extraordinary expectation formed of you and this
          rival you will vanquish with the greatest ease, only on one condition—that you make up
          your mind to put out your full strength in the cultivation of those qualities, by which
          the noble actions are accomplished, upon the glory of which you have set your heart. In
          support of this sentiment I would have written at greater length had not I felt certain
          that you were sufficiently alive to it of your own accord; and I have touched upon it even
          thus far, not in order to fire your ambition, but to testify my affection. </p>

          on a lofty and conspicuous pinnacle in the sight of multitudes both of citizens and
          allies; and it is conveyed to us by neither obscure nor uncertain talk, but by the loud
          and unanimous voice of all. There is one thing of which I cannot feel certain—whether to
          congratulate you, or to be alarmed for you on account of the surprising expectation
          entertained of your return; not because I am at all afraid of your not satisfying the
          world's opinion, but, by heaven, lest, when you do come, there may be nothing for you to

          <salute>TO C. SCRIBONIUS CURIO (ARRIVED IN ITALY)</salute>
          <dateline>ROME (?JULY)</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> News had not yet reached me of your arrival in Italy when I sent Sext. Villius, an
          intimate of my friend Milo, with this letter to you. But nevertheless, since your arrival
          was thought to be approaching, and it was ascertained that you had already started from
          Asia Rome-wards, the importance of my subject made me dismiss any fear of being premature
          in sending you this letter, for I was exceedingly anxious that it should reach you as soon
          as possible. If the obligations, Curio, had only been on your side, and as great as they
          are usually proclaimed by you rather than as valued by me, I should have been more shy of
          coming to you for any request of importance which I might have to make. For it is very
          disagreeable to a modest man to ask a great favour from one whom he thinks under an
          obligation to himself, lest he should seem rather to demand than to ask what he is
          seeking, and to regard it more in the light of a debt than of a favour. But since your
          kindnesses to me were known to the whole world, or rather I should say were made
          especially prominent and valuable by the very novelty of my circumstances; and since it is
          the mark of a generous heart to be willing, when much is owed, to reckon the debt at its
          highest; <pb n="357"/> I did not hesitate to prefer to you by letter a petition for what
          was of the highest importance and most vital consequence to me of anything in the world.
          For I was not afraid of being unable to support your kindnesses to me, even though they
          were beyond calculation: especially as I felt confident that there was no amount of favour
          for which my heart was incapable of finding room when receiving it, or for which in
          repayment it could not make a full and brilliant return. I have concentrated and embarked
          all my zeal, all my efforts, all the care and industry of which I am capable, my every
          thought, in fact, my whole heart and soul, on securing Milo's consulship; and I have made
          up my mind that in this matter I ought to look not merely for the profit arising from an
          act of kindness, but also for the credit of disinterested affection. Nor do I think that
          anyone was ever so anxious about his own personal safety and his own fortunes as I am for
          his election, on which I have made up my mind that all my interests depend. To him I see
          clearly that, if you choose, you can render such substantial help that we need ask for
          nothing else. We have on our side all these advantages: the favour of the loyalists won
          since his tribunate on account of his supporting me (as I hope you understand); that of
          the common multitude on account of the splendour of his gladiatorial exhibitions and the
          liberality of his disposition; the favour of the young men and of those influential in
          securing votes, won by his own eminent powers of captivation, shall I call it? or his
          diligence in that department; lastly, my own electoral support, which, if it is not very
          powerful, is at any rate regarded as only right, due and proper, and on that account is
          perhaps influential also. What we want is a leader, and what I may call a controller, or,
          so to speak, a pilot of those winds which I have described: and if we had to select one
          such out of the whole world, we should have no one to compare with you. Wherefore, if (as
          I am sure you can) you can regard me as a grateful, as an honest man, from the mere fact
          that I am thus eagerly exerting myself for Milo, if, in fine, you think me worthy of your
          kindness, I do ask you this favour—that you come to the rescue of this anxiety of mine and
          this crisis in my reputation, or, to put it with greater truth, that you will devote your
          zeal to what is all but a question of life and death to me. As to Titus <pb n="358"/>

          you were in securing my safety. <milestone unit="para"/>Did I not know that you must be
          fully aware, while writing this letter to you, under what a weight of obligation I am
          labouring, how strongly I am bound to work in this election for Milo, not only with every
          kind of exertion, but even with downright fighting, I should have written at greater
          length. As it is, I hand over and commit the business, the cause, and myself wholly and
          entirely into your hands. Of one thing be sure: if I obtain this help from you, I shall
          owe you almost more than I owe Milo himself; for my personal safety, in which I have been
          conspicuously aided by him, has not been as dear to me as the sacred duty of returning the
          favour will be delightful. That object I feel confident that your aid, and yours alone,
          will enable me to secure. </p>

          Pompey was at the head of that business. The chief thing is—and you can therein lay me

            it is suggested that it was after his aedileship of the previous year, when a scarcity
            of corn had contributed to his unpopularity. The date of the letter is uncertain.
          </note> I had forgotten our friendship, or had any intention of breaking off my
          correspondence, that I have <pb n="360"/> not written to you of late years. The reason is
          that the earlier part of them was a period of depression owing to the disaster which had
          befallen the Republic and myself, while the later period, with your own most distressing
          and undeserved misfortune, has made me reluctant to write. Since, however, a sufficiently
          long period has now elapsed, and I have recalled with greater distinctness your high
          character and lofty courage, I thought it not inconsistent with my purposes to write this
          to you. For my part, my dear P. Sittius, I defended you originally, when an attempt was
          made in your absence to bring you into odium and under a criminal charge; and when a
          charge against you was involved in the accusation and trial of your most intimate friend,
            <note n="1" anchored="true">P. <foreign xml:lang="la">Sulla</foreign>. Sittius was not,
            it seems, brought to trial with <foreign xml:lang="la">Sulla</foreign>, but his journey
            to Spain formed part of the allegations against <foreign xml:lang="la">Sulla</foreign>.
          </note> I took the very greatest care to safeguard your position and justify you. And,
          again also, on this last occasion, soon after my return to Rome, though I found that your
          case had been put on a footing far different from what I should have advised, if I had
          been there, still I omitted nothing that could contribute to your security. And though on
          that occasion the ill-feeling arising from the price of corn, the hostility of certain
          persons, not only to yourself, but to all your friends as well, the unfairness of the
          whole trial, and many other abuses in the state, had greater influence than the merits of
          your case or than truth itself, I yet did not fail to serve your son Publius with active
          assistance, advice, personal influence, and direct testimony. Wherefore, as I have
          carefully and religiously fulfilled all the other offices of friendship, I thought I ought
          not to omit that of urging upon you and beseeching you to remember that you are a human
          being and a gallant man—that is, that you should bear philosophically accidents which are
          common to all and incalculable, which none of us mortals can shun or forestall <pb n="361"
          /> by any means whatever: should confront with courage such grief as fortune brings: and
          should reflect that not in our state alone, but in all others that have acquired an
          empire, such disasters have in many Instances befallen the bravest and best from unjust
          verdicts. Oh that I were writing untruly when I say, that you are exiled from a state in
          which no man of foresight can find anything to give him pleasure! As for your son, again,
          I fear that, if I write nothing to you, I may seem not to have borne testimony to his high
          qualities as they deserve; while on the other hand, if I write fully all I feel, I fear
          that my letter may irritate the smart of your regret. But, after all, your wisest course
          will be to regard his loyalty, virtue, and steady conduct as being in your possession, and
          as accompanying you wherever you may be: for, in truth, what we embrace in imagination is
          no less ours than what we see before our eyes. Wherefore not only ought his brilliant
          qualities and extreme affection for you to afford you great consolation, but so also ought
          I and others of your friends who value you, and always will do so, not for your position,
          but your worth; and so, above all else, ought your own conscience, when you reflect that
          you have not deserved anything that has befallen you, and when you consider besides that
          the wise are distressed by guilt, not by mischance—by their own ill-doing, not by the
          misconduct of others. For my part, I shall omit no opportunity either of consoling or
          alleviating your present position ; for the recollection of our old friendship, and the
          high character and respectful attentions of your son, will keep me in mind of that duty.
          If you, on your part, will mention by letter anything you want, I will take care that you
          shall not think that you have written in vain. <pb n="362"/>

            motion prepared for Cicero's recall, of which Cicero speaks with approbation (p. 178).

            clear, especially the phrase <foreign xml:lang="la">si forte de tuis sumpsero</foreign>.
            Was Cicero expecting a present of a bust of Minerva, or intending to purchase one from
            Appius's collection? Or does he allude, as has been suggested, to the Minerva he had
            himself dedicated before his exile, and which had probably fallen into the hands of the
            Appian family? </note> Your freedman Cilix was not well known to me before, but when he

          that letter by his own words. I was much gratified by his speech, when he described to me
          your feelings and the remarks which you were daily making about me. In short, within two
          days he became my intimate friend, without, how ever, my ceasing to regret Phania deeply.

            Bursa, who, being tribune in <date when="-0052">B.C. 52</date>, had promoted the riots
            following the death of Clodius, especially in regard to burning his body in the Curia,
            and had, after his office terminated (10th December), been prosecuted <foreign
              xml:lang="la">de vi </foreign> by Cicero successfully. Bursa, with others, had
            supported Pompey's wish for the dictatorship, as well as his legislation, and
            accordingly, in attacking him, Cicero had against him the weight of Pompey's influence.
            He therefore looks upon it as a great triumph. </note> but your congratulations are too
          half-hearted. For you suppose, as you say in your letter, that, owing to the fellow's
          meanness, I don't look upon it as a matter of much rejoicing. I would have you believe
          that I am more pleased with this verdict than with the death of my enemy. For, in the
          first place, I would rather win by legal process than by the sword; in the second place,
          by what brings credit to a friend than by what involves his condemnation. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">The condemnation of Bursa was a point in favour of <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Milo</foreign>, whereas Milo's murder of Clodius only brought his
            ultimate condemnation and exile. Milo's trial had taken place in April. </note> And,
          above all, I was delighted that the support of the loyalists was given to me so decisively
          against the influence exerted to an incredible degree by a most illustrious and powerful
          personage. Finally—though, perhaps, you won't think it likely—I bated this man much more
          than the notorious Clodius himself. For the latter I bad attacked, the former I had
          defended. The latter, too, though the very existence of the Republic was to be risked in
          my person, had yet a certain great object in view; nor was it wholly on his own
          initiative, but with the support of those who could not be safe as long as I was so. But
          this ape of a fellow, in sheer wantonness, had selected me as an object for his
          invectives, and had persuaded certain persons <note n="3" anchored="true">Pompey and his
            friends. </note> who were jealous of me that he would always be a ready instrument for
          an attack upon me. Wherefore I bid you rejoice with <pb n="366"/> all your heart: a great
          stroke has been struck. Never were any citizens more courageous than those who ventured to
          vote for his condemnation, in the teeth of the immense power of the man by whom the jurors
          had themselves been selected. And this they never would have done had not my grievance
          been theirs also. Here, in Rome, I am so distracted by the number of trials, the crowded
          courts, and the new legislation, <note n="1" anchored="true">The new laws introduced by
            Pompey <foreign xml:lang="la">de vi</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="la">de

            anchored="true">The intercalary month was inserted between the 23rd and 24th of

            their secret jealously. If it is inserted, Cicero will be kept all the longer in town
            with senatorial and legal business, and so be prevented from seeing Marius, who lived
            near his Pompeian villa. </note> so that I may see you as soon as possible.</p>

        <epigraph>
          <p>The following letters to Tiro, with one from Quintus in regard to his manumission, are
            given here because of the difficulty of dating them. The indications of time are as
            follows.</p>
          <p>1. Those addressed to Tiro are earlier than that of Quintus, because they refer to a
            promised emancipation, while that of Quintus speaks of it as accomplished.</p>
          <p>2. The letter of Quintus is after the emancipation of his own freedman Statius, which
            apparently took place B.C. 59.</p>
          <p>3. Quintus is at a distance from Italy, and is looking forward to rejoin his brother
            and family.</p>
          <p>4. Cicero is engaged on some more than ordinary literary work. V. Pompey is visiting
            Cicero in his Cuman villa. Now after his return from Asia (B.C. 58), Quintus was only
            twice thus distant, in B.C. <date to="-56" from="-57">57</date>-56 in Sardinia, and in
            B.C. <date to="-53" from="-54">54</date>-53 in Britain and Gaul. In both of these
            periods Cicero was engaged on literary work in the former on the <title>de
              Oratore</title>, in the latter on the <title>de Republica</title>. There is really no
            means of deciding between these two. It is even possible that they might be placed some
            time during the propraetorship of Quintus in Asia (B.C. <date to="-59" from="-62"
              >62</date>-59), during which Cicero was engaged, among other things, on a poem on his
            own times and a history of his consulship. Tiro—or M. Tullius Tiro, as he was called
            after his emancipation—was not a young man, and may well have been emancipated even in
            B.C. 59. According to Hieronymus, he died in B.C. 5 in his hundredth year. He was
            therefore little more than a year younger than Cicero himself. The illness of Tiro must
            have been an earlier one than that of which we shall hear much in B.C. <date to="-49"

          Believe me when I read your letter and his I jumped for joy and I both thank and
          congratulate you, for if the fidelity and good character of my own Statius is a delight to
          me, how much more valuable must those same qualities be in your man since there is added
          to them knowledge of literature conversational powers, and culture, which have advantages
          even over those useful virtues ! I have all sorts of most conclusive reasons for loving
          you: and here is another one, either for what you have done, or, if you choose, for your

            interval between consulship or praetorship and a province, and providing for the interim
            by drawing on the ex-consuls and ex-praetors of previous years who had not had

            had been by name exempted in Pompey's law, but the senate nevertheless (or a party in

            question, though gradually coming round to the side of the senate. Caesar believed that

        <p> Though, contrary to my own wishes, and to my surprise, it has turned Out that I am

        <p> UPON my arrival at Brundisium on the 22nd of May, your legate Q. Fabius Vergilianus was
          awaiting me, and by your <pb n="14"/> direction put before me what had already occurred,
          not to me, whom it chiefly concerned, but to the whole Senate—that the province you are
          holding required a stronger garrison. In fact, nearly all the senators expressed
          themselves in favour of a reinforcement being enlisted in Italy for my legions and those
          of Bibulus. Upon Sulpicius declaring that he would not allow that measure, we protested
          indeed at great length, but so unanimous was the wish of the senate for our early start,
          that we were obliged to conform to it; and we did so accordingly. As things are now, I beg
          you, as I did in the letter I gave to your letter-carriers at Rome, that you will make it
          your object, in consideration of the very intimate union of our sentiments, to bestow
          attention and care on those details wherein an out-going provincial governor can consult
          for the advantage of a successor, who is joined to him by the closest ties of interest and
          affection; so that the whole world may see that I could not have succeeded anyone more
          kindly disposed to me, nor you have handed over the province to a warmer friend.
            <milestone unit="para"/>From the despatch intended to be read in the senate, of which
          you have sent me a copy, I had gathered that a large number of soldiers had been dismissed
          by you; but this same Fabius has pointed out that you had thought of doing so, but at the
          moment of his leaving you, the number of soldiers was still intact. If that is so, you
          will be doing me a very great favour if you make as small a reduction as possible in the
          scanty forces you already have : and I imagine that the decrees of the senate passed on
          this subject have been sent to you. For myself, so highly do I esteem you, that I shall
          approve of whatever you have done; but I feel confident that you also will do what you
          will perceive to be most in my interest. I am waiting for my legate C. Pomptinus at
          Brundisium, and I presume that he will arrive there before the 1st of June. And as soon as
          he has come I shall avail myself of the first opportunity of sailing that is offered me.

            who, when she quarrelled with him, accused him of attempting to poison her. He was

            though dissolute person, will be found in Boissier's <foreign xml:lang="fr">Cicéron et

            Egypt he attempted to secure popularity by opposing his law for relieving financial

          business, which these clerks cannot easily get at, I will myself carefully write you an
          account of how it was done, what was thought of it, and what is expected to be its result.
          For the present there is nothing which causes much anticipation. For those rumours as to
          the admission of the Transpadani to the <foreign xml:lang="la">comitia</foreign> died out
          after reaching Cumae : <note n="1" anchored="true">See Letter CLXXXIV, p. 6. </note> when
          I got to Rome I didn't find that there was the slightest whisper about it. Besides,
          Marcellus has not as yet brought before the senate the subject of a successor to the
          Gallic provinces, <note n="2" anchored="true">Caesar's ten years' government of this
            province would be over in March, <date when="-0048">B.C. 48</date>; but if he was to
            stand for the consulship for that year in the usual way, he must come home in July,
              <date when="-0049">B.C. 49</date>. Caesar maintained that by the clause in Pompey's
            law he was authorized to stay in his province and be elected in his absence, and so
            would only return to Rome at the end of <date when="-0049">B.C. 49</date> to take up his
            consulship. Thus he complains that a resolution of the senate compelling him to come
            home in July, <date when="-0049">B.C. 49</date>, would deprive him " of a six months'
              <foreign xml:lang="la">imperium</foreign> bestowed on him by the people,' (<bibl

          postponed that motion to the 1st of June. He has gone far to bring up again the talk about
          him which was prevalent when we were in Rome. <note n="3" anchored="true">That Marcellus
            was weak and irresolute. <foreign xml:lang="la">Expressit</foreign> is not the word
            Cicero would have used. It is a slang use of the word which means (I) to squeeze out,

          wishes he professed to entertain—for he is accustomed to think one thing and say another,
          and yet is not clever enough to conceal his real aims. As to Caesar, there are frequent
          and rather ugly reports—at any rate, people keep arriving with mysterious whispers : one
          says that he has lost his cavalry, which, in my opinion, is without doubt an invention :
          another says that the seventh legion has had a drubbing, that he himself is besieged among
          the Bellovaci, <note n="5" anchored="true">Caesar's serious struggle with the <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Bellovaci</foreign> (round Beauvais, in Normandy) is described in
            Hirtius's continuation of Caesar's commentaries, B. G. viii. 6-22. A slight cavalry
            disaster, which may have given rise to the reported loss of the cavalry, is described in
            ch. 12. Caesar invaded the <foreign xml:lang="la">Bellovaci</foreign> with the 7th, 8th,
            and 9th legions, but at one time he was at any rate in a sufficiently difficult position
            to make it necessary for him to send for another legion, the 13th (B. G. viii. 8-11.)
          </note> and cut off from <pb n="17"/> his main army. But neither is there anything known
          for certain as yet, nor are even these uncertain rumours publicly bruited abroad after
          all—they are mentioned as open secrets among the small clique with which you are
          acquainted; but Domitius, with his finger on his lips, hints at them. On the 24th of May,

        </opener>
        <p> ON the 4th of June, being at Brundisium, I received your letter stating that you had
          instructed L. Clodius with what you wished him to say to me. I am much looking forward to
          his arrival, that I may learn at the earliest possible moment the message he is bringing
          from you. My warm feeling and readiness to serve you, though I hope they are already known
          to you by many instances, I shall yet manifest in those circumstances above all others, in
          which I shall be able to give the most decisive proof that no one's reputation and
          position is dearer to me than yours. On your side, both Q. Fabius Vergilianus and C.
          Flaccus, son of Lucius, and—in stronger terms than anyone else—M. Octavius, son of Gneius,
          have shewed me that I am highly valued by you. This I had already judged to be the case on
          many grounds, but above all from that book on Augural Law, of which, with its most
          affectionate dedication, you have made me a most delightful present. On my part, all the
          services which belong to the closest relationship shall be ever at your command. For ever
          since you began feeling attachment to me, I have learnt daily to value you more highly,
          and now there has been added to that my intimacy with your relations—for there are two of
          them of different ages whom I value very highly, Cn. Pompeius, father-in-law of your
          daughter, and M. Brutus, your son-in-law <note n="1" anchored="true">Cn. Pompeius, elder
            son of Cn. Pompeius Magnus, married a daughter of Appius Claudius M. <foreign

            and, secondly, <foreign xml:lang="la">Porcia</foreign>, daughter of <foreign

          membership <pb n="20"/> of the same college, especially as that has been stamped by such a
          complimentary expression of your approval, <note n="1" anchored="true">By the dedication
            of the <foreign xml:lang="la">liber auguralis</foreign>, after Cicero's election into

          supplied a bond of no ordinary strength towards securing a union of feeling between us.
          But I shall not only, if I come across Clodius, write you at greater length after talking
          with him, but shall also take pains myself to see you as soon as possible. Your saying
          that your motive for staying in the province was the hope of having an interview with me,
          to tell you the honest truth, is very agreeable to me. </p>

          unexpected, or so scandalous in the eyes of everybody. Nay, even I, though I countenanced
          him with all my might for friendship's sake, and had prepared myself to condole with him,
          was thunderstruck when it occurred, and thought I must be under some hallucination. What
          do you suppose, then, was the feeling of others? Why, they attacked the jurors with a
          storm of disapproving shouts, and made it quite plain that this was more than they could
          stand. Accordingly, now that he is left to the mercies of the Licinian law, he seems to be
          in greater danger than ever. <note n="2" anchored="true">Having been acquitted on the
            charge of <foreign xml:lang="la">ambitus</foreign>, the only thing to be done with

            political club (<foreign xml:lang="la">sodalitas</foreign>) for corrupt purposes. The

            regard to the composition of the jury <bibl n="Cic. Planc. 36">pro Planc. 36</bibl>).
            Caelius therefore thinks that <foreign xml:lang="la">Messalla</foreign> will have less
            chance under it. </note> Besides this, on the day after the acquittal, Hortensius came
          into Curio's theatre <note n="3" anchored="true">Two wooden theatres that swung round,
            with spectators sitting in them, to form an amphitheatre for gladiators. Curio had

            <l>Tempest hissing through the shrouds.</l>
          </quote> This was the more noticed from the fact that Hortensius had reached old age
          without ever having been hissed, but on this occasion 'got it heartily enough to serve
          anyone for the whole of his life, and to make him sorry he had won his case. Of politics I
          have nothing to tell you. The active proceedings of Marcellus have died away, not from
          lack of energy, as it seems to me, but from policy. As to the consular elections, public
          opinion is quite at a loss. For myself, I have chanced upon one competitor who is noble
            <pb n="23"/> and one who acts the noble : for M. Octavius, son of Gnaeus, and C. Hirrus
          are standing with me. I tell you this because I know that it was on account of Hirrus that
          you were anxiously waiting for news of my election. However, as soon as you learn of my
          having been returned, I beg you to be taking measures as to the panthers. <note n="1"
            anchored="true">The office Caelius was seeking was that of curule aedile; as aedile he

            was the fashion to endeavour, in some way, to make their office notable by something

        <p> Is it so? Have I won? And do I send you frequent letters, which, as you were leaving,
          you said I should never take the trouble to do for you? It is even so, that is to say, if
          the letters I send reach you. And, indeed, I am all the more energetic about this because,
          being at leisure, I have nowhere to spend my little holiday with any pleasure. When you
          were at Rome I had an unfailing and most delightful resource for an idle day—to spend the
          holiday with you. I miss this exceedingly, so that not only do I feel myself to be all

          Yes! by Hercules. M. Octavius is unable to do much to soften the hostile feelings—and they

            at Mitylene. </note> would have caused me sorrow, yet the philosophic spirit with which
          you bear it delight—nevertheless, I should have preferred to have seen you. For I do not
          feel the pain much less when you are out of sight, while such pleasure as is possible
          would at any rate have been greater had I seen you. Therefore I shall not hesitate to
          endeavour to see you whenever I shall be conveniently able to do so. Meanwhile, such
          business as can be put before you by letter, and, as I think, can be brought to a
          conclusion, I will put before you now at once I will preface my request by asking you not
          to do anything for my sake against your own inclination; but if the matter is one which is
          important to me, and in no way of much importance to yourself, still only grant it in case
          of having first made up your mind to do so cheerfully. I am in thorough sympathy with
          Patron the Epicurean, except that I differ from him widely in philosophy. But not only at
          the very beginning in Rome, when he was paying attention to you as well as all your
          friends, did he also cultivate my acquaintance with special care, but recently also, after
          having gained all that he wanted in the way of personal profit and reward, he has
          continued to regard me as almost the first of his supporters and friends. Besides this, he
          was introduced <pb n="28"/> and recommended to me by Phaedrus, <note n="1" anchored="true"
            >An Epicurean who taught at Athens and at Rome. <foreign xml:lang="la">Philo</foreign>
            was an Academician, to which sect Cicero was in later years more drawn. Phaedrus came to
            Rome in <date when="-0088">B.C. 88</date>, and immediately won the devotion of the young
            Cicero (Brut. 306). </note> who, when I was a boy and before I knew Philo, was highly
          valued by me as a philosopher, and afterwards as, at any rate, a good, agreeable, and
          kindly man. This Patron, therefore, having written to me at Rome, begging me to reconcile
          you to him, and to ask you to grant him some ruined house or other once belonging to
          Epicurus, I did not write to you on the subject, because I did not want any plan of
          building which you might have to be hampered by a recommendation of mine. On my arrival at
          Athens, however, having been asked by the same person to write to you on the subject, I
          have granted his request, because all your friends agreed in saying that you had given up
          that building idea. If this is so, and if it is now of no importance to you, I would ask
          you, if some little offence has been caused you by the wrong-headedness of certain
          persons—and I know the class of men—to take a lenient view of the matter, either from your
          own great natural kindness or, if you like, out of compliment to me. For my part, if you
          ask me what I think about it myself, I neither see why he is so anxious for it, nor why
          you make difficulties; I only feel that it is much less natural for you to trouble
          yourself without reason, than for him to do so. However, I am sure that Patron's line of
          argument and the merits of his case are known to you. He says that he has to maintain his
          own honour and duty, the sanctity of a will, the prestige of Epicurus, the solemn
          injunction of Phaedrus, the home, the dwelling-place, the footprints of famous men. We may
          ridicule the man's entire life and the system which he follows in philosophy, if we take
          upon ourselves to find fault with what he is now contending for. But, by Hercules, since I
          am not very unfriendly to him or to others who find pleasure in such things, I think we
          must be indulgent to him for being so very keen about it. For even if he is wrong in this,
          it is a fault of the head, not the heart. But to come to the point—for I must mention this
          sooner or later—I love Pomponius Atticus as a second brother. Nothing can be <pb n="29"/>
          dearer or more delightful than he is to me. Atticus, then-not that he is of their sect
          (for he is cultivated to the highest degree in all liberal learning <note n="1"

            Latin, according to Cicero, generally had the same defect. See Brut. 131; Tuscul. 2.7:

          upon me as he has never done anything else, though he is the very reverse of self-seeking,
          the last person in the world to be troublesome in making requests; and he feels no doubt
          of my being able to obtain this favour from you on the slightest hint, even if you still
          had the intention of building. In the present circumstances, however, if he hears that you
          have laid aside your plan of building and that yet I have not obtained this favour from
          you, he will think, not, indeed, that you have been ungenerous towards me, but that I have
          been careless in what concerned himself. Wherefore I beg you to write word to your agents
          that the decree of the Areopagites, which they call a "minute," <note n="2"
            anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">u(pomnhmatismo/n</foreign>, "record," "memorial." This it
            appears from inscriptions was the technical word for a decree of the Areopagus, though
            other words are also found, such as <foreign xml:lang="grc">do/gma</foreign>, <foreign
              xml:lang="grc">eperw/thma</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="la">consultum</foreign>),
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)/doce</foreign>, etc. A series of inscriptions also shews
            that in the Roman period the Areopagus was an important executive body: thus we find it
            superintending the prosecutions of users of false weights and measures, and constantly
            joined with the council of 600 (or 500 later) in voting honours to benefactors. In one
            inscription (Add. 4315, n. C. I. G.) it is joined with the "Epicureans at Athens" and
            the theatrical guild in paying honour to a physician. The minute or record here to be
            canceled appears to be a grant or sale to Memmius of a building site in Athens, on which
            were the ruins of the house of Epicurus, which the Epicurean Patron wished to preserve.
          </note> may be canceled with your free consent. But I return to what I said at first.
          Before making up your mind to do this, I would have you be sure that you do it for my sake
          with a willing heart. At any rate have no doubt of this: if you do what I ask, I shall
          take it as a very great favour. Farewell. <pb n="30"/>

        <p> What! Do you suppose that I meant you to send me an account of gladiatorial matches, of
          postponements of trials, of robberies by Chrestus, and such things as, when I am at Rome,
          nobody ventures to retail to me? See what a high opinion I have of you—and not, indeed,
          undeservedly, for I have never yet known anyone with keener political instincts—I don't
          care for your writing to me even the daily occurrences in the most important affairs of
          the state, unless there is something specially affecting myself. Other people will write
          about them ; many will convey news of them: common report itself will bring many of them
          to my ears. Therefore it is not things past or present that I expect from you, but things
          to come—for you are a man who sees far in front of you—so that, having got a view of the
          ground plan of the Republic from your pen, I may satisfy myself as to what the future
          building is to be. As yet, however, I have no fault to find with you ; for it is
          impossible for you to see farther than any one of us, and especially myself, who have
          spent several days with Pompey in conversation exclusively political, which neither can
          nor ought to be committed to writing. Only take this as certain, that Pompey is an
          admirable citizen, and prepared in courage and wisdom alike to meet every contingency that
          needs to be provided against in the political situation. Wherefore devote yourself to him:
          he will receive you, believe me, with open arms. For he takes the same view, as we ever
          do, as to who are good and bad citizens. After spending exactly ten days in Athens, and
          having seen a great deal of our friend Caninius Gallus, <note n="1" anchored="true">L.

          <dateline>TRALLES, 28 JULY</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> I ARRIVED at Tralles on the 27th of July. There I 'found L. Lucilius waiting for me with
          your letter and message ; than whom you could have sent no man either more friendly to me,
          or, as I think, better suited to give the information I wanted, or endowed with more
          practical wisdom himself. For myself, I read your letter with great pleasure, and also
          listened carefully to Lucilius. For two reasons all mention of past services is now
          superfluous: first, because you think so—for you say in your letter that you thought what
          I wrote to you about our mutual services, though gratifying to you, was unnecessary,
          considering how far back they go—and, secondly, because our friendship is well established
          and our fidelity tried: I will therefore pass over that subject, though I will yet express
          the thanks which I owe you. For I have observed and learnt from your letter that in all
          your proceedings you kept in view the object of consulting for my interests, and of
          settling beforehand and, so to speak, prearranging everything which would make my
          administration easier and less complicated. When I tell you that this <pb n="39"/>
          kindness on your part excites the liveliest gratitude in me, it naturally follows that I
          wish you to think that it will ever be and is now an object dear to me, that first of all
          you and your friends, and then all the rest of the world also, should know that I am your
          very warm friend. If there are any people who are not clear on that point as yet, I think
          it is rather that they don't wish us to entertain such feelings than that they
          are-ignorant of our doing so. But I am sure they will not be ignorant of it: for the
          persons taking part in our drama will not be obscure, nor its action unimportant. But I
          wish all this to be shewn in performance rather than in anything said or written.
            <milestone unit="para"/>You say that the route I have planned out makes you somewhat
          doubtful whether you are likely to see me in the province. The facts are these. When
          talking to your freedman Phania at Brundisium, I remarked in the course of conversation
          that I should be glad to go to that part of the province first, which I thought would best
          meet your wishes. Whereupon he informed me that, as it was your wish to leave by sea, it
          would be very convenient to you if I approached the maritime portion of the province on
          board ship. I said I would do so: and so I should have done, had not our friend L. Clodius
          told me at Corcyra that I must by no means do so: that you would be at Laodicea to meet me
          when I arrived. That was a much shorter and more convenient route for me, especially as I
          thought that it was your preference. Your plans were afterwards changed. In these
          circumstances it will be easiest for you to arrange what is to be done: I will lay before
          you what my plan is. On the 31st of July I expect to be at Laodicea: I shall remain there
          for a very few days to get in some money due to me on an exchequer bill of exchange. I
          shall then direct my course to the army, so as to be at Iconium, as I think, about the
          13th of August. But if I am now making any mistake in thus writing—for I am at some
          distance both from my sphere of duty and the localities—as soon as I have begun my farther
          progress, I will employ the swiftest messengers, and write as often as I possibly can, to
          put before you the whole scheme of my days and routes. I have neither the courage nor the
          right to lay any burden upon you. Yet, as far as it may be so without inconvenience to
          you, it is <pb n="40"/> really of great importance to both of us that I should see you
          before you leave. If any accident, however, makes this impossible, you may yet feel
          certain of all the services that I can render you, exactly as if I had seen you. As to my
          own affairs, I shall not give you any written commissions until I have given up all hope
          of a personal interview. You tell me that you asked Scaevola <note n="1" anchored="true"
            >Perhaps Q. Mucius <foreign xml:lang="la">Scaevola</foreign>, who was with Quintus
            Cicero in Asia. He was tribune in <date when="-0054">B.C. 54</date>, and was therefore
            possibly a <foreign xml:lang="la">legatus</foreign> of Appius </note> to take charge of
          the province in your absence until my arrival. I saw him at Ephesus, and he spent the
          three days of my stay at Ephesus with me in a very cordial manner ; but I did not hear a
          word from him indicating any commission given him by you. I only wish he could have obeyed
          your wishes: for I don't think he was unwilling to do so. </p>

        </opener>
        <p> I envy you: such a budget of startling news is conveyed every day to you over there!
          First, the acquittal of Messalla, then his condemnation: the election of C. Marcellus to
          the consulship: M. Calidius, after losing his election, impeached by the two Gallii: P.
          Dolabella made one of the <foreign xml:lang="la">quindecimviri</foreign>. There is only
          one thing I don't envy you for—that you have lost a most interesting spectacle, and did
          not see the expression on the face of Lentulus Crus when he lost. But what a come down for
          him! He had been so confident, had made so sure of it! Dolabella himself had been so
          doubtful! And, by Hercules, if our friends the equites had not been too sharp-eyed, he
          would have won almost by the retirement of his opponent. The next item I don't think will
          surprise you, that Servaeus, after becoming tribune-designate, has been condemned. C.
          Curio is <pb n="41"/> candidate for the vacancy thus made by him. <note n="1"
            anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Messalla</foreign>, convicted (after his acquittal for <foreign
              xml:lang="la">ambitus</foreign>) under the Licinian law <foreign xml:lang="la">de
              sodalitiis</foreign> (see Letter CXCV). M. Calidius, praetor <date when="-0057">B.C.
              57</date>, accused now of <foreign xml:lang="la">ambitus</foreign> had himself
            formerly accused Q. Gallius on the same charge. P. <foreign xml:lang="la">Cornelius
              Dolabella</foreign>, afterwards son-in-law of Cicero, but a partisan of Caesar in the
            Civil War, is now elected as one of the <foreign xml:lang="la">quindecimviri sacris
              faciendis</foreign>. L. <foreign xml:lang="la">Cornelius</foreign> Lentulus Crus
              <foreign xml:lang="la">consul</foreign> in <date when="-0049">B.C. 49</date>, had been
            praetor <date when="-0058">B.C. 58</date>, a strong <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Optimate</foreign>. Of Servaeus nothing is known ; he is prosecuted for <foreign
              xml:lang="la">ambitus</foreign> between his election and the day of entering office,
            and being condemned, is <foreign xml:lang="la">ipso facto</foreign> incapable of taking
            it up. C. Curio, of whom we have heard so often, the pupil and friend of Cicero, of whom
            he hoped such high things, had ruined himself by his extravagant funeral games, and
            during his year of office was won over to Caesar's side by being relieved by him from
            his enormous debts. </note> It is remarkable how much alarm he inspires in many people,
          who don't know him and his easy-going character ; but, as I hope and desire, and to judge
          from his present attitude, he will prefer to side with the loyalist party and the senate.
          In his present frame of mind he is bubbling over with this intention. The root and origin
          of this feeling is that Caesar, who generally spares no expense in attaching to himself
          the friendship of the lowest characters, has treated him with very marked neglect. And in
          this there does seem to me to be a touch of humour—which has been noticed also to a great
          extent by the rest—that Curio, who never acts on any fixed plan, should be thought to be
          following a deliberate policy and a deep design in evading the counsels of those who had
          exerted themselves to oppose his election to the tribuneship —I mean the Laelii and
          Antonii and powerful men of that stamp. <milestone unit="para"/>There has been a somewhat
          longer interval than usual between this and my last letter, because the successive
          postponements of the elections kept me more than usually busy, and forced me to wait day
          after day for their result, that I might give you the information when all was over. I
          have waited to the 1st of August. There have been some hitches in the praetorian
          elections. Moreover, what will be the result of my own election I do not know: that of the
          plebeian Aediles' election indeed has, as far as Hirrus is concerned, amounted to a strong
          expression of opinion in my favour. For that foolish proposition of his (which we laughed
          at of old), and the promulgation of a law for the <pb n="42"/> appointment of a dictator,
          brought M. Caelius Vinicianus suddenly to the ground, and caused him to be loudly hooted
          when down. This was followed by a general demand that, after that, Hirrus should not be
          elected curule aedile. <note n="1" anchored="true">For Hirrus, too, had proposed that
            Pompey should he made dictator. The old dictatorship was forgotten ; what people
            remembered was Sulla's unconstitutional dictatorship and the proscriptions. </note> I
          hope that you will speedily hear about me the news you have hoped for, and about him what
          you have scarcely ventured to hope. <milestone unit="para"/>As to politics, I had by this
          time ceased to hope for any new development ; but at a meeting of the senate in the temple
          of Apollo on the 22nd of July, upon a motion being brought before it in reference to the
          pay of Pompey's soldiers, mention was made of the legion with which Pompey had furnished
          C. Caesar—in what division was it reckoned, for what purpose was it required? Pompey
          having answered that "it was in Gaul," he was compelled to say that "he would withdraw the
          legion." He didn't say this at once, but only on the subject being brought forward and
          under a fire of invective from his detractors. <note n="2" anchored="true">Pompey, though
            proconsul of Spain, was retained on the plea of the public service outside the city
              (<foreign xml:lang="la">ad urbem</foreign>), as proconsul with <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >imperium</foreign>. As such he commanded all troops in Italy (for the consuls, while
            in the city, had no military command). He also, by the special terms of his appointment
            as <foreign xml:lang="la">praefectus annonae</foreign>, had the right for five years
            from B.C. to enlist soldiers in any province. In <date when="-0055">B.C. 55</date> he
            had enlisted a legion in Cisalpine Gaul ; but in <date when="-0053">B.C. 53</date>, in
            view of a threatened rebellion throughout Transalpine Gaul, Caesar had asked' him to
            order this legion to join him, and Pompey had done so. We shall see that its withdrawal
            at the end of this year, under pretext of a Parthian war, was one of Caesar's alleged
            grievances (<bibl n="Caes. Civ. 6.1">Caes. B.C. 6.1</bibl>; B.C. i. 4, 11). Of the
            troops Pompey retained in Italy the main part were at <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Ariminum</foreign>, the frontier town of Italy proper and Gaul. Hence, when Caesar
            crossed the Rubicon in <date when="-0049">B.C. 49</date>, he found most of the towns on
            the eastern coast garrisoned by cohorts under Pompey's officers. </note> He was then
          asked about the appointment of a successor to C. Caesar; <note n="3" anchored="true">As to
            whether Caesar was to stay in Gaul over the elections of <date when="-0049">B.C.
              49</date>, or come home before the full term of his governorship granted him by the
            law had expired. </note> and on this point a resolution was passed that "Cn. Pompeius
          should return to the city as soon as possible, in order that the question of the
          succession to the provinces might be debated while he was in the house." For Pompey was on
            <pb n="43"/> the point of starting for Ariminum to join the army ; and in fact did go at
          once. I think that business will come on on the 13th of August. Some conclusion will be
          come to for certain, or a scandalous exercise of the veto will hinder it. For in the
          course of the debate Pompey let fall the expression, "Everybody ought to be obedient to
          the senate." For my part, however, there is nothing I look forward to so much as to
          hearing Paullus delivering his vote first as consul-elect. <note n="1" anchored="true">L.

        <p> How far you are anxious about the peaceful state of your province and the neighbouring
          regions I don't know: for myself, I am in great suspense. For if we could only arrange
          matters in such a fashion, that the war should just be of a magnitude to correspond with
          your forces, and that we should gain just enough success for a triumph, without
          encountering the serious contest awaiting you, then nothing could be so much to be wished.
          As it is, if the Parthian stirs at all, I know that the struggle will not be a slight one.
          Moreover, your army is scarcely large enough to hold a single pass. No one, however, takes
          that into account; but everything is expected from a man at the head of a public
          department, as though he had been refused nothing which was required to put him in the
          most absolute state of preparation. Added to this, I don't see any chance of a successor
          being named for you, owing to the controversy about the Gauls. Although on this point I
          think you have settled in your own mind what to do, nevertheless, to enable you to settle
          it the earlier, I thought, as I now foresee that contingency, that I ought to keep you
          informed. For you know the way things commonly go: a settlement of the Gauls will be
          passed ; some one' will be found to veto it ; then up will get some one else to veto the
          other provinces, unless the senate is allowed to pass a vote about them all without
          interference. This is the sort of game that will be kept up briskly and long, and so long
          that more than two years will be wasted in these intrigues. If I had any news in politics
          to tell you, I would have followed my usual habit of carefully retailing in my letter not
          only what had happened, but also what I expected to be the result of it. In point of fact,
          everything seems to have stuck, so to speak, in the ditch. Marcellus is trying to push
          that same motion about the provinces, but has <pb n="49"/> not as yet succeeded in getting
          a quorum. <note n="1" anchored="true">See Letter CCV. The motion of Marcellus about the
            provinces was to come on the 13th of August. According to Willem's <title>Le Sénat

              provinciis</foreign> enacted a minimum number senators for the passing of a decree as
            to the provinces. </note> If, after this year is over, Curio as tribune, and the same
          motion about the provinces come upon the stage, you cannot fail to see how easy it will be
          to stop all business, and how much Caesar, and those who care nothing for the Republic
          when their own interests are involved, hope that it may be so. </p>

        <p> "Is that the way you have treated Hirrus?" quoth you. Nay, if you only knew how easy it
          was, what an absence of even the shadow of a struggle, you would be ashamed that he ever
          ventured to come forward as a rival candidate with you. <note n="2" anchored="true">I.e.,
            for the augurship. </note> However, after his defeat, he keeps a smiling face, plays the
          honest citizen, and delivers his votes against Caesar ; blames the delay; attacks Curio,
          too, with considerable violence has quite changed his habits since his defeat. Besides, he
          who has hitherto never shown his face in the forum, and has had little to do with the law
          courts, now pleads cases of slaves claiming freedom, <note n="3" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Liberales causas.</foreign> This phrase does not occur in Cicero,
            though it does in Terence and in Quintilian. Some of the editors, therefore, have
            doubted as to its genuineness or its meaning here. The point seems to be that Hirrus, to
            gain popularity, now took up the cases of the humblest clients, but yet did not exert
            himself to come to the courts in the afternoons. Law business would generally end
            between twelve and one, but sometimes cases were renewed after the midday rest and meal.
          </note> though seldom after midday. I told you in one of my letters that the business of
          the provinces was to be settled on the 13th of August: well, the trial of Marcellus,
          consul-designate, interfered with <pb n="50"/> that. The matter was postponed till the 1st
          of September. They haven't even been able to make a house. I send this letter on the 2nd
          of September, up to which date nothing has been decided any more than before. As far as I
          can see this question will be transferred to next year unsettled, and, as well as I can
          guess, you will have to leave some one behind you to take charge of the province. <note
            n="1" anchored="true">Cicero, as a fact, did leave his quaestor in charge of the
            province. At the end of a year a provincial governor could do this, though he remained
            responsible through his nominee. </note> For the appointment of a successor is not freed
          from difficulties, now that it is sought to put the Gauls, the assignment of which is
          vetoed, under the same category as the rest of the provinces. <note n="2" anchored="true"
            >Up to this time the government of the Gauls had been arranged for till the end of <date
              when="-0049">B.C. 49</date> by a <foreign xml:lang="la">lex</foreign>. The proposal to
            have a successor allotted for them in the ordinary way raised the entire question of
            Caesar's rights, and the resolution in the senate to go on with allotting the provinces
            usual would be vetoed <foreign xml:lang="la">ab initio</foreign> in order to cover the
            case of the Gauls. </note> I have no doubt of this being the case: and it has made me
          the more determined to write to you, that you might prepare yourself for this eventuality.
            <milestone unit="para"/>In nearly every letter I have mentioned the subject of the
          panthers to you. It will be a disgrace to you that Patiscus has sent ten panthers to
          Curio, and that you should not send many times more. And these very beasts, as well as ten
          more from Africa, Curio has presented to me, lest you should think that he does not know
          how to make any presents except landed estates. If you will only not forget, and send for
          some men of Cibyra, and also transmit a letter to Pamphylia—for it is there that they are
          said to be mostly captured—you will effect what you choose. I am all the more earnest
          about this now, because I think I shall have to furnish the exhibition entirely apart from
          my colleague. Pray lay this injunction upon yourself. It is your way to take much trouble
          willingly, as it is mine for the most part to take none. In this business you have nothing
          to do but speak—that is, to give an order and a commission. For as soon as the beasts have
          been captured, you have men to feed and transport them in those whom I have sent over on
          the affair of Sittius's bond. I think also that, if you give me any hope in your letters,
          I shall send some more men across. <pb n="51"/>
          <milestone unit="para"/>I recommend to you M. Feridius, a Roman knight, a son of a friend
          of mine, a good and active young man, who is about to arrive in your province on business
          of his own, and I beg you to count him among the number of your friends. He wishes that
          certain lands, from which their townships draw revenue, should by your favour (which you
          can easily and honourably grant) be relieved from this burden: you will have obliged men
          who are both grateful and honest. <milestone unit="para"/>I would not have you think that

          to the men of the pavement ; all the most respectable men abstained from voting for him.
          Your friend Pompey plainly objects to Caesar keeping a province with an army, and being at
          the same time consul. However, the motion he himself made in the senate was that no decree

        </opener>
        <p> Ambassadors sent to me by Antiochus of Commagene having arrived at the camp at Iconium
          on the 28th of August, <pb n="52"/> and having announced to me that the son of the king of
          the Parthians, whose wife was the sister of the king of the Armenians, had arrived on the
          Euphrates with a very large force of Parthians, and a great host of other nations besides,
          and had actually begun the passage of the Euphrates, and that it was reported that the
          Armenian king was about to make a raid upon Cappadocia—I thought that, considering our
          close friendship, I ought to write and tell you this news. I have sent no public despatch
          for two reasons: first, because the ambassadors said that the Commagenian himself had at
          once sent messengers and a despatch to the senate; and, secondly, because I believed that
          M. Bibulus, proconsul of Syria, who started thither by sea from Ephesus about the 13th of
          August, seeing that he had had the wind in his favour, had by this time arrived in his own
          province, and I thought that the senate was sure to get more definite information on all
          points in a despatch from him. For myself, considering the circumstances and the gravity
          of the war, my chief anxiety is to retain by my own leniency and purity, and the loyalty
          of our allies, what I can scarcely hope to retain by the amount of my forces and material
          resources. I would beg you, on your part, to continue your habitual affection for me and

        <p> When I compare my course of action with yours, though in maintaining our friendship I do
          not allow myself greater credit than I do you, yet I am more satisfied with my conduct <pb
            n="53"/> than with yours. For at Brundisium I asked Phania—and I imagined that I saw
          clearly his fidelity to you and knew what a high place he had in your confidence—to tell
          me to what part of the province he thought you would like me to come in taking over the
          succession. Having been answered by him that I could not please you more than by going by
          sea to Sida, <note n="1" anchored="true">In <foreign xml:lang="la">Pamphylia</foreign>,
            modern Esky Adalia, then possessing a good harbour, much used by the pirates before
            Pompey¹s war.</note> although the arrival there was not very dignified <note n="2"
            anchored="true">An arrival by sea must necessarily prevent much of the state and outward
            show that the governor would like to have round him on entering his province. Caesar had
            the same thought apparently, when he gives as a motive for building his bridge on the
            Rhine that crossing by boats was hardly consonant with the "dignity" of the Roman
            people. </note> and much less convenient for me on many accounts, I yet said that I
          would do so. Again, having met L. Clodius in Corcyra—a man so closely attached to you,
          that in talking to him I seemed to be talking to you—I told him that I meant to arrange
          for my first arrival to be at the point at which Phania had requested that it should be.
          Thereupon, after thanking me, he begged me very strongly to go straight to Laodicea: that
          you wished to be on the very frontier of the province, in order to quit it at the first
          moment: nay, that, had I not been a successor whom you were anxious to see, you would most
          likely have quitted before you were relieved. And this last agreed with the letter which I
          had received in Rome, from which I thought that I perceived how much in a hurry you were
          to depart. I answered Clodius that I would do so, and with much greater pleasure than if I
          had had to do what I had promised Phania. Accordingly, I changed my plan and at once sent
          a letter in my own writing to you; and this, I learnt from your letter, reached you in
          very good time. With my conduct I am, for my part, quite satisfied; for nothing could be
          more cordial. Now, on the other hand, consider your own. Not only were you not at the
          place where you might have seen me earliest, but you had gone such a distance as made it
          impossible for me to overtake you even, within the thirty days fixed by, I think, the
          Cornelian law. <note n="3" anchored="true">The <foreign xml:lang="la">lex</foreign>
            Cornelia of <foreign xml:lang="la">Sulla de ordinandis provinciis</foreign>, one of the
            provisions of which was that a retiring governor must leave his province within thirty
            days of the arrival of his successor. </note> Such a course of action on your part <pb
            n="54"/> must appear to those who are ignorant of our feelings to each other to indicate
          one who, to put it at the mildest, is a stranger and desirous of avoiding a meeting, while
          mine must seem that of the most closely united and affectionate of friends. And, after
          all, before reaching my province, I received a letter from you, in which, though you
          informed me that you were starting for Tarsus, you yet held out no uncertain hope of my
          meeting you. Meanwhile, certain persons, I am ready to believe out of spite—for that is a
          vice widely spread and to be found in many—yet who had managed to get hold of some
          plausible grounds for their gossip, being unacquainted with the constancy of my feelings,
          tried to alienate my affection from you, by saying that you were holding an assize at
          Tarsus, were issuing many enactments, deciding actions, delivering judgments, though you
          might have guessed that your successor had by this time taken over your province—things
          (they remarked) not usually done even by those who expect to be relieved shortly. I was
          not moved by the talk of such persons; nay, more, I assure you, that if you performed any
          official act, I was prepared to consider myself relieved from trouble, and to rejoice that
          from being a government of a year, which I regarded as too long, it had been reduced
          nearly to one of eleven months, if in my absence the labour of one month were subtracted.
          One thing, however, to speak candidly, does disturb me—that, considering the weakness of
          my military force, the three cohorts which are at their fullest strength should be absent,
          and that I should not know where they are. But what causes me most annoyance of all is
          that I do not know where I am likely to see you, and have been the slower to write to you,
          because I was expecting you in person. from day to day ; and meanwhile I did not receive
          so much as a letter to tell me what you were doing or where I was to see you. Accordingly,
          I have sent you the commander of my reserve—men, Decimus Antonius, a gallant officer and
          possessed of my fullest confidence, to take over the cohorts, if you think well, in order
          that, before the suitable season of the year is gone, I may be able to accomplish
          something practical. It was in that department that I had hoped, both from our friendship
          and your letter, to have the advantage of your advice, of which I do not even now despair.
          But the truth <pb n="55"/> is that, unless you write to me, I cannot even guess when or
          where I am to see you. For my part, I will take care that friends and enemies alike
          understand that I am most warmly attached to you: of your feelings towards me you do
          appear to have given the ill-disposed some grounds for 'thinking differently: if you will
          put that straight I shall be much obliged to you. That you may also be able to calculate
          at what place you may meet me without a breach of the Cornelian law, note this—I entered
          the province on the last day of July: I am on my way to Cilicia through Cappadocia: I
          break up the camp from Iconium on this last day of August. <note n="1" anchored="true"
            >Going to <foreign xml:lang="la">Cybistra, in Cappadocia</foreign>, where he pitched his
            camp. </note> With these facts before you, if you think by reckoning days and routes you
          may meet me, please settle at what place that may be most conveniently done, and on what
          day. <note n="2" anchored="true">As the thirty days within which the outgoing governor was
            required by the law to quit his province were now expired, it is difficult to see an

          <salute>TO THE MAGISTRATES AND SENATE</salute>
          <dateline>CYBISTRA (SEPTEMBER)</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> M. Tullius Cicero, son of Marcus, greets the consuls, praetors, tribunes, and senate. If
          you are well, I am glad. I and the army are well. <milestone unit="para"/>Having entered
          the province on the last day of July, not having been able to arrive earlier owing to the
          difficulty of the journey both by land and sea, I thought the thing most suitable to my
          office, and most conducive to the public welfare, was to provide everything affecting the
          army and its active service. These arrangements having been made by me with more care and
          energy than means or sufficient supplies, and messages and letters reaching me nearly
          every day concerning an invasion of the province of Syria by the Parthians, I thought that
          I ought to direct my march through Lycaonia, the Isaurians, and Cappadocia. For there was
          very strong reason to conjecture that, should the Parthians endeavour to quit Syria and
          invade my province, they would march through Cappadocia, as being most completely open to
          them. Accordingly, I marched with the army through that part of Cappadocia which borders
          on Cilicia, and pitched my camp at Cybistra, which is a town at the foot of Mount Taurus,
          in order that Artavasdes, the Armenian king, whatever his disposition, might know that an
          army of the Roman people was not far from his frontier ; and that I might have in as close
          contact as possible king Deiotarus, a sovereign who is most loyal and devoted to our
          Republic, since his advice and material support might be of assistance to the public
          interests. Having my camp in this place, and having sent the cavalry into Cilicia—in order
          that my arrival, having been notified to the communities in that region, might confirm the
          loyal dispositions of all, and at the same time that I might get early information of what
          was going on in Syria— <pb n="62"/> I thought I ought to give the three days of my stay in
          that camp to a high and necessary duty. For, seeing that a formal resolution of yours had
          imposed upon me the duty of protecting king Ariobarzanes (surnamed Eusebes and
          Philorhomaeus), of defending the personal safety of that sovereign and the integrity of
          his dominions, and of being the guardian of king and kingdom alike: and seeing that you
          had appended a declaration that the safety of that sovereign was a matter of great concern
          to the people and senate—a decree such as had never been passed by our house concerning
          any king before—I thought myself bound to report the expression of your opinion to the
          king, and to promise him my protection and a faithful and energetic support, in order
          that, as his personal safety and the integrity of his dominions had been commended to my
          care, he might communicate to me anything he wished to be done. Having, in the presence of
          my council, communicated these things to the king, he began his reply by the proper
          expression of his warmest thanks to you: and then went on to thank me also, saying that he
          looked upon it as a very great and honourable distinction that his personal safety should
          be a matter of concern to the senate and people of Rome, and that I should exhibit such
          energy as to put beyond doubt my own good faith and the weight of your recommendation.
          And, indeed, at this first interview, he also assured me of what I was very delighted to
          hear, that he neither knew nor had a suspicion of any plots either against his own life or
          against his kingdom. After I had congratulated him and said that I rejoiced to hear it,
          and yet had advised him as a young man to remember the disaster of his father's death, to
          protect himself with vigilance, and, in accordance with the injunction of the senate, to
          take measures for his safety, he then left me and returned to the town of Cybistra.
          However, next day he came to visit me in the camp, accompanied by his brother Ariarathes
          and some elder men, who had been his father's friends. In a state of agitation and with
          tears in his eyes—his brother and friends showing the same signs of distress—he began
          appealing to my good faith and the charge imposed on me by you. On my asking with surprise
          what had occurred, he said that "information of an undoubted conspiracy had been
          communicated to him, <pb n="63"/> which had been withheld from him before my arrival,
          because those who might have denounced it to him had kept silence through fear, but that
          now, relying upon my protection several persons had boldly informed him of what they knew:
          that among these his most devoted brother had told him" (a story which the latter repeated
          in my hearing) "that he had been solicited to aim at becoming king: that so long as his
          brother was alive he could not accept that suggestion ; but that from fear of the danger
          he had never revealed the circumstance." After this speech I advised the king that he
          should take every precaution to preserve his life ; and I exhorted the friends, who had
          enjoyed the confidence of his father and grandfather, to guard the life of their sovereign
          with all care and vigilance, warned by his father's most lamentable murder. Upon the king
          asking me for some cavalry and cohorts from my army, though I was fully aware that in view
          of your senatorial decree I was not only authorized, but even bound to comply, yet, since
          the public interests demanded, owing to the news daily arriving from Syria, that I should
          lead the army as soon as possible to the frontiers of Cilicia—and since the king, now that
          the plot had been denounced, seemed not to be in need of an army of the Roman people, but
          to be capable of defending himself by his own resources, I urged him to learn his first
          lesson in the art of ruling by taking measures to preserve his life: that upon those by
          whom he had discovered that a plot was being laid against him he should exercise his
          sovereign rights: punish those who must be punished, relieve the rest from fear: use the
          protection of my army rather to inspire fear in the guilty than to keep up a state of
          civil war: the result would be no doubt that all, having been made acquainted with the
          decree of the senate, would understand that in accordance with your resolution I should
          protect the king if necessary. <milestone unit="para"/>Having thus encouraged him, I broke
          up my camp there, and began my march into Cilicia, leaving behind me on my departure from
          Cappadocia an impression that by your policy my arrival, owing to a strange and almost
          providential accident, had relieved from an actual plot a sovereign to whom you had given
          unsolicited that title in most complimentary terms, whom you had entrusted to my honour,
            <pb n="64"/> and whose safety you had declared in a decree to be a matter of great
          concern to you. I thought it was not improper that my despatch should inform you of this
          circumstance, in order that you might learn from what almost happened that you had long
          before taken the precautions necessary to prevent it: and I have been all the more ready
          to give you the information, because in king Ariobarzanes I think I have detected such
          signs of virtue and ability, as well as of good faith and loyalty to you, that you appear
          to have had good reason for all the care and energy you have devoted to his protection.

          <salute>TO THE MAGISTRATES AND SENATE</salute>
          <dateline>CILICIA, 22 SEPTEMBER</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> M. Tullius Cicero, son of Marcus, proconsul, greets the consuls, praetors, tribunes, and
          senate. If you are well, I am glad. I and the army are well. <milestone unit="para"
          />Although I had undoubted assurance that the Parthians had crossed the Euphrates with
          nearly all their forces, yet, believing that more definite information could be sent you
          on these points by the proconsul M. Bibulus, I concluded that it was not incumbent on me
          to mention in a public despatch reports reaching me concerning the province of another.
          Having since then, however, received information on the most unquestionable authority-from
          legates, messengers, and despatches—whether I considered the importance of the matter
          itself, or the fact of not having yet heard of Bibulus's arrival <pb n="66"/> in Syria, or
          that the conduct of this war was almost as much my business as that of Bibulus, I came to
          the conclusion that it was my duty to write you word of what had reached my ears. The
          legates of king Antiochus of Commagene were the first to inform me that large bodies of
          Parthians had begun to cross the Euphrates. On the receipt of this report, as there were
          certain persons who thought that full credit could not be given to that sovereign, I made
          up my mind that I must wait for more trustworthy information. On the 18th of September,
          whilst marching into Cilicia at the head of my army, on the frontier between Lycaonia and
          Cappadocia, a despatch was handed to me from Tarcondimotus, who is considered to be the
          most faithful ally and the most devoted friend of the Roman people beyond Mount Taurus,
          announcing that Pacorus, son of Orodes, the king of the Parthians, had crossed the
          Euphrates with a very large body of Parthian cavalry, and had pitched his camp at Tyba,
          and that consequently a very serious commotion had been caused in the province of Syria.
          On the same day a despatch on the same subject reached me from Iamblichus, phylarch of the
          Arabians, <note n="1" anchored="true">Of these petty princes, Antiochus had been
            established in <foreign xml:lang="la">Commagene</foreign> in <date>B.C. <date to="-62"
                from="-63">63</date>-62</date> by Pompey, as also probably Tarcondimotus in part of
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Cilicia</foreign>. Iamblichus, the Bedouin chief, was put to
            death by Antony in <date when="-0031">B.C. 31</date>, but his son was restored by
            Augustus. He had also no doubt owed his establishment or restoration to Pompey in <date
              when="-0063">B.C. 63</date>. </note> who is generally considered to be well-disposed
          and friendly to our Republic. Though I was fully aware that, on receipt of this
          information, our allies were unsettled in their feelings and wavering from the expectation
          of political change, I yet hoped that those whom I had already visited, and who had seen
          the mildness and purity of my administration, had been made more devoted to the Roman
          people, and that Cilicia, too, would become more certainly loyal when it had once felt the
          advantage of my equitable rule. Acting at once from this motive, and also with a view to
          put down those of the Cilicians who are in arms, and to show the enemy in Syria that the
          army of the Roman people, so far from retiring on receipt of that news, was actually
          approaching nearer, I determined to lead it right up to Mount Taurus. But if my authority
          has any weight with you—especially in matters which you only know by report, but which are
          all <pb n="67"/> but passing under my eyes—I strongly urge and advise you to take measures
          for the defence of these provinces: it is over-late already, but better late than never.
          For myself, you are well aware how slenderly supplied and how imperfectly furnished with
          troops, in view of the expected gravity of this war, you have despatched me. And it was
          not from the blindness of vanity, but from a modest scruple as to refusing, that I did not
          decline this business. For I have never considered any danger so formidable, as to make me
          wish to avoid it in preference to obeying your will. But at this moment the matter is of
          such a nature, that unless you promptly despatch into these provinces an army on the same
          scale as you are wont to employ for the most important war, there is the most imminent
          danger of our having to give up all those provinces, on which the revenues of the Roman
          people depend. Again, there is this reason for your not resting any hopes on a levy in the
          province—that men are not numerous, and that such as there are fly in every direction at
          the first alarm. Again, what this class of soldier is worth in his opinion has been shown
          by that gallant officer, M. Bibulus: for, though you had granted him leave to hold a levy
          in Asia, he has declined to do so. <note n="1" anchored="true">A governor of one province
            could not hold levies in another without special grant of the senate. An exception had
            been proposed for Pompey in <date when="-0057">B.C. 57</date>, when he was appointed
              <foreign xml:lang="la">praefectus</foreign>
            <foreign xml:lang="la">annonae</foreign>, and apparently was made in and after his
            consulships of <date when="-0055">B.C. 55</date> and 52. </note> For auxiliaries raised
          from the allies, owing to the harshness and injustice of our rule, are either so weak that
          they can do us little service, or so disaffected to us that it seems improper to expect
          anything from them or trust anything to them. Both the loyalty and the forces, whatever
          their amount, of king Deiotarus I reckon as being at our service. Cappadocia has nothing
          to give. Other kings and despots are not to be relied upon either in regard to their
          resources or their loyalty. For myself, in spite of this short supply of soldiers, I shall
          certainly show no lack of courage, nor, I hope, of prudence either. What will happen is
          uncertain. I pray that I may be able to secure my safety! I will certainly secure my
          honour. <pb n="68"/>

        </opener>
        <p> ALTHOUGH, as far as I have been able to gather from your letter, I see that you won't
          read this till you are at the gates of Rome, <note n="1" anchored="true">Appius remained
            outside the gates (<foreign xml:lang="la">ad urbem</foreign>, not <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >in urbe</foreign>) because he claimed a triumph, of which, however, <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Dolabella</foreign> baulked him. See Letter CCXLI. </note> when the
          extremely reckless gossip of provincials will have become quite stale, yet, as you have
          written to me at such length about what unprincipled men are saying, I thought I ought to
          be careful to give your letter a brief answer. Two clauses of your epistle, however, must
          in a manner be passed over in silence: for they contain nothing that is definite or
          precise, beyond saying that alike by my looks and my silence I had shown that I was no
          friend to you: and that this had been made unmistakable both on my judicial seat, when
          business was going on, and at certain social parties. I can well understand that there is
          nothing in all this; yet, though there is nothing in it, I fail to understand even what
          the allegation is. I know thus much, indeed—that many observations of a very marked
          character, made by me both from the high official seat and on the level of private
          intercourse, which were exceedingly complimentary to you, and indicated an anxious desire
          to acknowledge the close ties between us, might have with strict truth been reported to
          you. For as to the legates, <note n="2" anchored="true">Legates sent, as was often the
            case, to commend Appius at Rome and support his claim to a triumph. They were sent at
            the expense of their own cities, and the system was often much abused and became a heavy
            burden on the states. </note> what could I have done in better taste or with greater
          regard to equity, than to diminish the expenses of states that were in great financial
          distress, and yet at the same time to detract nothing from your honour, especially as it
          was in answer to the petition of the states themselves? For <pb n="69"/> I had not been
          aware of the scale on which deputations were being sent on your account. When I was at
          Apamea, the head men of many states informed me that large sums were being voted for
          legates, though the states were insolvent At this, many thoughts occurred to me at once.
          First, I did not think that you—a man of wisdom, and, to use the jargon of the day, a man
          of "culture "—took any pleasure in deputations of that sort: and I believe I argued to
          that effect at some length in court at Synnada. In the first place (I said) Appius
          Claudius was commended to the senate and people of Rome, not by the evidence of the people
          of Midaeium (for it was in that state that the subject was started), but in the natural
          course of things: and, in the second place, I had seen many cases in which deputations
            <note n="1" anchored="true">These complimentary <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >legationes</foreign>, he means, were not heard in the senate. Their number created a
            certain effect, just as petitions are not noticed in the House of Commons, though if
            numerous they may form some ground for action. </note> had come to Rome to commend
          certain persons, but I never remembered any instance of a hearing being granted them, to
          deliver their panegyric at any particular time or place I was pleased (I said) with their
          display of feeling in being grateful to you for your services; but their whole idea
          appeared to me quite superfluous. If, however, they wished by that measure to show their
          zeal, I should commend any man who did it at his own expense; should allow of it if the
          expense to the state did not exceed the law; should refuse permission if it were
          unlimited. Well, what fault can be found with that? The only possible one is what you go
          on to say—that certain persons considered my edict to have been expressly framed with a
          view to hinder these deputations of yours. Really, I think it is not so much those who
          argue thus who do me a wrong, as he who opens his ears to such a proposition. I drew up my
          edict at Rome: I never added a word to it except a clause which the <foreign xml:lang="la"
            >publicani</foreign> in their interview with me at Samos, asked me to transfer word for
          word from your edict to my own. The clause referring to the diminishing the expenses of
          the states was very carefully worded; and in that clause there are some new provisions
          advantageous to the states, with which I am greatly pleased: but this clause, which has
          given birth to the suspicion of <pb n="70"/> my elaborating something meant to be
          offensive to you, is taken from former edicts. For I was not so foolish as to hold that
          men were being deputed on their own private affairs, who were being sent, in the first
          place, in your interests while you were still in possession of <foreign xml:lang="la"
            >imperium</foreign>; and, in the second place, were being sent to deliver a vote of
          thanks, not in any private assembly, but in the council chamber of the whole world, the
          senate. Nor when I ordered that no one was to go without my leave, did I exclude those
          from doing so who might be unable to follow me to the camp and across the Taurus. That, in
          fact, is the most ridiculous thing in your letter: for what need was there for their
          following me to the camp or crossing the Taurus, when I arranged my journey from Laodicea
          as far as Iconium, with the express object of the magistrates and legates of all the
          dioceses north of Taurus, <note n="1" anchored="true">He means the three dioceses—properly
            belonging to the province of Asia, and afterwards reunited to it-Cibyra, <foreign

          there, meeting me? Unless you suppose that no deputations were arranged till I had crossed
          the Taurus! That is certainly not so. For when I was at Laodicea, at Apamea, at Synnada,
          at Philomelium, at Iconium, in all of which towns I made some stay, there were ready
          waiting for me all the deputations of that kind. And yet I would have you know this, that
          I made no decree about diminishing or wholly remitting the expense of embassies, except
          such as the head men of the states asked for—that quite unnecessary expenses should not be
          added to the selling of the contract for the tribute, <note n="2" anchored="true">The
              <foreign xml:lang="la">tributum</foreign> in <foreign xml:lang="la">Cilicia</foreign>,
            unlike the taxes in Asia, was not sold to <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign>,
            but left to each state to collect. If; however the states fell into arrears, a contract
            for its collection was sold to <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign>, who put the
            screw on more tightly than the local tax-gatherers. </note> and the very galling
          exaction (as you know) of the poll-tax and door-tax. Now, when at the instigation not only
          of justice but of pity, I undertook to relieve from their distress the states that had
          been ruined, and ruined, too, chiefly through their own magistrates, I could not be
          indifferent to that source of unnecessary expense. For your part, if observations of that
          nature were reported to you in regard to me, you ought not to have believed them. But if
          you like this way of attributing to others whatever occurs to your own mind, you are
          introducing <pb n="71"/> a style of conversation between friends which is not very
          courteous. Whereas if I had ever had any thought of casting a slur on your reputation in
          the province, I should not have referred to your son-in-law, nor to your freedman at
          Brundisium, nor to your prefect of engineers at Corcyra, as to where you wished me to
          come. <note n="1" anchored="true">See Letters CCIV, CCXII. The only explanation of the
            reference to Appius's son-in-law must be that Cicero saw Gnaeus Pompeius at his father's
            villa at <foreign xml:lang="la">Tarentum</foreign> But most editors would omit <foreign
              xml:lang="la">ad generum</foreign>. </note> Wherefore, on the advice of the greatest
          philosophers, who have written most brilliantly on the conduct of friendship, you may
          banish all expressions such as "they argued," "I maintained in opposition," "they said
          so," "I denied it." Do you suppose that I have never been told anything about you? Not
          even this—that, after having desired me to come to Laodicea, you yourself crossed the
          Taurus? That on the same days as I was holding assizes at Apamea, Synnada, and Philomelium
          you were doing so at Tarsus? I will say no more, lest I should seem to be doing exactly
          what I blame in you. I will only say this, and I feel it: if you feel in your own heart
          what you say that others are remarking, you are much to blame: but if others say these
          things to you, you are not entirely without fault in listening to them. My conduct in
          every particular of our friendship will be found to be consistent and sincere. But if
          anyone tries to make out that I had some ulterior object in view, could there be a better
          example of my supposed cunning than that, having always defended you while abroad—and that
          though I had no idea of ever requiring your defence while abroad myself—I should now give
          you the best possible excuse for abandoning me in my absence from town? I except from this
          denial one species of conversation, in which on very many occasions something is said,
          such as I presume you would prefer not being said—I mean when any abusive remark is made
          about any of your legates, prefects, or military tribunes. But even in regard to this
          nothing, by Hercules, has occurred in my hearing of a graver character, or reflecting on
          more persons, than what Clodius mentioned to me at Corcyra, when under that head he made a
          very loud complaint that you had been unfortunate in the dishonesty of others. Such
          observations as these, seeing that they are frequently <pb n="72"/> made, and do not
          reflect, in my opinion, on your personal honour, I have never provoked, but neither have I
          exerted myself to repress them. If there is anyone who thinks that no man is ever
          sincerely reconciled with another, he does not prove our want of sincerity, but betrays
          his own, and at the same time shows that he thinks no worse of me than he does of you. But
          if, again, there is anyone who dislikes my administration in the province, and considers
          himself injured by a certain dissimilarity between my arrangements and yours—the fact
          being that we have both acted conscientiously, though we took different lines—such a man I
          do not care to have for a friend. Your liberality, as became a great noble, was on a
          larger scale in the province; if mine is somewhat more restricted—though your second year,
          owing to the hardness of the times, somewhat clipped the wings of your generous and
          bountiful nature—men ought not to be surprised, since I have always been naturally
          disinclined to be lavish at the expense of others, and am influenced by the same hard
          times as others are, <quote>That I am sour to them to keep my conscience sweet.</quote>
          Your giving me information about affairs in the city was pleasant to me, both for its own
          sake, and because you showed your intention of keeping all my commissions in mind. Among
          them there is one that I beg you to regard as supreme—see that to the business in which I
          am now engaged there should be no addition made either of responsibility or time; and to
          ask Hortensius, our fellow augur and friend, if ever he has thought or done anything for
          my sake, to give up this two-year proposal of his also, than which nothing could be more
          unfriendly to me. To give you the information you want about my proceedings, I left Tarsus
          on the 7th of October for Amanus. I write this on the day after that in camp, in the
          territory of Mopsuhestia. Whatever I do I will write and tell you, nor will I ever send a
          letter home to my family without adding one directed to be delivered to you. As to your
          question about the Parthians, I think they were not Parthians at all. The Arabs who were
          there with a semi-Parthian equipment, are said to have all gone back. People say that
          there is no <pb n="73"/> enemy in Syria. <note n="1" anchored="true">Of course this
            information is subsequent to the public despatch preceding; hut neither that nor this
            appears to be accurate. The Parthians had crossed the Euphrates and had been repulsed by
            Cassius, as we shall see; but Cicero is always unwilling to give credit either to
            Cassius or Bibulus in this matter. </note> Pray write to me as often as possible about
          both your own and my affairs, and on the state of the Republic generally. About the last I
          am the more anxious, because I gather from your letter that our friend Pompey is about to
          go to Spain. <note n="2" anchored="true">To his province, to which, however, he never

          <salute>M. CAELIUS RUFUS TO CICERO (IN CILICIA)</salute>
          <dateline>ROME (OCTOBER)</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> Though I have some political news for you, yet I don't think I have anything to tell you
          that you will be more glad to hear than this: I have to inform you that C. Sempronius
          Rufus—Rufus, your pet darling —has been convicted of vexatious prosecution with universal
          applause. You ask, in what case? Well, he indicted M. Tuccius (who had formerly prosecuted
          him) after the Roman games for illegal violence under the <foreign xml:lang="la">lex
            Plotia</foreign>. His object was this: he saw that, unless some defendant were put on
          the list for trial whose case could take priority, he would have to stand his own trial
          this year. Moreover, he had no doubt what would happen to him. <note n="3" anchored="true"
            >A prosecution <foreign xml:lang="la">de vi</foreign> took precedence of one <foreign
              xml:lang="la">de ambitu</foreign>. Therefore, if he prosecuted Tuccius for <foreign
              xml:lang="la">vis</foreign>, Tuccius would have to wait before he could bring his
            accusation <foreign xml:lang="la">de ambitu</foreign>. As there was no case in the
            accusation <foreign xml:lang="la">de vi</foreign>, Sempronius was accused of bringing a
            vexatious action, i.e., an action not sincerely meant to be what it pretended, but begun
            merely for obstructive purposes. Roman games, 4th-19th September. </note> This
          prosecution was a small favour he preferred to do to his accuser more than anyone else!
          Accordingly, without anyone backing his indictment, he came down into the forum and
          indicted Tuccius. As soon as I heard of it, I hurried without waiting for a summons to the
          defendant's bench. I rose, and without saying a word on the merits of <pb n="74"/> the
          case, I showed up his whole character and career, even bringing in the matter of
          Vestorius, and telling the story of his having surrendered to you as a favour "whatever
          Vestorius held contrary to his own legal rights." <note n="1" anchored="true">Reading and
            interpretation are doubtful. Apparently Cicero, as arbitrator between Sempronius and
            Vestorius, had decided in favour of the latter; but Sempronius, while refusing to
            submit, pretended to yield as a favour what (as he alleged) Vestorius was wrongfully
            withholding from him, the point being that he himself is in the wrong all the time. </note>
          <milestone unit="para"/>The following hotly contested case is also at present taking up
          the attention of the forum. <note n="2" anchored="true">The story is difficult to follow.
            C. Claudius <foreign xml:lang="la">Pulcher</foreign>, after his praetorship of Asia
              (<date>B.C. <date to="-53" from="-56">56</date>-53</date>), was in <date when="-0051"
              >B.C. 51</date> condemned for extortion. He either died or left Rome, and his property
            was not sufficient to pay the damages. <foreign xml:lang="la">Pausanias</foreign>
            (unknown to us) asked leave to prosecute his <foreign xml:lang="la">legatus</foreign>
            (or other official), M. Servilius, for wrongful possession of money (<foreign
              xml:lang="la">quo ea pecunia peroenisset</foreign>), but the praetor <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Laterensis</foreign> decided that there was no case to go into court.
            Then Pilius began a prosecution of him <foreign xml:lang="la">de repetundis</foreign>,
            but this was anticipated by another by Appius (son of C. Claudius), who prosecuted him
            for wrongful possession, being able to make out a better <foreign xml:lang="la">prima
              facie</foreign> case. The votes in this trial were equal, but Servilius was left in a
            questionable position by an irregularity of the praetor in recording the verdict.
            Caelius says that he is now going to be prosecuted by Pilius on the criminal charge of
            extortion. The young Appius had made a mess of it, had exposed his own and his father's
            malpractices, and was himself now being prosecuted by members of Servilius's family.
          </note> M. Servilius had, as was to be expected from his previous conduct, become utterly
          bankrupt, and had nothing left which he was not prepared to sell to anybody, and when he
          became my client had already exposed himself to the most violent scandal. But when
          Pausanias initiated proceedings against him for "fraudulent possession of the money" (I
          acting as counsel for the defence), the praetor Laterensis declined to allow the action.
          Then Q. Pilius, the connexion of our friend Atticus, initiated proceedings against him for
          extortion. Much talk at once arose about the case, and strong remarks began to be made
          about a conviction. Moved by this storm of popular feeling, Appius the younger laid an
          information as to a sum of money having been transferred from his father's estate to
          Servilius, and stated that 81 sestertia (about £648) had been deposited to enable him to
          secure the collusive failure of the prosecution. <note n="3" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Praevaricatio</foreign>, where the professed prosecuters
            voluntarily, and for corrupt motives, allow the case to go against them. </note> You are
          surprised at this <pb n="75"/> folly; nay, what would you have said if you had heard him
          conducting the case, and the admissions which he made, foolish in the extreme as far as he
          was himself concerned, and positively shameful as regards his father? <note n="1"
            anchored="true">Because they confessed to his father having tried to get off by
            collusion with the prosecution, thereby acknowledging his guilt. </note> The jury called
          upon to consider their verdict was the same as that which had assessed the damages in the
          former case. The votes having turned out to be equal, Laterensis, from imperfect
          acquaintance with the laws, announced the verdict of each of the <foreign xml:lang="la"
            >decuriae</foreign> separately, and finally, according to the custom of the praetors,
          gave the decision "for the defendant." <note n="2" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Non redigam</foreign>, lit. "I will not exact the money," i.e.,
            the money alleged to have been fraudulently received. </note> After leaving the court,
          Servilius being thenceforth regarded as acquitted, Laterensis read the 101st clause of the
          law, which contains the words "The verdict of the majority of the jurors shall be good and
          decisive." He thereupon did not enter him on the records as acquitted, but only entered a
          statement of the verdict of the several <foreign xml:lang="la">decuriae</foreign>. <note
            n="3" anchored="true">Such a record would not, on the face of it, prove acquittal,
            because a man might be acquitted by a small majority in two <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >decuriae</foreign> and yet be condemned by so large a majority in the third as not to
            have a majority of the whole jury in his favour as required by law. </note> Upon Appius,
          however, applying for a new trial, he said that he had consulted L. Lollius <note n="4"
            anchored="true">Apparently a jurisconsult, but he is unknown. </note> and would record
          the facts. So that now, being neither acquitted nor condemned, Servilius will be at the
          disposal of Pilius for an action for extortion, with a reputation already damaged. For
          Appius, though he had already sworn that there was no collusion, did not venture to
          dispute the right to prosecute <note n="5" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Divinatio</foreign>, a technical name for the trial between two
            or more rival claimants for the conduct of a prosecution. </note> with Pilius, and has
          himself had proceedings begun against him for extortion by the Servilii, besides having
          been indicted for violence by a creature of his own, Sextius Tettius. <note n="6"
            anchored="true">These actions, meant to tie the hands of Appius and prevent his farther
            attacks on Servilius, were also probably grounded on his own revelations. He had, we may
            suppose, been with his father in Asia on his staff, and therefore, under the Julian law,
            was open to prosecution <foreign xml:lang="la">de repetundis.</foreign> See <bibl

            unit="para"/>As for political business, for many days past nothing at <pb n="76"/> all
          has been done, owing to the suspense as to the arrangements to be made about the Gauls. At
          last, however, after frequent postponements and serious debates, and when Pompey's wishes
          had been clearly seen to incline in the direction of passing a decree for Caesar quitting
          his province after the 1st of March next, a decree of the senate was passed, which I

          <milestone unit="para"/>The following observation also of Cn. Pompeius attracted
          attention, and gave people a very great feeling of security, when he said that he could
          not, without unfairness, settle anything about Caesar's provinces before the 1st of March,
          but that after the 1st of March he would not hesitate. When asked, what if anyone on that
          date vetoed it, he said that it made no difference whether Caesar refused to obey the
          senate, or secured some one to prevent the senate passing a decree. "What if," said some
          one else, "he shall determine both to be consul and to keep his army?" To which he
          answered—with what mildness !—"What if my son should choose to strike me with his stick?"
          By such words as these he has made people think that some negotiation was going on between
          Pompey and Caesar. And so I think Caesar is minded to adopt one of two alternatives—either
          to remain in his province, and not be a candidate this next year, or, if he succeeds in
          getting elected, to leave his province. Curio is preparing to oppose him at every point.
          What he can do I don't know. I clearly see this, that if Curio keeps his wits about him,
          even though he effects nothing, he cannot possibly come utterly to grief. Curio treats me
          in a very gentlemanly way, and has forced a troublesome business on me by his present. For
          if he had not given me those African beasts, which had been imported for him to use at his
          games, <pb n="79"/> the thing might have been omitted. Now, however, since give games I
          must, I would beg you, as I have often asked you before, to see that I have some beasts
          from your parts. I also commend to your attention the bond held by Sittius. I am sending
          my freedman Philo and the Greek Diogenes to Cilicia, to whom I have entrusted a message
          and a letter to you. Pray be so good as to give them, and the business on which I have
          sent them, your special attention. For in the letter, which I have given them for you, I
          have stated in detail how extremely important it is to me. </p>

        <p> M. CICERO, proconsul, greets M. Caelius, curule aedile elect. First of all, as in duty
          bound, I congratulate you and express my delight at the rank which you have already
          attained, and your hopes of advancement in the future. It is somewhat late in the day:
          that, however, does not arise from my negligence, but from my ignorance of everything that
          is going on. For I am in a district where, partly from its distance, and partly from
          brigandage, all news is as late as possible in arriving. Besides congratulating you, I can
          scarcely find words to thank you for having had an election calculated, as you said in
          your letter, to give us an endless fund of laughter. And so, as soon as I heard the news,
          I imagined myself in that man's skin—you know whom I mean—and personified to myself all
          that "rising generation" about which he is always talking so big. "'Tis hard to say
          "—looking at you in my mind's eye the while, though far away, and as though I were talking

          reach me! For I cannot be induced to believe that you have not sent me any letter since
          your election to the aedileship, considering the importance of the fact and the
          congratulation for which it called: on your account, because it was what I was hoping for,
          on that of Hillus <note n="3" anchored="true">Hillus for Hirrus. It doesn't seem much of a
            jest. </note> (you see I lisp) because it was what I had not <pb n="81"/> expected.
          However, be assured that I have received no letter from you since that glorious election,
          which transported me with delight. This makes me fear that the same may happen to my
          letter. For my part, I have never sent a single packet home without an enclosure for you,
          and nothing can be more delightful and beloved than you are to me. But let us return (not
          "weturn," for I have lost my lisp) to business. <milestone unit="para"/>It is as you
          desired. For you could have wished me, you say, to have no more trouble than just enough
          for the laurel. <note n="1" anchored="true">For a triumph. </note> You are afraid of the
          Parthians, because you have no confidence in the forces at my disposal. Well, the course
          of affairs has been as follows. On the announcement of a Parthian invasion, relying on
          certain difficulties in the country and on the natural features of the mountains, I led my
          army to Amanus, supported by a fairly good contingent of auxiliary forces, and by a
          certain prestige attaching to my reputation among populations who had no personal
          knowledge of me. For one often hears in these parts, "Is that the man by whom the
          city—,whom the senate—?" You can imagine the rest. By the time I had arrived at Amanus,
          which is a mountain common to me and Bibulus, the dividing line being the watershed, our
          friend Cassius, to my great joy, had repulsed the enemy from Antioch: Bibulus had taken
          over his province. Meanwhile, with my full forces I harassed the population of Amanus, our
          immemorial foes. Many were killed and taken prisoners, the rest were scattered: the
          fortified Strongholds were taken by surprise and burnt. Accordingly, after a complete
          victory, having been acclaimed <foreign xml:lang="la">imperator</foreign> at Issus—in
          which place, as I have often been told by you, Clitarchus related to you that Darius was
          conquered by Alexander—I drew off my army to the most disturbed part of Cilicia. There for
          the past twenty-five days I have been assailing a very strongly fortified town called
          Pindenissus with earthworks, pent-houses, towers, and with such great resources and
          energy, that the only thing now wanting to the attainment of the most glorious renown is
          the credit of taking the town; and if, as I hope, I do take it, I will then at Once send
          an official despatch. For the present I content myself with writing this to you, to give
          you hope of attaining <pb n="82"/> your wish. But to return to the Parthians, the present
          summer has had the fairly fortunate result I have mentioned: for the next, there is much
          cause for alarm. Wherefore, my dear Rufus, be vigilant: in the first place, that I may
          have a successor: but if that shall turn out to be, as you write, too much of a business,
          then, what is easy enough, that no additional period be imposed. About politics I expect
          in your letters, as I have said before, current events and, even more, conjectures of the
          future. Wherefore I beg you earnestly to write me an account of everything in the greatest
          detail. </p>

        </opener>
        <p> I have been much disturbed by the despatches of C. Cassius and Deiotarus For Cassius has
          written to say that the forces of the Parthians are across the Euphrates: Deiotarus that
          they started for our province by way of Commagene. For my part, my chief alarm has been on
          your account, knowing as I do what your state of preparation in the way of an army is,
          lest this inroad should in any way endanger your prestige. For I should have had some fear
          for your life, even if you had had a more adequate army: as it is, the slenderness of your
          forces made me forbode a retreat, not a battle, on your part. What view people would take
          of that, and how far what you were compelled to do would be likely to be considered
          satisfactory—about this I am still feeling anxious, and shall not cease to be alarmed till
          I hear of your having reached Italy. But the news of the passage of the Parthians has
          given rise to various suggestions. One man is for sending Pompey, another against Pompey's
          removal from the city, another for sending Caesar with his own army, another the consuls;
          no one, however, is for sending any who are in Rome without office by a senatorial <pb
            n="83"/> decree. <note n="1" anchored="true">Which was regarded as unconstitutional, and
            only to be justified by extreme circumstances. See <bibl n="Caes. Civ. 1.6">Caesar, B.C.
              1.6</bibl>.5. </note> The consuls, moreover, for fear of this decree being passed for
          their leaving Rome in military uniform, or of the business being transferred to some one
          else, which would involve a slight upon themselves as having been passed over, are so
          unwilling to have any meeting of the senate at all, that they are getting a reputation for
          a want of energy in public business. But whether it is carelessness, or slackness, or the
          fear which I have suggested, behind this pretence of moderation there is concealed a
          disinclination to a province. No despatch has arrived from you, and had not that of
          Deiotarus followed his, it was beginning to be believed that Cassius, in order to
          represent devastation caused by himself as the work of the Parthians, invented 'the war,
          sent some Arabs into the province, and told the senate that they were Parthians. Wherefore
          I advise you to describe minutely and cautiously the state of things in your part of the
          world, whatever it is, that you may not be said either to have been filling some
          particular person's sails, or to have kept back what it was important to know. We have now
          come to the last period of the year: for I write this letter on the 15th of November. I
          see plainly that nothing can be done before the 1st of January. You know how slow and
          ineffective Marcellus is, and how dilatory Servius. What sort of men do you suppose they
          are, or how can they possibly do what is against their inclination, when things which they
          so wish they yet carry on so languidly as to give the impression of not wishing them?
          Again, when the new magistrates come into office, if there is a Parthian war, this
          question will take up their first months. But if; on the other hand, there turns out to be
          no war, or only one such as you or Your successors can manage with a small reinforcement,
          I Perceive that Curio will bestir himself with two objects: first, to take something away
          from Caesar; and, secondly, to bestow something on Pompey, however insignificant and
          valueless the contribution may be. Moreover, Paullus talks about the province with
          irrational violence. His intemperance will be resisted by our friend Furnius: about
          several others I cannot form an opinion. This is all I know: other possible events I
          cannot yet decipher. I know that time brings <pb n="84"/> many developments and upsets
          many arrangements: but whatever is going to happen will be confined within these limits. I
          have this addition to make to the proceedings of Curio—his proposal as to the Campanian
          land: as to which they say that Caesar is indifferent, but that Pompey is much opposed,
          lest it should be unoccupied and at Caesar's disposal when he returns. As to your leaving
          your province, I cannot promise to take treasures to get a successor appointed: but I will
          at least pledge myself that your time is not prolonged. It is for you to consider whether,
          if the state of affairs, if the senate urge you to stay, if a refusal on our part cannot
          decently be made, you choose to persevere in your determination. My only business is to
          remember with what solemnity at your departure you laid the injunction on me not to allow
          of its happening. </p>

        <p> It is not usual to find fault with a tardy congratulation, especially if it has been
          omitted by no negligence: for I am far off, and news reaches me slowly. However, I both
          congratulate you and heartily wish that your tribunate may redound to your lasting
          reputation; and I exhort you to direct and control everything by your own good sense, and
          not allow yourself to be carried away by suggestions of others. There is no one who can
          give you wiser advice than you can give yourself: you will never make a slip, if you
          listen to your own heart. I don't write this inconsiderately: I am fully conscious to whom
          I am writing: I know your courage, I know your good sense. I am not afraid of your acting
          timidly or foolishly, if you maintain what you feel in your own heart to be right. To what
          a political situation you have, I don't say fallen, but come—for it is by your own
          deliberate choice and not by chance that you have brought <pb n="85"/> your tribuneship
          into the very midst of a crisis—you, of course, perceive. I do not doubt that you are
          considering how decisive in politics is the choice of seasons, how rapidly events shift,
          how uncertain are results, how pliable are men's wills, what treachery, what falseness,
          there is in life. But I beseech you, Curio, give your whole heart and mind, not to any new
          principle, but to that which I mentioned at the beginning of my letter: commune with your
          own thoughts, take your own self into council, listen to yourself, obey your-self. It is
          not easy to find anyone capable of giving better advice to another than you are: to
          yourself, at any rate, no one will give better. Good heavens! why am I not there to be, if
          you will, the spectator of your glory, or the sharer, or partner, or assistant in your
          counsels? Although of this you do not in the least stand in need, yet, after all, the
          greatness and intensity of my affection would have secured my being of some use to you by
          my advice. I will write at greater length to you at another time: for within the next few
          days I intend to send some letter-carriers from my own establishment, that, since I have
          performed a public service with good results and to my own satisfaction, I may in one
          despatch give an account to the senate of the events of the whole summer. As to your
          election to the priesthood, you will learn from the letter which I delivered to your
          freedman Thraso how much trouble I have taken, and how difficult a matter it has been to
          deal with and maintain. For yourself, Curio, in the name of your uncommon affection for
          me, and my own unparalleled one for you, I beg you not to allow any extension of time to
          be made in my case to this burden of a province. I urged this on you when I was with you,
          and when I had no idea that you were going to be tribune this year, and I have often made
          the same request by letter; but then it was made to you as a member of the senate, <note
            n="1" anchored="true">Reading <foreign xml:lang="la">senatore</foreign> with the MSS. It
            seems to me evidently right. Cicero says that when he first appealed to Curio, he was
            only a private member of the senate, with only such influence as his rank and popularity
            gave him—now he is a tribune who could <foreign xml:lang="la">veto</foreign> any such
            measure, and therefore had as great power in the matter as any man could have. I doo not

          highest rank and the greatest popularity, now it is to I tribune, and that tribune a

          difficult—but to prevent any novelty: to support both a decree of the senate and laws, and
          to allow the terms under which I left Rome to remain as they are. This I earnestly beg of
          you again and again. </p>

            answering a letter, and his correspondent would have no doubt of his meaning, though we
            are left to guess it. The next sentence shows that the reference is to Curio, of whose

          possible in his tribuneship, both for his own sake—for, as <pb n="92"/> you know, he is a
          great favourite of mine—and also, by Hercules, for that of the Republic, which, however,
          ungrateful to myself it may be, I shall never cease to love. You, however, my dear
          Volumnius, since you have begun doing so, and now see also that it gives me pleasure,
          write to me as often as possible about affairs in the city, about politics. I like the
          gossiping style of your letter. Farther—more, speak seriously to Dolabella, whom I see and
          believe to be very anxious for my regard, and to be most affectionately disposed towards
          me: encourage him in that disposition, and make him wholly mine; not, by Hercules, that
          there is anything lacking in him, but as I am very much set upon it, I don't think I am
          showing too much anxiety. </p>

          gave him by decree, and which he has always maintained without dispute; and, in the second

          it down as lost and hopeless. Well, now, since so heavy a burden is laid on me by a very
          kind friend, I will also lay a burden on you, warranted by your eminent services to me;
          and yet in doing so I am unwilling to be troublesome to you. The people of Mylasa and
          Alabanda owe Cluvius money. Euthydemus told me, when I was at Ephesus, that he would see

          to see that he either gives up possession of the property mortgaged and surrenders it to
          Cluvius's agents, or pays the money; and farther, that the people of Heraclea and
          Bargylia, who are also in his debt, should either pay the money or give him a lien on
          their revenues. The people of Caunus also owe him money, but they allege that they have
          placed the money on deposit. I should like you to investigate that, and, if you ascertain
          that they have not deposited the money, either by edict or decree, to see that Cluvius's
          claim to interest is secured to him by your decision. <note n="1" anchored="true">If the

        <p> Although, when I spoke to you at Ephesus of the business of my legate M. Anneius, I
          gathered that you were strongly inclined to do anything for his own sake, nevertheless, I
          value M. Anneius so highly, and think that you value me so highly, that I do not hesitate
          to allow my recommendation to be added as a finishing stroke to your existing <pb n="95"/>
          willingness to serve him. For, though I have long been attached to M. Anneius—as I have
          practically shown by offering him a legation unasked, after having refused many who asked
          for it—yet, since he has been associated with me in war and the conduct of military
          affairs, I have come to know that his courage, good sense, honour, and loyalty to myself
          are so eminent, that I now value him as highly as anyone in the world. You know that he
          has a suit with the people of Sardis: I explained the merits of the case to you at
          Ephesus: but you will, nevertheless, inquire into it more easily and satisfactorily on the
          spot. As to the rest, by Hercules, I long hesitated what exactly to write to you. For your
          manner of deciding questions at law is justly celebrated, and known to your high credit.
          We, again, have no need of anything in this case, but that you should decide the question
          according to your usual principles. But yet, since I am fully aware how great the
          influence of a praetor is—especially a praetor whose character for honesty, firmness, and
          equity is acknowledged on all hands—I do ask of you, in the name of our very close
          intimacy and of the many mutual good services, which have benefited us both equally, by a
          display of cordiality, by an exercise Of influence, and by an exertion of zeal to convince
          M. Anneius, not only that you are his friend (this he does not doubt, for he has often
          remarked it to me), but that you have been made much more his friend by this letter of
          mine. Finally, I don't think you feel any hesitation as to how well you will be investing
          your kindness with a man of the most grateful disposition and most excellent principles.

            <foreign xml:lang="la">Nysa, in Caria</foreign>, was known at this time for several

          of the state <note n="1" anchored="true">Or, leaving out <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >pars</foreign>, "is the most important in the city." </note> for it is made up of
          members of the other companies; and it so happens that a very large number of this company
          are on extremely intimate terms with me, and especially the man who is at the present time
          at the head of the business, P. Rupilius, son of Publius, of the tribe Menenia, the master
          of that company. Such being the case, I beg you with more than common earnestness to
          protect Cn. Pupius, who is an employee of this company, by every sort of kindness and
          liberality within your power; and to secure, as you easily may, that his services shall be
          as satisfactory as possible to the company, while at the same time determining that the
          property and interests of the partners—as to which I am well aware how much power a
          quaestor possesses—should be secured and promoted. While you will in this be doing me a
          very great favour, I can at the same time from personal experience give you my promise,
          and pledge my word for it, that you will find the partners of the Bithynia company mindful
          of and grateful for any service you have rendered them.</p>

            the end of July, and did not reach Italy till the 25th November, nor Rome till the
            beginning of the following year. He was therefore absent from the struggle that <date

            by letters. Pompey's illness occurred at the beginning of the year, and outwardly things
            seemed quieter. But the storm was brewing, and the first symptom of it was Curio's
            change of parties, influenced by an enormous bribe. As tribune he stood in the way of
            the senatorial decree for Caesar's recall, and on going out of office (10th December)
            went straight to Caesar at Ravenna and urged him to march on Rome. The letters of the
            year (barren, of course, of speeches or literature) give perhaps the most lively picture
            extant in antiquity of a political movement. It <pb n="101"/> is the nearest thing to

        <p> Your own immense prestige and my unvarying belief in your consummate virtue have
          convinced me of the great importance it is to me that you should be acquainted with what I
          have accomplished, and that you should not be ignorant of the equity and disinterestedness
          with which I protected our allies and governed my province. For if you knew these facts, I
          thought I should with greater ease secure your approval of my wishes. <milestone
            unit="para"/>Having entered my province on the last day of July, and seeing that the
          time of year made it necessary for me to make all haste to the army, I spent but two days
          at Laodicea, four at Apamea, three at Synnada, and the same at Philomelium. <note n="1"
            anchored="true">These times do not exactly agree with those given in Letters CCVII and
            CCXXVII, but the differences are unimportant and might easily be accounted for by lapse
            of memory. </note> Having held largely attended assizes in these towns, I freed a great
          number of cities from very vexatious tributes, excessive interest, and fraudulent debt.
          Again, the army having before my arrival been broken up by something like a mutiny, <note
            n="2" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Seditione quadam</foreign>. He qualifies <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >seditione</foreign>, as he doesn't wish to say that there was a downright mutiny;
              <foreign xml:lang="la">quadam</foreign> might be translated "so to speak." He had
            heard of these difficulties in the army, but hoped that they had been put right by
            Appius Claudius. </note> and five cohorts—without a legate or a—military tribune, and,
          in fact, actually without a single centurion-having taken up its quarters at Philomelium,
          while the rest of the army was in Lycaonia, I ordered my legate M. Anneius to bring those
          five cohorts to join the main army; and, having thus got the whole army together into one
          place, to pitch a camp at Iconium in Lycaonia This order having been energetically
          executed by him, I arrived at the camp myself on the 24th of August, having meanwhile, in
          accordance with the decree of the senate, collected in the intervening days a strong body
          of reserve men, a very <pb n="102"/> adequate force of cavalry, and a contingent of
          volunteers from the free peoples and allied sovereigns. While this was going on, and when,
          after reviewing the army, I had on the 28th of August begun my march to Cilicia, some
          legates sent to me by the sovereign of Commagene announced, with every sign of panic, yet
          not without some foundation, that the Parthians had entered Syria. On hearing this I was
          rendered very anxious both for Syria and my own province, and, in fact, for all the rest
          of Asia. Accordingly, I made up my mind that I must lead the army through the district of
          Cappadocia, which adjoins Cilicia. For if I had gone straight down into Cilicia, I could
          easily indeed have held Cilicia itself, owing to the natural strength of Mount Amanus—for
          there are only two defiles opening into Cilicia from Syria, both of which are capable of
          being closed by insignificant garrisons owing to their narrowness, nor can anything be
          imagined better fortified than is Cilicia on the Syrian side—but I was disturbed for
          Cappadocia, which is quite open on the Syrian side, and is surrounded by kings, who, even
          if they are our friends in secret, nevertheless do not venture to be openly hostile to the
          Parthians. Accordingly, I pitched my camp in the extreme south of Cappadocia at the town
          of Cybistra, not far from Mount Taurus, with the object at once of covering Cilicia, and
          of thwarting the designs of the neighbouring tribes by holding Cappadocia. Meanwhile, in
          the midst of this serious commotion and anxious expectation of a very formidable war, king
          Deiotarus, who has with good reason been always highly honoured in your judgment and my
          own, as well as that of the senate—a man distinguished for his goodwill and loyalty to the
          Roman people, as well as for his eminent courage and wisdom—sent legates to tell me that
          he was on his way to my camp in full force. Much affected by his zeal and kindness, I sent
          him a letter of thanks, and urged him to hasten. However, being detained at Cybistra five
          days while maturing my plan of campaign, I rescued king Ariobarzanes, whose safety had
          been entrusted to me by the senate on your motion, from a plot that, to his surprise, had
          been formed against him: and I not only saved his life, but I took pains also to secure
          that his royal authority should be respected Metras and Athenaeus (the latter strongly
          commended <pb n="103"/> to me by yourself), who had been exiled owing to the persistent
          enmity of queen Athenais, I restored to a position of the highest influence and favour
          with the king. Then, as there was danger of serious hostilities arising in Cappadocia in
          case the priest, <note n="1" anchored="true">The priest of the temple of <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Bellona</foreign> at <foreign xml:lang="la">Comana</foreign>, who had
            command over a large body of slaves of the temple and its dependencies. It was a
            position of quasi-royal power. Pompey had confirmed or restored a certain Archelaus in
            this position. </note> as it was thought likely that he would do, defended himself with
          arms—for he was a young man, well furnished with horse and foot and money, and relying on
            <note n="2" anchored="true">I venture to read <foreign xml:lang="la">et fretus
              iis</foreign>, for Tyrrell's <foreign xml:lang="la">ego tuto iis</foreign>, "with
            safety to those," which is a very doubtful construction. </note> those all who desired
          political change of any sort —I contrived that he should leave the kingdom: and that the
          king, without civil war or an appeal to arms, with the full authority of the court
          thoroughly secured, should hold the kingdom with proper dignity. Meanwhile, I was informed
          by despatches and messengers from many sides, that the Parthians and Arabs had approached
          the town of Antioch in great force, and that a large body of their horsemen, which had
          crossed into Cilicia, had been cut to pieces by some squadrons of my cavalry and the
          praetorian cohort then on garrison duty at Epiphanea. Wherefore, seeing that the forces of
          the Parthians had turned their backs upon Cappadocia, and were not far from the frontiers
          of Cilicia, I led my army to Amanus with the longest forced marches I could. Arrived
          there, I learnt that the enemy had retired from Antioch, and that Bibulus was at Antioch.
          I thereupon informed Deiotarus, who was hurrying to join me with a large and strong body
          of horse and foot, and with all the forces he could muster, that I saw no reason for his
          leaving his own dominions, and that in case of any new event, I would immediately write
          and send to him. And as my intention in coming had been to relieve both provinces, should
          occasion arise, so now I proceeded to do what I had all along made up my mind was greatly
          to the interest of both provinces, namely, to reduce Amanus, and to remove from that
          mountain an eternal enemy. So I made a feint of retiring from the mountain and making for
          other parts of Cilicia: and having gone a day's march from Amanus and pitched a camp, on
          the 12th of October, towards evening, <pb n="104"/> at Epiphanea, with my army in light
          marching order I effected such a night march, that by dawn on the 13th I was already
          ascending Amanus. Having formed the cohorts and auxiliaries into several columns of
          attack—I and my legate Quintus (my brother) commanding one, my legate C. Pomptinus
          another, and my legates M. Anneius and L. Tullius the rest—we surprised most of the
          inhabitants, who, being cut off from all retreat, were killed or taken prisoners. But
          Erana, which was more like a town than a village, and was the capital of Amanus, as also
          Sepyra and Commoris, which offered a determined and protracted resistance from before
          daybreak till four in the afternoon Pomptinus being in command in that part of Amanus—we
          took, after killing a great number of the enemy, and stormed and set fire to several
          fortresses. After these operations we lay encamped for four days on the spurs of Amanus,
          near the Arae Alexandri, <note n="1" anchored="true">Some columns put up near the field of
            the battle of Issus by Alexander, or to mark the line of his march. </note> and all that
          time we devoted to the destruction of the remaining inhabitants of Amanus, and devastating
          their lands on that side of the mountain which belongs to my province. Having accomplished
          this, I led the army away to Pindenissus, a town of the Eleutherocilices. And since this
          town was situated on a very lofty and strongly fortified spot, and was inhabited by men
          who have never submitted even to the kings, and since they were offering harbourage to
          deserters, and were eagerly expecting the arrival of the Parthians, I thought it of
          importance to the prestige of the empire to suppress their audacity, in order that there
          might be less difficulty in breaking the spirits of all such as were anywhere disaffected
          to our rule. I encircled them with a stockade and trench: I beleaguered them with six
          forts and huge camps: I assaulted them by the aid of earthworks, pent-houses, and towers :
            <note n="2" anchored="true">That is, movable towers pushed up on rollers to the wall.
          </note> and having employed numerous catapults and bowmen, with great personal labour, and
          without troubling the allies or costing them anything, I reduced them to such extremities
          that, after every region of their town had been battered down or fired, they surrendered
          to me on the fifty-seventh day. Their next neighbours were the people of Tebara, no less
            <pb n="105"/> predatory and audacious: from them after the capture of Pindenissus I
          received hostages. I then dismissed the army to winter quarters; and I put my brother in
          command, with orders to station the men in villages that had either been captured or were
          disaffected. <milestone unit="para"/>Well now, I would have you feel convinced that,
          should a motion be brought before the senate on these matters, I shall consider that the
          highest possible compliment has been paid me, if you give your vote in favour of a mark of
          honour <note n="1" anchored="true">What Cicero wants is a <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >supplicatio</foreign> of as many days as the senate will grant, i.e., days of solemn
            thanksgiving such as had been voted in honour of Caesar's Gallic victories and on many
            other occasions. </note> being bestowed upon me. And as to this, though I am aware that
          in such matters men of the most respectable character are accustomed to ask and to be
          asked, yet I think in your case that it is rather a reminder than a request which is
          called for from me. For it is you who have on very many occasions complimented me in votes
          which you delivered, who have praised me to the skies in conversation, in panegyric, in
          the most laudatory speeches in senate and public meeting: you are the man to whose words I
          ever attached such weight as to hold myself in possession of my utmost ambition, if your
          lips joined the chorus of my praise. It was you finally, as I recollect, who said, when
          voting against a supplicatio in honour of a certain illustrious and noble person, <note
            n="2" anchored="true">Probably P. <foreign xml:lang="la">Cornelius</foreign> Lentulus
            Spinther, <foreign xml:lang="la">consul</foreign>
            <date when="-0057">B.C. 57</date>, who did much to secure Cicero's recall. He asked in
            vain for a <foreign xml:lang="la">supplicatio</foreign>, or perhaps even a triumph, for
            his achievements in <foreign xml:lang="la">Cilicia</foreign>
            <date>B.C. <date to="-54" from="-56">56</date>-54</date>. See Letter CXXV. </note> that
          you would have voted for it, if the motion had related to what he had done in the city as
          consul. It was you, too, who voted for granting me a supplicatio, though only a civilian,
            <note n="3" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Togato</foreign>. The <foreign xml:lang="la">consul</foreign> in

              >toga</foreign>, not the <foreign xml:lang="la">paludamentum</foreign>. The difference
            has been expressed by distinguishing the imperium <foreign xml:lang="la">domi</foreign>
            and imperium <foreign xml:lang="la">militiae</foreign>, which latter he had if he
            commanded an army, and which a proconsul had when in a province. Thus, in his poem on
            his own times, Cicero had a line which he was fond of quoting: <quote xml:lang="la"
                ><foreign xml:lang="la">Cedant arma togae, concedat laurea laudi</foreign>.</quote>
          </note> not as had been done in many instances, "for good services to the state," but, as
          I remember, "for having saved the state." <note n="4" anchored="true">See vol. i., p. 64,
            and 2 Phil. 2. In 2 Phil. 13, he says the motion for a <foreign xml:lang="la"

          </note> I pass over your having shared the hatred I excited, <pb n="106"/> the dangers I
          ran, all the storms that I have encountered, and your having been entirely ready to have
          shared them much more fully if I had allowed it; and finally your having regarded my enemy
          as your own; of whose death even-thus shewing me clearly how much you valued me—you
          manifested your approval by supporting the cause of Milo in the senate. On the other hand,
          I have borne a testimony to you, which I do not regard as constituting any claim on your
          gratitude, but as a frank expression of genuine opinion: for I did not confine myself to a
          silent admiration of your eminent virtues—who does not admire them? But in all forms of
          speech, whether in the senate or at the bar; in all kinds of writing, Greek or Latin; in
          fine, in all the various branches of my literary activity, I proclaimed your superiority
          not only to contemporaries, but also to those of whom we have heard in history. <milestone
            unit="para"/>You will ask, perhaps, why I place such value on this or that modicum of
          congratulation or compliment from the senate. I will be frank with you, as our common
          tastes and mutual good services, our close friendship, nay, the intimacy of our fathers
          demand. If there ever was anyone by natural inclination, and still more, I think, by
          reason and reflexion, averse from the empty praise and comments of the vulgar, I am
          certainly the man. Witness my consulship, in which, as in the rest of my life, I confess
          that I eagerly pursued the objects capable of producing true glory: mere glory for its own
          sake I never thought a subject for ambition. Accordingly, I not only passed over a
          province after the votes for its outfit had been taken, but also with it an almost certain
          hope of a triumph <note n="1" anchored="true">The province of <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Gallia Cisalpina</foreign>, to which Metellus <foreign xml:lang="la">Celer</foreign>

              >Salassi</foreign>. See vol. i., pp. 21, 62. </note> and finally the priesthood,
          though, as I think you will agree with me, I could have obtained it without much
          difficulty, I did not try to get. Yet after my unjust disgrace—always stigmatized by you
          as a disaster to the Republic, and rather an honour than a disaster to myself—I was
          anxious that some very signal marks of the approbation of the senate and Roman people
          should be put on record. <pb n="107"/> Accordingly, in the first place, I did subsequently
          wish for the augurship, <note n="1" anchored="true">A vacancy was made in the college of
            augurs in <date when="-0059">B.C. 59</date> by the death of Metellus <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Celer</foreign>, which Cicero would have liked to fill (see vol. i.,
            P.90). But he was not nominated as one of the two candidates, as was necessary. He
            filled the vacancy caused by the death of P. Crassus <date when="-0053">B.C. 53</date>.
          </note> about which I had not troubled myself before; and the compliment usually paid by
          the senate in the case of success in war, though passed over by me in old times, I now
          think an object to be desired. That you should approve and support this wish of mine, in
          which you may trace a strong desire to heal the wounds inflicted upon me by my disgrace,
          though I a little while ago declared that I would not ask it, I now do earnestly ask of
          you: but only on condition that you shall not think my humble services paltry and
          insignificant, but of such a nature and importance, that many for far less signal
          successes have obtained the highest honours from the senate. I have, too, I think, noticed
          this—for you know how attentively I ever listen to you—that in granting or withholding
          honours you are accustomed to look not so much to the particular achievements as to the
          character, the principles and conduct of commanders. Well, if you apply this test to my
          case, you will find that, with a weak army, my strongest support against the threat of a
          very formidable war has been my equity and purity of conduct. With these as my aids I
          accomplished what I never could have accomplished by any amount of legions: among the
          allies I have created the warmest devotion in place of the most extreme alienation; the
          most complete loyalty in place of the most dangerous disaffection; and their spirits
          fluttered by the prospect of change I have brought back to feelings of affection for the
          old rule. <milestone unit="para"/>But I have said too much of myself, especially to you,
          in whom singly the grievances of all our allies alike find a listener. You will learn the
          truth from those who think themselves restored to life by my administration. And while all
          with nearly one consent will praise me in your hearing as I most desire to be praised, so
          will your two chief client states—the island of Cyprus and the kingdom of Cappadocia <note
            n="2" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Cato</foreign>, to get him out of Rome, had been sent in <date
              when="-0058">B.C. 58</date> on the motion of Clodius to take over Cyprus; he therefore
            (as usual) became its patron. It is not known why he was specially connected with
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Cappadocia</foreign> and Deiotarus, but client kings generally
            selected some prominent Roman to represent their interests. It has been suggested that
            Ariobarzanes' indebtedness to Cato's nephew <foreign xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign> had
            something to do with it. But we cannot be sure. <foreign xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign>,
            it may be observed, was also a friend of Deiotarus, and defended him before Caesar in

          <pb n="108"/> —have something to say to you about me also. So, too, I think, will
          Deiotarus, who is attached to you with special warmth. Now, if these things are above the
          common run, and if in all ages it has been rarer to find men capable of conquering their

          common sympathy in tastes and studies —our inseparable devotion and attachment to which
          from boyhood have caused us to become almost unique examples of men bringing that true and
          ancient philosophy (which some regard as only the employment of leisure and idleness) down

        <p> Since the dearest wish of my heart has come to pass, that of all the Marcelli and even
          the Marcellini—for the good feeling of your whole family and name towards me has ever been
          extraordinary—since, I say, it has come to pass that your possession of the consulship
          enables you to satisfy the views of all your family, that consulship in which it also
          happens that my public services and the glory and distinction accompanying them have
          fallen, I ask you a favour which it is very easy for you to grant, since the senate, I
          believe, is not averse, namely, to see to a senatorial decree being passed in as
          complimentary terms as possible when my despatch is read. <note n="1" anchored="true">The
            public despatch referred to in this and the previous and subsequent letters has not been
            preserved; but no doubt its substance was the same as the letter to <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Cato</foreign>. </note> Had the ties between you and me been less than
          those between me and all the members of your family, I would have made those my spokesmen
          to you, by whom you know well that I am regarded with special affection. The kindnesses
          done me by your father are very eminent, nor could anyone have been a warmer friend to my
          personal safety or my political position. As for your brother, I don't think that there is
          anyone who does not know how much he values and has ever valued me. In fact, your whole
          house has always honoured me with the most important services of every kind. Nor, indeed,
          have you yielded to any of your family in affection for me. Wherefore I ask you, with more
          than common earnestness, to determine that, as far as you are concerned, I shall receive
          the highest possible compliment, and to consider that in voting a supplicatio and in all

        </opener>
        <p> IT has been one of the strongest wishes of my heart to be in Rome with you on many
          accounts, but especially that you might have clearly before your eyes, both during your
          canvass and your actual administration, how eager I was to fulfil my obligation to you.
          And, indeed, as far as your canvass was concerned, it always seemed to me to be plain
          sailing, yet I nevertheless wished to give some actual aid. In your consulship truly I am
          anxious that you should have still less difficulty, yet I am vexed to think that I, as
          consul, had a full view of your zealous kindness when you were a young man, whilst you
          cannot have one of mine now that I am so far advanced in life. But there has been, I
          think, a kind of fatality ordaining that you should always have the opportunity of
          advancing my honour, while I never had anything-except the wish—enabling me to repay you.
          My consulship and my restoration alike you honoured by your support. It has happened that
          the occasion for my performing active public service has fallen in your consulship.
          Accordingly, though your brilliant position and high rank, as well as my own great office
          and high reputation, would seem to demand that I should urge you, and beg you at some
          length, to see to a decree of the senate being passed on the subject of my services in as
          complimentary terms as possible, yet I do not venture to put it strongly to you, lest I
          should appear to have forgotten your habitual kindness to me, or should admit the thought
          of your having forgotten. Accordingly, I will do as I think you would wish, and confine my
          petition to a few words, when it is made to a man that all the world knows has done me
          eminent service. If others had been consuls, you are the man of all others, Paullus, to
          whom I should have sent asking you to secure for me their warmest support. As it is, the
          chief power and greatest influence being in your hands, and our close connexion being
          known to everybody, I do beg you <pb n="111"/> warmly, that you should see to a decree
          being passed in regard to my services in as complimentary terms and as speedily as
          possible. That these services deserve honour and congratulation you will learn from the
          despatch which I have addressed officially to you, your colleague, and the senate. I would
          further beg you to undertake the support of my other interests of every kind, and above
          all of my reputation. And let it be among your first concerns, as I asked you in a
          previous letter also, to prevent any extension of time in my tenure of office. I am eager
          to see you while you are still consul, and to gain all I hope for in your consulship,
          whether here or at home. Farewell. </p>

            Longinus, the future assassin of Caesar, had gone to Syria as quaestor with M. Licinius

            lead off the main body of the Roman army to Antioch, and had remained in charge of the

            Bibulus in September, <date when="-0051">B.C. 51</date>. Just before the arrival of
            Bibulus he had again defeated the attack of the Parthians near Antioch and handed over
            his province in a state of comparative safety. He is now on the point of returning to
            Italy. </note> proquaestor. You introduce M. Fadius to me as a friend, but I make no
          fresh acquisition in him; for it is now many years since he has been among my cherished
          possessions, and valued by me for his exceeding kindness and attentions. Nevertheless, the
          discovery of his attachment to you has made him still dearer to me. So, though your letter
          did some good, yet a still more powerful recommendation was my clear perception and
          recognition of his own warm feeling for you. However, I will take every pains to do for
          Fadius what you ask. It is yourself that I could wish for many reasons had been able to
          visit <pb n="112"/> me: in the first place, that I might see you after so long a
          separation—-a man whom I have long valued so highly; in the second place, that I might
          offer my personal congratulations, as I have already done by letter; thirdly, that we
          might consult together on whatever matters we wished, you on yours, I on mine; and lastly,
          that our friendship, which has been kept up by the interchange of signal services on both
          sides, but has had its continuity interrupted by periods of separation, might be greatly
          strengthened. Since this was not to be, we will avail ourselves of what letters can do for
          us, and shall, though separated, attain almost the same objects as we should have done if
          we had met face to face. One satisfaction, of course, that which arises from the actual
          sight of you, cannot be obtained by the help of letters: the other, the pleasure, I mean,
          of congratulating you, though more meagre than it would have been, if I could have seen
          your face while offering my congratulations, I have nevertheless already experienced and
          now give myself again: and I do indeed congratulate you both on the splendour of your
          services, and also for their opportuneness, in that at the moment of your departure from
          it you have been followed by the loudest praises and the liveliest gratitude of your
          province. My third point—that we might have consulted each other about our affairs—that
          let us do equally by letter. On every other account I am strongly of opinion that you
          ought to hasten your return to Rome. For things there, as I left them, shewed no signs of
          a storm as far as you are concerned, <note n="1" anchored="true">He is referring to a
            danger of prosecution for extortion in Syria. </note> and owing to your recent very

          </note> are no more than you can combat, hasten home: nothing could be nobler or more
          popular: but if they are more serious, take care that your return does not fall at a most
          inopportune moment. You are the sole judge on this point, for you alone know your powers.
          If you are strong enough to do it, you are sure of praise and popularity: if you are
          clearly not strong enough, it will be easier for you to support popular remark by staying
          away. For myself, however, the <pb n="113"/> request I make to you in this letter is the
          same as that in my previous one—that you should exert yourself to the utter-most to
          prevent any extension of time being made to my provincial government, which both by decree
          of the senate and by the law was to be of one year's duration. I press this upon you with
          warmth, because I consider my entire fortunes to depend upon it. You have Paullus to
          support you—my friend, and a very warm one: you have Curio and Furnius. I beg you to exert
          yourself, with the assurance that it is every-thing in the world to me. My last point was
          the strengthening of our friendship. On that there is no need of more words. You sought my
          society in your boyhood: I for my part ever thought that you would be a credit to me. You
          were, moreover, a protection to me in the darkest hour of my fortunes. To these facts I
          may now add the very close intimacy which has sprung up since you left town between me and
          your relative Brutus. <note n="1" anchored="true">Cassius, who was some twenty years
            younger than Cicero, had married <foreign xml:lang="la">Tertia</foreign>, half-sister to

          character which distinguish you both, I believe that I have a very great reserve of
          pleasure and honour in store. t beg you earnestly to ratify this expectation, and also to
          write to me at once, and as often as possible after your arrival at Rome. </p>

        <p> I RAVE no doubt the news has reached you of Appius being impeached by Dolabella. But
          there is by no means the feeling against him which I had expected. For the truth is,
          Appius acted with a good deal of sense. No sooner did Dolabella appear at the tribunal,
          than he entered the city and gave up his demand for a triumph. By thus acting he at once
          took the edge off popular talk, and shewed himself also to be better prepared than his
          accuser had expected. <pb n="114"/> His chief hope is now in you. I know you don't dislike
          him. It is now in your power to attach him to you as strongly as you choose. If you had
          never had a quarrel with him, you would now have had a freer hand in the whole business:
          as it is, if you push legality to the proverbial extreme, <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Illam</foreign>. Referring to the proverb, <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >summum ius summa iniuria</foreign> (<bibl n="Cic. Off. 1.33">de Off. 1.33</bibl>).
          </note> you must be on your guard against being thought not to have been quite candid and
          sincere in renouncing your hostility. In this respect you will certainly be on safe ground
          in doing him a favour, if so minded; for no one will say that you have been debarred from
          doing a duty by the influence of intimacy and friendship. <note n="2" anchored="true">The
            point is this: in old times Cicero was at enmity with Appius (as supporting his brother
            Clodius). If that had never been the case he might have taken the purely legal view of
            the matter; but if he does so now, people will say his reconciliation with Appius was
            all pretence, whereas, if he supports him, nobody can say that he does so from any
            special feeling of friendship. Cicero is said to have the power of helping Appius
            because, being governor of the province, in connexion with which Appius's conduct is
            impugned, he would doubtless facilitate or make difficult the sending of witnesses
            against him. </note> It occurs to my mind that, between the application to the praetor
          and the formal notice of impeachment, Dolabella's wife has divorced him. 'I remember the
          commission you gave me as you were leaving: <note n="3" anchored="true">To think of a
            suitable husband for <foreign xml:lang="la">Tullia</foreign>
          </note> I think you have not forgotten what I wrote to you. It is not as yet the time for
          entering into farther details. I can only give you this hint: if you like the suggestion,
          do not, nevertheless, at the present moment betray your sentiments, but wait to see how he
          comes out of this case. Take care that it does not bring discredit on you if it leaks out:
          assuredly, if any expression of your feeling were to crop up now, it would gain a greater
          notoriety than is either decent or expedient. Nor will he be able to hold his tongue on a
          circumstance which chimed in so pat with his hopes, and which will reflect so much
          additional lustre upon him in conducting the prosecution: especially as he is the sort of
          man to be scarcely able to refrain, even though he knew it was ruinous to himself to
          mention the fact. Pompey is said to be very anxious on Appius's behalf, so much so that it
          is even thought that he means to send one or other of his sons to you. <note n="4"
            anchored="true">Gnaeus or Sextus Pompeius. </note>
          <pb n="115"/> Here we are all for his acquittal, and, by Hercules, every disclosure that
          could reflect disgrace or dishonour on him has been carefully barred. Our consuls are
          indeed energetic: they haven't been able to get a single decree through the senate, except
          the one for the Latin festival! Our friend Curio's tribuneship is deadly dull—as cold as
          ice. In short, I can hardly express to you the flatness of everything at Rome. If it had
          not been for a good fight I am having with the shopkeepers and water companies, <note
            n="1" anchored="true">As aedile, in which office he had the superintendence of the water
            supply, state of the streets, fire preventives, etc. The point was that the shopkeepers
            had been drawing off public water by private pipes. A speech of Caelius <foreign

          upon the state. If the Parthians don't make it warm for you, we here are stiff with cold.
          However, Bibulus has done his best: without the help of the Parthians he has managed to
          lose a poor cohort or two in Amanus. So it is reported here. <milestone unit="para"/>I

            of pontifices, of which Curio was a member. He apparently tried to induce the pontifices
            to intercalate this year, which was not the rght year. His object was presumed to be to
            further postpone the decision as to Caesar's province, which was to come on in the

          ratted to the popular party, and begun speaking up for Caesar, and has made a great parade

          have some of the credit. I advise you not to commit yourself in regard to Dolabella: that

          usually indulge. This letter is shorter than usual, but the letter-carrier of the

          longer one to your freedman. Moreover, absolutely nothing new has happened, unless you
          would like my letter to be filled with such anecdotes as the following (and I am sure you
          would): The younger Cornificius has betrothed himself to Orestilla's daughter Paulla
          Valeria, sister of Triarius, has divorced her husband without cause alleged, on the very
          day he was to arrive from his province. She is going to marry D. Brutus. She has yet given

            sent back her dress and ornaments." In case of a divorce by the woman without cause, the
            husband retained the dos, or a large part of it; but there is no authority for the

          something to find out from others. And I rather like the idea of an imperator questioning
          one person after another with what woman so-and—so has been caught. <pb n="117"/>

        <p> I will write to you at greater length when I have got more leisure. I write this in
          haste, Brutus's messengers having come to me at Laodicea and told me that they are
          hurrying off to Rome. Accordingly, I am giving them no letters except for you and Brutus.
          Commissioners from Appia have handed me in a roll from you full of most ill-founded
          complaints of my having hindered their building by a rescript. Moreover, in the same
          letter you ask me to grant them permission to go on building as soon as possible, lest
          they should be stopped by winter; and at the same time you complain of my forbidding them
          to raise a tax till I granted them leave to do so after investigation: for you say that it
          was tantamount to stopping the work, seeing that I could not hold such investigation till
          after my return from Cilicia at winter time. <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Appia</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="la">Apia</foreign> was in
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Phrygia</foreign> in the "diocese" of <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Synnada</foreign>. The Control thus exercised by the proconsul on local expenditure
            in building, etc., is well illustrated by Pliny's letters to Trajan (see <foreign
              xml:lang="la">ad</foreign>
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Trai</foreign>. 37, 38, etc.). The "tax" (<foreign xml:lang="la"
              >tributa</foreign>) here alluded to is not the <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >tributum</foreign> to Rome, but a local tax or rate for the public work mentioned. </note>
          <milestone unit="para"/>Hear my answer to all these charges, and see how much fairness
          there is in your expostulation. In the first place, on my being approached by persons
          professing that unbearable exactions were being made upon them, what unfairness was there
          in my writing to forbid their proceeding till I had investigated the facts and the merits
          of the case? In my not being able to do so till winter? For that is what you say in your
          letter. As though for purposes of investigation I must go to them, and not they come to
          me! "Such a long way off;" you say. What! at the time you delivered that letter to them,
          in which you remonstrated with me against preventing them from finishing their building
          before winter, did you <pb n="118"/> suppose that they would not come to me? However, on
          that point, at least, they made a ridiculous blunder: for the letter they brought with
          them asking to be allowed to carry on the work in the summer, they delivered to me after
          midwinter. But let me tell you, first, that the number of those appealing against the tax
          is far in excess of those who wish it levied; and, second, that I will, nevertheless, do
          what I may suppose you to wish. So much for the Appiani. <milestone unit="para"/>I have
          been informed by Pausanias, Lentulus's freedman and my marshal, that you had complained to
          him of my not having gone to meet you. I treated you with contempt, you think,' and my
          conduct was the height of arrogance! Your servant having come to me nearly at midnight and
          announced that you intended coming to meet me at Iconium before daybreak, and it being
          uncertain by which of the two roads (for there were two), I sent your most intimate friend
          Varro to meet you by one, and Q. Lepta, my captain of engineers, by the other. I charged
          them both to hasten back to me first, in order that I might start to meet you. Lepta came
          hurrying back and told me that you had already passed my camp. I came in all haste to
          Iconium. The rest you already know. Was I likely not to try and meet you? You— an Appius
          Claudius—an imperator—in spite of immemorial custom— lastly (and this is the strongest
          point of all) a friend t Considering, too, that in such matters of etiquette I am usually
          even too precise for my official rank and position. But enough of this. Pausanias also
          told me that you said, "What an Appius went to meet a Lentulus, a Lentulus an Ampius, and
          a Cicero refuse to meet an Appius?" Heavens! do even you—a man, in my opinion, of supreme
          good sense, of great learning, of the widest knowledge of affairs, and I may add a man of
          politeness (which the Stoics are quite right in counting among the virtues)—do you, I say,
          suppose that any Appiusism or Lentulusism has more influence with me than the distinctions
          bestowed by virtue? Before I had earned what are held by mankind to be the most splendid
          honours, I yet was never dazzled by those high-sounding names of yours: it was the men who
          had bequeathed them to you that I regarded as great. But when I had so obtained and so
          administered the highest offices of state, as to make me think that there was nothing left
          for <pb n="119"/> me to acquire in furtherance of my honour or glory, I hoped that I had
          become, never indeed the superior, but at least the equal of you nobles. Nor, by Hercules,
          did I perceive that Pompey, whom I put above anybody who has ever lived, nor P. Lentulus,
          whom I put above myself, take any other view. If you think otherwise, you will not go
          wrong if, in order to understand what high birth and nobility are, you would study
          somewhat more carefully what Athenodorus, <note n="1" anchored="true">A Stoic philosopher
            of Tarsus, one of the teachers of Augustus. </note> son of Sardon, says on this subject.
          But to return to the point—I would have you believe that I am not only your friend, but
          your very warm friend. I will assuredly by every act of kindness in my power make it
          possible for you to judge that to be unmistakably the case. As for yourself, however, if
          your object is to be thought, in my absence, to be under a less heavy obligation to me, I
          free you from that anxiety: <quote>
            <l>For by my side are those</l>

          prone to spy out faults, you will not, indeed, succeed in making me less zealous for you;
          but you will succeed in making me rather more indifferent as to how you take my goodwill.
          I write this to you with some candour, relying on the consciousness of my services and my

        <p> Your letter has made me a consummate general: I had really no idea that you were so
          accomplished a tactician. I see you have been poring over the treatises of Pyrrhus and
          Cineas. So I am thinking of obeying your maxims: more than that, I mean to have some light
          vessels on the coast: against your Parthian horse they say that no better equipment can be
          discovered. But why jest? You don't know what a great general you are talking to! The
            <title>Cyropaedeia</title>, which I had well thumbed over, I have thoroughly exemplified
          throughout my command. But we will have our joke out when we meet, and that I hope before
          very long. Now listen to the word of command, or rather "attention!" as they used to say
          in old times. With M. Fadius, as I think you know, I am very intimate, and I am much
          attached to him, as well from his extreme honesty and singular modesty of behaviour, as
          from the fact that I am accustomed to find him of the greatest help in the controversies
          which I have with your fellow tipplers the Epicureans. He came to see me at Laodicea, and
          I wanted him to stay with me, but he was suddenly agitated by a most distressing <pb
            n="121"/> letter containing the announcement that an estate near Herculaneum, of which
          he is joint owner, had been advertised for sale by his brother Q. Fadius. M. Fadius was
          exceedingly annoyed at this, and thought that his brother (who is not a wise man) had
          taken that extreme step at the instigation of his own private enemies. In these
          circumstances, my dear Paetus, as you love me, take the whole case in hand and free Fadius
          from his distress. We want you to use your influence, to offer your advice, or even to
          make it a matter of personal favour. Don't let brothers go to law and engage in a suit
          discreditable to both. Two of Fadius's enemies are Mato and Pollio. Need I say more? I
          really cannot, by Hercules, express in writing how much I shall be obliged to you if you
          put Fadius at his ease. He thinks that this depends on you, and makes me think so also.

        </opener>
        <p> AT last! A letter worthy of Appius Claudius, full of kindness, cordiality, and
          consideration! No doubt the sight of the city restored your old city-bred courtesy. For
          the letters which you sent me on your journey before leaving Asia—one about my forbidding
          legates to start for Rome, the other about stopping the building operations at Appia—were
          very unpleasant reading for me. Accordingly, conscious of my unbroken friendliness to you,
          I wrote back with some little irritation. However, when I read the letter you gave to my
          freedman Philotimus, I saw and understood that there were many persons in the province who
          did not wish us to entertain the feelings towards each other which we actually were
          entertaining; but that as soon as you approached the city, or rather as soon as you saw
          your relatives, you ascertained <pb n="123"/> from them how loyal I had been to you in
          your absence, how careful and unremitting in fulfilling all my obligations to you.
          Accordingly, you can imagine how much I value that sentence in your letter, "If anything
          occurs affecting your position, though that is hardly possible, yet, if it does, I will
          return your favours in full." That, however, will be an easy task for you: for there is
          nothing impossible for zeal and kindness, or rather affection. For my part, though I
          always myself thought that it would be so, and was frequently assured of it in letters, I
          yet was extremely delighted by the announcement in your letter of your strong, or rather
          certain, hope of a triumph. And, indeed, it was not because it made it the easier for me
          to obtain one—for that would be a motive truly Epicurean <note n="1" anchored="true">For
            friendship, according to the Epicureans, was founded on utility, it was cultivated for
            its advantages—though in practice their friendships were particularly close. How they
            made their theory square with their practice cannot be discussed here. </note> —but, by
          Hercules, because the splendour of your position is dear to me in itself and for itself
          Wherefore, as you have more people than others have whom you know to be starting for this
          province—for they nearly all come to you to ask if you have any commands—you will very
          greatly oblige me if you will send me a letter, as soon as you have obtained what you
          confidently expect and I heartily wish. If the process of making up their minds and the
          dilatory proceedings of the long bench, <note n="2" anchored="true">Probably the bench of
            the tribunes, who might veto the proposal (Willems, <title>Le Sénat</title>, 2.173).
            Mommsen objects that a special bench of the tribunes is not mentioned till imperial
            times; but as one of the first honours voted to Iulius, as to Augustus, was that he
            should <foreign xml:lang="la">sit</foreign> on the tribunician bench, this implies the
            existence of such a bench before. See <bibl n="TLG385.1 42.20">Dio, 42.20</bibl>;

          friend Pompey calls it, deprive you of this or that particular day (for what more can they
          do?), yet your high claims will hold the field. But if you care for me, if you wish me to
          care for you, write to me, that I may enjoy the delight as soon as possible. I should wish
          you also to pay me the promised addition to your former present. <note n="3"
            anchored="true">Appius's work on the <foreign xml:lang="la">ius augurale</foreign>,
            referred to before (see p. 20). Apparently it was only a first part that had come out,
            and more was expected. </note> I am both anxious to complete my knowledge of augural
          law, <pb n="124"/> and am also, by Hercules, incredibly delighted with attentions and
          presents from you. As for the wish you express for something of the same sort from me, I
          certainly must consider the best style of composition to repay you for your gift: for it
          is assuredly not my way—putting as I do, and as you often observe with surprise, so much
          energy into the task of writing—to let myself be thought to have been slack about it,
          especially in a case involving a charge not simply of slackness, but of ingratitude as
          well. However, I will see about it. The promise you make, I beg you, in the name of your
          good faith and energetic character, as well as in that of our friendship—no affair of
          yesterday, but now a thoroughly established fact—to take measures to fulfil, and to exert
          yourself to secure a supplicatio being voted in my honour in as complimentary terms and at
          as early a date as possible. I certainly sent my despatch later than I could have wished,
          in regard to which the difficulty of navigation was not the only irritating circumstance:
          I believe, in fact, that my despatch arrived just when the senate was in vacation. <note
            n="1" anchored="true">Though, according to Willems (ii. 148), there were no regular days
            for the meeting of the senate (though some on which it could not meet), yet the Kalends
            and Ides seem to have been the days on which there generally was such a meeting; but
            April was a month full of holidays, and we have seen that Cicero and others were
            generally out of town during that month, during which the consuls from custom (though
            not ftom law) generally did not summon the senate. </note> But this I did under your
          influence and by your advice, and I think I was quite right not to send a despatch the
          very moment I was greeted as imperator, but only when other services had been performed
          and the summer campaign was concluded. You will then, I hope, see to these matters, as you
          profess your intention of doing, and will regard myself, my affairs, and my friends as
          recommended to your care. <pb n="125"/>

          Syria, the more earnest am I in my request to you, in the name of our close friendship,
          that you would send back my legate M. Anneius to me at the earliest possible moment. For
          by his activity, wisdom, and knowledge of military affairs I well know that both I and the
          state can receive the most important assistance. Indeed, had it not been of such urgent
          importance to him, he would never have been induced to quit me, nor I to let him go. I
          think of starting for Cilicia about the 1st of May. Before that day M. Anneius is bound to
          rejoin me. The request which I pressed upon you very earnestly, both in a personal
          interview and by letter, I now reiterate— that you should take pains to enable him to
          settle the business he has with the Sardians as the justice of his case and the dignity of
          his character demand. I gathered from your remarks, when I conversed with you at Ephesus,
          that you were ready to do anything for the sake of M. Anneius himself. Yet I should wish
          you to think that you could not oblige me more than by letting me see that he has settled
          his business to his satisfaction owing to your support, and I beg you again and again to
          see that done at the earliest possible time. <pb n="148"/>

        <p> WOULD you have supposed that words could possibly fail me, and not only oratorical
          words, such as you advocates use, but even this common vernacular which I employ? Still,
          fail me they do, and for this reason—I am surprisingly anxious as to what decree may pass
          about the provinces. An astonishing yearning for the city possesses me, an incredible
          longing for my friends and for you among the first, and at the same time a weariness of a
          province, either because I seem to have gained so much reputation, that an accession to it
          is now not so much to be sought, as some change of fortune to be feared; or because the
          whole business is one unworthy of my powers, able and accustomed as I am to sustain more
          important burdens in the public service; or, again, because an alarm of a serious war is
          hanging over us, which I seem likely to avoid by quitting my province on the day
          appointed. The panthers are being energetically attended to by the ordinary hunters in
          accordance with my orders: but there is a great scarcity of them, and such as there are, I
          am told, complain loudly that they are the only things for which traps are set in all my
          province, and they are said in consequence to have resolved to quit our province for
          Caria. However, the business is being pushed on zealously, and especially by Patiscus. All
          that turn up shall be at your service, but how many that is I don't in the least know. I
          assure you I am much interested in your aedileship: the day itself reminds me of it; for I

        <p> THOUGH{ your letters are rare (perhaps they don't all reach me), yet I always receive
          them with delight. For instance, the last received— how sensible it is! How kind and
          instructive! Though in all points I had made up my mind that I must act as you advise, yet
          my plans are confirmed when I see that farseeing and faithful advisers agree with me. I am
          very fond of Appius, as I have often remarked to you in the course of conversation, and I
          perceived that the moment our quarrel was at an end he began to like me. For when consul
          he shewed me great respect, and as a friend he has made himself agreeable, and has taker
          great interest in my pursuits. That good services on my side were in truth not wanting you
          are witness, and are supported now, I think, by Phania coming in pat, like a <pb n="155"/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">*kwmiko\s ma/rtus</foreign>. Phania is a freedman of Appius
            Claudius, whom Cicero trusts to speak well of his feelings towards Appius. Cicero is
            fond of illustrating such convenient or sudden events by the incidents of a play. Cp. 2

          and friends: especially as he is my colleague, <note n="2" anchored="true">In the college

          letter hints a kind of doubt as to my feelings towards him. I suppose you have been told
          something: it is false, believe me, if you have. My official principles and policy present
          certain points of contrast with his method of administering the province. From that
          circumstance, perhaps, people have suspected that this contrast arises from estrangement
          of feeling, not mere difference of opinion. I have, however, never done or said anything
          with the object of lessening his reputation. Moreover, since this trouble that has come
          upon him from the rash act of our Dolabella, <note n="3" anchored="true">His prosecution

        <p> I am exceedingly glad that such services as I have rendered to Rhodon, and any other
          kindnesses I have done you and yours, have pleased you, the most grateful of men; and let
          me assure you that I feel greater interest every day in promoting your position, though,
          indeed, you have yourself so enhanced it by the purity and lenity of your administration,
          that it seems scarcely to admit of any increase. But as I think over your plans, I am more
          and more convinced every day of the soundness of the advice which I originally gave our
          friend Ariston, when he came to see me, that you would be incurring dangerous enmity, if a

          slight from you. And, by heaven! it certainly will be a slight: for you have <pb n="157"/>
          no one with you of higher official rank. The man himself, too, to say nothing of his high
          birth, has claims superior to those of the excellent and unimpeachable officers, your
          legates, in this special particular, that he is a quaestor and your quaestor. That no
          individual can, however provoked, do you any harm I quite see; yet I would not like you to
          have three brothers, of the highest birth, energetic, and not without eloquence, angry
          with you at once, especially on any good ground: men too whom I see will be successively
          tribunes during the next three years. <note n="1" anchored="true">M. Antonius was tribune

            brother were all in office together in <date when="-0044">B.C. 44</date>, as <foreign
              xml:lang="la">consul</foreign>, tribune, and praetor. </note> Who knows, again, what
          sort of times await the Republic? In my opinion, they will be stormy. Why should I wish
          you to incur the alarms which tribunes can cause, especially when, without exciting remark
          from anyone, you can give the preference to a quaestor over legates of only quaestorian
          rank? And if he shews himself worthy of his ancestors, as I hope and trust he may do, the
          credit will to a certain extent be yours: if, on the other hand, he comes to grief in any
          way, the discredit will be all his, not yours at all. <note n="2" anchored="true">Because
            Thermus would only have followed the regular course in appointing his quaestor to take
            charge of his province in the interval between his departure and the arrival of his
            successor. It is an irony of destiny, somewhat pathetic, that Cicero should be writing
            in Antony's favour, and should speak of the brothers as <foreign xml:lang="la">non
              indisertos</foreign>, considering the charges of ignorance and every vice which he
            afterwards flung at Marcus Antonius, to whom also he was to owe his own death. </note> I
          thought, as I am on the point of starting for Cilicia, that I ought to write and tell you
          what occurred to me as being for your interests. Whatever you decide upon doing I pray
          heaven to prosper. But if you will listen to me, you will avoid enmities, and take

            <note n="1" anchored="true">His prosecution by <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Dolabella</foreign>. </note> although I was at first greatly disturbed at the news,
          since nothing could have happened more contrary to my expectation, yet when I had
          collected my thoughts, the sequel seemed to me to present no difficulty, because I felt
          great confidence in you and your friends, and many reasons occurred to me for thinking
          that this trouble would redound to your honour. One thing I was really sorry for, when I
          saw that a most certain and most thoroughly deserved triumph had been snatched from you by
          this step on the part of your jealous rivals. But if you rate it at the value which I have
          always thought should be put upon it, you will be acting wisely and will come off
          victorious, the chagrin of your enemies furnishing you with the most complete of triumphs.
          For I see clearly that the effect of your energy, power, and wisdom will be to make your
          enemies bitterly repent their ill-considered measure. As for myself, I solemnly promise
          and vow before heaven that in support of your dignity—I prefer that word to "safety "—I
          will in this province, which you once governed, undertake and carry through the duties and
          role of an intercessor by my entreaties, of a relation by my exertions, of a man beloved
          (I hope) among the states by the exertion of my influence, of an imperator by using the
          full weight of my <pb n="160"/> office. I would have you both demand and expect everything
          of me: I shall surpass your expectations by my services. Q. Servilius delivered me a very
          short letter from you, which yet seemed to me unnecessarily long: for I think myself
          wronged in being asked. I could have wished that no such occasion had arisen for you to
          see how highly I, how highly Pompey (who, as is only right, is ever the first of men to
          me), how highly Brutus values you: though you might have perceived it in our daily
          intercourse, as you will now. But since the occasion has arisen, if I omit anything in my
          power, I shall confess to a crime and a disgrace. Pomptinus, who has been treated by you
          with eminent and exemplary good faith, and of whose obligations to you I am a witness, has
          shewn that he remembers you with all the affection which you can justly claim. He left me,
          much against my will, under the pressure of urgent private affairs, yet, when he saw that
          it was of importance to you, though on the point of embarking at Ephesus, he returned to
          Laodicea. When I see that you are likely to command innumerable instances of similar zeal
          in your service, I can have no manner of doubt that your present anxiety will eventually
          strengthen your position. If, indeed, you succeed in getting censors elected, and if you
          conduct your censorship as you both ought and can, I am convinced that you will be for all
          time a tower of strength not only to your-self, but to all your family. Pray fight and
          strive that there be no prolongation of my office, so that, when I have done all you want
          for you here, I may have the opportunity there also of giving practical expression to my
          goodwill to you. What you tell me of the support offered you by all men and all ranks does
          not at all surprise me, and is exceedingly grateful to my feelings: the same account has
          reached me from my various friends. Accordingly, it gives me great satisfaction, not only
          that a proper tribute is paid to you—whose friendship to me is a source of pleasure as
          well as honour—but also, in truth, that there is still left in our country an almost
          unanimous feeling of affection for gallant and energetic men: which in my eyes has ever
          been the one reward for my own days of labour and nights of toil. It has, I confess,
          caused me great surprise that this young man—whom I have twice defended to <pb n="161"/>
          the utmost of my power on capital charges—should be so headstrong as, when entering on a
          course of hostility to you, to forget the patron of his fortunes and whole career;
          especially considering that you had enough and to spare of every kind, whether of honour
          or material support, while he himself, to put it at the lowest, has large deficiencies in
          these respects. Some silly and childish talk of his had been already reported to me by our
          friend M. Caelius; about which talk also I have had many communications from you. For
          myself, I should have been much more inclined to break off an old connexion with a man who
          had entered on a course of hostility to you, than to make a new one. For you ought not to
          doubt the warmth of my feelings towards you: it is notorious to everyone in the province,
          and was not less so in Rome. Nevertheless, a certain suspicion is hinted at in your
          letter, and a doubt on your part, in regard to which the present is not a suitable time to
          remonstrate with you, yet the occasion requires that I should clear myself. For when,
          pray, did I hinder any embassy being sent to Rome to convey an encomium upon you? Or,
          supposing me to be your declared enemy, how could I have done anything less likely to
          injure you, or how, if your secret enemy, have more openly betrayed my hostility? But if I
          had been as perfidious as those who attribute these motives to us, yet I at least should
          not have been such a fool as to betray either an enmity which I wished to conceal, or a
          burning desire to wound where it was impossible to damage you. I remember certain persons
          coming to me from Phrygia Epictetos, to inform me that some excessive sums were being
          voted for the expenses of some legates. To them I expressed an opinion, rather than gave
          an order, that votes for such expenses should conform as closely as possible to the lex
          Cornelia. And that I did not insist even on that is testified by the accounts of the
          boroughs, in which each entered as paid to your legates what they severally chose. But
          what a pack of lies has been foisted on you by a set of the most untrustworthy of men! Not
          only that the votes were cancelled, but that, when the legates had actually started, the
          money was demanded and forcibly recovered from their agents, and that many were thus
          prevented from going at all! I should have expressed <pb n="162"/> some discontent and
          expostulated with you, had it not been, as I before observed, that I preferred at the
          present juncture to clear myself rather than accuse you, and thought this the more proper
          course. So not a word about you and your having believed it: but about myself I will say a
          few words as to why you ought not to have believed it. For if you hold me to be a good
          man, if you hold me to be worthy of the studies and philosophy to which I have devoted
          myself from boyhood, if you hold it proven in circumstances of the greatest gravity that
          my courage is fairly high and my wisdom none of the worst, you ought to know that there is
          nothing in my conduct as a friend—I don't say treacherous, designing, or deceitful—but
          even mean or cold. But if you choose to imagine me to be dark and mysterious, what could
          be less consonant with such a character than to disdain the friendship of a man in the
          highest possible position, or to attack his reputation in a province, after defending his
          credit at home? Or to display one's hostility where it was impossible to damage him, or to
          select for an occasion of treachery what would give the clearest indication of dislike,
          but would be the least effectual in inflicting a blow upon him? What reason, moreover, was
          there for my being so implacable to you, when my own brother had informed me that you had
          not been really hostile to me, even at a time when the assumption of such a part had
          almost been forced upon you? <note n="1" anchored="true">In taking part with his brother

          me to do, or a vote you wished me to support in the senate? What charge did you give me as
          I was seeing you off at Puteoli, in which I have not more than fulfilled your expectation
          by my energetic exertions? Again, if it is above everything the mark of selfish cunning to
          judge everything by the standard of one's own advantage, what could better suit my
          interests than the close alliance with a man of the highest rank and greatest official
          dignity, whose wealth, ability, sons, marriage connexions, blood-relations, could all
          greatly promote my <pb n="163"/> honour, or, I may say, my security? All these advantages,
          after all, I did aim at in seeking your friendship—which I did not seek from any selfish
          cunning, but rather because I had some sound sense. Again, how powerful are those bonds in
          which I am the most willing of prisoners !—sympathy of tastes, charm of social
          intercourse, the refined pleasures of our life and its environment, our interchange of
          ideas in conversation, our deeper studies. And these all belong to private life. What
          about public ties between us? Our famous reconciliation, in which any inadvertence even is
          impossible without a suspicion of perfidy; our colleagueship in the most illustrious
          priesthood—in which, in the opinion of our ancestors, not only was no breach of friendship
          possible without impiety, but no election even into the college was permissible, if a man
          were on had terms with any of the existing members. But to pass over these ties, numerous
          and important as they are, was there ever anyone who valued another, or could or ought to
          value another, as highly as I do Cu. Pompeius, your daughter's father-in-law? For if
          services are to count—I consider that I owe him the restoration of country, children,
          life, rank, and, in a word, of myself. If the charm of social intercourse—what friendship
          between two consulars in our city was ever closer than ours? If those tokens of affection
          and kindness— what confidence has he ever withheld from me? What has he failed to discuss
          with me? What motion affecting himself in the senate has he wished should, in his absence,
          be moved by anyone else? What marks of honour has he not desired me to receive in the most
          complimentary form? Finally, with what courtesy, with what forbearance, did he endure my
          vehement pleading for Milo, though at times opposed to his own proposals! With what hearty
          zeal did he take measures to prevent my being reached by the hostile feelings aroused at
          that juncture, protecting me by his ad vice, his influence, and finally by his arms! <note
            n="1" anchored="true">This is all very well: Cicero now speaks of the guard round the
            Court during Milo's trial as meant for his protection; but at the time he was so
            alarmed, that he broke down utterly in his speech. </note> At that crisis, indeed, such
          was his steadfastness, such his magnanimity, that, to say nothing of crediting some
          Phrygian or Lycaonian, as you did in the case of the legates, he would not <pb n="164"/>
          believe malevolent remarks about me even from men of the highest rank. Therefore, as his
          son is your son-in-law, and as I am well aware, besides this connexion by marriage, how
          dear you are to Cn. Pompeius, and how precious in his sight, what ought my feelings
          towards you to be? Especially as he has written me such a letter that, had I been your
          enemy, as I am your most affectionate friend, I should have been softened towards you, and
          have surrendered myself to the wishes and authority of a man to whom I owed so much.
            <milestone unit="para"/>But enough of this: it has been expressed already, perhaps, at
          greater length than was necessary. Let me now tell you what I have actually done and
          arranged. <note n="1" anchored="true">The statement of the measures taken by Cicero is
            apparently omitted, perhaps by the original editor of the letters, though there does not

          shall continue to do, rather in support of your dignity, than as a means of averting
          danger from you. For I shall soon, I hope, hear of your being censor; <note n="2"

          <dateline>(CILICIA, JUNE)</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> M. Tullius Cicero, imperator, son of Marcus, grandson of Marcus, greets C. Caelius
          Caldus, son of Lucius, grandson of Gaius, quaestor. When I first received the most welcome
          intelligence that the lot had assigned you to me as quaestor, <pb n="165"/> I hoped that
          this chance would be a source of greater pleasure the longer you were with me in the
          province. For it appeared to me of great importance that the connexion between us, thus
          formed by fortune, should be supplemented by personal intercourse. When subsequently I
          failed to hear anything from yourself, or to receive a letter from anyone else as to your
          arrival, I began to fear, what I still fear may be the case, that I should have left the
          province before you arrived in it. However, when I was in camp in Cilicia, I received a
          letter from you on the 21st of June, expressed in the most cordial terms, and sufficiently
          manifesting your kindness and abilities. But it contained no indication of day or place of
          writing, nor of the time at which I might expect you; nor was the person who delivered it
          to me the one to whom you had given it: for then I might have ascertained from him where
          and when it was despatched. In spite of this uncertainty, I yet thought that I must
          contrive to send some of my orderlies and lictors to you with a letter. If you receive it
          in anything like time, you will be doing me a very great favour if you will join me in
          Cilicia as soon as you can. For though, of course, what your cousin Curius, who is, as you
          know, a very great ally of mine, and also what your relative and my most intimate friend
          C. Vergilius, have written to me about you with the greatest earnestness has, of course,
          very great importance in my eyes—as a serious recommendation of such very warm friends is
          bound to have—yet your own letter, and especially what you say about your own position and
          our connexion, has, to my mind, the greatest weight of all. No quaestor could have been
          assigned to me that would have been more welcome. Wherefore whatever marks of distinction
          I can shew you, shall be shewn, demonstrating to all the world that I fully recognize your
          own and your ancestors' high position. I shall be better able to do this, if you join me
          in Cilicia, which I think is very much to my interest and that of the state, and above all
          to your own. <pb n="166"/>

        <p> M. CICERO to Appius Pulcher, (as I hope) censor. Being in camp on the river Pyramus,
            <note n="1" anchored="true">The modern Seikun. </note> I received two letters from you
          at the same time, forwarded by Q. Servilius from Tarsus. One of them was dated 5th of
          April, the other, which seemed to me the more recent, was not dated. I will therefore
          answer the former first, in which you tell me about your acquittal on the charge of lèse
          majesté. I had, indeed, been long ago informed of this by letters, messages, and in fine
          by common rumour, for nothing could be more notorious—not because anyone had expected a
          different result, but because, as a rule, no report about men of illustrious <pb n="172"/>
          reputation gets out without making a stir—yet your letter increased the satisfaction I
          felt in the news, not only because it spoke in clear terms and with greater fullness than
          the talk of the common people, but also because I felt more really like congratulating you
          when I heard your own story from yourself. Accordingly, I embraced you in imagination,
          since you were not here, and, kissing the actual letter, I also congratulated myself. For
          compliments paid by the whole people, the senate, and the jurors to ability, energy, and
          virtue (perhaps I flatter myself in imagining myself possessed of these) I look upon as
          paid to myself also. Nor is it the splendid result of your trial so much as the perverted
          intelligence of your enemies that excites my wonder. "Bribery or maiestas," you will say,
          "what does it matter which?" Nothing substantially: for the former you have never touched,
          and the latter you have promoted rather than injured. But the fact is that maiestas (in
          spite of Sulla) is of such a vague nature as to permit of the safe denunciation of anyone:
          while bribery is a word of such definite meaning that either the accusation or the defence
          must be discreditable. <note n="1" anchored="true">The first <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >maiestas</foreign> is used in the proper sense of "majesty of the people." As a crime
            it is a wide term, covering all kinds of actions, and may therefore be brought against
            anyone without obvious injustice; whereas <foreign xml:lang="la">ambitus</foreign> is a
            definite charge, which must either be groundless, in which case it is discreditable to
            bring it, or well grounded, when it is discreditable to the defendant. It must be one
            thing or the other; it can't be vague, or partly true and partly false, as <foreign
              xml:lang="la">majestas</foreign> may. <foreign xml:lang="la">Maiestas</foreign> is
            used briefly for <foreign xml:lang="la">crimen laesae</foreign>
            <foreign xml:lang="la">maiestatis populi Romani</foreign>, and might include not only
            acts of treason, but ill-management of any sort, whereby the interests of the people
            suffered. It took the place (with extended meaning) of the ancient <foreign
              xml:lang="la">perduellio</foreign>. It seems first to have been used as a legal term
            in the law of Saturninus (<date when="-00102">B.C. 102</date>), and it was afterwards
            more fully developed by Sulla's <foreign xml:lang="la">lex</foreign> Cornelia dc
              <foreign xml:lang="la">maiestate</foreign> (<date when="-0080">B.C. 80</date>). (Cic.
              <bibl n="Cic. Pis. 50">in Pis. § 50</bibl>.) </note> For how can there be any doubt as
          to whether bribery has been employed or not? Now, who ever suspected your successive
          elections? How unlucky that I wasn't there! What roars of laughter I would have caused!
          But as to the trial for malestas, there were two things that gave me very great pleasure
          in your letter: one was your saying that you were defended by the Republic itself—for even
          if good and gallant citizens were as plentiful as possible, it still ought to preserve men
          like you; while in the actual state of affairs it is more <pb n="173"/> bound than ever to
          do so, when there is such a dearth of such men in every office and every age, that a state
          so bereaved ought to welcome guardians like you with open arms: the other is your
          wonderfully high praise of the good faith and good feeling of Pompey and Brutus. I am
          delighted at their honourable conduct and cordial kindness, both because they are your
          relations and my very dear friends, and also because one of them is the first of men of
          every age and country, while the other has long been the first of our younger men, and
          will soon, I hope, be first of all the citizens. As to having the witnesses who took
          bribes punished with ignominy by their several states, unless something has already been
          done by the agency of Flaccus, it shall be done by mine on my return journey through Asia.
            <milestone unit="para"/>Now I come to your second letter. You send me a sketch-plan, so
          to speak, of the state of things affecting us both, and of the whole condition of
          politics: in this I am much relieved by the sagacity of your letter. For I perceive that
          the dangers ahead are at once less formidable than I feared, and the safeguards greater,
          if; as you say, all the real strength of the state has devoted itself to Pompey as its
          leader: and I perceived at the same time that your spirit was alert and keen in the
          defence of the Republic, and I experienced a wonderful pleasure from the energy which made
          you determine, in spite of very pressing engagements, that the state of the Republic
          should be known to me by your means. Certainly: keep the books on the augural science for
          the time when we take a holiday together; for when I wrote dunning you for the performance
          of your promise, I thought of you as being outside the walls and enjoying the most
          complete leisure. As it is, however, instead of your augural books, I shall expect all
          your speeches complete. Decimus Tullius, to whom you gave a message for me, has not yet
          been to see me, nor have I at present any of your friends with me; only my own, who,
          however, are all yours. I don't understand what you mean by my "somewhat angry letter." I
          have written to you twice, clearing myself carefully, and only gently finding fault with
          you for having been too ready to believe things about me. This is a kind of expostulation
          which seems to me proper for a friend; but if you don't like it, I won't employ it again.
            <pb n="174"/> But if, as you say, the letter was ill expressed, be sure it was not mine.
          For as Aristarchus denies any verse he doesn't like to be Homer's, so pray do you (excuse
          the joke) consider nothing that is ill expressed to be mine. Farewell, and in your

          were a civilian, should be maintained abroad with the same painstaking care now that you
          have military command. Therefore what I could conscientiously do in setting forth in
          laudatory terms that the province had been defended by your wisdom; that the kingdom of
          Ariobarzanes, as well as the king himself, had been preserved; and that the feelings of
          the allies had been won back to loyalty to our empire—that I have done by speech and vote.
          That a thanksgiving was decreed I am glad, if you prefer our thanking the gods rather than
          giving you the credit for a success which has been in no respect left to chance, but has
          been secured for the Republic by your own eminent prudence and self-control. But if you
          think a thanksgiving to be a presumption in favour of a triumph, and therefore prefer
          fortune having the credit rather than yourself, let me remind you that a triumph does not
          always follow a thanksgiving; and that it is an honour much more brilliant than a triumph
          for the senate to declare its opinion, that a province has been retained rather by the
          uprightness and mildness of its governor, than by the strength of an army or the favour of
          heaven: and that is <pb n="175"/> what I meant to express by my vote. And I write this to
          you at greater length than I usually do write, because I wish above all things that you

        <p> Your "thanksgiving" has given us some sharp twinges, though they have not lasted long:
          for we came to a serious deadlock. The fact is, Curio, who is very fond of you, finding
          that every device was being employed to deprive him of comitial days, declared that
          nothing would induce him to allow the thanksgiving to pass the senate, lest he should
          appear to have thrown away by his own blundering the advantage he had obtained by the
          infatuation of Paullus, and should be regarded as having sold the cause of the Republic.
          Accordingly, we have had to adopt a compromise, and the consuls have pledged themselves
          not to hold the thanksgiving this year. Plainly you have reason to thank both consuls:
          Paullus certainly the rather of the two. For Marcellus answered him that he did not build
          much on those thanksgivings ; <note n="1" anchored="true">I do not think that Marcellus
            said that "he had very little hope that the suppiications would pass," as Prof. Tyrrell
            interprets him: for there was no doubt about them if Curio withdrew his veto-and the
            remark would have no influence with him. What Marcellus said was that he was "not
            relying on the supplications in order to stop Curio from doing business with the
              <foreign xml:lang="la">comitia</foreign>," while Paullus promised outright hat he
            would not so use them this year at all. The senate voted a <foreign xml:lang="la"

          would not hold them this year. I was told that Hirrus meant to talk out the decree. I got
          hold of him: he not only did not do so, but when the vote for the victims was brought

            victims, as we find often in Livy. The change to <foreign xml:lang="la">de
              hostibus</foreign> makes a considerable ambiguity, for it was on the claim of a
            triumph, not a <foreign xml:lang="la">supplicatio</foreign>, that the general had to
            make a return of the numbers of the enemy that had fallen. Besides, if we read <foreign

              <foreign xml:lang="la">ut numerarentur</foreign>, for the singular number refers to
            "counting out" the senate. </note> and he could have put a spoke in our wheel, if he had
          called for a count, he held his tongue. He merely signified his agreement with Cato, who,
          while speaking of you in complimentary terms, voted against the thanksgiving. Favonius
          made a third with them. Wherefore you must thank everybody according to his peculiar
          idiosyncrasy and principles: these three, because they only shewed their wishes instead of
          making speeches, and because when they might have hindered they shewed no fight; and
          Curio, because he deviated from his own line of obstructive policy for your sake. For
          Furnius and Lentulus, as in duty bound, just as though they were personally affected, went
          round with me and took trouble in the matter. I can also speak in high terms of the
          exertions and earnestness of Cornelius Balbus. For he both spoke in strong terms to Curio,
          saying that, if he acted otherwise, he would be inflicting an injury on Caesar, and also
          managed to create a feeling of mistrust as to Curio's sincerity. Some voted for the decree
          who really wished for a decision un-favourable to you—such as the Domitii, the Scipios;
          and when they interposed in this matter with the design of provoking his veto, Curio made
          a very neat reply. "He was all the more happy," he said, "not to veto the decree, because
          he saw that certain persons who voted for it did not wish it carried." <milestone
            unit="para"/>As for politics, every controversy centres on one point—the provinces. In
          this matter Pompey as yet seems to have thrown all his weight on the side of the senate's
          wish that Caesar should leave his province on the 13th of November. when it was held, or
          whether it was held at all, and he would be influenced by the convenience of public
          business. <pb n="177"/> Curio is resolved to submit to anything rather than allow this: he
          has given up all his other proposals. Our people, whom you know so well, do not venture to
          push matters to extremes. The situation turns entirely on this: Pompey, professing not to
          be attacking Caesar, but to be making an arrangement which he considers fair to him, says
          that Curio is deliberately seeking pretexts for strife. However, he is strongly against,
          and evidently alarmed at, the idea of Caesar becoming consul-designate before handing over
          his army and province. He is being attacked with some violence, and his whole second
          consulship is being roughly criticised by Curio. <note n="1" anchored="true">Because in it
              (<date when="-0055">B.C. 55</date>) the legislation was passed which gave Caesar his
            present claims, i.e., the law of Trebonius giving him five more years in his province.
          </note> Mark my words—if they push their suppression of Curio to extremes, Caesar will
          interpose in favour of the vetoing tribune; if, as it seems they will do, they shrink from
          this, Caesar will stay in his province as long as he chooses. The vote given by each is in
          the memorandum of city events <note n="2" anchored="true">Not the public gazette (<foreign
              xml:lang="la">acta</foreign>), but the private one which Caelius caused to be drawn up
            for Cicero's benefit. </note> from which pick out what is worth reading: skip much,
          especially the hissing at the games and accounts of funerals and other unimportant gossip.
          It has a good deal worth knowing. The fact is, I prefer erring on the side of telling what
          you don't want, to passing over anything necessary. I am glad that you have interested
          yourself in the business of Sittius. But since you suspect the men I sent to you of being

        <p> I CONGRATULATE YOU on a son-in-law who is, on my word, the best of men: for that is my
          opinion of him. Some other blemishes in his character, by which he has hitherto stood in
          his own light, are already shaken off by age; and, if any remain, I feel sure that they
          will be quickly removed by your society and influence, and by the modesty of Tullia. For
          he is not obstinate in vice, nor blunted beyond the power of understanding the higher
          life. Last, but not least, I am very fond of him. <milestone unit="para"/>You will be
          eager, my dear Cicero, to hear that our friend Curio had a fine conclusion to his veto of
          the decrees concerning the provinces. For on a motion in regard to the veto being brought
          before the house—a motion ordered by decree of the senate—and when M. Marcellus had
          proposed that the tribunes should be remonstrated with, a full senate voted a direct
          negative. The fact is that Pompey is now so out of sorts, <note n="1" anchored="true">

            to his illness. See p. 168. </note> that he can scarcely find anything to suit him. They
          have come round to this—that Caesar is to be allowed to stand for the consulship without
          giving up army or provinces. How Pompey is likely to endure this I will write you word as
          soon as I know. What is to happen to the Republic, if lie resists this in arms or ignores

          <salute>TO GNAEUS SALLUSTIUS (PROQUAESTOR IN SYRIA)</salute>
          <dateline>TARSUS, 18 JULY</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> Your orderly delivered me your letter at Tarsus on the 17th of July, and I will now
          proceed to answer it, as I perceive is your wish, in detail. About my successor I have
          heard nothing, and I don't think there will be one. There is no reason for my not leaving
          the province to the day, especially as all fear from the Parthians is removed. I am
          strongly inclined to stop nowhere. I think I shall go to Rhodes for the sake of the boys,
          but of even that I am not certain. I wish to arrive outside the city as soon as possible,
          yet the course of politics and events in Rome will guide the course of my journey. Your
          successor cannot in any case make such haste as to enable you to meet me in Asia. As to
          delivering the copies of accounts, your non-delivery of them, for which you say Bibulus
          gave you licence, is no inconvenience to me: but I scarcely think you are justified in so
          doing by the Julian law, which Bibulus disregards on a certain settled principle, <note
            n="1" anchored="true">Because he would not acknowledge the Julian laws of <date
              when="-0059">B.C. 59</date>, which he considered to have been rendered null and void
            by his <foreign xml:lang="la">obnuntiato</foreign>. </note> but which I think you ought
          certainly to observe. You say that the garrison ought not to have been withdrawn from
          Apamea; I see that others think the same, and I am much annoyed that rather unpleasant
          remarks have been made by my ill-wishers. As to whether the Parthians have crossed or not
          I perceive that you are the only man who has any doubt. Accordingly, all the garrisons,
          which I had raised to a state of great effectiveness I have been induced by the positive
          assertions I hear made to dismiss. As to my quaestor's accounts, it was neither reasonable
          that I should send them to you, nor were <pb n="184"/> they then made up. I think of
          depositing them at Apamea. Of the booty taken by me no one, except the quaestors of the
          city—that is, the Roman people—has touched or will touch a farthing. At Laodicea I think I
          shall accept sureties for all public money, so that both I and the people may be insured
          against loss in transit. As to what you say about the 100,000 drachmae, in a matter of
          that kind no concession to anyone is possible on my part. For every sum of money is either
          treated as booty, in which case it is administered by the praefecti or it is paid over to
          me, in which case it is administered by the quaestor. You ask me what my opinion is as to
          the legions which the senate has ordered for Syria. <note n="1" anchored="true">These are
            the two legions, of which one was to be supplied by Pompey, and one by Caesar, but which
            eventually both came to Italy from Caesar's army, and were not sent to Syria. </note> I
          had my doubts before about their coming; now I feel no doubt, if news is received in time
          of there being peace in Syria, that they will not come. I see that Marius, the successor
          to the province, will be slow in coming precisely because the Senate has decreed that he
          should accompany the legions. <milestone unit="para"/>There's the answer to one letter.
          Now for the second. You ask me to recommend you as earnestly as possible to Bibulus. In
          this matter inclination on my part is not wanting, but it seems to me to be a proper
          opportunity for expostulating with you: for you are the only man of all Bibulus's staff
          who never informed me of his complete and causeless alienation from me. For a number of
          people reported to me that, when there was a great alarm at Antioch, and great hopes were
          entertained of me and my army, he was accustomed to say that they would prefer to endure
          any-thing rather than be thought to have wanted my help. I am not at all annoyed that,
          from the loyalty due from a quaestor to his praetor, you say nothing of this: although I
          was informed of the treatment you are receiving. He, for his part, when writing to Thermus
          about the Parthian war, never sent me a line, though he knew that the danger from that war
          specially affected me. The only subject on which he wrote to me was the augurship of his
          son: <note n="2" anchored="true">Apparently for the vacancy which was filled up at the
            beginning of this year by M. Antonius or Q. Cassius Longinus. The surviving son of
            Bibulus (L. Calpurnius Bibulus)—by his wife <foreign xml:lang="la">Porcia</foreign>,
            afterwards wife of M. Brutus—lived till about <date when="-0031">B.C. 31</date>, and
            wrote a memoir of his stepfather <foreign xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign>. </note> in
          regard to which I was <pb n="185"/> induced by compassion, and by the friendly feelings I
          had always entertained to Bibulus, to be at the pains of writing to him with the greatest
          cordiality. If he is universally ill-natured—which I never thought—I am the less offended
          by his conduct to me: but if he is on special bad terms with me, a letter from me will do
          you no good. For instance, in his despatch to the senate, Bibulus took the whole credit
          for matters in which we both had a share. He says in it that he had secured that the rate
          of exchange should be to the public advantage. Again—and this is wholly my doing—the
          declining to employ Transpadane auxiliaries he mentions as a concession of his own, also
          to the profit of the people. On the other hand, when a thing is entirely his own doing, he
          brings me into it: "When WE demanded more corn for the auxiliary cavalry" he writes.
          Surely, again, it is the mark of a small mind, and one which from sheer ill-nature is poor
          and mean, that because the senate conferred the title of king on Ariobarzanes through me,
          and commended him to me, he in his despatch does not call him king, but the "son of king
          Ariobarzanes." Men of this temper are all the worse if favours are asked of them.
          Nevertheless, I have yielded to your wish, and have written him a letter, with which you
          can do what you like when you have received it. </p>

          glad in the first place to hear your compliments to Dolabella, and in the second place to
          find that you like him. For what you say of the possibility of his being reformed by
          Tullia's good sense, I know to what letter of your own it is an answer. <note n="3"
            anchored="true">He means that by the complimentary remarks as to <foreign xml:lang="la"

          done is done, and heaven prosper it! I hope I shall find him an agreeable son-in-law, and
          in that respect your kindness will be of much assistance. <milestone unit="para"/>Politics
          make me very anxious. I am fond of Curio: I wish Caesar to shew himself an honest man: I
          could die for Pompey: but after all nothing is dearer in my sight than the Republic
          itself. In this you are not making yourself very Conspicuous, for you seem to me to have
          your hands tied—by being at once a good citizen and a good friend. On quitting my
          province, I have put my quaestor Caelius in command. "A mere boy," say you. Yes, but a
          quaestor, a young man of high rank, and in accordance with nearly universal precedent: for
          there was no one who had held higher office for me to put in that position. Pomptinus had
          departed long ago: my brother Quintus could not be induced: moreover, if I had left him,
          enemies would have said that I had not really left the province at the end of a year, in
          accordance with the decree of the senate, since I left a second self behind me. Perhaps
          they might even have added, that the senate had ordered that those should govern provinces
          who had not done so before; whereas my brother had governed Asia for three years. In fine,
          I have now no anxieties: if I had left my brother behind, I should have been afraid of
          everything. Lastly, not so much of my own initiative, as following the precedent set by
          the two most <pb n="187"/> powerful men of the day, who have secured the allegiance of all
          the Cassii and Antonii, <note n="1" anchored="true">Pompey had chosen Cassius, Caesar
            Antonius, as their quaestors. Cicero argues that he has done less—for he has only
            employed the quaestor assigned him by lot (vol. i., p. 73; 2 Phil. 50). </note> I have
          not so much been desirous to attract a young man to myself, as unwilling to repel him You
          must needs praise this policy of mine: for it cannot now be changed. You did not write
          clearly enough to me about Ocella, and it was not mentioned in the gazette. Your doings

        <p> I WILL first congratulate you—for that is what the order of events demands: and then I
          will speak of myself. I do warmly congratulate you on the result of the trial for bribery,
          and not on what nobody ever had any doubt about—your acquittal—but on the fact which, the
          better citizen, the more illustrious man, the more loyal friend you are, the greater the
          marks of virtue and industry distinguishing you, is the -more to be wondered at, namely,
          that no secret ill-will was found lurking even in the concealment of the ballot bold
          enough to attack you. It is a fact scarcely consistent with the circumstances, the men,
          and the morals of our day. I have not been so much struck by anything for a long time
          past. <milestone unit="para"/>Now as to myself—for a moment put yourself in my place, and
          imagine yourself to be just what I am. If you have no difficulty in finding something to
          say, don't excuse my hesitation. I, indeed, would hope for myself and my Tullia, as you
          most kindly and politely express your wishes, that what has been done by my family without
          my knowledge may turn out to our happiness. But that the marriage happened to take place
          at that particular time—I hope and desire that it may not be wholly without happiness, yet
          after all it is your wisdom and kindness which gives me more ground for that hope than the
          opportuneness of it. <note n="1" anchored="true">Cicero is trying to excuse the fact that
            Dolabella's marriage to <foreign xml:lang="la">Tullia</foreign> was just at the time
            that he was prosecuting Claudius. </note>
          <pb n="189"/> Accordingly, I cannot think how to end what I have begun to say; for I ought
          not to make any gloomy remark on an event which you honour with your felicitations, and
          yet after all there is something in it which stings me. But in this matter there is one
          thing of which I am not afraid of your not being fully aware that what was done was done
          by others, to whom I have left a charge that during my absence they should not refer to
          me, but should act on their own judgment. Here I am met by the question, "What would you
          have done if you had been at home?" I should have approved of the match; as to the time, I
          should have done nothing without your consent, or without consulting you. You see how I
          have all this time been sweating under the hard task of finding how to maintain what I am
          bound to maintain, and yet not offend you. <note n="1" anchored="true">Cicero feels that
            the case is an awkward one; and his style becomes laboured and involved in trying to put
            it pleasantly. </note> Relieve me, then, of this burden: for I think I have never
          handled a more difficult cause. Be sure of this in any case: had I not at that very time
          already completed the whole business with the greatest zeal for the maintenance of your
          highest reputation—although I think my old affection for you admits of no addition—yet
          when this marriage was announced to me, I should have defended your honour, not indeed
          with greater zeal, but more keenly, openly, and markedly. <milestone unit="para"/>On my
          way from my province, after the conclusion of my year of command, as I was approaching
          Sida on board ship, accompanied by Q. Servilius, a letter from home was delivered to me on
          the 3rd of August. I at once told Servilius—for he seemed somewhat put out— that he might
          expect greater exertions on my part in all ways. In short: I have not become at all better
          disposed to you than I was, but I have become much more energetic in declaring my good
          disposition. For as our old difference made me more on my guard against giving any ground
          for thinking our reconciliation feigned, so this new marriage connexion gives me fresh

        <p> JUST as though I divined that some day or other I should have to ask for your zealous
          support, I worked hard for your reputation when the question of your actions was on the
          tapis. However, I will not disguise the truth: you have given more than you got. For every
          single person has written to tell me that, not only by the weight of your eloquence and
          your senatorial vote—which from such a man were quite enough for me—but also by personal
          exertion, by offer of advice, by coming to my house and calling on my friends, you left
          nothing, however troublesome, for anyone else to do. All this is a much greater honour to
          me than the thing itself for which the trouble is being taken. For the outward rewards of
          virtue many have attained without possessing virtue: but such great zeal from such men as
          you virtue alone' can secure. Accordingly, I set before my-self as the profit to be
          derived from our friendship that friendship itself, than which nothing can be more
          fruitful, especially in those studies to which we have both devoted ourselves. For I
          profess myself to be both your ally in politics, on which our sentiments agree, and
          closely united in daily life, which we devote to such accomplishments' and studies. I
          could have wished that fate had so ordained it that you could value all my family as
          highly as I do yours. Even as to this, however, I have a sort of intuition which prevents
          my despairing. But this does not touch you: the burden is wholly mine. I wish you to
          clearly understand that in this change of circumstances something has been added to my
          affection towards you—to which no addition seemed <pb n="193"/> possible—rather than
          anything detracted from it. when I write this I hope you are already censor. My letter is
          all the shorter and more modest as being addressed to a "director of morals." <note n="1"

        <p> RIGHT glad am I to be praised"—says Hector, I think, in Naevius—"by thee, reverend
          senior, who hast thyself been praised." For certainly praise is sweet that comes from
          those who themselves have lived in high repute. For myself, there is nothing I should not
          consider myself to have attained either by the congratulation contained in your letter, or
          the testimony borne to me in your senatorial speech: and it was at once the highest
          compliment and the greatest gratification to me, that you willingly conceded to
          friendship, what you transparently conceded to truth. And if, I don't say all, but if many
          were Catos in our state—in which it is a matter of wonder that there is even one—what
          triumphal chariot or laurel should I have compared with praise from you? For in regard to
          my feelings, and in view of the ideal honesty and subtilty of your judgment, nothing can
          be more complimentary than the speech of yours, which has been copied for me by my
          friends. But the reason of my wish, for I will not call it desire, I have explained "to
          you in a 'former letter. And even if it does not appear to you to be entirely sufficient,
          it at any rate leads to this conclusion not that the honour is one to excite excessive
          desire, but yet is one which, if offered by the senate, ought certainly not to be
          rejected. Now I hope that that <pb n="194"/> House, considering the labours I have
          undergone on behalf of the state, will not think me undeserving of an honour, especially
          one that has become a matter of usage. And if this turns out to be so, all I ask of you is
          that—to use your own most friendly words—since you have paid me what in your judgment is
          the highest compliment, you will still "be glad" if I have the good fortune to get what I
          myself have preferred. <note n="1" anchored="true">Cato had voted against the supplicatio,
            and Cicero has to tax his skill to appear not to be vexed (as he was), and to assume
            that Cato's complimentary speech was as good as if he voted fbr it. He is answering
            Cato's letter. See Letter CCLXV. </note> For I perceive that you have acted, felt, and
          written in this sense: and the facts themselves shew that the compliment paid me of a
          supplicatio was agreeable to you, since your name appears on the decree: for decrees of
          the senate of this nature are, I am aware, usually drawn out by the warmest friends of the
          man concerned in the honour. I shall, I hope, soon see you, and may it be in a better
          state of political affairs than my fears forbode! </p>

        <p> I am ashamed to confess to you and to complain of the injuries done me by Appius—that
          most ungrateful of men, who begins to hate me because he is under great obligations to me;
          and since, in his avarice, he could not constrain himself to pay his debt, he has declared
          a secret war against me, yet not so secret either but that many people reported it to, me,
          and I myself observed without difficulty that he was harbouring evil thoughts of me. When,
          however, I discovered that he had been tampering with the college, <note n="2"
            anchored="true">Apparently the college of augurs, to which Caelius wished to be elected
          </note> then that he had been openly colloguing with certain persons, <pb n="195"/>
          deliberating with L Domitius <note n="1" anchored="true">L. Domitius Ahenobarbus, consul
              <date when="-0054">B.C. 54</date> with Appius. </note> —at present my bitterest
          enemy—and expressing a wish to offer this trifling favour to 'Cn. Pompeius, I could not
          prevail on myself to upbraid him personally, or to beg one, whom I considered owed his
          life to me, to refrain from injuring me. What, then, could I do? However, I spoke to
          several of his friends, who were acquainted with my services to him. When I perceived that
          he did not think me even worth conciliating, I preferred putting myself under an
          obligation to his colleague <note n="2" anchored="true">L. Piso, the other censor. </note>
          —a man very much out of sympathy with me, and not likely to be very well-disposed to me,
          owing to my friendship with you—rather than endure the sight of that ape. When he
          ascertained this, he flew into a rage and kept exclaiming that I was looking for an excuse
          for hostility, in order that, since he had not done what I wanted in regard to the money,
          I might cover my attack upon him by this show of a personal quarrel. Since then he has not
          ceased egging on Servius Pola to accuse me, and concerting measures with Domitius. And
          when they were not successful in securing anyone to accuse me under any law, they wanted
          me to be attacked under a law which gave them no ground for saying a word. Their impudence
          was so boundless, that they secured an information being laid against me under the
          Scantinian law <note n="3" anchored="true">Against unnatural crimes. </note> at the very
          height of the Circensian games, in which I was presiding. Scarcely had Pola got the words
          out of his mouth, when I laid an information under the same law against the censor Appius.
          I never saw a more successful stroke. For it has been approved by the people, and not all
          the lowest of them, to such an extent, that the scandal has given Appius greater pain than
          the legal proceedings. Besides this, I have started an action for recovering a shrine now
          within the wails of his house. <milestone unit="para"/>I am much disturbed by the
          detention of the slave who takes this letter to you. For since the receipt of your last he
          has been more than forty days in town. I don't know what to say to you. You know that

        <p> TAKING Arsaces prisoner and storming Seleucia was not worth your missing the spectacle
          of events which have been going on here. Your eyes would never have ached again, if you
          had only seen Domitius's look when he lost the election. <note n="1" anchored="true">To
            the college of augurs (see preceding letter). L. Domitius was already a member of the
            college of sacerdotes. </note> It was a very full comitia, and the voting was evidently
          on party lines: a very few voted from motives of personal connexion or obligation.
          Accordingly, Domitius is most bitterly angry with me. He never hated any one even of his
          own friends so much as he does me: and all the more so that he thinks the augurship has
          been snatched from him unfairly, and that I am at the bottom of it. Now he is furious that
          people are so much rejoiced at his vexation, and that there was only one man more zealous
          for Antony than I was. For the young Cn. Domitius himself has given notice- of action
          against the young Cn. Saturninus—who is very unpopular owing to his past life. The trial
          is now imminent, with good hope, too, of an acquittal, after the acquittal of Sextus
          Peducaeus. As to high politics—I have often told you in my letters that I see no chance of
          peace lasting a year; and the nearer the struggle comes, which must come, the clearer does
          that danger appear. The point, on which the men in power are bound to fight, is this - Cn.
          Pompeius has made up his mind not to allow C. Caesar to become consul, except on condition
          of his first handing over his army and provinces: while Caesar is fully persuaded that he
            <pb n="197"/> cannot be safe if he quits his army. He, however, proposes as a compromise
          that both should give up their armies. So that mighty love and unpopular union of theirs
          has not degenerated into mere secret bickering, but is breaking out into open war. Nor can
          I conceive what line to take in my own conduct—and I feel sure that this doubt will
          exercise you a good deal also—for between myself and these men there are ties of affection
          and close connexion, since it is the cause, not the men, that I dislike. I think you are
          alive to this rule, that men ought in a case of home differences, so long as the contest
          is carried on constitutionally without an appeal to arms, to follow the party most in the
          right: when it comes to war and the camp, the stronger party; <note n="1" anchored="true"
            >This is rather like Mr. Pickwick's rule as dealing with two election crowds, "to shout
            with the largest." </note> and to make up one's mind that the safer course is the
          better. In this quarrel I perceive that Cn. Pompeius has on his side the senate and the
          iudices: that Caesar will be joined by all whose past life gives them reason to be afraid,
          or their future no reason to hope: that there is no comparison between their armies. On
          the whole, there is time enough to weigh the forces of both, and to choose sides.
            <milestone unit="para"/>I almost forgot what above everything else I was bound to write
          to you. Do you know that the censor Appius is doing marvels? Busying himself about
          statues, pictures, land-owning, and debt with the greatest vigour? He is persuaded that
          his censorship is a kind of soap or soda. I think he is wrong: while he is meaning to wash
          off stains, he is really exposing all his veins and vitals. Hurry home, in the name of
          gods and men! Come as quickly as you can to enjoy a laugh, that a trial under the
          Scantinian law should be before Drusus, and that Appius should be making regulations about
          statues and pictures. <note n="2" anchored="true">I.e., about the amount of such things
            which it was legal for a man to own. </note> Believe me, you ought to make haste. Our
          friend Curio is thought to have acted prudently in his concession as to Pompey's money for
          his troops. In a word, you want my opinion as to the future. Unless one or the other of
          these two goes to the Parthian war, I see that a violent quarrel is impending, which the
          sword and main force will decide. Both are prepared in resolution <pb n="198"/> and
          forces. If it could only be transacted without extreme danger, fortune is preparing for
          you a great and enjoyable spectacle. </p>

          14th of October I arrived at Athens, after experiencing unfavourable winds and a slow and
          unpleasant voyage. As I was disembarking, Acastus met me with letters, the 21st day since
          his start, which is very active travelling. I received one from you, in which you tell me
          that you fear your previous letters did not reach me. I got them all: you have shewn the
          greatest energy in writing me full accounts of everything, and I am exceedingly obliged to
          you. I was not surprised that the letter brought by Acastus was short: for you are
          expecting me, or rather us, immediately in person: and we are anxious to reach you at the
          earliest possible time, though I am fully aware to what a state of public affairs I am
          coming: for the letters brought me by Acastus from many of my friends have shewn me that
          things look warlike, so that when I do arrive I shall not be able to cloak my sentiments.
          But since <pb n="202"/> there is no shirking fate, I shall make the more haste, that I may
          consider the whole crisis with greater ease. Pray, as well as your health will permit,
          come as far as you can to meet me. As to the inheritance from Precius—I am deeply grieved
          at it, for I loved the man—I wish you to see to this: if the auction takes place before my
          arrival, let Pomponius, or, if he can't, Camillus act for us. As soon as I am safe at home
          I will look after the rest of the business myself. But if you have already started from
          Rome, still see that this arrangement is made. Dearest, sweetest Terentia, as you love me,
          take care, all of you, of your health. Good-bye. </p>

          though it is of great consequence to securing my triumph that I should arrive at the city
          wall as early as possible, yet I feel guilty for having left you: but as you seemed to

          can overtake me, you must decide for yourself. I have sent Mario to you with directions to
          rejoin me as soon as possible with you, or, if you are still delayed, to return at once.
          But pray be fully assured of this: if it is compatible with your state of health, my first
          desire is to have you with me: if; however, you are certain that a short stay at Patrae is
          necessary for your convalescence, my first desire is that you should be well. If you set
          sail at once, you will catch us up at Leucas: but if you determine to stay to confirm your
          health, pray take particular care to secure suitable fellow travelers, weather, and ship.
          Be especially careful, dear Tiro, as you love me, not to allow Mario's arrival or this
          letter to influence you. If you do what will best conduce to your recovery, you will be
          most strictly obeying my wishes. In considering these matters let your own heart be your
          guide. I miss you: yes! but I also love you, Love prompts the wish to see you in good
          heath; the other motive would make me wish to see you as soon as possible. The former is
          therefore to be preferred. Accordingly, let your first care be to get well: of the

        <p> WARMEST greeting from Tullius, his son, brother, and nephew to Tiro. Your letter gave me
          varied emotions. I was much agitated by the first page, a little cheered by the second. So
          I am now quite clear that, until you are entirely <pb n="209"/> recovered, you should not
          risk a journey either by sea or land. I shall see you quite soon enough, if I see you
          thoroughly restored to health. Yes, what you say in your e letter about the doctor being
          well thought of; I am also told about him. Yet I am far from satisfied with his treatment.
          For you ought not to have had soup given you when suffering from weak digestion. However,
          I have written to him with great earnestness, as also to Lyso. To Curius, indeed, that
          most agreeable, attentive, and kindly of men, I have written at great length. Among other
          things I have asked him to transfer you from where you are to his own house, if you wished
          it. For I fear our friend Lyso is somewhat careless: first, because all Greeks are so, and
          secondly because, though he got a letter from me, he has sent me no e answer. However, you
          speak well of him: you must therefore yourself decide what is best to be done. I do beg
          you, dear Tiro, not to spare expense in anything whatever necessary for your health. I
          have written to Curius to honour your draft to any amount: something, I think, ought to be
          paid to the doctor himself to make him more zealous. Your services to me are past
          counting—at home, in the forum, at Rome, in my province: in private and public business,
          in my literary studies and compositions. But there is one service you can render me that
          will surpass them all-gratify my hopes by appearing before me well and strong! I think, if
          you are recovered, you will have a most charming voyage home with the quaestor Mescinius.
            <note n="1" anchored="true">See p. 173. </note> He is not without culture, and is, I
          thought, attached to you. And while health should be your first and most careful
          consideration, consider also bow to secure a safe voyage, dear Tiro. I wouldn't have you
          hurry yourself now in any way whatever. I care for nothing but your safety. Be assured,
          dear Tiro, that no one loves me without loving you; and though it is you and I who are
          most directly concerned in your recovery, yet it is an object of anxiety to many. Up to
          this time, in your desire never to leave me in the lurch, you have never had the
          opportunity of getting strong. Now there is nothing to hinder you: throw everything aside,
          be a slave to your body. I shall consider the <pb n="210"/> amount of attention you pay to
          your health the measure of your regard for me. Good-bye, dear Tiro, good-bye good-bye, and
          good health to you! Lepta and all the rest send their kind regards. Good-bye! <milestone

          See what Curius, Lyso, and the doctor think of it. I intended to send Mario back to you,
          that you might despatch him to me when you were a little better: but I reflected that
          Mario could only bring me one letter, while I was anxious for several. So you will be able
          (and pray do so, if you love me) to make Acastus go down to the harbour every day: there
          will be plenty of people to whom you may safely intrust a letter, and who will be pleased
          to convey it to me. For my part, I will not omit anyone who is going to Patrae. I place
          all my reliance for your proper treatment on Curius. Nothing can be kinder than he is, or
          more attached to me. Put yourself entirely in his hands. I would rather see you a little

        <p> CICERO and his son greet Tiro warmly. We parted from you, as you know, on the 2nd of
          November. We arrived at Leucas on the 6th of November, on the 7th at Actium. There we were
          detained till the 8th by a storm. Thence on the 9th we arrived at Corcyra after a charming
          voyage. At Corcyra we were detained by bad weather till the 15th. On the 16th we continued
          our voyage to Cassiope, a harbour of Corcyra, a distance of 120 stades. There we were
          detained by winds until the 22nd. Many of those who in this interval impatiently attempted
          the crossing suffered shipwreck. On the 22nd, after dinner, we weighed anchor. Thence with
          a very gentle south wind and a clear sky, in the course of that night and the next day we
          arrived in hìgh spirits on Italian soil at Hydrus, <note n="1" anchored="true">Also called
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Hydruntum;</foreign> mod. Otranto. </note> and with the same
          wind next day—that is, the 24th of November—at 10 o'clock in the morning we reached
          Brundisium, and exactly at the same time as ourselves Terentia (who values you very
          highly) made her entrance into the town. On the 26th, at Brundisium, a slave of Cn.
          Plancius at length delivered to me the ardently expected letter from you, dated the 13th
          of November. It greatly lightened my anxiety: would that it had entirely removed it!
          However, the physician Asclapo positively asserts that you will shortly be well. What need
          is there for me at this time of day to exhort you to take <pb n="213"/> every means to
          re-establish your health? I know your good sense, temperate habits, and affection for me:
          I am sure you will do everything you can to join me as soon as possible. But though I wish
          this, I would not have you hurry yourself in any way. I could have wished you had shirked
          Lyso's concert, for fear of incurring a fourth fit of your seven-day fever. But since you
          have preferred to consult your politeness rather than your health, be careful for the
          future. I have sent orders to Curius for a douceur to be given to the physician, and that
          he should advance you whatever you want, engaging to pay the money to any agent he may
          name. I am leaving a horse and mule for you at Brundisium. At Rome I fear that the 1st of
          January will be the beginning of serious disturbances. I shall take a moderate line in all
          respects. It only remains to beg and entreat you not to set sail rashly-seamen are wont to
          hurry things for their own profit: be cautious, my dear Tiro: you have a wide and
          difficult sea before you. If you can, start with Mescinius; he is usually cautious about a
          sea passage: if not, travel with some man of rank, whose position may give him influence
          over the ship-owner. If you take every precaution in this matter and present yourself to
          us safe and sound, I shall want nothing more of you. Good-bye, again and again, dear Tiro!
          I am writing with the greatest earnestness about you to the physician, to Curius, and to
          Lyso. Good-bye, and God bless you. </p>

            began in earnest as soon as Caesar crossed the Rubicon. Directly the news arrived Pompey
            left Rome to gather soldiers stationed in winter quarters and on garrison duty in
            various parts of Italy, and Italy itself was portioned out into districts for defence
            under various magistrates and senators. But by the 18th of March Pompey had quitted
            Italy, never to return, with the two consuls and other magistrates; and before the end
            of the month Caesar had arrived at Rome, left it in charge of the praetor Lepidus, and
            Italy in charge of the tribune Antony, specially invested with praetorian powers, and
            had gone to besiege Marseilles and to fight Pompey's legates in Spain. Cicero, who had
            had the district of Capua assigned to him, had nothing left but to keep as quiet as he
            could in his country houses. But his conscience left him no peace until he had joined
            Pompey in Greece, though he was fully aware of the unsatisfactory nature of the party
            which had accompanied him there. After long hesitation, he at last made up his mind,
            early in June, to join Pompey's camp. After his arrival there we have no more letters

        <p> CICERO and his son, Terentia, Tullia, Quintus and his son, send warm greetings to Tiro.
          Though I miss your ever-ready help at every turn yet it is not for my sake so much as for
          yours that I grieve at your illness. But now that the violence of your disease has abated
          so far as to become a quartan fever—for so Curius writes me word—I hope that with care you
          will soon become stronger. Only be sure-as becomes a man of your good sense—to think of
          nothing for the present except how to get well in the best possible way. I know how your
          regret at being absent worries you, but all difficulties will disappear, if you get well.
          I would not have you hurry, for fear of your suffering from sea-sickness in your weak
          state, and finding a winter voyage dangerous. I arrived at the city walls on the 4th of
          January. Nothing could be more complimentary than the procession that came out to meet me;
          but I found things in a blaze of civil discord, or rather civil war. I desired to find a
          cure for this, and, as I think, could have done so; but I was hindered by the passions of
          particular persons, for on both sides there are those who desire to fight. The long and
          short of it is that Caesar himself—once our friend— has sent the senate a menacing and
          offensive despatch, <note n="1" anchored="true">Caesar (<bibl n="Caes. Civ. 1.5">B.C.
              1.5</bibl>) describes it as containing demands of "the mildest possible kind"<foreign
              xml:lang="la">—lenissima postulata</foreign>. It was brought by Curio, who, going out
            of office on the 10th December, had joined Caesar at <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Ravenna</foreign>. </note> and is so insolent as to retain his army and province in
          spite of the senate, and my old friend Curio is backing him up. Farthermore, our friend
          Antonius and Q. Cassius, having been expelled from the house, though without any violence,
          left town with Curio to join Caesar, directly the senate had passed the decree ordering "
          consuls, praetors, tribunes, and us proconsuls to see that the Republic received no
          damage." <note n="2" anchored="true">This <foreign xml:lang="la">senatus consultum
              ultimum</foreign> was passed on the 7th of January, the fifth meeting of the
            senate-two comitial days, 3rd and 4th, preventing a meeting being held (<bibl
              n="Caes. Civ. 1.5">Caesar, B.C. 1.5</bibl>). Cicero's assertion that no violence was
            done to Cassius and Antony seems to be confirmed by Caesar's account, who only says that
            after this decree <foreign xml:lang="la">profugiunt statim ex urbe</foreign> tr. pl. If
            any violence had been used, he would certainly have mentioned it as strengthening his
            case. In the decree the (unusual) mention of proconsuls was in order to include Pompey
            and Cicero. </note> Never has the state been in greater danger: never have disloyal
          citizens had a <pb n="235"/> better prepared leader. On the whole, however, preparations
          are being pushed on with very great activity on our side also. This is being done by the
          influence and energy of our friend Pompey, who now, when it is too late, begins to fear
          Caesar. In spite of these exciting incidents, a full meeting of the senate clamoured for a
          triumph being granted me: but the consul Lentulus, in order to enhance his service to me,
          said that as soon as he had taken the measures necessary for the public safety, he would
          bring forward a motion on the subject. I do nothing in a spirit of selfish ambition, and
          consequently my influence is all the greater. Italy has been marked out into districts,
          shewing for what part each of us is to be responsible. I have taken Capua. That is all I
          wanted to tell you. Again and again I urge you to take care of your health, and to write
          to me as often as you have anyone to whom to give a letter. Good-bye, good-bye <milestone

          convenience you were unwilling to disturb me, I should wish you to believe that, if you
          had sent me word, I should have preferred your wish to my own <pb n="236"/> convenience.
          In reply to your letter, I Should have been able to write to you on the details more
          conveniently, if my secretary, M. Tullius, had been with me. lie, I feel certain, at any
          rate in making up the accounts—I cannot speak of other things-did not knowingly do
          anything adverse to your interest or your reputation. And in the next place I can assure
          you that, if the old rule and ancient custom as to giving in accounts had been in force, I
          should never have given them in until I had first checked and made them up with you, as
          our close official connexion demanded. What I should have done outside Rome, had the old
          custom remained in force, that I did in the province, because, by the Julian law, it was
          necessary to leave accounts in the province and to give in a verbatim copy of them at the
          treasury. I did not do this with a view of forcing you to adopt my calculation; but I put
          a great confidence in you, and shall never be sorry that I did so. For I handed over my
          secretary to your entire control—of whom I now see that you entertain suspicions—and you
          joined your brother M. Mindius with him in the business. The accounts were made up, in my
          absence, under your eye, to which I did nothing whatever beyond reading them. When I
          received a copy from my secretary, I regarded it as received from your brother. If that
          was a compliment, I could not pay you a greater one: if it was an instance of confidence,
          I have shewn you almost more than I shewed myself: if my duty had been to see that nothing
          was entered in them that was not for your honour and advantage, there was no one to whom I
          could have intrusted them in preference to the man to whom I did do so. At any rate, I
          merely obeyed the law by depositing copies of the accounts made up and audited in two
          cities, Laodicea and Apamea, which I regarded as the two chief cities (for it had to be
          the chief cities). So then to this point my first reply is that, though for good and
          sufficient reasons I have made haste to give in the accounts at the treasury, yet I should
          have waited for you, had I not considered that depositing the accounts in the province was
          tantamount to giving them in at the treasury. <note n="1" anchored="true">Because the two
            copies, having been deposited in the provincial towns, could not be altered, and the
            copy in the treasury was bound to be a verbatim copy of them. </note>
          <pb n="237"/>
          <milestone unit="para"/>As to what you say of Volusius, that has nothing to do with the
          accounts. I have been advised by experts-among them by C Camillus, the best lawyer of the
          day and a very kind friend of mine— that the debt (the amount was not 3,000 sestertia, as
          you say, but 1,900) could not be transferred from Valerius to Volusius, and that the
          sureties of Valerius were liable. For a sum of money had been paid us in the name of
          Valerius as purchaser: the balance I entered in the accounts. <note n="1" anchored="true"
            >Apparently Cicero, having satisfied himself that the proportion of the 1,900 <foreign
              xml:lang="la">sestertia</foreign> paid by Valerius was sufficient to save the treasury
            from loss, entered the balance on the debit side as "remitted" or "returned" on his
            authority as proconsul. We cannot tell what the debt was, perhaps for some contract, for
            which Volusius had bid too high, and for which Valerius (a banker) gave securities, and
            because he be-came thereby the purchaser or contractor (<foreign xml:lang="la"
              >manceps</foreign>) was liable to the state for the whole. </note> But your proposal
          robs me of the fruit of my liberality, of my activity, and even (what, after all, I do not
          much care about) of a moderate amount of good sense: of my liberality, because you prefer
          to suppose my legate and my prefect, Q. Lepta, to have been relieved from a most serious
          calamity by the good offices of my secretary rather than of myself, and that though they
          ought never to have been made liable: of my activity, because you suppose that in regard
          to so important a duty, I may say so grave a danger, I neither knew anything nor took any
          thought—that my secretary made any entry he chose without even going through the form of
          reading it over to me: of my good sense, because you think that an arrangement, which had
          been thought out by me with no little acuteness, had been practically not thought of at
          all. The fact of the matter is that the release of Volusius was my own design, and I also
          formed the plan for relieving the securities of Valerius and Tit. Marius himself from so
          heavy a loss. And this scheme has not only the approval of everybody, but their warm
          commendation, and, if you wish to know the real truth, I perceived that my secretary was
          the one person who did not like it. But it was my view that, so long as the People got its
          own, a good man should consult for the interests of so large a number-whether of friends
          or fellow citizens. As regards Lucceius, the <pb n="238"/> arrangement Come to, at the
          suggestion of Pompey, was that the money should be deposited in a temple. I acknowledged
          that as having been done on my order. This money Pompey has employed, as Sestius did that
          deposited by you. But this, I am aware, does not affect you. I should have been sorry to
          have omitted to record your having deposited the money in the temple on my order, had not
          that sum been attested by records of the most solemn and precise nature— stating to whom
          it was paid, by what decree of the senate, and in virtue of what written order from you
          and from myself it had been handed over to P. Sestius. <note n="1" anchored="true">The two
            points Cicero answers are: (I) Rufus Complained of an item in the accounts, in which
            Valerius had been entered as a debtor to the state, and also as having discharged the
            debt, though he had not paid the full <foreign xml:lang="la">sum</foreign>. This Cicero
            explains that he did on professional advice, as Valerius, not Volusius, was liable: he
            had remitted this balance, because the state did not lose anything. (2) Rufus complains
            that Cicero made no entry of a certain <foreign xml:lang="la">sum</foreign>, as to which
            there was a dispute, having been deposited by him in a temple. Cicero says he might have
            done so, but that, after all, Rufus was protected by a number of formal receipts and
            other documents. We have heard of disputed money being put in a temple before (p. 131).
            Pompey and Sestius (Cicero's successor in <foreign xml:lang="la">Cilicia</foreign>) took
            this money in virtue of a senatorial decree passed on the 7th of January, giving Pompey
            a large number of men and complete command of all public money (<bibl n="TLG551.17 2.34"
              >App. B.C. 2.34</bibl>; Dio, 41, 3). It was thus that Caesar was justified in
            regarding what he found in the hands of Pompeian officers as public money (see <bibl
              n="Caes. Civ. 1.23">Caes. B.C. 1.23</bibl>). The senate having passed this vote, Rufus
            and Cicero gave their orders or cheque upon the temple to pay the money to Pompey
          </note> Seeing that these facts had been put on record in so many ways, that a mistake in
          regard to them was impossible, I did not make an entry, which after all had no reference
          to you. However, I wish now I had made the entry, since I see that you regret its not
          having been done. <milestone unit="para"/>I quite agree as to your being obliged, as you
          Say, to enter this transaction, and your balance will not differ at all from mine by your
          doing so. You may add also, "on my authority," which, though I did not add it, I have no
          reason for denying, nor should deny, had there been any such reason, and had you declined
          to add it. Again, as to the sum of 900,000 sesterces: that, at any rate, was entered in
          accordance with your own or your brother's wishes. However, if there is any entry (for the
          posting of the public <pb n="239"/> ledger is not Completed) which I can correct even now
          in my accounts, I must consider—since I have not taken advantage of the decree of the
          senate—what grace the laws allow me. <note n="1" anchored="true">It appears that the
            senate had granted him an extension of time as to giving in his accounts, but that,
            having not taken advantage of that, decree, he can only do what the law dictates as to
            sending in corrections. But the reading and meaning of <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >de</foreign> logaeo is very uncertain. </note> Anyhow, you were not bound to make the
          entry you have made in regard to the amount collected tally with my accounts, <note n="2"
            anchored="true">The reading and meaning are alike uncertain. I suppose it to refer to
            the <foreign xml:lang="la">sum</foreign> of money just mentioned, as to the entry of
            which in Cicero's accounts Rufus found some technical objection. Cicero says, "Well, you
            and your brother agreed as to the item: and in your office as quaestor you were
            responsible for the account of the amount actually got in, and were not bound to copy my
            entry in your own accounts." </note> unless I am mistaken-for there are others with more
          technical knowledge than myself. But pray do not doubt my doing everything that I think to
          be for your interests or in accordance with your wish, if I possibly can. <milestone
            unit="para"/>As to what you say about the list for good-service rewards, you must know
          that I have returned the names of my military tribunes and prefects, and the members of
          the staff—at least of my own staff. <note n="3" anchored="true">Not yours also. The
              <foreign xml:lang="la">contubernales</foreign> were young men serving with a
            magistrate as volunteers, for the sake of experience. </note> In this matter, indeed, I
          made a mistake. I thought that the time allowed me for giving in their names was
          unlimited: I was afterwards in-formed that it had to be done within thirty days of handing
          in my accounts. I am very sorry that this list for good-service rewards was not reserved
          to enhance your credit rather than mine, since I have no promotion to work for. However,
          in regard to the centurions and the subalterns of the military tribunes, nothing has yet
          been done, for good-service rewards of that class have no time limit by law. <milestone
            unit="para"/>The last item is the 100,000 sesterces, in regard to which I remember
          receiving a letter from you from Myrina acknowledging the mistake to be not mine, but
          yours. The mistake—if mistake it was— appeared to have originated with your brother and
          Tullius. But since it could not be corrected—for I had already deposited my accounts and
          quitted my province—I believe I answered you as politely <pb n="240"/> as the warmth of my
          feelings dictated and my financial outlook at the time allowed. <note n="1"
            anchored="true">I. e., considering that I was saving all I Could for my triumph, and
            that I could ill afford to lose so much (about £800). </note> But I did not either then
          consider that I was bound by the polite tone of my letter, nor do I now think that I was
          bound to have regarded your letter about the 100 sestertia in the light in which men
          regard dunning letters received in times like these. At the same time you ought to take
          this into consideration. The whole sum of money legally coming to me I deposited with the
          publicani at Ephesus. It amounted to 2,200,000 sesterces (about £17,600). The whole of it
          has been appropriated by Pompey. Whether I submit to that with patience or the reverse,
          you at least ought to take the loss of 100 sestertia (about £800) with equanimity, and to
          reckon that just so much the less has come into your pocket from your own allowances or my
          liberality. But even if you had debited me with this 100 sestertia, yet your kindness and
          affection for me is such that you would not wish to distrain <note n="2" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Aestimationem accipere</foreign>, i.e., to take property in
            satisfaction of a debt, on a fixed valuation. </note> on me at such a time as this: for,
          however much I wished the money paid in cash, I have not the wherewithal. But regard this
          as a joke, just as I do what you said. However, as soon as Tullius comes back from the
          country, I will send him to you, if you think that will be any good. I have no reason for
          wishing this letter not to be torn up. <note n="3" anchored="true">Cicero seems to mean
            that if Rufus thinks the letter against his interest, he is at liberty to destroy it,
            and so have a freer hand in dealing with his secretary Tullius. </note>

        <p> TULLIUS to his wife, and her father to his dearest daughter, and Cicero to his mother

          reconsider what to do, whether to stay at Rome, or to join me, or seek some place of
          safety. This is not a point for my consideration alone, but for yours also. What occurs to
          me is this: you may be safe at Rome under Dolabella's protection, and that Circumstance
          may prove serviceable to us in case of any violence or plunder Commencing. But, on the
          other hand, I am shaken in this idea by seeing that all the loyalists have left Rome and
          have the ladies of their families with them. Again, the district in which I now am
          consists of towns and estates also which are in my power, so you could be a good deal with
          me, and, if you quitted me, Could very conveniently stay in domains belonging to us. I
          cannot as yet quite make up my mind which of the two is the better course for you to take.
          Please observe for yourselves what other ladies of your rank are doing, and be careful not
          to be cut off from the power of leaving town when you do wish to do so. I would have you
          carefully consider it again and again with each other and with your <pb n="246"/> friends.
          Tell Philotimus to secure the house with barricades and a watch. Also please organize a

        <p> TULLIUS to Terentia, her father to Tullia, his two sweethearts, and Cicero to his
          excellent mother and darling sister, send warm greetings. If you are well, we are so too.
          It is now for you to consider, and not for me only, what you must do. If Caesar means to
          come to Rome in a peaceable manlier, you can stay at home with safety for the present: but
          if in his madness he is going to give up the city to plunder, I fear Dolabella himself may
          not be able to protect us sufficiently. Besides, I am alarmed lest we should be cut off
          from you, so that when you do wish to leave town you may be prevented. There is one other
          thing, which you are in the best position to observe yourselves-are other ladies of your
          rank remaining in Rome? If not, it deserves consideration whether you can do so with
          propriety. As things stand at present indeed, always provided that I am allowed to hold
          this district, you will be able to stay with me or on one of our estates with the greatest
          comfort. There is another thing I am afraid of-a want of provisions in the city before
          long. On these points pray consult with Pomponius, with Camillus, with anybody you think
          right: above all don't be frightened. Labienus has made things better for us. Piso, too,
          is helpful in quitting the city and declaring his own son-in-law guilty of treason. Do

        <p> How seriously my personal safety and that of all loyalists is imperilled, as well as
          that of the whole senate and Republic, you may judge from the fact that we have abandoned
          our town houses, and the very city itself, to plunder and conflagration. Matters have come
          to such a pitch that, unless some god or some accident intervenes, we cannot possibly be
          saved. For my part, ever since I arrived at the city, I have never ceased promoting in
          thought, word, and deed everything that made for peace: but a strange mad passion for
          fighting has inflamed not only the disloyal, but even those who are reckoned loyalists,
          though I loudly proclaim that nothing can be more lamentable than a civil war.
          Accordingly, when Caesar yielded to the promptings of what may be called downright
          insanity, and— forgetting his name and his honours—had successively occupied Ariminum,
          Pisaurum, Ancona, and Arretium, I left the city. On the wisdom or courage of such a step
          it is useless to argue. You see how we stand now. The upshot is, proposals are received
          from Caesar that Pompey should go to Spain: that the levies already completed and our
          garrisons should be disbanded: that he will hand over farther Gaul to Domitius, hither
          Gaul to Considius Nonianus (these are the men to whom these <pb n="254"/> provinces have
          been allotted): that he will come to canvass for the consulship, and no longer demand that
          his candidature be admitted in his absence: that he will be in town as candidate for the
          legal three nundinae. <note n="1" anchored="true">That is, seventeen clear days. </note>
          We accept the proposals, but on the condition that he withdraws his garrisons from the
          places he has occupied, so that a meeting of the senate may be held at Rome to discuss
          these same proposals in security. If he does this, there is hope of a peace—not a
          creditable one, for we accept terms from him, but anything is better than to be as we are.
          If; on the other hand, he declines to abide by his terms, everything is ready for war, but
          of a kind that he cannot possibly maintain-especially as he will have shirked terms
          proposed by himself—provided only that we cut him off from all power of approaching the
          city. This we hope can be done: for we are holding levies on a large scale, and we think
          that he is afraid, if he once begins a march upon the city, that he may lose the Gauls,
          both of which, with the exception of the Transpadani, are bitterly hostile to him: and on
          the side of Spain he has six legions and a large force of auxiliaries under Afranius and
          Petreius <note n="2" anchored="true">Two of the three legates of Pompey in Spain. </note>
          on his rear. If he persists in his madness it seems possible that he may be crushed—if it
          can only be done without losing Rome! He has, again, received a very severe blow in the
          fact that Titus Labienus, who occupied the most influential position in his army, has
          declined to be a partner in his crime. He has abandoned him and is with us, and many are
          said to intend doing the same. I as yet am president of the sea-coast from Formiae. I
          refused any more important function, that my letters and exhortations to peace might have
          greater influence with Caesar. If; however, war does break out, I see that I shall have to
          take command of a camp and a definite number of legions. I have another trouble in the
          fact that my son-in-law Dolabella is with Caesar. <milestone unit="para"/>I wished you to
          know these facts, but don't let them agitate you and retard your recovery. I have
          recommended you with great earnestness to Aulus Varro, whom I know to be warmly attached
          to me and very fond of you, <pb n="255"/> asking him to interest himself in your health
          and your voyage, and generally to take you under his charge and look after you. I feel
          certain he will do all this, for he promised to do so, and spoke to me in the kindest
          manner. Pray, since you were unable to be with me at the time I most wanted your help and
          fidelity, do not hurry or allow yourself to embark upon a voyage while ill, or in bad
          weather. I shall never think you come late if you come well and strong. As yet I have seen
          no one who had seen you since M. Volusius, who handed me your letter. I don't wonder at
          this, for I don't think my letters either can reach you in such stormy weather. But do
          your best to recover, and, when you do recover, only sail when you can do so with safety.
          My son is at Formiae, Terentia and Tullia at Rome. Take care of yourself. <milestone

          or hear of anyone prompter in action than our Caesar, and more moderate in victory? Why!
          Do you think that our soldiers, who in the most inclement and frozen <pb n="299"/>

          has nothing to do with me. I can't explain matters to you unless we meet, and I hope that
          will soon take place. For as soon as he has driven Pompey out of Italy, Caesar has
          resolved to summon me to Rome: and I look upon that as good as done, unless Pompey has
          preferred being besieged in Brundisium. Upon my life, the chief motive I have for hurrying
          there is my ardent desire to see you and impart all my thoughts. And what a lot I have!
          Goodness! I am afraid that, as usual, I shall forget them all when I do see you. But what

          are in arms, and that on some trumpery excuse. Bellienus, a slave of Demetrius, who was

          <note n="2" anchored="true">Probably near Marseilles, where Caesar stopped on his way to
            Spain for some weeks to organize its siege. </note> (16) APRIL Being mortally alarmed by
          your letter, in which you shewed that your mind was filled with gloomy ideas, without
          saying outright what they were, and yet betraying the kind of action which you were
          contemplating, I write this letter to you on the spot. In the name of your fortunes and
          your children, my dear Cicero, I beg and beseech you not rashly to imperil your safety and
          security. I protest in the name of gods and men, and of our friendship, that I told you
          beforehand, and that my warning was not given inconsiderately, but that after meeting
          Caesar, and ascertaining what his view would be, if he gained the victory, I informed you
          of it. If you think that Caesar will maintain the same policy in letting his adversaries
          go and offering terms, you are mistaken. His thoughts, and even his words, forebode
          nothing but severity and cruelty. He left town incensed with the senate: he was thoroughly
          roused by the recent tribunician intercessions: <note n="3" anchored="true">The
            intercessions of Metelius. See previous letter, p. 364 </note> there will be no place,
          by heaven, <pb n="368"/> for mediation. Wherefore, if you love yourself, if you love your
          only son, if your family and your remaining hopes are dear to you: if I, or that excellent
          man your son-in-law, have any influence with you—and you surely ought not to wish to ruin
          us, in order to force us to choose between loathing and abandoning the cause, on the
          triumph of which our safety depends, or harbouring an unnatural wish against your safety.
          Finally consider this: whatever offence your hesitation has caused Pompey you have already
          incurred; it would be a piece of most consummate folly to act against Caesar now that he
          is victorious, when you refused to attack him while his fortunes were doubtful—to join the
          men after they have been driven into flight, whom you refused to follow when they were
          holding their ground. Take care lest, while feeling ashamed of not being a good enough
          Optimate, you fail to select the best course for yourself. But if I can't persuade you to
          take my advice in toto, at least wait till it is known how we get on in the Spanish
          provinces, which I have to tell you will be ours as soon as Caesar arrives. What hope your
          people have when the Spains are lost I don't know. Of what, then, you can be thinking to
          join men in so desperate a position, on my honour, I cannot imagine. What you told me,
          though not in so many words, Caesar had already heard, and he had scarcely said "good
          morning!" to me when he mentioned what he had heard about you. I said I did not know
          anything about it, but yet begged him to write you a letter as the best method of inducing
          you to stay in the country. He is taking me into Spain with him. For if he were not doing
          so, before going to Rome, I should have hastened to visit you, wherever you were, and
          should have pressed this upon you personally, and tried with might and main to keep you
          from going. Pray, my dear Cicero, reflect again and again, and do not utterly ruin
          yourself and all your family, nor knowingly, and with your eyes open, put yourself into a
          situation from which you can see no possible retreat. But if, on the one hand, you are
          shaken by the remarks of the Optimates, or, on the other, are unable to endure the
          intemperance and offensive behaviour of certain persons, I think you should select some
          town not affected by the war, while this controversy is being <pb n="369"/> fought out,
          which will be settled almost directly. If you do this, you will, in my opinion have acted
          wisely, and will not offend Caesar. </p>

        <p> Mv intimate friend Gaius Trebatius has written to me to say that you have inquired of
          him where I was, and that you regretted that, owing to the state of your health, you had
          not seen me after my arrival at the city walls, and that at the present time you wished,
          if I came nearer, to consult with me on what was the duty of us both. Oh that it had been
          possible, Servius, for us to converse before the ruin— that is the word!—had been
          completed. We should surely have contributed some assistance to the falling Republic. For
          I am fully informed, though absent myself, that, foreseeing these disasters long before,
          you were the supporter of peace both during and after your consulship. I, however, though
          approving your policy and holding the same opinion myself, was unable to do any good. For
          I arrived late in the day; I was isolated; I was regarded as imperfectly acquainted with
          the facts: I had suddenly plunged into a scene of mad passion for war. Now, since it seems
          impossible for us to furnish any support to the Republic, if there is any measure within
          our power to take in our own particular interests—I don't mean to maintain our old
          position, but to express our grief in the manner most honourable to ourselves-there is no
          one in the world with whom I should think it proper to confer in preference to yourself.
          For you do not forget the <pb n="373"/> examples of the most illustrious men—whom we ought
          to resemble— nor the maxims of the greatest philosophers, whom you have always worshipped.
          And, in fact, I should myself have written to you before to warn you that your going to
          the senate—or rather to the convention of senators <note n="1" anchored="true">See
              <foreign xml:lang="la">ante</foreign>, p. 358. Cicero professes to hold that the
            meeting could not be called a "senate" in the absence of the consuls, many other
            magistrates, and a considerable number of the ordinary members. But the praetor Lepidus
            had the legal right of summoning it, and there was no law demanding the presence of
            other magistrates. </note> —would have no result, had I not been afraid of annoying the
          man who was urging me to imitate you. Him indeed I gave clearly to understand, when he
          asked me to attend the senate, that I should say precisely what you said about peace, and
          about the Spains. You see how the matter stands: the whole world is parcelled out among
          men in military command, and is ablaze with war: the city, without laws, law courts,
          justice, or credit, has been abandoned to plunder and fire. Accordingly, nothing occurs to
          me, I don't say to hope, but scarcely even to venture to wish. If, however, you, in your
          supreme wisdom, think it of any advantage that we should have a discussion, though I am
          thinking of going still farther from the city, the very name of which I do not now like to
          hear mentioned, I will yet come nearer; and I have instructed Trebatius not to decline to
          bring any message you wished to send me: and I should like you to do so, or to send me any
          of your own friends that you can trust, so that you may not be obliged to leave the city,
          or I to approach it. I pay you the same high compliment as I perhaps claim for myself, in
          feeling sure that whatever we mutually agree upon, will have the approbation of all the
          world. Farewell. <pb n="374"/>

        <p> I received your letter on the 28th of April, while at my Cuman villa. As soon as I had
          read it I perceived that Philotimus, considering that he had, as you say, received verbal
          instructions from you on every point, had made a great mistake in not having come to me
          personally, but sending your letter, which I understood to have been the shorter because
          you had imagined that he would deliver it. However, after I had read your letter, your
          wife Postumia and our dear Servius called on me. Their opinion was that you should come to
          Cumae, and they even urged me to write and tell you so. You ask what my advice is: it is
          of such a nature, that it is easier to adopt it myself than to give it to another. What
          measure could I venture to urge on a man possessed of your supreme influence and knowledge
          of affairs? If we ask what is most right, the answer is plain: if what is expedient, it is
          doubtful. But if we are the men we really ought to be-holding, that is, the faith that
          nothing is expedient except what is right and virtuous-there can be no doubt as to what we
          ought to do. You express your opinion that my case is closely connected with <pb n="376"/>
          yours. Well, at least we both made the same mistake, though with the very best intentions.
          For both of us continually advised a peaceful solution; and since nothing was more to
          Caesar's advantage, we thought that we were obliging him by supporting peace. How grossly
          mistaken we have been, and to what a pass things have come, you now see. Nor do you only
          perceive what is actually going on and what has gone on, but also what the course of
          affairs and the ultimate result will be. Therefore you must either approve the measures
          now being taken, or be a party to them in spite of disapproving them. The one alternative
          in my eyes is discreditable, the other is dangerous as well. I can only come, therefore,
          to one conclusion—that I ought to quit the country. All that I have, I think, to consider
          in so departing is the method to adopt, and the country to which to go. Surely there never
          were circumstances of greater distress, or even a question more difficult to settle. For
          no decision is possible that does not fall foul of some great difficulty. For you, my
          opinion is—if you will agree with me—that, if you have made up your mind as to what you
          think you ought to do, in a way which separates your plan from mine, you should save
          yourself the trouble of the journey here but if there is anything you wish to impart to
          me, I shall expect you. Of course, I should like you to come as soon as you can
          conveniently to yourself, as I perceived was the wish both of Servius and Postumia.
          Farewell. </p>

        <p> Though I never doubted your great affection for me, yet I learn it better every day of
          my life, and I never forget what you once said in a letter, that you would be more zealous
          in shewing me attention than you had been in the province (though, to my mind, nothing
          could exceed your loyalty in <pb n="377"/> the province), in proportion as your judgment
          could now be more independent. Accordingly, your former letter gave me great pleasure,
          because it shewed me that my arrival was affectionately looked forward to by you, and
          that, when things turned out differently from what you had expected, you were greatly
          rejoiced at the line I took. So, also, this last letter is extremely valuable to me from
          the expression at once of your judgment and your affection: of your judgment, because I
          learn that, as all gallant and good men are bound to do, you hold nothing to be expedient
          except what is right and virtuous; of your affection, because you promise to stand by me,
          whatever course of policy I shall adopt. Nothing could be more gratifying to me, nor, as I
          think, more honourable to yourself. My own course has long been decided. I have not
          written to tell you of it before, not because you were one to be kept in the dark, but
          because the communication of a policy at such a time seems in a certain sense to be an
          exhortation to duty, or rather a summons to share in either danger or labour. Seeing,
          however, that your goodwill, kindness, and affection for me are what they are, I gladly
          embrace such a heart. But I do so on this condition, for I will not abandon my habitual
          modesty in asking favours: if you do what you profess, I shall be grateful; if not, I
          shall pardon you, and consider that you were unable to deny the latter to your fears, the
          former to me. For it is in sober earnest an extremely difficult case. The right thing to
          do is clear: as to the expedient thing, though it is obscure, yet, if we are the men we
          ought to be, that is, worthy of our philosophical studies, we cannot entertain a doubt
          that the most advantageous course is the course of strictest honour. Wherefore, if you
          determine to join me, come at once. But if you wish to act with me and to go to the same
          place, but cannot do so just yet, I will keep you fully informed on every point. Whichever
          way you decide I shall look upon you as my friend, but as the closest possible friend if
          you decide on the course which I desire. <pb n="378"/>

          <dateline>CUMAE (MAY)</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> Your letter <note n="1" anchored="true">See Letter CCCLXXXII, p. 367. This letter to
            Caelius is far more discreditable to Cicero than the most pitiful of his letters from
            exile. There is hardly a word in it which is not false, or a <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >suggestio falsi</foreign>. It was meant to be shewn to Caesar, and is a sad piece of
            trimming. It is astonishing that he should have sent <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Atticus</foreign> a copy of it, when he remembered what he had written continually to
            him. The idea of Malta, if really entertained, was only a passing one. His real
            hesitation was as to going to Pompey. </note> would have given me great pain, had it not
          been that by this time reason itself has dispelled all feelings of annoyance, and had not
          my mind, from long despair of public safety, become callous to any new sorrow.
          Nevertheless, I do not know how it happened that you conceived from my former letter the
          suspicion which you mention in yours. For what did it contain beyond a lamentation over
          the state of the times, which do not cause me greater anxiety than they do you? For I know
          the keenness of your intellect too well to suppose that you do not see what I see myself.
          What surprises me is that, knowing me as thoroughly as you ought to do, you could be
          induced to think, that I was either so shortsighted as to abandon a fortune in the
          ascendant for one on the wane and all but entirely sunk; or so inconsistent as to throw
          away the favour already gained of a man at the height of prosperity, and so be untrue to
          myself, and— a thing which I have from the beginning and ever since avoided—take part in a
          civil war. What, then, do you mean by my "lamentable" design? Is it that of retiring,
          perhaps, to some secluded spot? For you know how it not <pb n="386"/> only turns my
          stomach—as it used at one time to turn yours also—but sickens my very eyes to see the
          insolent conduct of mere upstarts. I have the additional <foreign xml:lang="fr"
            >gêne</foreign> of the procession of lictors, and the title of imperator, by which I am
          addressed. If I had been without that burden, I should have been content with any retreat,
          however humble, in Italy. But these laurelled fasces of mine not only attract the eyes,
          but now also provoke the remarks of the malevolent. And though that is so, I yet never
          thought of leaving the country without the approbation of your party. But you know my
          small estates: I am obliged to stay on them, not to be troublesome to my friends. Now the
          fact of my finding it pleasantest to reside in my marine villa causes some to suspect me
          of an intention to embark on a voyage: and, after all, perhaps I should not have been
          unwilling to do so, had I been able to reach peace: for how could I consistently sail to
          war: especially against a man who, I hope, has forgiven me, on the side of a man who by
          this time cannot possibly forgive me? <milestone unit="para"/>In the next place, you might
          without any difficulty have understood my feeling at the time of your visit to me in my
          Cuman villa. For I did not conceal from you what Titus Ampius had said: <note n="1"
            anchored="true">Who advocated uncompromising resistance to Caesar. </note> you saw how I
          shrank from leaving the city after hearing it. Did I not assure you that I would endure
          anything rather than quit Italy to take part in a civil war? What, then, has occurred to
          make me change my resolve? Has not everything been rather in favour of my abiding by my
          opinion? Pray believe me in this—and I am sure you do think so-that among these miseries I
          seek for nothing but that people should at length understand that I have preferred peace
          to everything: that, when that was given up in despair, my first object was to avoid
          actual civil war. Of this consistent conduct I think I shall never have cause to repent. I
          remember, for instance, that our friend Q. Hortensius used to plume himself on this
          particular thing, that he had never taken any part in a civil war. In this matter my
          credit will be more brilliant, because it was attributed to want of spirit in his case: in
          mine I do not think that this idea can possibly be entertained. Nor am I terrified by the
          considerations <pb n="387"/> which you put before me, with the most complete fidelity and
          affection, with the view of alarming me. For there is no sort of violence that does not
          seem to be hanging over the heads of all in this world-wide convulsion; and this, indeed,
          I would with the greatest pleasure have averted from the Republic at the cost of my
          private and domestic losses, even those against which you bid me be on my guard. To my
          son, whom I rejoice to see enjoying your affection, I shall leave, if the Republic
          survives in any shape, a sufficiently noble inheritance in the memory of my name: but if
          it entirely disappears, nothing will happen to him apart from the rest of the citizens.
          You ask me to have some regard to my son-in-law-a most excellent young man, and very dear
          to me: can you doubt, when you know how much I regard both him, and of course my dear
          Tullia, that this subject gives me the keenest anxiety? The more so, that in the universal
          disaster I yet used to flatter myself with this little grain of hope, that my, or rather
          our, Dolabella would be freed from those embarrassments which he had brought upon himself
          by his own liberality. Pray ask him how he got through the settling days, while he was in
          the city. How disagreeable they were to him, and how derogatory to myself as his
          father-in-law! Accordingly, I am neither waiting for the result of the Spanish campaign,
          as to which I am fully convinced that the truth is as you say, nor am I meditating any
          astute policy. If there is ever to be a state, there will be doubtless a place for me: but
          if there is not, you will yourself, as I think, make for the same lonely retreats in which
          you will hear that I have taken up my abode. But perhaps I am talking wildly, and all
          these troubles will end better. For I remember the expressions of despair among those who
          were old men when I was a youth: perhaps I am now imitating them, and indulging in the
          usual weakness of my time of life. I wish it may be so. But nevertheless!-I suppose you
          have heard that a purple-bordered toga is being woven for Oppius. <note n="1"
            anchored="true">That is, Oppius, a partisan of Caesar's, and generally spoken of in
            connexion with Balbus, is to have some curule office by Caesar's favour. </note> For our
          friend Curtius thinks of a double-dyed one: but the hand that should dye it keeps him
          waiting. <note n="2" anchored="true">M. Curtius Postumus, who had also joined Caesar, was
            to have an augurship (see p. 396). The augurs wore a <foreign xml:lang="la"

            calls <foreign xml:lang="grc">di/bafon</foreign> (vol. i., p. 98). By infector, "dyer,"
            Cicero seems to mean Caesar, who was to give him the promotion. </note> I put in this
          seasoning of joke to shew you that, in <pb n="388"/> spite of my indignation, I am still
          in the habit of laughing. <note n="1" anchored="true">The jest consists in the jocose
            description of Oppius and Curtius— Oppius as ordering a new <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >toga</foreign>, and Curtius as sending his <foreign xml:lang="la">toga</foreign> to
            be dyed, and being kept waiting by the dyer (i.e., Caesar). He seasons the bitter herbs
            of his letter with a dressing of jest. He uses a word (<foreign xml:lang="la"
              >adspersi</foreign>) specially applied to "dressing" salads or vegetables with oil or

          you to look to it as closely as if your own interests were at stake. My last remark shall
          be this: I shall do nothing wild or inconsiderate. However, I beg you, in whatever country

        <p> ALL those uneasy feelings and melancholy thoughts, by which I kept you in such extreme
          distress, which makes me more uneasy than anything—as well as Tulliola, who is dearer to
          me than life itself-I have got rid of and ejected. The reason of it all I discovered the

          And, after all, I hope affairs are of such a nature, that I may venture to expect you to

          that Appius Claudius had been on our side, or Gaius Curio on yours ! <note n="1"
            anchored="true">For Caelius's quarrel with Appius, see vol. ii., pp.194, 195. He thinks
            that if Appius had been a Caesarian that would have made him turn Pompeian. But the
            reading is doubtful. </note> It was my friendship for the latter that gradually edged me
          on to this infernal party—for I feel that my good sense was destroyed between anger and
          affection. You too-when, being on the point of starting for Ariminum, <note n="2"

            employed by Caesar, as we know he was, vol. ii., p.298. His visit to Cicero would then
            be in the first week of January, and he would probably start for <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Ariminum</foreign> before the news had come of the crossing of the Rubicon. </note> I
          came at night to visit you—in the midst of your giving me messages for Caesar about peace,
          and playing your rôle of fine citizen, you quite <pb n="5"/> forgot your duty as a friend
          and took no thought of my interests. And I am not saying this because I have lost
          confidence in this cause, but, believe me, I'd rather die than see these fellows here.

          not afraid of your men being bloodthirsty, we should long ago have been driven out of
          Rome. For here, with the exception of a few moneylenders, there is not a man or a class
          that is not Pompeian. Personally, I have brought it about that the masses above all,
          and—what was formerly ours—the main body of citizens should be now on your side. <note
            n="2" anchored="true">Caelius contrasts <foreign xml:lang="la">plebs</foreign> and
              <foreign xml:lang="la">populus</foreign>. Of course these terms no longer have the old
            political meaning; but <foreign xml:lang="la">plebs</foreign> had come to be used as we
            use the "masses" for the lower orders generally; whereas <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >populus</foreign> was the whole body of the citizens as possessed of political power;
            and when contrasted with <foreign xml:lang="la">plebs</foreign> may be taken to mean the
            whole body politic which formed the majority at the comitia—the mass of voters. Caelius
            tried to gain the latter by opposing the exaction of debts under arbitration, as
            arranged by Caesar, and by proposing a suspension of house rents. </note> "Why did I do
          so?" quoth you. Nay, wait for what is to come: I'll make you conquer in spite of

          we are open to attack, and what our weak point is. And I shall act thus from no hope of
          reward, but, what is ever the strongest motive with me, from indignation and a feeling of
          having been wronged. What are you doing over there? Are you Waiting for a battle? That's
          Caesar's strongest point. I don't know about your forces; ours have become thoroughly
          accustomed to fighting battles and making light of cold and hunger. <note n="4"
            anchored="true">Caelius seems to insinuate that Pompey's wisest course would be to avoid
            an engagement and to make again for Italy, where the Caesarians were weak. This is the
            last appearance of Caelius in the correspondence. The discontent with his position here
            indicated-founded on the fact that though he had been appointed praetor by Caesar's
            influence, Trebonius was praetor <foreign xml:lang="la">urbanus</foreign> and in a
            superior position to himself-presently led him to take up a position of violent
            opposition, especially regard to Caesar's financial arrangements, the result of which
            was that he was forcibly suspended from his functions by the <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >consul</foreign> Servilius Isauricus. Finally, under pretence of going to Caesar at
            Alexandria, he attempted to join <foreign xml:lang="la">Milo in Apulia</foreign>, who
            was trying to secure by force his own restoration, which had not been included in the
            revocation of other exiles. <foreign xml:lang="la">Milo</foreign>, however, had already
            fallen; and when Caelius proceeded to raise forces on his own account, before he could

            foreign auxiliary soldiers, whom he attempted to win over. (<bibl n="Caes. Civ. 3.20"

        <p> If you are well, I am glad. I am quite well, and so is our dear Tullia. Terentia has
          been rather unwell, but I am assured that she has now recovered. In all other respects
          things are quite as they should be at your house. Though at no time did I deserve to be
          suspected by you of acting from party motives rather than from a regard to your interests,
          when I urged you either to join Caesar and myself, or at least to retire from open war,
          especially since victory has already inclined in our favour, it is now not even possible
          that I should create any other impression than that of urging upon you what I could not,
          with due regard to my duty as your son-in-law, suppress. On your part, my dear Cicero,
          pray regard what follows-whether you accept or reject the advice—as both conceived and
          written with the best possible intention and the most complete devotion to yourself.
            <milestone unit="para"/>You observe that Pompey is not secured either by the glory of
          his name and achievements, or by the list of client kings and peoples, which he was
          frequently wont to parade: and that even what has been possible for the rank and file, is
          impossible for him,—to effect an honourable retreat: driven as he has been from Italy, the
          Spanish provinces lost, a veteran army captured, and now finally inclosed by his enemy's
          lines. <note n="1" anchored="true">This refers to the lines, fifteen miles long, drawn by
            Caesar round Pompey's position on the bay of <foreign xml:lang="la"
            >Dyrrachium</foreign>. They were not, however, completed at the southern extremity, and
            shortly afterwards pierced them at this point, and inflicted a severe defeat upon
            Caesar. </note> Such disasters I rather think have never <pb n="7"/> happened to a Roman
          general. Wherefore employ all your Wisdom in considering what either he or you have to
          hope. For thus you will most easily adopt the policy which will be to your highest
          advantage. Yet I do beg this of you,—that if Pompey succeeds in avoiding this danger and
          taking refuge with his fleet, you should consult for your own interests, and at length be
          your own friend rather than that of anyone else in the world. You have by this time
          satisfied the claims of duty or friendship, whichever you choose to call it: you have
          fulfilled all obligations to your party also, and to that constitution to which you are
          devoted. It remains to range ourselves with the constitution as now existing, rather than,
          while striving for the old one, to find ourselves with none at all. Wherefore my desire
          is, dearest Cicero, that, supposing Pompey to be driven from this district also and
          compelled to seek other quarters, you should betake yourself to Athens or any peaceful
          city you choose. If you decide to do so, pray write and tell me, that I may, if I possibly
          can, hurry to your side. Whatever marks of consideration for your rank have to be obtained
          from the commander-in-chief, such is Caesar's kindness, that it will be the easiest thing
          in the world for you to obtain them from him yourself: nevertheless, I think that a
          petition from me also will not be without considerable weight with him. I trust to your
          honour and kindness also to see that the letter-carrier whom I send to you may be enabled
          to return to me, and bring me a letter from you. </p>

          break in the correspondence for more than three months, in the course of which the fate of
          the Republic was decided. On the 7th of July, Caesar, after Pompey had pierced his lines
          and inflicted a defeat upon him, retreated into Thessaly. Pompey's exultant followers
          forced him to follow, and on the 9th of August the battle of Pharsalia drove Pompey to his
          retreat and death in Egypt, and made Caesar master of the Empire. The fleet, indeed, still
          held out, and took those of the Pompeians who had not been in the battle or had escaped
          from it to Africa and Spain. But Cicero <pb n="12"/> (who was with the fleet at Corcyra)
          refused to join in continuing the war, and after staying some time at Patrae returned to
          Brundisium, having, it appears, received Caesar's permission through Dolabella to do so.
          At Brundisium, however, he waited many months, not venturing to approach Rome till
          Caesar's will was known. It is during his residence at Brundisium that the next
          thirty-three letters are written. The dates are according to the unreformed calendar—in
          advance of the true time as much perhaps as two months.) </p>

        <p> You say that you are glad of my safe arrival in Italy. I only hope you may continue to

          injuries which I have received, I have taken a step involving complications which I may
          find some difficulty in unravelling. <note n="1" anchored="true">There is still a
            possibility of the ultimate success of the Pompeians, who are mustered in great force in
            Africa. Pompey's son Gnaeus had threatened to kill Cicero at <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Corcyra</foreign>, when he refused to go on with the war; and, if that party
            succeeded in the end, they would regard Cicero as having acted treasonably in returning
            to Italy. This was one of the "injuries"; another was the fact that his brother and
            nephew had turned against him, and, as he believed, were denouncing him to Caesar.

          <dateline>BRUNDISIUM (AUGUST OR EARLY SEPTEMBER)</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> ALTHOUGH both of us, from a hope of peace and a loathing for Civil bloodshed, desired to
          hold aloof from an obstinate prosecution of war, nevertheless, since I think I was the
          first to adopt that policy, I am perhaps more bound to give you satisfaction on that
          point, than to expect it from you. Although, as I am often wont to recall in my own mind,
          my intimate talk with you and yours with me led us both to the Conclusion that it was
          reasonable that, if not the cause as a whole, yet at least our judgment should be decided
          by the result of one battle. Nor does anyone ever sincerely criticise this opinion of
          ours, except those who think it better that the constitution should be utterly destroyed,
          rather than remain in a maimed and weakened state. I, on the Contrary, saw of course no
          personal hope from its destruction, much from its surviving fragments. But a state of
          things has followed which makes it more surprising that <pb n="55"/> those events were
          possible, than that we did not foresee what was going to happen, and were unable with our
          merely human faculties to prophesy it. For my part, I confess that my view was that, when
          that battle had been fought, which seemed as it were to be the last word of fate, the
          conquerors would desire measures to be taken for the safety of the community at large, the
          conquered for their own. But both of these policies I regarded as depending on the
          promptness of the victor. If that promptness had been displayed, Africa would have
          experienced the same indulgence which Asia and Achaia too have witnessed, <note n="1"
            anchored="true">That is, the members of the defeated party who had taken up their abode
            in Asia and <foreign xml:lang="la">Achaia</foreign>, and the numerous adherents who had
            gathered in Africa. </note> you yourself, as I think, acting as agent and intercessor.
            <note n="2" anchored="true">Cassius had joined Caesar early with his fleet. See p.31.
          </note> But the hours having been allowed to slip away-always most precious, and never
          more so than in civil wars—the year that intervened induced some to hope for victory,
          others to think lightly of the defeat itself. And the blame for all this mischief is on
          the shoulders of fortune. For who would have thought such a serious delay as that of the
          Alexandrian war was going to be added to the war already fought, or that a princeling like
          that Pharnaces of yours was going to cause a panic in Asia. <milestone unit="para"/>For
          ourselves, however, though our policy was the same, our fortune has been different. For
          you have adopted the rôle of taking an active part in his councils, and of thus keeping
          yourself in a position to foresee what was going to happen, which more than anything else
          relieves one's anxiety. <note n="3" anchored="true">Cassius does not appear to have been
            in Egypt with Caesar, but to have remained at Rhodes or on the coast of <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Cilicia</foreign> with his ships. When Caesar crossed from Alexandria to
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Cilicia</foreign> in this year, Cassius met him at the mouth of
            the Cydnus, and, according to a later assertion of Cicero's (<bibl n="Cic. Phil. 2.26"
              >Phil. 2.26</bibl>), contemplated turning against him and destroying him. This is not
            mentioned by anyone else. </note> I, who was in a hurry to see Caesar in Italy—for that
          is what I thought would happen-and, when he returned after sparing many of the most
          honourable men, to "spur the willing horse" (as the phrase goes) in the direction of
          peace, am now most widely separated from him, and have been so all along. Moreover, I am
          living in the <pb n="56"/> hearing of the groans of Italy and the most heartrending
          complaints in Rome: to which we might perhaps have contributed some alleviation, I in my
          way, you in yours, and everyone in his own, if only the chief man had been there.
          Wherefore I would have you, in view of your unbroken affection for me, write and tell me
          what you know, what you feel, and what you think I am to expect or ought to do. A letter
          from you will be of great value in my eyes, and would that I had obeyed that first one,
          which you sent me from Luceria! For I should then have retained my position without any of
          this distress. <note n="1" anchored="true">We know nothing of this letter from Cassius. He
            seems to have advised Cicero not to leave Italy. </note> [Between the date of the last
          letter to Terentia (1 September) and that of the next (1 October) Caesar had landed at
          Tarentum, and, meeting Cicero, who was coming to greet him, alighted from his carriage,
          embraced him, had a long conversation with him on the road, and gave him free leave to
          live where he chose. Cicero seems to have at once started for his favourite round of
          visits to his villas, and then gone to Rome. This is the end, then, of the episode in his
          life connected with the Civil War. Henceforth, till Caesar's assassination, he lives a
          comparatively retired and literary life, seldom appearing in the senate or as an
          advocate.] </p>

          <dateline>ROME (DECEMBER?)</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> I found pleasure in reading your letter, and a very great one in reading your book: yet
          in the midst of that pleasure I experienced this sorrow, that, after having inflamed my
          desire of increasing the closeness of our intercourse—for as far as affection goes no
          addition was possible-you at once quit us, and inspire me with such deep regret, as to
          leave me but one consolation, namely, that our mutual regret for each other's absence may
          be softened by long and frequent letters. <note n="2" anchored="true">Gaius Trebonius had
            been all along a strong Caesarian. In his tribuneship (Dec. <date>B.C. 56-</date>Dec.
              <date when="-0055">B.C. 55</date>) he proposed the law for the extension of Caesar's
            governorship. From <date when="-0054">B.C. 54</date> he was his <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >legatus</foreign> in Gaul. He helped to conduct the siege of Marseilles <date
              when="-0049">B.C. 49</date>. He was praetor <foreign xml:lang="la">urbanus</foreign>
            in the year <date when="-0048">B.C. 48</date>, and maintained Caesar's financial
            enactments against Caelius. Some time in <date when="-0047">B.C. 47</date> he was sent
            to southern Spain as proconsul in place of Cassius. He seems to have been an admirer of
            Cicero, in spite of politics, and to have made s collection of his bons mots. He did not
            succeed in <foreign xml:lang="la">Baetica</foreign>, and though afterwards nominated by
            Caesar to the province of Asia, he was one of his assassins. Of his own miserable death
            we shall hear later on. He had some tincture of letters, and wrote verses on the model
            of Lucilius. </note> This I can guarantee not only from myself to you, but also from you
          to me. For you left no doubt in my mind as to how much you were attached to me. I will
          pass over what you did in the sight of the whole state, when you took upon you a share of
          my quarrels, when you <pb n="58"/> defended me in your public speeches, when as quaestor
          you stood by the consuls in what was at once my cause and that of the constitution, when
          as quaestor again you refused to submit to the tribune, <note n="1" anchored="true">As
            quaestor, <date when="-0060">B.C. 60</date>, Trebonius had opposed the passing of the

          </note> and that though your colleague was for obeying him. Yet, to forget your recent
          services (which I shall always remember), what anxiety for me did you shew during the war,
          what joy at my return, what anxiety, what pain, when my anxieties and sorrows were
          reported to you! Lastly, the fact that you had meant to come to Brundisium to see me had
          you not been suddenly sent to Spain—to omit, I say, all this, which in my eyes must be as
          precious as my own life and safety, what a strong profession of affection does the book
          which you have sent me convey I First, because you think any utterance of mine to be
          witty, though others perhaps do not: and, secondly, because those mots, whether witty or
          the reverse, become extraordinarily attractive as you tell them. In fact, even before they
          come to me, your readers have all but exhausted their power of laughter. But if in making
          this compilation there was no more compliment than the inevitable fact of your having
          thought for so long a time exclusively about me, I should be hard-hearted indeed if I did
          not love you. Seeing, however, that what you have taken the trouble to write you could
          never have planned without a very strong affection, I cannot deem that anyone is dearer to
          himself than I am to you: to which affection would that I could respond in other ways! I
          will at least do so in affection on my part: with which, after all, I feel certain you
          will be fully satisfied. <milestone unit="para"/>Now I come to your letter, which, though
          written in full and gratifying terms, there is no reason why I should answer at great
          length. For, in the first place, I did not send that letter to Calvus, <note n="2"
            anchored="true">Trebonius seems to have remonstrated on some laudatory expressions in a
            letter to Calvus, which he had seen. C. Licinius Calvus, son of the annalist Licinius
            Macer, was born <date when="-0082">B.C. 82</date>. He was a poet and orator. In the
            latter capacity Cicero elsewhere (Brut. § 283) speaks of him as being learned and
            accurate, but too much enslaved to the model of the Attic style, which he had set
            himself to imitate. That is the "certain definite style" of which he here speaks.
          </note> any more than the one you are now reading, with an idea of its getting abroad. For
          I write in one <pb n="59"/> style what I expect that the persons addressed only, in
          another what I expect that many, will read. In the next place, I praised his genius in
          higher terms than you think could have been done with sincerity. To begin with, it was
          because that was my real opinion. He had a subtle and active mind: he adhered to a certain
          definite style, in which, though his judgment was at fault-generally his strong point—he
          yet attained his aim. He had great and uncommon learning: force he had not. It was in that
          direction, therefore, that I tried to rouse his energies. Now, in stimulating and whetting
          a man's intellect nothing is more efficacious than to mingle praise with exhortation. That
          is my judgment on Calvus, and the motive of my letter: motive, in that I praised in order
          to stimulate him; judgment, in that I thought very highly of his ability. <milestone
            unit="para"/>It only remains to follow your journey with affectionate interest, to look
          forward to your return with hope, to cherish you while absent in memory, and to alleviate
          our regret by an interchange of letters. I should wish you often to recall your kindnesses
          and good services to me; for while you may, and I may not, forget them without positive
          crime, you will have reason, not only to think me an honest man, but also to believe that
          you are deeply loved by me. </p>

            the previous year, spends this one in comparative peace, and in something like his old
            manner of life. Any uneasiness he may still have felt as to his political position
            ceased after Caesar's victory over the Pompeians at Thapsus in April. He, however, seems
            to have lived in retirement, and to have devoted himself to literary work, producing two
            oratorical treatises—Partitiones Oratoriae, Orator ad M. Brutum. After Caesar's return
            to Rome (26 July) he twice came out of his retirement: once to deliver a speech (pro
            Marcello) in the senate thanking Caesar for recalling M. Claudius Marcellus, the consul
            of <date when="-0055">B.C. 55</date>, and again to defend Q. Ligarius, accused of vis,
            for his conduct in Africa in <date when="-0049">B.C. 49</date>. His discontent with the"
            tyranny" is only cautiously expressed in his letters, but his panegyric on Cato called
            out a reply from Caesar himself. Some <pb n="60"/> time in this year his dissatisfaction
            with Terentia culminated in a divorce, and he married a young and rich wife, Publilia.
            This year consisted ot 444 days, 90 days being intercalated to correct the Kalendar,
            under Caesar's directions. The letters, though often touching on politics generally, do
            not contain sufficiently clear indications of contemporary events to allow of their
            being exactly dated, and the order of their succession is not often clear. </p>

        </opener>
        <p> As Marcus Varro was starting to join you as your quaestor, I did not think that he stood
          in need of any recommendation: for I thought him sufficiently recommended to you by the
          custom of our ancestors, which ordained—as you are doubtless aware—that this connexion of
          a quaestor with his chief should be as nearly as possible that of sons to their father.
          But as he has convinced himself that a letter from me, carefully expressed in regard to
          him, would be likely to have great weight with you, and as he pressed me warmly to write
          as fully as possible, I preferred to do what an intimate friend thought to be of so much
          importance to himself. <milestone unit="para"/>I will shew you, then, that I am bound to
          act thus. From his first entrance into public life M. Terentius attached himself to me.
          Presently, when he had established his position, two additional reasons appeared to
          increase my warm feelings towards him: one was the fact that he was engaged in the same
          pursuit as myself, that which still forms my greatest delight, displaying, as you are
          aware, both genius and no lack of industry; the second was that he early embarked on the
          companies of publicani-unfortunately, as it turned out, for he suffered very heavy losses:
          still, the interests of an order to which I was very closely bound being thus shared by us
          both made our friendship all the stronger. <milestone unit="para"/>Once more, after an
          honourable and creditable career on both benches, <note n="1" anchored="true">That is, I
            think, as accusing or defending men on their trial. The counsel for the prosecution and
            defence occupied different benches (see vol. ii., p. 219; <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >pro</foreign> Flacc. §22; in Verr. 2, § 73). I do not think it can be explained as
            "advocate and juryman," for the use of <foreign xml:lang="la">subsellia</foreign> for
            the seats of the jury is doubtful, and for the praetor (in a civil suit) it would be
            "tribunal." </note> just before the recent revolution he became <pb n="61"/> a candidate
          for office, and looked upon that as the most honourable fruit of his toil. <milestone
            unit="para"/>Again, in the late crisis he went from my house at Brundisium with a
          message and letter for Caesar: in which affair I had clear proof of his affection in
          undertaking the business, and of his good faith in carrying it through and bring mg me
          back an answer. I had intended to speak separately as to his uprightness and high
          character, but it seems to me that in thus beginning with a statement of the reason for my
          loving him, I have in that statement already said enough about his uprightness.
          Nevertheless, I do promise as a separate thing, and pledge my word, that he will be at
          once delightful and useful to you. For you will find him a steady, sensible man, as far
          removed as possible from any self-seeking, and, moreover, a man of the most laborious and
          industrious character. <milestone unit="para"/>Now it is no business of mine to promise
          what you must form your own judgment upon, when you have become well acquainted with him:
          yet, after all, in forming new connexions the first approach is always of consequence, and
          by what kind of introduction the door of friendship, so to speak, is opened. This is what
          I wished to effect by the present letter: though the tie between a quaestor and his chief
          ought in itself to have effected it. Vet it will not, after all, be any the weaker by this
          addition. Be careful, therefore, if you value me as highly as Varro thinks, and I feel
          that you do, to let me know as soon as possible that my recommendation has done him as
          much service as he himself hoped, and I had no doubt, that it would. <note n="1"

            but made governor of Cisalpine Gaul, i.e., North Italy, which was still treated as a
            province, though its inhabitants were full citizens, and continued to be so treated till
            the time of Augustus. An analogy in some respects would be the Lord Lieutenant of
            Ireland. </note> that you take great pains to allow nothing which concerns me to be
          unknown to you; I therefore feel no doubt that you know not only to what municipium I
          belong, but also how careful I am to defend the interests of my fellow townsmen of
          Arpinum. Now their entire income and resources, which enable them to keep their temples
          and other public buildings in repair, depend upon the rents which they own in the province
          of Gallia. To visit these estates, to collect the moneys owed by the tenants, and
          generally to investigate and provide for the management of the whole property, we are
          sending a commission of Roman knights, Quintus Fufidius, son of Quintus, Marcus Faucius,
          son of Marcus, Quintus Mamercius, son of Quintus. be explained as "advocate and juryman,"
          for the use of subsellia for the seats of the jury is doubtful, and for the praetor (in a
          civil suit) it would be "tribunal." I beg you with more than common earnestness, in the
          name of our friendship, that you would have an eye to this affair, and take pains that as
          far as you are concerned the business of the municipium may be transacted with as little
          difficulty, and finished as promptly, as possible; and that you would treat the persons
          themselves, whose names I have given, with all the honour and kindness which characterize
          you. By doing so you will have attached men of honour to your person, and have put a most
          grateful municipium under an obligation to you for your kind service. For myself, you will
          have done me a more than common favour, because, while it has been my invariable custom to
          protect my fellow townsmen's interests, this particular year has a special claim upon my
          attention and service to them. For this year I <pb n="63"/> have, for the sake of settling
          the affairs of the municipium, consented that my son, and nephew, and M. Caesius—a very
          intimate friend of mine-should be aediles; for that and no other is the magistrate
          customarily elected in our municipium. <note n="1" anchored="true">Confirmed by an

        <p> IN another letter I have commended our commissioners from Arpinum in a body as earnestly
          as I could. In this with still greater earnestness I commend Q. Fufidius to you
          separately-with whom I have ties of all kinds-not to detract at all from the former
          commendation, but to put in this one in addition. He has two special claims on me: he is a
          stepson of M. Caesius, who is a very intimate friend and close connexion of mine; and he
          served under me in Cilicia as a military tribune, in which office he conducted himself in
          such a way as to make me feel that I had received a kindness from him, rather than
          conferred one. He is besides—which is of very great weight with you—by no means without
          taste for our favourite studies. Wherefore I would have you admit him to your society
          without the least reserve, and take pains to make his labour on this commission—which he
          has undertaken to his own inconvenience and at my instigation—as complete a success as
          possible. For he wishes, as the best men naturally do, to earn the utmost possible credit
          both <pb n="64"/> from me, who urged him to undertake it, and from the municipium. This he
          will succeed in doing, if by this recommendation of mine he secures your good services.

          interchanged between myself and him. P. Cornelius in your province owes him a sum of
          money. That case has been referred by Volcatius, the praetor urbanus, for trial in Gaul. I
          beg you more earnestly than if it were business of mine—in proportion as it is more
          honourable to take trouble about one's friends' money than one's Own—to <pb n="65"/> see

          sent to represent him, may bring the matter to a conclusion on the most favourable terms
          possible and get at the money. You will thus be doing me a very great favour, and at the

            <foreign xml:lang="la">Varro</foreign>, the "most learned of the Romans," and author, it
            is said, of 490 books (two only of which remain even partially), had been one of
            Pompey's legates in Spain in <date when="-0049">B.C. 49</date>, where he had to
            surrender his legions to Caesar. He, however, joined Pompey in Epirus. Whilst Caesar was

              (<bibl n="Cic. Phil. 2.103">Phil. 2.103</bibl>), but on his return Caesar restored him
            to his property and civil position, and indeed employed his services in the collection
            of the public library. He was the oldest of the leading men of this period, yet survived
            them all. He was born <date when="-00116">B.C. 116</date>, and died <date when="-0028"
              >B.C. 28</date>. </note> which Atticus read to me, I learnt what you were doing and
          where you were; but when we were likely to see you, I could gain no idea at all from the
          letter. However, I am beginning to hope that your arrival is not far off. I wish it could
          be any consolation to me! But the fact is, I am overwhelmed by so many and such grave
          anxieties, that no one but the most utter fool <pb n="66"/> ought to expect any
          alleviation: yet, after all, perhaps you can give me some kind of help, or I you. For
          allow me to tell you that, since my arrival in the city, I have effected a reconciliation
          with my old friends, I mean my books: though the truth is that I had not abandoned their
          society because I had fallen out with them, but because I was half ashamed to look them in
          the face. For I thought, when I plunged into the maelstrom of civil strife, with allies
          whom I had the worst possible reason for trusting, that I had not shewn proper respect for
          their precepts. They pardon me: they recall me to our old intimacy, and you, they say,
          have been wiser than I for never having left it. Wherefore, since I find them reconciled,
          I seem bound to hope, if I once see you, that I shall pass through with ease both what is
          weighing me down now, and what is threatening. Therefore in your company, whether you
          choose it to be in your Tusculan or Cuman villa, or, which I should like least, at Rome,
          so long only as we are together, I will certainly contrive that both of us shall think it
          the most agreeable place possible. </p>

          the period of the Civil Wars, surviving Antony—whom he betrayed—and settling down to enjoy
          the wealth that his extortions had gained him, as a courtier in the train of Augustus.
          Velleius Paterculus gives the blackest account of him (ii. 83) as an ingrained traitor
            (<foreign xml:lang="la">morbo proditor</foreign>) and profligate. Horace, however, seems
          to have regarded him with some affection (Od. 1.7). We shall hereafter see something of
          his shifty policy following the murder of Caesar. </note>
        <p>I have no doubt of your knowing that, among the connexions bequeathed to you by your
          father, there was no one more closely united to you than myself, not only for the <pb
            n="67"/> reasons which give an appearance of close attachment, but also for those which
          are kept in operation by actual intimacy and association, which you know to have existed
          between me and your father in the highest degree and with the greatest mutual
          gratification. Starting from that origin my personal affection enhanced the ancestral
          friendship, and the more so that I perceived, as soon as your time of life admitted of
          your forming an independent judgment as to the value you should attach to this or that
          person, that I at once began to receive from you marks of respect, regard, and affection.
          To this was added the bond—in itself no slight one—of common studies, and of such studies
          and accomplishments as, in their very nature, serve to bind together men who have the same
          tastes in close ties of intimacy also. <milestone unit="para"/>I imagine you must be
          waiting to see to what this elaborate prelude is tending. To begin with, let me assure you
          that this resume' of facts has not been made by me without good and sufficient reason. I
          am exceedingly intimate with C. Ateius Capito. You know what the ups and downs of my
          fortunes have been. In every position of honour or of difficulty of mine, Capito's
          courage, active assistance, influence, and even money were ever at my service, supplied my
          occasions, and were ready for every crisis. He had a relation named Titus Antistius. While
          this man was serving in Macedonia as quaestor, according to the lot, and had had no
          successor appointed, <note n="1" anchored="true">That is, he was staying over his year
            because the allotment of provinces at the end of <date when="-0050">B.C. 50</date> had
            been vetoed. </note> Pompey arrived in that province at the head of an army. Antistius
          could do nothing. For if he had had things his own way, there is nothing he would have
          preferred to going back to Capito, for whom he had a filial affection, especially as he
          knew how much he valued Caesar and had always done so. But, being taken by surprise, he
          only engaged in the business as far as he was unable to refuse. When money was being
          Coined at Apollonia, I cannot say that he presided at the mint, nor can I deny that he was
          engaged in it; but it was not for more than two or three months. After that he held aloof
          from the camp: he avoided official employment of <pb n="68"/> every sort. I would have you
          believe me on this point as an eye-witness: for he used to see my melancholy during that
          campaign, he used to talk things over with me without reserve. Accordingly, he withdrew
          into hiding in central Macedonia at as great a distance as he could from the camp, so as
          to avoid not only taking command in any department, but even being on the spot. After the
          battle he retired to Bithynia to a friend's house named Aulus Plautius. When Caesar saw
          him there he did not say a single rough or angry word to him; and bade him come to Rome.
          Immediately after that he had an illness from which he never recovered. He arrived at
          Corcyra ill, and there died. By a will which he had made at Rome in the consulship of
          Paulus and Marcellus, <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <date when="-0050">B.C. 50</date>. </note> Capito was made his heir to five-sixths of
          his estate: as regards the other sixth, the heirs were men whose share may be confiscated
          without a word of complaint from anyone. That amounts to thirty sestertia. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">About £240. </note> This is a matter for Caesar to consider. But in the
          name of our ancestral friendship, in the name of our mutual affection, in the name of our
          common studies and the close identity in the whole current of our existence, I do ask and
          entreat you, my dear Plancus, with an anxiety and warmth beyond which I cannot go in any
          matter, to exert yourself, to put out your best energies, and to secure that by my
          recommendation, your own zeal, and Caesar's indulgence, Capito may obtain possession of
          his kinsman's legacy. Everything that I could possibly have got from you in this your hour
          of highest favour and influence, I shall regard you as having voluntarily bestowed upon
          me, if I obtain this object. There is a circumstance, of which Caesar has the best means
          of judging, which I hope will assist you-Capito always shewed respect and affection for
          Caesar. But Caesar can himself bear witness to this: I know the excellence of his memory:
          so I don't give you any instructions. Do not pledge yourself to Caesar on Capito's behalf,
          any farther than you shall perceive that he remembers. For my part, I will submit to you
          what I have been able to put to the test in my own case: you must judge of its importance
          for yourself. You are not ignorant of the side and the <pb n="69"/> cause which I have
          supported in politics, by the aid of what individuals and orders I have maintained myself,
          and by whom I have been fortified. Believe me when I say this: if I have done anything in
          the late war itself which was not quite to Caesar's taste—though I am well aware that
          Caesar knows me to have done so quite against my will—I have done it by the advice,
          instigation, and influence of others. But in so far as I have been more moderate and
          reasonable than anyone else of that party, I have been so by the influence of Capito more
          than anyone else: and if my other connexions had been like him, I should perhaps have done
          the State some good, certainly I should have done a great deal to myself. If you
          accomplish this object, my dear Plancus, you will confirm my expectations as to your kind
          feeling towards myself, and you will by your eminent service have bound Capito himself to
          you as a friend—a man of the most grateful and obliging disposition, and of the most
          excellent character. </p>

        <p>I was gratified by your letter which told me, what I thought to be the case even without

          compliment, but I do not yield to you in the strength 9f the wish: for may I have all my
          heart's desire, as I ardently long to be with you! Even at the time when I had a greater
          wealth of good citizens, agreeable men, and attached friends about me, there was yet no
          one whose Society I enjoyed more than yours, and few whose I enjoyed as much. But at the
          present time, since some have died, others are away, and others changed in feeling, upon
          my <pb n="70"/> honour, a single day devoted to you will bring a richer return of pleasure
          than all this time given to most of those with whom I am forced to live. For do not
          imagine that solitude—and even that, after all, I am not allowed to en-joy—is not
          pleasanter than the talk of those who crowd my house, with one or at most two exceptions.
            <note n="1" anchored="true">For Cicero's feelings as to his solitude in a crowd, see
            vol. i., pp. 49-50. </note> Accordingly, I fly to that refuge, which I think you should
          also seek—my darling studies: and, in addition to them, the consciousness of the
          principles I have maintained. For I am a man, as you will have no difficulty in
          conceiving, who have never acted for my own interests in preference to those of my fellow
          citizens: a man of whom, if he whom you never loved—for you loved me—had not been jealous,
          he would now have been in prosperity, and so would all the loyalists. I am he whose wish
          was that no man's brute force should be preferred to peace with honour. And again, when I
          perceived that the very appeal to arms, which I had always dreaded, was to influence the
          result more than that union of all loyalists (of which I again was the author), I
          preferred accepting a peace on any terms whatever that were safe to a combat with the
          stronger. But all this and much else when we meet, as we soon shall. For after all there
          is nothing to keep me at Rome except the expectation of news from Africa: for the campaign
          there seems to me to have come to a point when the decisive stroke cannot be far off. Now
          whatever that news may be, I suppose it is of some importance to me that I should not be
          out of the way of consulting my friends: I don't, indeed, see clearly what the precise
          importance is, but nevertheless it must be of some. In fact, it has come to this, that
          though there is a wide difference between the merits of the two contending sides, I should
          imagine there will not be much difference between the way they will use their victory. But
          my courage, which has perhaps been somewhat weak while the result was undecided, now that
          all is lost, has greatly recovered its tone. You, too, did much to strengthen it by your
          previous letter, from which I learnt how bravely you were bearing your injurious
          treatment: and it was helpful to me to find that <pb n="71"/> your lofty character, as
          well as your literary studies, had stood you in good stead. For I will be candid: I used
          to think you somewhat lacking in spirit, as indeed most of us were, who have lived the
          life of free men in a state that was itself wealthy and free. But as we were moderate in
          the old prosperity, so ought we to endure now with courage what is not a mere reverse of
          fortune, but a total loss of it: to the end that we may get this amount of good at least
          in the midst of the gravest ills, that, while even in prosperity we were bound to
          disregard death (seeing that it will bring with it an absence of all sensation <note n="1"

        <p> Caninius, our common friend, having called upon me very late in the evening, and having
          told me that he was starting to join you in the morning, I told him that I would have
          something for him to take, and begged him to Call for it in the morning. I finished my
          letter in the night, but he never Came: I supposed that he had forgotten. Nevertheless, I
          should have sent you the letter itself by my own letter-carriers, had I not heard from the
          same friend next day that you were starting from your Tusculan villa in the morning. But
          now look at, this! All on a sudden a few days later, when I wasn't in the least expecting
          it, Caninius Called on me in the morning, and said that he was starting to join you at
          once. Though that letter was now stale, especially considering the importance of the news
          that have since arrived, <note n="1" anchored="true">The battle of Thapsus was fought on
            the 6th of April, according to the unrevised calendar. The news reached Rome on the
            evening of the 20th (Dio, 43, 42). </note> yet I was unwilling that my night's work
          should be thrown away, and gave it as it was to Caninius: but I spoke to him as to a man
          of learning and one warmly attached to you, and I presume that he has conveyed my words to
          you. <milestone unit="para"/>However, I give you the same counsel that I give myself —to
          avoid men's eyes, if we find it difficult to avoid their tongues. For those who give
          themselves airs about the victory regard us in the light of defeated enemies: while those
          who are vexed at our friends' defeat regret that we remain alive. You will ask perhaps
          why, this being the state of things in the city, I have not left town like yourself? You,
          I presume, you, who surpass both me and others in the clearness of your perceptions,
          divined it all! Nothing of course escaped you! Why, who is so much of a Lynceus <pb n="75"
          /> as, in such pitchy darkness, never to stumble on anything, never to blunder against
          anything anywhere? For my part, it long ago occurred to my mind how pleasant a thing it
          would be to go out of town somewhere, so as to avoid seeing and hearing what is being done
          and said here. But I had certain misgivings: my idea was that everyone who met me on the
          road would, as it suited his particular point of view, suspect, or, even if he did not
          suspect it, would say: "This fellow is either frightened, and therefore is running away,
          or he is meditating some move and has a ship ready prepared." In fact, even the man whose
          suspicion was the least malicious, and who perhaps knew me best, would have thought my
          motive for going was that my eyes could not endure the sight of certain persons. From some
          such misgivings as these I am as yet staying on at Rome, and after all, long habit has
          insensibly covered over the wound and deadened my indignation. <milestone unit="para"
          />That is the explanation of my policy. For yourself, then, what I think you should do is
          this: remain in retirement where you are until such time as this exultation is past
          boiling point, and at the same time till we hear particulars of the decisive struggle: for
          decisive I think it was. But it will make all the difference what the feeling of the
          conqueror is, and how the campaign has ended. Though I am able to make a shrewd guess,
          still I wait, after all, for information. Nor, indeed, would I have you starting for Baiae
          until rumour has shouted itself hoarse. For it will be more to our credit, even when we do
          quit the city, to be thought to have come to that neighbourhood rather to weep than to
          swim. But you know all this better than I. Only let us abide by our resolve to live
          together in pursuit of those studies of ours, from which we formerly sought only pleasure,
          but now seek also the preservation of our lives. And if anyone wishes for our services-not
          merely as architects, but also as workmen to build up the constitution-let us not refuse
          to assist, but rather hasten with enthusiasm to the task. And if, on the other hand, no
          one will employ us, let us compose and read "Republics." And if we cannot do so in the
          senate-house and forum, yet at least (after the example of the most learned of the
          ancients) on paper and in books let us govern the state, and investigate its customs <pb
            n="76"/> and laws. These are my views. You will very much oblige me if you will write
          and tell me what you mean to do and what your opinion is. </p>

        <p> I was dining with Seius when a letter was delivered to each of us from you. Yes, I

          not hesitate to go over, horse, foot, and artillery! For when I heard about L. Caesar the

            he do for me, his father?" So, Cicero means, "If Caesar pardoned his bitter enemy, young
            Lucius Caesar, what must he do to me, his old friend?" L. Caesar is the man who brought
            the messages to and from Pompey (vol. ii., pp.249, 250, 255). </note> Accordingly, I do
          not cease dining out with the members of the party now in power. What else should I do?

        <p> Yes, I think the 5th of next month will be in very good time, both in consideration of
          the state of public affairs and of the season of the year. <note n="5" anchored="true">For
            starting to meet Caesar. We must remember that, in spite of an intercalary month
            inserted after the 23rd of February, the calendar this year was two months in advance,
            and was not rectified till the autumn. Therefore the 5th of June is really about the 5th
            of April, and that was full early for Caesar to embark on a voyage from Africa. </note>
          Wherefore I approve of that day: and will myself accordingly aim at the same. I should <pb
            n="78"/> not have thought that we ought to repent of our policy, even if those who did
          not adopt it were not now repentant. For our guiding star was not advantage, but duty: and
          what we abandoned was not duty, but a hopeless task. So we shewed greater sensitiveness to
          honour than those who never stirred from home, and greater reasonableness than those who
          did not return home when all was lost. But nothing irritates me so much as the severe
          Criticism of the do-nothings, and I am more inclined to feel scrupulous about those who
          fell in the war, than to trouble myself about those who are angry with us for being alive.

          <salute>TO M. MARIUS (AT POMPEII)</salute>
          <dateline>ROME (LATE IN MAY)</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> Very often, as I reflect upon the miseries in which we have all alike been living these
          many years past, and, as far as I can see, are likely to be living, lam wont to recall
          that time when we last met: nay, I remember the exact day. Having arrived at my Pompeian
          villa on the evening of the 12th of May, in the consulship of Lentulus and Marcellus,
            <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <date when="-0049">B.C. 49</date>. This apology for his conduct is somewhat like that
            addressed to Lentulus, vol. i., p.310. </note> you came to see me in a state of anxiety.
          What was making you uneasy was your reflexion both on my duty and my danger. If I remained
          in Italy, you feared my being wanting to my duty: if I set out to the camp, you were
          agitated by the thought of my danger. At that time you certainly found me so unnerved as
          to be unable to unravel the tangle and see what was best to be done. Nevertheless, I
          preferred to be ruled by honour and reputation, rather than to consider the safety of my
          life. Of this decision I afterwards repented, <pb n="79"/> not so much on account of the
          danger I incurred, as because of the many fatal weaknesses which I found on arrival at my
          destination. In the first place, troops neither numerous nor on a proper war footing; in
          the second place, beyond the general and a few others—I am speaking of the men of rank—the
          rest, to begin with, greedy for plunder in conducting the war itself, and moreover so
          bloodthirsty in their talk, that I shuddered at the idea of victory itself: and, lastly,
          immense indebtedness on the part of the men of the highest position. In short, there was
          nothing good except the cause. <milestone unit="para"/>Despairing of victory when I saw
          these things, I first began advising a peace, which had always been my policy; next,
          finding Pompey vehemently opposed to that idea, I proceeded to advise him to protract the
          war. Of this he at times expressed approval, and seemed likely to adopt the suggestion;
          and he perhaps would have done so, had it not been that as a result of a certain
          engagement <note n="1" anchored="true">When Pompey pierced Caesar's lines and defeated
            him. See pp. 6-7. </note> he began to feel confidence in his soldiers. From that day
          forth that eminent man ceased to be anything of a general. He accepted battle against the
          most highly seasoned legions with an army of raw recruits and hastily collected men.
          Having been shamefully beaten, with the loss also of his camp, he fled alone. <milestone
            unit="para"/>This I regarded as the end of the war, as far as I was concerned, nor did I
          imagine that, having been found unequal to the struggle while still unbeaten, we should
          have the upper hand after a crushing defeat. I abandoned a war in which the alternatives
          were to fall on the field of battle, or to fall into some ambush, or to come into the
          conqueror's hands, or to take refuge with Iuba, or to select some place of residence as
          practically an exile, or to die by one's own hand. At least there was no other
          alternative, if you had neither the will nor the courage to trust yourself to the victor.
          Now, of all these alternatives I have mentioned, none is more en-durable than exile,
          especially to a man with clean hands, when no dishonour attaches to it: and I may also
          add, when you lose a city, in which there is nothing that you can look at without pain.
          For my part, I preferred to remain with my own family—if a man may nowadays call anything
            <pb n="80"/> his own—and also on my own property. What actually happened I foretold in
          every particular. I came home, not because that offered the best condition of life, but
          that after all, if some form of a constitution remained, I might be there as though in my
          own country, and if not, as though in exile. For inflicting death on myself there seemed
          no adequate reason: many reasons why I should wish for it. For it is an old saying, "When
          you cease to be what once you were, there is no reason why you should wish to live." But
          after all it is a great consolation to be free of blame, especially as I have two things
          upon which to rely for support-acquaintance with the noblest kind of learning and the
          glory of the most brilliant achievements: of which the former will never be torn from me
          while I live, the latter not even after my death. <milestone unit="para"/>I have written
          these things to you somewhat fully, and have bored you with them, because I knew you to be
          most devoted both to myself and to the Republic. I wished you to be acquainted with my
          entire views, that in the first place you might know that it was never a wish of mine that
          any one individual should have more power than the Republic as a whole; but that, when by
          some one's fault a particular person did become so powerful as to make resistance to him
          impossible, I was for peace: that when the army was lost, as well as the leader in whom
          alone our hopes had been fixed, I wished to put an end to the war for the rest of the
          party also: and, when that proved impossible, that I did so for myself. But that now, if
          our state exists, I am a citizen of it; if it does not, that I am an exile in a place
          quite as suited for the position, as if I had betaken myself to Rhodes or Mytilene.
            <milestone unit="para"/>I should have preferred to discuss this with you personally, but
          as the possibility of that was somewhat remote, I determined to make the same statement by
          letter, that you might have something to say, if you ever fell in with any of my critics.
          For there are men who, though my death would have been utterly useless to the state,
          regard it as a crime that I am still alive, and who I am certain think that those who
          perished were not numerous enough. Though, if these persons had listened to me, they would
          now, however unfair the terms of peace, have been living in honour; for while inferior in
          arms they would have been superior in the merits of their <pb n="81"/> cause. Here's a
          letter somewhat more wordy than perhaps you would have wished; and that I shall hold to be
          your opinion, unless you send me a still longer one in reply. If I can get through with
          some business which I wish to settle, I shall, I hope, see you before long. </p>

            often uses the same phrase in letters written nearly at the same time. The general point
            of view (which so often shifts with Cicero) is about the same. </note> was not the fact
          of your never having written to me since your arrival in Italy that deterred me from
          writing to you. The reason was that I could not think of any promise to make you in my

          myself as to what policy to pursue, or of any consolation to offer in the midst of such

          were offered you and were actually available. But since you have decided that to your
          policy, righteously and courageously adopted, there should be the same limit as fortune
          herself had laid down as the finishing point of our struggles, I beg and implore you, in
          the name of our old union and friendship, and in <pb n="82"/> the name of my extreme
          affection for you and your no less strong one for me, to preserve yourself alive for us,
          for your mother, your wife, and all near and dear to you, to whom you have ever been the
          object of the deepest affection. Consult for the safety of yourself and of those who hang
          upon you. The lessons gathered from the wisest of philosophers, and grasped and remembered
          by you from your youth up with such brilliant success—all these put in practice at this
          crisis. Sorrow for those you have lost <note n="1" anchored="true">His father, L. Domitius

        <p> About things "possible," let me tell you my opinion agrees with Diodorus. Wherefore, if
          you are to come, be assured that your coming is "necessary," but if you are not, then it
          is "impossible" that you should come. Now see which <pb n="83"/> opinion pleases you the
          more, that of Chrysippus or the one which our teacher Diodotus could not stomach. But on
          these points also we will talk when we are at leisure: that too is "possible," according
          to Chrysippus. <note n="1" anchored="true">Cicero playfully alludes to the
            necessitudinarian doctrines of Diodorus of <foreign xml:lang="la">Caria</foreign> (the
            Megaric philosopher, <foreign xml:lang="la">ob</foreign>. <date when="-00307">B.C.

              <date when="-00280">B.C. 280</date>). Diodorus maintained that "only what is or what
            will be is possible." Chrysippus, on the other hand, defined "the possible" as what is
            "capable of being true if circumstances do not prevent." Diodotus was a Stoic who lived
            many years in Cicero's house, and died there <date when="-0059">B.C. 59</date>. See vol.
            i., p.115. </note> I am much obliged to you about Coctius: for that is just what I had

        <p> Our friend Caninius has brought a message from you bidding me write and tell you
          whatever I thought you ought to know. Well then, Caesar's arrival of course is occupying
          men's minds, and of that you are yourself not unaware. However, he having written, I
          presume, to say that he intended to come to his villa at Alsium, <note n="2"
            anchored="true">On the coast of <foreign xml:lang="la">Etruria</foreign>, about eighteen
            miles north of the mouth of the Tiber. Caesar had a villa there, but so had many Roman
            nobles, and I suppose that he would be among enemies. </note> his friends wrote to him
          not to do so: that many people would annoy him, and he himself annoy many: they thought it
          would be more convenient for him to land at Ostia. I do not myself understand what
          difference it makes; but yet Hirtius told me that both he and Balbus and Oppius had
          written to him to do so-men, as I have reason to know, who are attached to you. I wanted
          you to learn this, that you might know <pb n="87"/> where to prepare yourself a lodging,
          or rather that you might do so in both places : <note n="1" anchored="true">At <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Alsium</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la">Ostia</foreign>, that he
            might be ready to meet Caesar in, either. </note> for what he is going to do is
          uncertain. At the same time I have shewn you that I am intimate with these men and
          admitted to their counsels And I don't see any reason for avoiding that. It is one thing
          to bear what one must bear, another to approve what one ought not to approve. Though for
          my part I do not know why I should not approve, with the exception of the first steps in
          the movement: for they were within the control of men's wills. I saw of course (you were
          abroad) that our friends desired war, whereas Caesar did not so much desire it as not fear
          it (wherefore the first steps were deliberate, the rest merely consequential), and that it
          must needs be that either this party or that should win. I know that you always lamented
          with me, when we saw, first, that frightful alternative—the destruction of one or the
          other army and leader; and, secondly, that the most dreadful evil of all was victory in a
          civil war, which indeed I dreaded even if it declared on the side of those whom I had
          joined. For the veriest do-nothings <note n="2" anchored="true">Reading <foreign
              xml:lang="la">otiosissimi minabantur</foreign>. </note> were uttering bloodthirsty
          threats, and they were offended both by your feelings and my words. At this moment,
          indeed, if our men had prevailed, they would have been exceedingly violent; for there were
          some who were very angry with us, as though forsooth we had adopted any resolution as to
          our own preservation which we had not decided to be good for them also; or as though it
          were more for the advantage of the state that they should fly to the protection of the
          beasts, <note n="3" anchored="true">The elephants of King <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Juba</foreign>. </note> than either die out of hand, or continue to live, if not with
          the best prospect, yet at least with some. But, it may be said, we are living in a
          distracted republic. Who denies it? But this is their look-out, who secured no resources
          for the various phases of life. <milestone unit="para"/>Well, it was to arrive at this
          point that my preface has extended to a greater length than I intended. For as I have ever
          regarded you as a great man, because in the face of these storms you are nearly the only
          one safely in port, and are reaping the best fruits of philosophy-namely, to <pb n="88"/>
          fix your mind upon and handle themes, the study and delight of which are to be preferred
          to all their employments and pleasures: so I consider these days you are spending at
          Tusculum to be a specimen of true life, and I would with pleasure resign all the wealth in
          the world to anybody on condition of being allowed, without the interruption of violence,
          to live a life like yours. And this, indeed, I imitate to the best of my ability, and with
          the utmost delight find repose in the studies which we both pursue. For who will grudge us
          this privilege, that, when our country either cannot or will not employ our services, we
          should return to that way of life, which many learned men have, perhaps wrongly, but still
          have thought was to be preferred even to public business? These studies, in the opinion of
          some eminent men, involve a kind of furlough from public duties: why then, when the state
          allows it, should we not enjoy them to the full? But I have more than fulfilled Caninius's
          demand; for he quite legitimately <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Iure</foreign>, the MS. reading. I am not satisfied that it is
            rightly rejected, as it is by all editors; <foreign xml:lang="la">ut scriberem</foreign>
            is easily understood after <foreign xml:lang="la">rogarat</foreign>. He elsewhere (vol.
            i., p.354) says that the proper purpose of a letter is to inform the recipient of what
            he does not but ought to know, and the writer does. So in asking that, Caninius asked
              <foreign xml:lang="la">iure</foreign>, in accordance with the law of letter writing.
          </note> asked me for anything I knew which you didn't: but I am telling you what you know
          better than I myself who tell it. I will accordingly do what I was asked, that is, prevent
          your being ignorant of anything that is in your way connected with this crisis which I may
          hear. <note n="2" anchored="true">The reading is doubtful. </note>

          <dateline>TUSCULUM (JULY)</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> I was charmed with your letter<note n="1" anchored="true">Paetus, to whom twelve letters
            are addressed, is an unknown man, though evidently very intimate with Cicero, to whom we
            have heard of his presenting a collection of books (vol. i., pp.60, 66). </note> , in
          which, first of all, what I loved was the tenderness which prompted you to write, in alarm
          lest Silius should by his news have caused me any anxiety. About this news, not only had
          you written to me before—in fact twice, one letter being a duplicate of the other-shewing
          me clearly that you were upset, but I also had answered you in full detail, in order that
          I might, as far as such a business and such a crisis admitted, free you from your anxiety,
          or at any rate alleviate it. But since you shew in your last also how anxious you are
          about that matter-make up your mind to this, my dear Paetus: that whatever could possibly
          be accomplished by art—for it is not enough nowadays to contend with mere prudence, a sort
          of system must be elaborated-however, whatever could be done or effected towards winning
          and securing the goodwill of those men I have done, and not, I think, in vain. For I
          receive such attentions, such politenesses from all Caesar's favourites as make me believe
          myself beloved by them. For, though genuine love is not easily distinguished from feigned,
          unless some crisis occurs of a kind to test faithful affection by its danger, as gold in
          the fire, there are other indications of a general nature. But I only employ one proof to
          convince me that I am loved from the heart and in sincerity-namely, that my fortune and
          theirs is of such a kind as to preclude any motive on their part for pretending. In
          regard, again, to the man who now possesses all power, I see no reason for my being
          alarmed: except the fact that, once depart from law, everything is uncertain; and that
          nothing can be guaranteed as to the future which <pb n="91"/> depends on another man's
          will, not to say caprice. Be that as it may, personally his feelings have in no respect
          been wounded by me. For in that particular point I have exhibited the greatest
          self-control. For, as in old times I used to reckon that to speak without reserve was a
          privilege of mine, since to my exertions the existence of liberty in the state was owing,
          so, now that that is lost, I think it is my duty to say nothing calculated to offend
          either his wishes or those of his favourites. But if I want to avoid the credit of certain
          keen or witty epigrams, I must entirely abjure a reputation for genius, which I would not
          refuse to do, if I could. But after all Caesar himself has a very keen critical faculty,
          and, just as your cousin Servius <note n="1" anchored="true">Servius Claudius, whose books
            Paetus had given to Cicero. He was probably cousin, not brother, of Paetus. </note>
          —whom I consider to have been a most accomplished man of letters—had no difficulty in
          saying: "This verse is not Plautus's, this is—"because he had acquired a sensitive ear by
          dint of classifying the various styles of poets and habitual reading, so I am told that
          Caesar, having now completed his volumes of bons mots, <note n="2" anchored="true">His
            Dicta <foreign xml:lang="la">Collectanea</foreign>, which Augustus would not allow to be
            pub- lished (<bibl n="Suet. Jul. 56">Suet. Iul. 56</bibl>). </note> if anything is
          brought to him as mine, which is not so, habitually rejects it. This he now does all the
          more, because his intimates are in my company almost every day. Now in the course of our
          discursive talk many remarks are let fall, which perhaps at the time of my making them
          seem to them wanting neither in literary flavour nor in piquancy. These are conveyed to
          him along with the other news of the day: <note n="3" anchored="true">For the <foreign
              xml:lang="la">acta diurna</foreign>, see vol. i., p. 146; vol. ii., pp.187, 404. But
            besides this Caesar seems to have had a private report made to him each day of what was
            happening, just as Augustus did, whether of public or domestic occurrences (<bibl
              n="Suet. Aug. 32">Suet. Aug. 32</bibl> and 78). It was Caesar who first ordered the
              <foreign xml:lang="la">acta</foreign> of the senate to be published (<bibl
              n="Suet. Jul. 20">Suet. Iul. 20</bibl>). </note> for so he himself directed. Thus it
          comes about that if he is told of anything besides <note n="4" anchored="true">That is,
            anything unfavourable. "Caesar considers that he knows the worst that I say from his own
            reporters, and will listen to nothing more." </note> about me, he considers that he
          ought not to listen to it. Wherefore I have no need of your Oenomaus, <note n="5"
            anchored="true">A play of Accius, from which Paetus had, it seems, quoted some lines
            recommending him to avoid exciting envy. </note> though your quotation of <pb n="92"/>
          Accius's verses was very much on the spot. But what is this jealousy, or what have I now
          of which anyone can be jealous? But suppose the worst. I find that the philosophers, who
          alone in my view grasp the true nature of virtue, hold that the wise man does not pledge
          himself against anything except doing wrong; and of this I consider myself clear in two
          ways, first in that my views were most absolutely correct; and second because, when I
          found that we had not sufficient material force to maintain them, I was against a trial of
          strength with the stronger party. Therefore, so far as the duty of a good citizen is
          concerned, I am certainly not open to reproach. What remains is that I should not say or
          do anything foolish or rash against the men in power: that too, I think, is the part of
          the wise man. As to the rest—what this or that man may say that I said, or the light in
          which he views it, or the amount of good faith with which those who continually seek me
          out and pay me attention may be acting—for these things I cannot be responsible. The
          result is that I console myself with the consciousness of my uprightness in the past and
          my moderation in the present, and apply that simile of Accius's not to jealousy, but to
          fortune, which I hold—as being inconstant and frail—ought to be beaten back by a strong
          and manly soul, as a wave is by a rock. For, considering that Greek history is full of
          examples of how the wisest men endured tyrannies either at Athens or Syracuse, when,
          though their countries were enslaved, they themselves in a certain sense remained free—am
          I to believe that I cannot so maintain my position as not to hurt anyone's feelings and
          yet not blast my own character? <milestone unit="para"/>I now come to your jests, since as
          an afterpiece to Accius's Oenomaus, you have brought on the stage, not, as was his wont,
          an Atellan play, <note n="1" anchored="true">The <foreign xml:lang="la">fabulae
              Atellanae</foreign> got their name from <foreign xml:lang="la">Atella in
              Campania</foreign>. They were coarser Oscan plays (vol. i., p. 259), presented after
            those taken from Greek tragedies, on the analogy of the satyric dramas at Athens. Mimes
            were solo plays or recitatives by single actors with appropriate gestures. They were
            becoming fashionable, and we hear of an <foreign xml:lang="la">eques</foreign> who acted
            his own mime (<bibl n="Suet. Jul. 39">Suet. Iul. 39</bibl>; Aug.45, 99). </note> but,
          according to the present fashion, a mime. What's all this about a pilot-fish, a denarius,
            <note n="2" anchored="true">A dinner at a <foreign xml:lang="la">denarius</foreign>
            (10d.) a head. </note> and a dish of salt fish and cheese? In my old <pb n="93"/>
          easy-going days I put up with that sort of thing: but times are changed. Hirtius and
          Dolabella are my pupils in rhetoric, but my masters in the art of dining. For I think you
          must have heard, if you really get all news, that their practice is to declaim at my
          house, and mine to dine at theirs. Now it is no use your making an affidavit of insolvency
          to me: for when you had some property, petty profits used to keep you a little too close
          to business; but as things are now, seeing that you are losing money so cheerfully, all
          you have to do, when entertaining me, is to regard yourself as accepting a "composition";
          and even that loss is less annoying when it comes from a friend than from a debtor. <note
            n="1" anchored="true">To understand this rather elaborate chaff we must remember the
            circumstances of the time. Caesar's law of <date when="-0049">B.C. 49</date> to relieve
            the financial situation in Italy enacted that creditors foreclosing for mortgage debtors
            were: (1) to deduct certain sums received as interest; (2) to take over the mortgaged
            properties at their value before the war panic. That value had to be estimated, and to
            accept an <foreign xml:lang="la">aestimatio</foreign> meant generally a loss: for a
            creditor had property on his hands which often would not fetch the amount of the debt.
            Suetonius reckons the average loss to have been twenty-five per cent. Now Paetus was a
            Caesarian, and therefore Cicero says, "Of course you are bearing your losses cheerfully
            (in the good cause), so you needn't make a fuss about entertaining me. It was some good
            being close-fisted when you had anything to save, now you may look upon any expense I
            cause you as only one other item in your bankruptcy." He does not seriously mean that
            Paetus was bankrupt. He chooses to represent the losses under tbe Caesarian law as
            amounting to that. I have accepted the reading, <foreign xml:lang="la">non est quod non
              sis</foreign>, though I do not feel that it is satisfactory. </note> Yet, after all, I
          don't require dinners superfluous in quantity: only let what there is be first-rate in
          quality and recherché. I remember you used to tell me stories of Phamea's dinner. Let
          yours be earlier, <note n="2" anchored="true">See vol. ii., pp.311,344. </note> but in
          other respects like that. But if you persist in bringing me back to a dinner like your
          mother's, I should put up with that also. For I should like to see the man who had the
          face to put on the table for me what you describe, or even a polypus-looking as red as
          Iupiter Miniatus. <note n="3" anchored="true">That is, "red-leaded" Iupiter. On certain
            festivals, especially at triumphal banquets, figures of Iupiter were introduced stained
            with red-lead or cinnabar (<bibl n="Plin. Nat. 33.112">Plin. N. H. 33.112</bibl>). An
            earthenware figure of the same god was also in the <foreign xml:lang="la"

        <p> I was doubly charmed by your letter, first because it made me laugh myself' and secondly
          because I saw that you could still laugh. Nor did I in the least object to being
          overwhelmed with your shafts of ridicule, as though I were a light skirmisher in the war
          of wits. What I am vexed at is that I have not been able, as I intended, to run over to
          see you: for you would not have had a mere guest, but a <pb n="98"/> brother-in-arms. And
          such a hero! not the man whom you used to do for by the hors d'oeuvre. I now bring an
          unimpaired appetite to the egg, and so the fight is maintained right up to the roast veal.
          The compliments you used to pay me in old times—"What a contented person!" "What an easy
          guest to entertain ! "—are things of the past. All my anxiety about the good of the state,
          all meditating of speeches to be delivered in the senate, all getting up of briefs I have
          cast to the winds. I have thrown myself into the camp of my old enemy Epicurus—not,
          however, with a view to the extravagance of the present day, but to that refined splendour
          of yours—I mean your old style when you had money to spend (though you never had more
          landed estate <note n="1" anchored="true">Referring to the foreclosures on lands which
            Paetus had been obliged to take on the valuations (<foreign xml:lang="la"
              >aestimationes</foreign>) according to Caesar's law, which were unsaleable; so he had
            land on his hands and yet was short of money. See pp.93, 96. </note> ). Therefore
          prepare! You have to deal with a man, who not only has a large appetite, but who also
          knows a thing or two. You are aware of the extravagance of your bourgeois gentilhomme. You
          must forget all your little baskets and your omelettes. I am now so far advanced in the
          art that I frequently venture to ask your friend Verrius and Camillus to dinner—what
          dandies! how fastidious! But think of my audacity: I even gave Hirtius a dinner, without a
          peacock however. In that dinner my cook could not imitate him in anything but the hot
          sauce. <milestone unit="para"/>So this is my way of life nowadays: in the morning I
          receive not only a large number of "loyalists," who, how ever, look gloomy enough, but
          also our exultant conquerors here, who in my case are quite prodigal in polite and
          affectionate attentions. When the stream of morning callers has ebbed, I wrap myself up in
          my books, either writing or reading. There are also some visitors who listen to my
          discourses under the belief of my being a man of learning, because I am a trifle more
          learned than themselves. After that all my time is given to my bodily comfort. I have
          mourned for my country more deeply and longer than any mother for her only son. But take
          care, if you love me, to keep your health, lest I should take advantage of your being laid
          up to eat you out of house and home. For I am resolved not to spare you even when you are

            something more to secure his <foreign xml:lang="la">restitutio</foreign>, and to have
            reproached him with the value of his services during the Catilinarian conspiracy, and in
            securing his recall. Mueller places this letter in March, <date when="-0052">B.C.

            Caesar. </note> Even if there had been no such obstacle, you ought not to have done it.
          "Why I shewed you attention in your consulship"—and then you go on to say that Caesar will
          certainly recall you. Well, you have a great deal to say, but nobody believes you. You
          allege that you stood for the tribuneship for my sake. I wish you had always been a

          all-was much better suited to your culture and refinement than all the Peloponnesus put
          together, to say nothing of Patrae. Now, however, on the contrary you seem to me to have
          been long-sighted for having settled in Greece when things here were in a desperate
          condition, and at the present crisis not only to be wise for being abroad, but happy as
          well. And yet what man of any discernment can be happy at present? But what you, who could
          do so, have secured by the use of your feet-removal to a place "Where of the Pelopidae"
            <note n="1" anchored="true">A quotation from the <foreign xml:lang="la">Pelops</foreign>

          </note> (you know the rest)-I am getting by a different method. For, after giving myself
          up to the reception of my friends which is more crowded than it used to be, precisely
          because they imagine that in a citizen of honest sentiments they see a rare bird of good
          omen, I bury myself in my library. Accordingly, I am completing works of an importance
          which you will perhaps appreciate. For in a certain talk I had with you at your house,
          when you were finding fault with my gloom and despair, I understood you to say, that you
          could not recognize the old high spirit in my books. <note n="2" anchored="true">I retain

          to me, and no less by mine to it, was dearer to me than my life. And even now, though not
          only is reason (which ought to be more powerful than anything) consoling me, but also time
          which cures even fools, yet I am nevertheless grieving that the general interests are in
          such a state of collapse, that no hope even is left of any future improvement. Not that in
          the present instance the fault is his, in whose power everything is—unless by any chance
          that very fact is not as it should be—but some things by accident and others by my own
          fault also have so fallen out, that complaint on my part for the past is barred. Hope for
          the future I see none. Therefore I return to what I said at first: you have left all this

            It was Caesar's constant habit (<bibl n="Plut. Caes. 63">Plut. Caes. 63</bibl>). And we
            have already heard of letters being delivered both to host and guest at dinner (p.76).
          </note> You will say, "where?" With Volumnius Eutrapelus. One place above me is Atticus,
          one below Verrius, both friends of yours. Do you wonder that our slavery is made so gay?
          Well, what am I to do? I ask your advice as the pupil of a philosopher. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">Dion, a Stoic (Acad. ii. 4, § 12). </note> Am I to be miserable, to
          torment myself? What should I get by that? And, moreover, how long? "Live with your
          books," say you. Well, do you suppose that I do anything else? Or could I have kept alive,
          had I not lived with my books? But even to them there is, I don't say a surfeit, but a
          certain limit. When I have left them, though I care very little about my dinner—the one
          problem which you put before the philosopher Dion—still, what better to do with my time
          before taking myself off to bed I cannot discover. <milestone unit="para"/>Now listen to
          the rest. Below Eutrapelus lay Cytheris. <note n="3" anchored="true">Of whom we have heard
            as accompanying Antony in his round of the Italian cities in <date when="-0049">B.C.
              49</date> (vol. ii., p. 389). In the 2nd Philippic (§58) Cicero says her connexion
            with Volumnius was so notorious, that she was addressed then as <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Volumnia. Cytheris</foreign> was her theatrical name. </note> At such a party as
          that, say you, was the famous Cicero, "To whom all looked with rev'rence, on whose face
          Greeks turned their eyes with wonder?" To tell you the truth, I had no suspicion that she
          would be <pb n="103"/> there. But, after all, even the Socratic Aristippus himself did not
          blush when he was taunted with having Lais as his mistress: "Yes," quoth he, "Lais is my
          mistress, but not my master." It is better in Greek; <note n="1" anchored="true">

          you must make a translation yourself, if you want one. As for myself, the fact is that
          that sort of thing never had any attraction for me when I was a young man, much less now I
          am an old one. I like a dinner party. I talk freely there, whatever comes upon the tapis,
          as the phrase is, and convert sighs into loud bursts of laughter. Did you behave better in
          jeering at a philosopher and saying, when he invited anyone to put any question he chose,
          that the question you asked the first thing in the morning was: "Where shall I dine?" The
          blockhead thought that you were going to inquire whether there was one heaven or an
          infinite number! What did you care about that? "Well, but, in heaven's name—you will say
          to me—"was a dinner a great matter to you, and there of all places ?" <note n="2"
            anchored="true">I have translated this as a retort which Cicero expects Paetus to make:
            "You chaff me about my neglecting philosophy for dinner: but why do you care for a
            dinner so much as to dine in such company?" It is not a very obvious or certain
            explanation, but neither are any of those given by others, which all differ. <foreign
              xml:lang="la">At</foreign> naturally introduces a supposed objection. But the text is
            very doubtful. </note>
          <milestone unit="para"/>Well then, my course of life is this. Every day something read or
          written: then, not to be quite churlish to my friends, I dine with them, not only without
          exceeding the law, but even within it, and that by a good deal. <note n="3"
            anchored="true">Caesar's sumptuary law. Suetonius says that he carried it out so
            strictly, that he set inspectors in the provision market to seize forbidden dainties,
            and even sent lictors to remove them from the table if they had been procured. Of
            course, however, it failed (<bibl n="Suet. Jul. 43">Suet. Iul. 43</bibl>; cp. Dio, 43,
            25). </note> So you have no reason to be terrified at the idea of my arrival. You will
          receive a guest of moderate appetite, but of infinite jest. <pb n="104"/>

            Caesar's friend and agent, would know his intentions. </note> has been staying with you?
          As though I were likely to know what he doesn't, and as though, when I do know anything,
          it is not from him that I always learn it. Nay rather, if you love me, tell me what is
          going to be done about us: for you have had in your power one from whom you could have
          learnt it either sober or at any rate drunk. But for myself, I do not ask you for such
          information: in the first place, because I put it down as so much gain that I have been
          left alive for the last four years, if gain it is to be called, and if it is life to
          survive the Republic; and, in the second place, because I think that I myself know what is
          going to happen. For whatever the stronger chooses will be done, and the stronger will
          always be the sword. We ought, accordingly, to be content with any concession made to us,
          whatever it is; the man who was unable to endure this ought to have died. <milestone

          courage and philosophy thought that nothing was better than to remain alive, I cannot but
          love the man by whose kindness I gained that object. But even if he should desire the
          continuance of a republic, such as perhaps he wishes and we ought all to pray for, he yet

          slaves, he is a slave to circumstances: and so neither can he possibly be sure of what
          circumstances will demand, nor we of what he is designing. The reason that I did not send

          either anxiety from the hesitation, or hope from the confidence of my words. However, I
          will add this, which is the most absolute truth, that during the present crisis I have not

        <p> I will answer two letters of yours: one which I received four days ago from Zethus, a
          second which your letter-carrier Phileros brought. From your former letter I gathered that
          you were much gratified by my anxiety about your health, and I rejoice that you have been
          convinced of it. <note n="2" anchored="true">The text is doubtful. I have taken Mueller's
            reading, <foreign xml:lang="la">quam tibi perspectam esse gaudeo</foreign>, omitting
              <foreign xml:lang="la">animumque erga te meum tibi perspectum</foreign>. </note> But,
          believe me, you will never see it in its full reality from a letter. For though I perceive
          that I am being sought out and liked by a considerable number of people—a thing it is
          impossible for me to deny—there is not one of them all nearer to my heart than yourself.
          For that you <pb n="106"/> love me, and have done so for a long while and without
          interruption, is indeed a great thing, or rather the greatest, but it is shared with you
          by many: but that you are yourself so lovable, so gracious, and so delightful in every
          way—that you have all to yourself. Added to that is your wit, not Attic, but more pungent
          than that of the Attics, good Roman wit of the true old city style. Now I—think what you
          will of it—am astonishingly attracted by witticisms, above all of the native kind,
          especially when I see that they were first infected by Latinism, when the foreign element
          found its way into the city, and now-a-days by the breeched <note n="1" anchored="true"
            >Technically <foreign xml:lang="la">Gallia bracata</foreign> was the Province, i.e.,
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Narbonensis</foreign>. </note> and Transalpine tribes also, so
          that no trace of the old-fashioned style of wit can be seen. Accordingly when I see you, I
          seem—to confess the truth—to see all the Granii, the Lucilii, as well as the Crassi and
          Laelii. Upon my life, I have no one left but you in whom I can recognize any likeness of
          the old racy cheerfulness. And when to these graces of wit there is added your strong
          affection for me, do you wonder that I have been so severely alarmed at so grave a blow to
          your health? <milestone unit="para"/>In your second letter you say in self-defence that
          you did not advise me against the purchase at Naples, <note n="2" anchored="true">See
            pp.94, 107. </note> but recommended caution. You put it politely, and I did not regard
          it in any other fight. However, I gathered the same idea as I do from this letter, that
          you did not think it open to me to take the course which I thought I might-namely, to
          abandon politics here, not indeed entirely, but to a great extent. You quote Catulus and
          all that period. <note n="3" anchored="true">He is referring to the period of his own
            consulship, and the years immediately preceding it. Q. Lutatius Catulus (<foreign
              xml:lang="la">consul</foreign>
            <date when="-0078">B.C. 78</date>) had been a consistent supporter of the party of the
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Optimates</foreign>, supported Cicero against the Catilinarian
            conspirators, and hailed him as <foreign xml:lang="la">pater patriae (pro</foreign>
            Sest. § 121). He died in <date when="-006">B.C. 6</date>o. See vol. i., pp.59, 124.
          </note> Where is the analogy? I did not myself at that time desire to absent myself for
          any length of time from the guardianship of the constitution: for I was sitting at the
          helm and holding the rudder; whereas now I have scarcely a place in the hold. Do you
          suppose the number of senatorial decrees will be any the less if I am at Naples? While I
          am at Rome and <pb n="107"/> actually haunting the forum, senatorial decrees are written
          out in the house of your admirer, my intimate friend. <note n="1" anchored="true">Caesar.
          </note> And whenever it occurs to him, I am put down as backing a decree, and am informed
          of its having reached Armenia and Syria, professing to have been made in accordance with
          my vote, before any mention has been made of the business at all. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">Other references to falsifications of <foreign xml:lang="la">senatus

            that his name was placed on the back as having been one of the committee to draw up the
            decree (<foreign xml:lang="la">esse ad scribendum</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="la"

          have you think that I am joking about this; for I assure you I have had letters from kings
          at the other end of the earth, thanking me for having voted for giving them the royal
          title, as to whom I was not only ignorant of their having been called kings, but of their
          very existence even. What, then, am I to do? After all, as long as this friend of

          over ten days. But if I don't find anything to suit me, I have made up my mind to reside
          with you: for I know I could not please you more. I am beginning to despair of Sulla's
          house, as I told you in my last, but I have not, after all, quite given it up. Pray do

        <p> I was exceedingly obliged by your letter giving me an account of your voyages. For you
          indicated your recollection <pb n="108"/> of our friendship, than which nothing could be
          more grateful to my feelings. For the future you will oblige me still more if you will
          write to me in a friendly way about public affairs, that is, the state of your province,
          and the details of your administration. Although I shall be sure to hear of these things
          from many people, considering your distinguished position, nevertheless I should be
          extremely glad to learn them from a letter of your own. For my part, I shall not often
          write to you my sentiments on imperial politics owing to the risk of a letter of that
          kind; but of what is actually being done I will frequently inform you Still I seem to hope
          that our colleague <note n="1" anchored="true">Caesar had become an augur, in virtue of a
            decree of <date when="-0047">B.C. 47</date> making him a member of all the sacred

          Caesar will be careful to see that we have a constitution of some kind. It was of great
          importance that you should take part in his deliberations: but if it is more for your

            adhered throughout to the Pompeian party. He was a very learned man, who wrote on
            various subjects of natural history, augural science, and language. Suetonius (Aug. 94)
            says that he prophesied the future greatness of Augustus by astrology from the hour of
            his birth. He was not recalled, but died shortly after the date of this letter. He
            professed to follow Pythagoras in some way. </note> , not only does no definite subject
          occur to me, but even the usual style of letter seems impossible. For of one department
          and habitual element in those letters, <note n="2" anchored="true">Literary or
            philosophical subjects, apparently, or perhaps lively and sportive subjects. See vol.
            i., p.354. </note> which we used to write in the days of our prosperity, the state of
          the times has violently deprived us, and fortune has ordained that I should be unable to
          write or so much as to think of anything of the sort. There only remained a certain gloomy
          and wretched style of letter, and one suited to the state of the times: that, too, fails
          me. In it there is bound to be either a promise of some assistance, or some consolation
          for your sorrow. I had no such promise to give: for, cast down by a similar blow of
          fortune, I am myself supporting my disasters by the aid of others, and it more frequently
          occurs to my mind to complain that I am living as I do, than to rejoice that I am alive.
          For although no signal injury has been inflicted upon me personally apart from others, and
          although it has never occurred to my mind to wish for anything in such circumstances which
          Caesar has not spontaneously offered me, yet nevertheless I am being so worn out with
          anxieties, that I regard myself as doing wrong in the mere fact of remaining alive. For I
          have lost not only many very intimate associates whom either death has snatched <pb
            n="110"/> from me, or exile torn away, but also all the friends whose affection my
          former successful defence of the Republic, accomplished with your aid, had gained for me.
          I am in the very midst of their shipwrecked fortunes and the confiscation of their
          property; and I not only hear—which in itself would have been bad enough—but I have before
          my very eyes the sharpest of all pangs, the actual sight of the ruin of those men by whose
          aid in old times I quenched that conflagration. And in the city in which I once enjoyed
          such popularity, influence, and glory, I am now entirely deprived of all these. I retain,
          indeed, Caesar's supreme kind-ness: but that cannot make up for violence and a complete
          upset of the established order of things. Therefore, being shorn of all to which nature
          and taste and habit had accustomed me, I present no pleasant object either to others, as
          it seems to me, or to myself. For, being inclined by nature to be always actively employed
          in some task worthy of a man, I have now no scope, not merely for action, but even for
          thought. And I, who in old times was able to help men, who were either obscure or even
          guilty, am now unable to make even a kind promise to Publius Nigidius—the most eminent man
          of the day for learning and purity of character, who formerly enjoyed the highest
          popularity, and at any rate was a most affectionate friend to me. <milestone unit="para"
          />Therefore from that kind of letter I am forcibly debarred. The only thing left is to
          console you and to put before you some considerations by which I may endeavour to distract
          your thoughts from your afflictions. But, if anyone ever had, you have the gift in the
          highest degree of consoling either yourself or another. Therefore upon that part of the
          subject which proceeds from profound reason and philosophy I will not touch: I will leave
          it entirely to you. What is becoming to a brave and wise man, what solidity of character,
          what a lofty mind, what a past such as yours, what studies and accomplishments, in which
          you have been eminent from boyhood, demand of you—that you will see for yourself. I only
          undertake to assure you of what I am able to gather and perceive, from being at Rome and
          watching affairs anxiously and with attention: it is that you will not be long in the
          distressing circumstances in which you are at present; but that in those, nevertheless,
          which I share with you, you <pb n="111"/> will perhaps be permanently. I think I perceive,
          to begin with, that the mind of him who is now all-powerful is inclined to grant your
          restoration. I am not writing at random. The less familiar I am with him, the more minute
          am I in my inquiries. It is in order that he may feel less difficulty in returning a
          sterner answer to those with whom he is still more angry, that he is as yet slower than he
          otherwise would have been in releasing you from your distressing position. His close
          friends, indeed, and those who are most liked by him, both speak and think of you with
          surprising kindness. Then there is in your favour the wish of the common people, or I
          should rather say a consensus of all classes. Even that which for the present, indeed, is
          most powerless of all, but which hereafter must necessarily be powerful, I mean the
          Republic itself, will with all the strength it may possess enforce your claim before long,
          believe me, upon those very men by whom it is now held in bondage. <milestone unit="para"
          />I come round, then, to the point of even making you a promise, which in the first
          instance I refrained from doing. For I will both open my arms to his most familiar
          friends, who are very fond of me and are much in my society, and will worm my way into his
          intimacy, which up to this time my scruples have closed to me, and I will at least follow
          up all the paths by which I shall think it possible to arrive at the object of our wishes.
          In all this department I will do more than I venture to write. And other things, which I
          know for certain to be at your service at the hands of many, are in the highest state of
          preparation on my side. There is no one article of property belonging to me which I would
          choose to have my own rather than yours. On this point, and indeed on the whole subject, I
          write the less liberally, because I prefer your hoping, what I feel sure will be the case,
          that you will be in the enjoyment of your own again. It remains for me to beg and beseech
          you to keep up your spirits to the highest pitch, and not to remember those maxims only
          which you have learnt from other great men, but those also which you have yourself
          produced by your genius and industry. If you review these, you will at once hope for the
          best, and endure philosophically what happens, of whatsoever kind it may be. But you know
          this better than I, or rather than anyone. For my part, whatever I <pb n="112"/>
          understand to be to your interests I will attend to with the greatest zeal and activity,
          and will preserve the memory of what you did for me at the saddest period of my life. </p>

          in one that is common to us all. So you ought neither to demand a position peculiar to

            Pompey in Epirus, had been since Pompey's defeat living at Mitylene unmolested. It was
            on his recall that Cicero delivered the speech (<foreign xml:lang="la">pro</foreign>
            Marcello) in the senate this year. See pp. 136-137. </note> consummate wisdom, nor to
          offer encouragement to a man of the highest spirit and the most conspicuous
          gallantry-certainly not to console him in any way whatever. For if you bear what has
          happened as lam told you do, I ought rather to congratulate you on your manliness than
          console your sorrow. But if these great disasters to the state are breaking your heart, I
          have no ingenuity to spare for finding consolations for you, when I cannot console myself.
          All that remains, therefore, for me to do is at every point so to display and guarantee my
          services, and to be in such a way ready to undertake whatever your friends may wish, as to
          shew that I hold myself your debtor not only for everything that is within my power to do,
          but also for what is beyond it. Nevertheless, please to consider that in what follows I
          have given you a warning, or (if you like) expressed an opinion, or from affection for you
          have been unable to refrain from saying—that you, as I do myself, should make up your
          mind, if there is to be a republic at all, that the first place in it is your due in
          everybody's judgment as well as in actual fact, though you are necessarily yielding to the
          circumstances of the hour: but if there is none, that after all this is the place best
          fitted for living even in exile. For if we are seeking freedom, what place is free from
          the master's hand? But if all we want is Some place, no matter of what sort, what
          residence is pleasanter than one's own home? But believe me, even the <pb n="114"/> man
          who now dominates everything favours men of talent: moreover, he opens his arms to high
          birth and lofty position, as far as circumstances and his own party needs allow. But I
          have said more than I intended. I return, therefore, to that one fact—that I am yours, and
          will be by the side of your friends, always provided that they are yours: if not, I will
          in any case satisfy the claims of our attachment and affection in all particulars.

        <p> Though I am aware that as yet you have maintained a policy of a nature that I do not
          venture to rebuke-not that I do not myself disagree with it, but because I judge you to be
          so wise a man, that I do not presume to prefer my view to yours-nevertheless, both the
          antiquity of our friendship and your eminent affection for me, which I have known from
          your childhood, have urged me to write to you what I believed would make for your personal
          security, and thought was not inconsistent with your honour. I have a vivid recollection
          that you were wise enough to discern the first signs of these disasters long before they
          occurred, and that you administered the consulship with the utmost splendour and in the
          most loyal spirit. But I also was conscious of this—that you were not satisfied with the
          policy of the civil war, nor with Pompey's forces, <note n="1" anchored="true">That is,
            with the amount of forces Pompey had to depend upon at the beginning of <date
              when="-0049">B.C. 49</date> (see <bibl n="Caes. Civ. 1.1">Caes. B.C. 1.1</bibl>),
            whence Marcellus is said to have proposed that Caesar's demand should not be brought
            before the senate until the levies had been held and an army enrolled. See also vol.
            ii., p.247. </note> nor the nature of his army, <note n="2" anchored="true">That is, of
            the heterogeneous character of the army in Epirus, made up of all nations, Asiatic as
            well as European. See vol. ii., p.329. </note> and were always deeply distrustful of it:
          in which <pb n="115"/> sentiment I think you remember that I also shared. Accordingly, you
          did not take much part in active service, and I always strove not to do so. For we were
          not fighting with the weapons with which we might have prevailed-deliberation, weight of
          character, and the righteousness of our cause, in all of which we had the superiority—but
          with muscles and brute force, in which we were not his equals. Accordingly, we were
          beaten, or, if worth cannot really be beaten, at least we were crushed and rendered
          powerless. And in this no one can do otherwise than highly praise your resolution, in that
          with all hope of victory you cast aside all desire of keeping up the contest also; and
          shewed that a wise man and a good citizen takes the first steps in a civil war with
          reluctance, but with pleasure declines taking the last. Those who did not adopt the same
          course as yourself I perceive to have split up into two classes. Either they endeavoured
          to renew the war—and these have betaken themselves to Africa: or, like myself, they
          trusted themselves to the victor. Your course was a kind of compromise between the two,
          since you perhaps regarded the second as cowardice, the first as blind obstinacy. I
          confess that by most people, or I should say by everybody, your plan has been judged to be
          wise, by many even magnanimous and courageous. But your policy, as it seems to me at
          least, has a certain limit, especially as in my opinion nothing is wanting to your being
          able to keep your entire fortune, except your own willingness to do so. For I have
          gathered that there is nothing else which causes him who is now all-powerful to feel any
          hesitation, except the fear that you would not regard it as a favour at all. <note n="1"
            anchored="true">As a matter of fact, when Marcellus, shortly after this letter, had his
            permission to return home, he shewed by no means any haste to avail himself of it. He
            did not leave Mitylene till the next spring, when he was murdered in the Piraeus on his
            way home, as we shall hear. </note> As to which there is no occasion for me to say what
          I think, since my conduct speaks for itself. However, even if you had already made up your
          mind, that you preferred being absent from Rome to seeing what was repugnant to your
          feelings, yet you ought to have reflected that, wherever you were, you would be in <pb
            n="116"/> the power of the man from whom you were fleeing. And even if he were likely to
          make no difficulty about allowing you to live in peace and freedom while deprived of
          property and country, you ought yet to have reflected whether you preferred living at Rome
          and in your own house, whatever the state of affairs, to living at Mitylene or Rhodes. But
          seeing that the power of the man whom we fear is so widely extended, that it has embraced
          the whole world, do you not prefer being in your own house without danger to being in
          another man's with danger? For my part, if I must face death, I would rather do so at home
          and in my native country, than in a foreign and alien land. This is the sentiment of all
          who love you, of whom the number is as great as your eminent and shining virtues deserve.
          We have also regard for your property, which we are unwilling to see scattered. For,
          though it can receive no injury destined to be lasting, because neither the present master
          of the Republic, nor the Republic itself, will allow it, yet I don't want to see an attack
          made by certain banditti upon your possessions : <note n="1" anchored="true">He is
            referring to various irregular and unauthorized seizures of properties of the Pompeians
            by some of the Caesarians, who, however, were in certain cases made to disgorge. See the
            case of Antony seizing the villa of <foreign xml:lang="la">Varro</foreign> at <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Casinum</foreign> (2 Phil. §§ 103-104). </note> and who these are I
          would have ventured to write, had I not felt sure that you understand. Here the anxieties,
          nay, the copious and perpetual tears of one man, your excellent brother Gaius Marcellus,
          plead for your pardon: I come next him both in anxiety and sorrow, but in actual prayers
          am somewhat slow, because I have not the right of entree to Caesar, being myself in need
          of intercession. We have only the influence which the conquered have, yet in counsel and
          zeal we are not wanting to Marcellus. By your other relations my help is not asked. I am

        </opener>
        <p> Though it is only a very few days ago that I gave Quintus Mucius a letter for you
          written at considerable length, in which I set forth in what state of mind I thought you
          ought to be, and what I thought you ought to do, yet, since your freedman Theophilus was
          starting, of whose fidelity and affection to you I had satisfied myself, I was unwilling
          that he should reach you without a letter from me. On the same considerations, then, as I
          did in my previous letter, I again and again exhort you, to make up your mind to become a
          resident member of the Republic, whatever its nature may be, at the earliest possible
          time. You will perhaps see many things disagreeable to your feelings, but not more after
          all than you daily hear. Moreover, you are not the man to be affected by the sense of
          sight alone, and to be less afflicted when you learn the same things by the ear, which
          indeed are usually even magnified by imagination. <note n="1" anchored="true">"When we
            only know a thing by hearsay, we are apt to exaggerate its gravity: when we see it we
            know better its true proportions." The reverse is often stated by Cicero himself, that
            what is seen gives keener pain than what is heard (see p.138, etc.). Both are in a way
            true. </note> But—you object—you will yourself be obliged to say something you do not
          feel, or to do something you do not approve. To begin with, to yield to circumstances,
          that is to submit to necessity, has ever been held the part of a wise man: in the next
          place, things are not—as matters now stand at least—quite so bad as that. You may not be
          able, perhaps, to say what you think: you may certainly hold your tongue. For authority of
          every kind has been committed to one man. He consults nobody but himself, not even his
          friends. There would not have been much difference if he whom we followed were master of
          the Republic. Can we think that the man who in a time of <pb n="118"/> war, when we were
          all united in the same danger, consulted only himself and a certain clique of wholly
          incompetent persons, was likely to be more communicative in the hour of victory, than he
          had been when the result was still uncertain? And do you think that a man who in your
          consulship would never be guided by your consummate wisdom, nor, when your brother was
          administering the consulship under your inspiration, ever condescended to consult you two,
          would now, if he were in sole power, be likely to want suggestions from us? <milestone
            unit="para"/>Everything in civil war is wretched; of which our ancestors never even once
          had experience, while our generation has now had it repeatedly: <note n="1"
            anchored="true">From the time of <foreign xml:lang="la">Sulla</foreign> and Marius
            onwards. </note> but nothing, after all, is more wretched than victory itself, which,
          even if it fall to the better men, yet renders them more savage and ruthless, so that,
          even if they are not such by nature, they are compelled to become so by the necessity of
          the case. For a conqueror is forced, at the beck of those who won him his victory, to do
          many things even against his inclination. Were you not wont to foresee simultaneously with
          myself how bloody that victory was likely to be? Well, would you at that time also have
          absented yourself from your country for fear of seeing what you disapproved? "No," you
          will say, "for then I should have been in possession of wealth and my proper position."
          Ah, but it had been consistent with a virtue such as yours to regard your personal
          interests as among the most insignificant concerns, and to be more profoundly affected by
          those of the state. Again, what is to be the end of your present policy? For up to now
          your conduct is approved, and, as far as such a business admits of it, your good fortune
          also is commended: your conduct, because while you engaged in the first part of the war
          under compulsion, you shewed your wisdom by refusing to follow it to the bitter end: your
          good fortune, because by an honourable retirement you have maintained both the dignity and
          the reputation of your character. Now, however, it is not right that you should feel any
          place more to your taste than your native land; nor ought you to love it less because it
          has lost some of its comeliness, but <pb n="119"/> rather to pity it, and not deprive it
          of the light of your countenance also, when already bereft of many illustrious sons.
          Finally, if it was the sign of high spirit not to be a supplicant to the victor, is it not
          perhaps a sign of pride to spurn his kindness? If it was the act of a wise man to absent
          himself from his country, is it not perhaps a proof of insensibility not to regret her?
          And, if you are debarred from enjoying a public station, is it not perhaps folly to refuse
          to enjoy a private one? The crowning argument is this: even if your present mode of life
          is more convenient, you must yet reflect whether it is not less safe. The sword owns no
          law: but in foreign lands there is even less scruple as to committing a crime. I am
          personally so anxious for your safety, that in this respect I take rank with your brother
          Marcellus, or at any rate come next to him. It is your business to take measures for your
          own interests, civil rights, life, and property. </p>

        <p> I am afraid you may think me remiss in my attentions to you, which, in view of our close
          union resulting from many mutual services and kindred tastes, ought never to be lacking.
          In spite of that I fear you do find me wanting in the matter of writing. The fact is, I
          would have sent you a letter long ago and on frequent occasions, had I not, from expecting
          day after day to have some better news for you, wished to fill my letter with
          congratulation rather than with exhortations to courage. As it is, I shall shortly, I
          hope, have to congratulate you: and so I put off that subject for a letter to another
          time. But in this letter I think that your courage—which I am told and hope is not at all
          shaken-ought to be repeatedly braced by the authority of a man, who, if not the wisest in
          the world, is yet the most devoted <pb n="120"/> to you: and that not with such words as I
          should use to console one utterly crushed and bereft of all hope of restoration, but as to
          one of whose rehabilitation I have no more doubt than I remember that you had of mine. For
          when those men had driven me from the Republic, who thought that it could not fall while I
          was on my feet, I remember hearing from many visitors from Asia, in which country you then
          were, that you were emphatic as to my glorious and rapid restoration. If that system, so
          to speak, of Tuscan augury which you had inherited from your noble and excellent father
          did not deceive you, neither will our power of divination <note n="1" anchored="true">By
            "our divination" Cicero may mean to include the augural science as known to the college
            of augurs. But though he plays round the subject, we need not suppose that he really
            thought that he had learnt to predict events thereby. What follows seems rather to point
            to Milton's "Till old experience do attain To something like prophetic strain," though
            the two ideas are (perhaps purposely) confused. </note> deceive me; which I have
          acquired from the writings and maxims of the greatest savants, and, as you know, by a very
          diligent study of their teaching, as well as by an extensive experience in managing public
          business, and from the great vicissitudes of fortune which I have encountered. And this
          divination I am the more inclined to trust, from the fact that it never once deceived me
          in the late troubles, in spite of their obscurity and confusion. I would have told you
          what events I foretold, were I not afraid to be thought to be making up a story after the
          event. Yet, after all, I have numberless witnesses to the fact that I warned Pompey not to
          form a union with Caesar, and afterwards not to sever it. By this union I saw that the
          power of the senate would be broken, by its severance a civil war be provoked. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">This prediction seems rather slender capital on which to set up business
            as a prophet. Pompey and Caesar combined for the express purpose of checkmating the
            senate, and if they quarrelled difficulties would be sure to follow. Besides, he puts
            quite a different complexion on it elsewhere (<bibl n="Cic. Phil. 2.24">Phil.
              2.24</bibl>), representing the remark as an aspiration expressed to Pompey after the
            war had begun. But "I told you so " is a gratification that few can resist. </note> And
          yet I was very intimate with Caesar, and had a very great regard for Pompey, but my advice
          was <pb n="121"/> at once loyal to Pompey and in the best interests of both alike. My
          other predictions I pass over; for I would not have Caesar think that I gave Pompey
          advice, by which, if he had followed it, Caesar himself would have now been a man of
          illustrious character in the state indeed, and the first man in it, but yet not in
          possession of the great power he now wields. I gave it as my opinion that he should go to
          Spain; <note n="1" anchored="true">It seems almost impossible that Cicero should ever have
            given this advice. Whilst in <foreign xml:lang="la">Cilicia</foreign>, indeed-when, as
            we have seen, he got rather behindhand in his knowledge of the inner nature of things—he
            was strong for Pompey not going to Spain (vol. ii., pp.30, 73). On his return he had an
            interview with Pompey on the 10th of December (vol. ii., p.223), in which he certainly
            made no such suggestion. As the days of December went on, and the fatal days of January
            approached, he all along supposes Pompey's presence in the senate, and himself to be
            supporting him (vol. ii., pp.226, 229). Nor in a second interview with Pompey, on the
            25th of December, does his account admit of the idea of his having expressed such an
            opinion (vol. ii., p.230); in fact, though Pompey apparently did mention it, Cicero
            thought it the worst of allthe alternatives (vol. ii., p.232). After about January 7th,
            he saw Pompey no more till he joined him in Epirus, when such a suggestion could not
            have been made. He was cognizant, however, of the proposals of Ciesar—sent through
            Lucius Caesar—one of which was that Pompey should go to Spain, though he characterized
            them as "utterly absurd" (vol. ii., p.249); still they were accepted—on condition of
            Caesar withdrawing from Italy—about the 25th of January, and Cicero may then have
            expressed this opinion, but so did others, only with this impossible condition (vol.
            ii., pp.253-254). </note> and if he had done so, there would have been' no civil war at
          all. That Caesar should be allowed to stand for the consulship in his absence I did not so
          much contend to be constitutional, as that, since the law had been passed by the people at
          the instance of Pompey himself when consul, it should be done. The pretext for hostilities
          was given. What advice or remonstrance did I omit, when urging that any peace, even the
          most inequitable, should be preferred to the most righteous war? My advice was overruled,
          not so much by Pompey—for he was affected by it—as by those who, relying on him as a
          military leader, thought that a victory in that war would be highly conducive to their
          private interests and personal ambitions. The war was begun without my taking any active
          part in it; it was forcibly removed from Italy, while I remained there as long as I could.
          But honour had greater weight with me than <pb n="122"/> fear: I had scruples about
          failing to support Pompey's safety, when on a certain occasion he had not failed to
          support mine. Accordingly, overpowered by a feeling of duty, or by what the loyalists
          would say, or by a regard for my honour-whichever you please-like Amphiaraus in the play,
          I went deliberately, and fully aware of what I was doing, "to ruin full displayed before
          my eyes." <note n="1" anchored="true">The author of the line is not known. Amphiaraus,
            husband of Eriphyle, sister of Adrastus, was enticed by his wife into joining the
            expedition of the Seven against Thebes, though he knew he was going to his death.
            Eriphyle had been bribed by Polynices to persuade her husband. It was a common theme of
            tragedy. </note> In this war there was not a single disaster that I did not foretell.
          Therefore, since, after the manner of augurs and astrologers, I too, as a state augur,
          have by my previous predictions established the credit of my prophetic power and knowledge
          of divination in your eyes, my prediction will justly claim to be believed. Well, then,
          the prophecy I now give you does not rest on the flight of a bird nor the note of a bird
          of good omen on the left-according to the system of our augural college-nor from the
          normal and audible pattering of the corn of the sacred chickens. I have other signs to
          note; and if they are not more infallible than those, yet after all they are less obscure
          or misleading. Now omens as to the future are observed by me in what I may call a two fold
          method: the one I deduce from Caesar himself, the other from the nature and complexion of
          the political situation. Caesar's characteristics are these: a disposition naturally
          placable and clement—as delineated in your brilliant book of "Grievances "—and a great
          liking also for superior talent, such as your own. Besides this, he is relenting at the
          expressed wishes of a large number of your friends, which are well-grounded and inspired
          by affection, not hollow and self-seeking. Under this head the unanimous feeling of
          Etruria <note n="2" anchored="true">The <foreign xml:lang="la">Caecinae</foreign> were a
            noble family of <foreign xml:lang="la">Volaterrae in Etruria</foreign>. </note> will
          have great influence on him. <milestone unit="para"/>Why, then—you may ask—have these
          things as yet had no effect? Why, because he thinks if he grants you yours, he cannot
          resist the applications of numerous petitioners with whom to all appearance he has juster
          grounds for anger. "What hope, then," you will say, "from an angry <pb n="123"/> man?"
          Why, he knows very well that he will draw deep draughts of praise from the same fountain,
          from which he has been already—though sparingly-bespattered. <note n="1" anchored="true"
            >This is Cicero's polite way of characterizing a book of Caecina's against Caesar, which
            Suetonius (Iul.75) says was most abusive (<foreign xml:lang="la"
              >criminosissimus</foreign>). He appears since then to have written some recantation,
            which he called <foreign xml:lang="la">Querelae</foreign>. </note> Lastly, he is a man
          very acute and farseeing: he knows very well that a man like you—far and away the greatest
          noble in an important district of Italy, and in the state at large the equal of any one of
          your generation, however eminent, whether in ability or popularity or reputation among the
          Roman people-cannot much longer be debarred from taking part in public affairs. <note
            n="2" anchored="true">Cicero trusts to Caesar wishing, like Napoleon, to have the
            countenance and support of the nobility. </note> He will be unwilling that you should,
          as you would sooner or later, have time to thank for this rather than his favour.
            <milestone unit="para"/>So much for Caesar. Now I will speak of the nature of the actual
          situation. There is no one so bitterly opposed to the cause, which Pompey undertook with
          better intentions than provisions, as to venture to call us bad citizens or dishonest men.
          On this head I am always struck with astonishment at Caesar's sobriety, fairness, and
          wisdom. He never speaks of Pompey except in the most respectful terms. "But," you will
          say, "in regard to him as a public man his actions have often been bitter enough." Those
          were acts of war and victory, not of Caesar. But see with what open arms he has received
          us! Cassius he has made his legate; <note n="3" anchored="true">After surrendering his
            fleet to him on his voyage to Alexandria. </note> Brutus governor of Gaul ; <note n="4"
            anchored="true">M. <foreign xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign> was made governor of
            Cisalpine Gaul, <date when="-0046">B.C. 46</date>. </note> Sulpicius of Greece ; <note

            Greece, see p.35. </note> Marcellus, <note n="6" anchored="true">M. Claudius Marcellus,
              <foreign xml:lang="la">consul</foreign>
            <date when="-0051">B.C. 51</date>. See p.113. </note> with whom he was more angry than
          with anyone, he has restored with the utmost consideration for his rank. To what, then,
          does all this tend? The nature of things and of the political situation will not suffer,
          nor will any Constitutional theory-whether it remain as it is or is changed-permit, first,
          that the civil and personal position <pb n="124"/> of all should not be alike when the
          merits of their cases are the same; and, secondly, that good men and good citizens of
          unblemished character should not return to a state, into which so many have returned after
          having been condemned of atrocious crimes. <milestone unit="para"/>That is my prediction.
          If I had felt any doubt about it I would not have employed it in preference to a
          consolation which would have easily enabled me to support a man of spirit. It is this. If
          you had taken up arms for the Republic—for so you then thought—with the full assurance of
          victory, you would not deserve special commendation. But if; in view of the uncertainty
          attaching to all wars, you had taken into consideration the possibility of our being
          beaten, you ought not, while fully prepared to face success, to be yet utterly unable to
          endure failure. I would have urged also what a consolation the consciousness of your
          action, what a delightful distraction in adversity, literature ought to be. I would have
          recalled to your mind the signal disasters not only of men of old times, but of those of
          our own day also, whether they were your leaders or your comrades. I would even have named
          many cases of illustrious foreigners: for the recollection of what I may call a common law
          and of the conditions of human existence softens grief. I would also have explained the
          nature of our life here in Rome, how bewildering the disorder, how universal the chaos:
          for it must needs cause less regret to be absent from a state in disruption, than from one
          well-ordered. But there is no occasion for anything of this sort. I shall soon see you, as
          I hope, or rather as I clearly perceive, in enjoyment of your civil rights. Meanwhile, to
          you in your absence, as also to your son who is here—the express image of your soul and
          person, and a man of unsurpassable firmness and excellence—I have long ere this both
          promised and tendered practically my zeal, duty, exertions, and labours: all the more so
          now that Caesar daily receives me with more open arms, while his intimate friends
          distinguish me above everyone. Any influence or favour I may gain with him I will employ
          in your service. Be sure, for your part, to support yourself not only with courage, but
          also with the brightest hopes. <pb n="125"/>

        <p> Although in your present circumstances I was bound, in view of our friendship, to write
          you some word either of consolation or support, yet up to this time I had omitted doing
          so, because I did not think myself able by mere words either to soften or remove your
          grief. When, however, I began to entertain a strong hope that it would not be long before
          we had you here in full enjoyment of your civil rights, I could not refrain from declaring
          my opinion and wishes to you. To begin with, then, I will say this, of which I have a
          clear knowledge and full perception—that Caesar will not be very obdurate to you. For
          circumstances, as well as the lapse of time and public opinion, and—as it seems to me—even
          his own natural disposition, daily render him more indulgent. And that I not only perceive
          in the case of others, but I am also told it in regard to yourself by his most intimate
          friends, to whom, ever since the news from Africa first arrived, I have never ceased in
          conjunction with your brothers to make representations. Thanks indeed to their virtue and
          piety and their unique affection for you, their constant and unremitting care for your
          safety are having such good effect, that I think there is now no indulgence that Caesar
          himself will not grant you. But if this comes to pass somewhat less quickly than we wish,
          the reason is that, owing to the multiplicity of his business, interviews with him have
          been somewhat difficult to obtain. At the same time, being unusually angered at the
          resistance in Africa, he seems resolved to keep those in suspense somewhat longer, by whom
          he considers himself to have been involved in the worry of a more protracted struggle. But
          even this, I understand, he daily regards in a more forgiving and placable spirit.
          Wherefore, believe me, <pb n="126"/> and remember that I said so to you, that you will not
          be much longer in your distressing position. Having told you my opinion, I will shew what
          my wishes are in regard to you by deeds rather than by words. If I were as powerful as I
          ought to be in a Republic, to which my services have been such as you estimate them, you
          certainly would not have now been in your present disadvantageous position: for the same
          cause has ruined my influence which has brought your safety into danger. But nevertheless,
          whatever the shadow of my old position, whatever the remains of my popularity shall be
          able to effect, all my zeal, advice, efforts, and fidelity shall be ever at the service of
          your most excellent brothers. Be sure, on your part, to keep the brave spirit which you
          have always kept. First, for the reasons which I have mentioned: and, secondly, because
          your wishes and sentiments about the Republic have ever been such as not only to warrant a
          hope of prosperity now, but even, if everything goes wrong, to make it after all incumbent
          on you, from a consciousness of your actions and policy, to bear whatever happens with the
          greatest resolution and spirit. </p>

          <salute>TO T. AMPIUS BALBUS (RECALLED FROM EXILE)</salute>
          <dateline>ROME (SEPTEMBER)</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> I congratulate you, my dear Balbus, and with sincerity. Yet I am not so foolish as to
          wish you to indulge in a passing and groundless exultation, and then to be suddenly
          depressed and rendered so prostrate, that nothing could afterwards raise your spirits or
          restore your equanimity. I have pleaded your cause with greater openness than was quite
          consistent with my present position. For the unfortunate fact itself of my influence
          having been weakened <pb n="127"/> was overcome by my affection for you and my unbroken
          love towards you, which has always been most carefully cultivated by yourself. Everything
          that was promised in regard to your return and restoration has been fulfilled, and is now
          secure and fully ratified. I have seen it with my own eyes, have had full information,
          have been personally a witness to it. For very opportunely I have all Caesar's intimate
          friends so closely knit to me by association and kindly feeling, that next to him they
          look upon me as first. Pansa, Hirtius, Balbus, Oppius, Matius, all make it clear in this
          matter that they have a unique regard for me. But if I had had to do it by my own
          exertions, I should not have regretted having made the attempt in whatever way the
          exigencies of the situation demanded. But I have not, in fact, made any special
          concessions to the situation: my old intimacy with all these men comes in here, with whom
          I have never ceased urging your claims. But Pansa, who is exceedingly zealous on your
          behalf and anxious to oblige me, I have regarded as my mainstay in this business, as being
          influential with Caesar no less from his character than from personal predilection.
          Tillius Cimber, again, has quite satisfied me. Yet, after all, the petitions which have
          weight with Caesar are not those which proceed from personal considerations, but those
          which are dictated by duty: and, as that was the case with Cimber, he had more influence
          than he could have had in anyone else's behalf. The passport has not been issued at once,
          owing to the amazing rascality of certain persons, who would have been bitterly annoyed at
          a pardon being granted to you, whom that party call the "bugle of the civil war"—and a
          good many observations to the same effect are made by them, as though they were not
          positively glad of that war having occurred. Wherefore it seemed best to carry on the
          business with Some secrecy, and by no means to let it get abroad that your affair was
          settled. But it will be so very shortly, and I have no doubt that by the time you read
          this letter the matter will have been completed. The fact is that Pansa, a man whose
          character and word can be trusted, not only assured me of it, but also undertook that he
          would very quickly get the passport. Nevertheless, I resolved that this account should be
          sent you, because from Eppuleia's report <pb n="128"/> and Ampia's <note n="1"
            anchored="true">The wife and daughter of T. Ampius. </note> tears I gathered that you
          were less confident than your letter would suggest Moreover, they thought that in their
          absence from your side you would be in much more serious anxiety. Wherefore I thought it
          of very great importance, for the sake of alleviating your pain and sorrow, that you
          should have stated for certain what was in fact certain. <milestone unit="para"/>You know
          that hitherto it has been my habit to write to you rather in the tone of one consoling a
          man of courage and wisdom, than as holding out any sure hope of restoration beyond that
          which, in my opinion, was to be expected from the Republic itself as soon as the present
          excitement died down. Remember your writings, in which you always shewed me a spirit at
          once great and firmly prepared to endure whatever might happen. Nor was I surprised at
          that, since I remembered that you had been engaged in public affairs from your earliest
          youth, and that your terms of office had coincided with the most dangerous crises in the
          safety and fortunes of the community, <note n="2" anchored="true">T. Ampius Balbus was a
            tribune in <date when="-0063">B.C. 63</date>, and praetor in <date when="-0059">B.C.

            which Cicero regards as fatal to the constitution. He had always been an ardent
            Pompeian, having proposed special honours to Pompey in <date when="-0063">B.C. 63</date>
            for his Eastern campaign. For his activity at the beginning of the Civil War, see vol.
            ii., p.271. He was not, it seems, at the battle of <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Pharsalia</foreign>, but was in Asia, where he tried to seize the treasures of the
            temple at Ephesus (<bibl n="Caes. Civ. 3.105">Caes. B.C. 3.105</bibl>). </note> and that
          you entered on this very war not solely with the idea of being in prosperity if
          victorious, but also, if it so happened, of bearing it philosophically if beaten. In the
          next place, since you devote your time to recording the deeds of brave men, <note n="3"
            anchored="true">This work is quoted apparently by <bibl n="Suet. Jul. 77">Suetonius,
              Iul. 77</bibl>. </note> you ought to think yourself bound to abstain from doing
          anything to prevent your shewing yourself exactly like those whom you commend. But this is
          a style of talk better suited to the position from which you have now escaped: for the
          present merely prepare yourself to endure with us the state of things here. If I could
          find any remedy for that, I would impart the same to you.. But our one refuge is
          philosophy and literature, to which we have always been devoted. In the time of our
          prosperity these seemed only to be an <pb n="129"/> enjoyment, now they are our salvation
          also. But, to return to what I said at first, I have no doubt of everything having been
          accomplished in the matter of your restoration and return. </p>

        <p> I would have sent you a letter before, if I had been able to hit upon the best sort to
          write: for at such a crisis the duty of friends is either to console or to make promises.
          I did not offer consolation, because I was told by many of the fortitude and wisdom with
          which you were bearing the hardship of the present situation, and how thoroughly you were
          consoled by the consciousness of your actions and policy. If that is the case, you are
          reaping a rich reward of your excellent studies, in which I know that you have ever been
          engaged, and I exhort you again and again to continue this line of conduct. At the same
          time, see here! You are a man deeply versed in what is recorded not only of particular
          examples, but in ancient history generally, while I am not quite ignorant of them either;
          but, though less deeply read than I could wish, I have had an even greater experience than
          I could have desired in actual affairs and practical business. Well, I pledge my word to
          you, that this indignation and this injurious treatment will not last long. For, in the
          first place, the man himself who has the chief power appears to me to be daily inclining
          insensibly towards just views and natural equity; and, in the second place, the merits of
          our cause itself are of such a kind, that It must necessarily revive and be renewed along
          with the Republic, which cannot possibly be kept down for ever. In fact, every day
          something is done in a spirit of greater Clemency and liberality than we feared would be
          the case. And since such things depend upon shifting circumstances, <pb n="130"/> often
          minute, I will look out for every chance, and will not pass over any opportunity of
          helping and relieving you. Accordingly, that second style of letter which I mentioned will
          daily, I hope, become easier to adopt-enabling me to make promises also. That I should
          prefer doing practically rather than in mere words. I would have you be convinced of
          this—that you have more friends than others who are and have been in the same misfortune
          as yourself, as far at least as I have been able to ascertain; and that I yield to no one
          of them. Be sure you keep up a brave and lofty spirit. That depends on yourself alone:
          what depends on fortune will be guided by circumstances and provided for by prudent
          measures on our part. </p>

        <p> Of the value I feel and always have felt for you, and of the value which I know you feel
          for me, I am myself the witness. Two things cause me as much anxiety as my misfortunes
          always caused you. The first is your policy, or perhaps I should say your misfortune, in
          remaining too long in the prosecution of a civil war; the second, that the recovery of
          your property and position is slower than is fair and than I could have wished.
          Accordingly, I have opened my whole heart to Postumulenus, Sestius, and (most frequently)
          to our friend Atticus, and recently to your freedman Theudas, and have repeated to them
          separately on several occasions, that by whatever means I could I desired to do all that
          you and your sons could wish. And I would have you write and tell your family that, as far
          at least as it lies in my power, they should regard my efforts, advice, property, and
          fidelity as at their service for all purposes. If my influence and favour were as great as
          they ought to be in a state which I have served so well, you too would now be what you <pb
            n="131"/> were, worthy in the highest degree of any rank, and at least easily first of
          your own ordo. But, since at the same time and in the same cause we have both of us lost
          our position, the things mentioned above, which are still mine to promise, and those also
          which I seem to myself to be partially retaining as reliques, so to speak, of my old
          rank-these I hereby promise you. For Caesar himself; as I have been able to gather by many
          circumstances, is not estranged from me, and nearly all his most intimate friends, bound
          to me as it happens by important services rendered by me in the past, are constant in
          their attentions and visits to me. Accordingly, if I find any opening for mooting the
          subject of your fortunes, that is, of your restoration to civil rights, on which
          everything depends—and I am daily more induced to hope for it from what these men say—I
          will do so personally and exert myself to the uttermost. It is not necessary to enter into
          details: I tender you my zeal and goodwill without reserve. But it is of great importance
          to me that all your friends should—as they may by a letter from you—know this, that
          everything which is Cicero's is at the service of Trebianus. To the same effect is it that
          they should believe that there is nothing too difficult for me to undertake with pleasure
          for you. </p>

            from this passage that he was on some service in the East at the present time. The
            disturbance in Syria was caused by Q. Caecilius Bassus, who, escaping from <foreign

          Rome, though there is the most profound tranquillity, you would prefer to have some
          salutary business of the right sort on foot. And I hope it will be so, for I see that
          Caesar is anxious for it. <note n="2" anchored="true">Some of the best of Caesar's laws
            were passed this year (Dio, 43, 25), but perhaps Cicero means some more or less complete
            restoration of the Republic. </note> Allow me to inform you that, seizing upon what I

          from a sincere feeling, but if not at least out of friendship. I will tell your people

        </opener>
        <p> Many <note n="1" anchored="true">Mueller gives a date, November 26th; but it does not
            appear to rest on anything certain. </note> daily report to me that you are in a state
          of great anxiety, and in the midst of miseries affecting all alike are suffering, as it
          were, a special personal sorrow. Though not surprised at this, and to a certain extent
          sharing in it myself, yet I am sorry that a man of your all but unequalled wisdom does not
          rather feel pleasure in his own blessings, than vexation at other people's misfortunes.
          For myself; though I do not yield to anyone in sorrow experienced from the ruin and
          destruction of the constitution, yet I now find many Sources of consolation, and above all
          in the consciousness of the policy which I pursued. For far in advance I foresaw the
          coming storm, as it were from a watchtower, and that not altogether spontaneously, but
          much more owing to your warnings and denunciations. For, though I was absent during the
          greater part of your consulship, yet in spite of that absence I was well informed of your
          sentiments in taking precautions against and predicting this disastrous war, and I was
          myself present in the first period of your consulship, <note n="2" anchored="true">The
            year B C. 51, in May of which year Cicero started for his province. </note> when, after
          passing in review all the civil wars, you warned the senate in the most impressive terms,
          both to fear those they remembered, and to feel assured, since the last generation had
          been so cruel—to an extent up to that time unprecedented in the Republic—that whoever
          thenceforth overpowered the Republic by arms would be <pb n="134"/> much more difficult to
          endure. For what is done on a precedent, they Consider as even legally justifiable: but
          they add and Contribute something, or rather a great deal, of their own to it. Wherefore
          you must remember that those who have not followed your authority and advice have fallen
          by their own folly, when they might have been saved by prudence like yours. You will say:
          "What consolation is that to me in the midst of such gloom and what I may call the ruins
          of the Republic?" Certainly it is a sorrow scarce admitting of consolation: so complete is
          the loss and the hopelessness of recovery. But, after all, both in Caesar's judgment and
          the people's estimate your righteousness, wisdom, and lofty character shine out like some
          torch when all the rest have gone out. This ought to go a long way towards alleviating
          your unhappiness. As to absence from your family, that should be the less distressing to
          you from the fact that you are at the same time absent from many severe annoyances. All of
          these I would have now mentioned in detail, had I not scrupled to enlighten you on certain
          particulars, from not seeing which you appear to me to be in a happier position than we
          who see them. I think that any consolation from me is properly confined to your being
          informed by a very affectionate friend of those facts by which your uneasiness could be
          relieved. Other sources of consolation, not unknown to me nor the least
          significant-indeed, as I think, by far the greatest—are centred in yourself: and by daily
          testing them I so completely recognize their soundness that they seem to me to be
          positively life-giving. <milestone unit="para"/>Again, I recall the fact that from the
          earliest dawn of manhood you have been most absolutely devoted to all kinds of
          philosophical study, and have with the utmost zeal and care learnt all the maxims of the
          wisest men which concern a right conduct of life. These indeed are useful as well as
          delightful, even in the highest state of prosperity: but in such times as these we have
          nothing else to give us peace of mind. I will not be in any way presumptuous, nor exhort a
          man so richly endowed with professional knowledge <note n="1" anchored="true">That is,
            jurisprudence. </note> and natural ability, to return to those arts to which, from the
          earliest period of your life, you have devoted your industry. <pb n="135"/> I will only
          say, what I hope you think to be right, that for myself, seeing that for the art to which
          I had devoted myself there was now no place either in forum or senate-house, I have
          bestowed my every thought and every effort on philosophy. For your professional knowledge
          - eminent and unrivalled as it is—no sphere much better has been left than for mine.
          Wherefore, though I do not presume to advise you, I have persuaded myself that you also
          were engaged in pursuits which, even if they were not exactly profitable yet served to
          withdraw the mind from anxiety. Your son Servius indeed is engaged in all liberal studies,
          and especially in those in which I have mentioned that I find peace of mind, with
          conspicuous success. In my affection for him in fact I yield to no one in the world but
          yourself, and he repays me with gratitude. In this matter he thinks, as one may easily
          see, that in shewing me attention and regard, he is at the same time doing what will give
          you the greatest pleasure. </p>

        <p> I ACCEPT your excuse for having frequently sent me a letter in duplicate, but I accept
          it only so far as you attribute to the carelessness or untrustworthiness of those who take
          them from you that they do not reach me: that part of your excuse in which you say that
          you frequently send me letters containing the same words from "poverty of language"—that
          is your expression—I neither understand nor acknowledge. And I myself, whom you declare in
          joke (as I take it) to possess a rich store of language, admit that I am not very badly
          off for words: for there is no occasion for "mock-modesty": yet I too—and that without
          "mock-modestly"—easily yield to the refinement and dainty simplicity of your style. As to
          your policy, mentioned in your letter, in not de <pb n="136"/> clining this command of
          Achaia, <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Achaia</foreign> was not an organized province at this time; its
            communities were free (<foreign xml:lang="la">liberi populi</foreign>, <bibl
              n="Caes. Civ. 3.3">Caes. B.C. 3.3</bibl>), though in a certain sense it was a
            province, as owing some allegiance to Rome, and is so classed by Cicero in, <date
              when="-0059">B.C. 59</date>, along with Marseilles, Rhodes, Sparta, Athens, Thessaly,
            and <foreign xml:lang="la">Boeotia (pro</foreign> Flacc. § 100). But Caesar had been in
            military occupation of it since <date when="-0048">B.C. 48</date>, having sent Q. Fufius
            Calenus there with a legion (<bibl n="Caes. Civ. 3.56">Caes. B.C. 3.56</bibl>), and
            though after <foreign xml:lang="la">Pharsalia</foreign> the legion was withdrawn (ib.
            106), Fufius seems to have remained there with some forces during part of <date
              when="-0047">B.C. 47</date> (see p.37; Caes. B. Alex. 44). Fufius returned to Rome
            with Caesar in the course of <date when="-0047">B.C. 47</date>, and it was then, it
            appears, that Sulpicius was asked by Caesar to accept charge of <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Achaia</foreign>, with authority in other parts of Greece also. </note> as I always
          had approved of it, much more did I do so after reading your last letter. For all the
          reasons which you mention are thoroughly sound, and in the highest degree worthy of your
          character and wisdom. As to your thinking that the matter has turned out otherwise than
          you expected, in that I do not at all agree with you. The fact is this: the
          disorganization and confusion are so great, the general dilemma and collapse caused by a
          most shocking war are so complete, that each man thinks the place where he happens to be
          the most wretched in the world. That is why you feel dissatisfied with your policy, and
          why only we who are still at home appear to you to be happy: while on the contrary to us
          you seem, not indeed entirely free from distress, but happy in comparison with ourselves.
          And in fact your lot is better than ours in this: you venture to say in your letter what
          is giving you pain; we cannot do even that much safely. Nor is this the fault of the
          victor, whose moderation cannot be surpassed, but of the victory itself, which in the case
          of civil wars is always offensive. In one point I have had the better of you—that I knew
          of the recall of your colleague Marcellus <note n="2" anchored="true">M. Marcellus,
              <foreign xml:lang="la">consul</foreign> with Sulpicius <date when="-0051">B.C.
              51</date> (see p.113). It was on Caesar's consenting to his recall that Cicero now
            explains why he made the speech in the senate. </note> a little before you did; and
          also, by Hercules, that I saw how that matter was actually managed. For be assured that
          since these unhappy events, that is, since the appeal to arms was begun, nothing else has
          been transacted with any proper dignity. For, in the first place, Caesar himself, after
          inveighing against the "bitter spirit" shewn by Marcellus—for that was the term he
          used—and having commended in the most complimentary terms <pb n="137"/> your fairness as
          well as your wisdom, all on a sudden unexpectedly concluded by saying that "he would not
          refuse a request of the senate for Marceflus, even in view of tbe character of the
          individual." In the next place, the senate had arranged, as soon as the case of Marcellus
          had been mentioned by L. Piso, and Gaius Marcellus <note n="1" anchored="true">C. Claudius
            Marcellus, <foreign xml:lang="la">consul</foreign>
            <date when="-0050">B.C. 50</date>, who was married to Caesar's great-niece Octavia.
            Though he had handed over the two legions sent by Caesar on pretext of the Parthian war
            to Pompey, he seems yet to have no part in the war of <date>B.C. <date to="-48"
                from="-49">49</date>-48</date> (<bibl n="Caes. Gal. 8.48">Caes. B. G. 8.48</bibl>,
            55). He was cousin (not brother) of M. Marcellus. </note> had thrown himself at Caesar's
          feet, that it should rise en masse and approach Caesar in a suppliant attitude. Ask no
          questions: -this day appeared to me to be so fair that I seemed to be seeing some shadow
          of a reviving Republic. Accordingly, when all who were called up before had moved a vote
          of thanks to Caesar, except Volcatius—for he said that if he had been in Caesar's place he
          would not have done it-I, when called on, abandoned my resolution. For I had determined,
          not, by Hercules, from lack of interest, but because I missed my old position in the
          house, to maintain unbroken silence. This resolution of mine gave way before Caesar's
          magnanimity and the senate's display of devotion. I therefore delivered a speech of thanks
          to Caesar at some length, and I am afraid that I have robbed myself of an honourable
          abstention from business in other cases as well, which was my one consolation in
          misfortune. However, since I have avoided offending him, who perhaps would have thought,
          if I never opened my mouth, that I regarded the constitution as in abeyance, I will do
          this without transgressing the bounds of moderation; or rather I shall keep some way this
          side of them, so as to satisfy his wishes without infringing upon my literary employments.
          For, though from my earliest youth every branch of study and liberal learning, and above
          all philosophy has been a delight to me, yet this taste grows stronger daily: partly, I
          presume, because my time of life is , now at its full maturity for wisdom, and partly
          owing to the .corruption of the times, which makes everything else incapable of relieving
          my mind of its sorrows. From a similar pursuit I gather from your letter that you are
          being distracted by business. But, after all, by this time the night hours will <pb
            n="138"/> help you somewhat. Your, or rather our, Servius is exceedingly attentive to
          me; and I am charmed not only with his universal integrity and the remarkable excellence
          of his character, but also by his devotion to study and learning. He often discusses with
          me whether you should stay where you are or quit your province. At present my opinion is
          that we should do nothing except Just what Caesar appears to wish. Things are in such a
          state that, supposing you to be at Rome, nothing could possibly give you any pleasure
          except your own family. As for the rest, the best feature in the situation is Caesar
          himself: all else is of such a kind, that, if you must do one or the other, you would
          prefer hearing to seeing them. This advice of mine is not at all consonant with my
          feelings, for I long to see you, but I am consulting for your own interests. </p>

          acceptable to me, because it proceeds from the kindest of hearts, yet there is one thing
          still more delightful and gratifying to me—namely, that while I have so few friends,
          relations, or connexions to take a sincere interest in my safety, I have had reason to
          know that you desire my company and have shewn in a practical way an unparalleled devotion
          to my interest. Everything else is as you say. And <pb n="139"/> considering the state of

          without the kind-ness of such gallant men and true friends no one, whether in adversity or
          prosperity, can live a real life. Accordingly, I congratulate myself on this. But for
          yourself, I will prove to you in a practical manner that you have been loyal to a man who
          loves you most deeply. </p>

        <p> You don't say so! You think yourself a madman for imitating the thunder of my eloquence,
          as you call it? <note n="1" anchored="true">Paetus had apparently compared his presumption
            to that of Salmoneus: "<foreign xml:lang="la">Demens, qui nimbos et non imitabile fulmen
              Aere et</foreign> cornipedum <foreign xml:lang="la">pulsu simularet equorum</foreign>"
              (<bibl n="Verg. A. 6.590">Verg. Aen. 6.590</bibl>). </note> You certainly would have
          been beside yourself if you had failed to do so: but since you even beat me at it, you
          ought to jeer at me rather than at yourself. So you had no need of that quotation from
          Trabea, <note n="2" anchored="true">Quintus <foreign xml:lang="la">Trabea</foreign>, a
            writer of comedies, who flourished about <date when="-00120">B.C. 120</date>. Cicero
            quoted him before (see vol. ii., p. 80); but it does not appear what the quotation made
            by Paetus was-some think the remark about imitating thunder. </note> rather the fiasco
          was mine. But, after all, what do you think of my style in letters? Don't I talk with you
          in the vulgar tongue? Why, of course one doesn't write always in the same style. For what
          analogy has a letter with a speech in court or at a public meeting? Nay, even as to
          speeches in court, it is not my practice to handle all in the same style. Private causes
          and such as are of slight importance we plead in simpler language; those that affect a
          man's civil existence or reputation, of course, in a more ornate style: but letters it is
          our custom to compose in the language of everyday life. Well, but letting that pass, how
          did it come into your head, my dear Paetus, to <pb n="140"/> say that there never was a
          Papirius who was not a plebeian? For, in fact, there were patrician Papirii, of the lesser
          houses, of whom the first was L. Papirius Mugillanus, censor with L. Sempronius
          Atratinus—having already been his colleague in the consulship—in the 312th year of the
          city. But in those days they were called Papisii. After him thirteen sat in the curule
          chair before L. Papirius Crassus, who was the first to drop the form Papisius. This man
          was named dictator, with L. Papirius Cursor as Master of the Horse, in the 415th year of
          the city, and four years afterwards was consul with Kaeso Duilius. Cursor came next to
          him, a man who held a very large number of offices; <note n="1" anchored="true">The hero
            of the second Samnite war was <foreign xml:lang="la">consul</foreign> six times,
            dictator three times. </note> then comes L. Masso, who rose to the aedileship; then a
          number of Massones. The busts of these I would have you keep—all patricians. Then follow
          the Carbones and Turdi. These latter were plebeians, whom I opine that you may disregard.
          For, except the Gaius Carbo who was assassinated by Damasippus, there has not been one of
          the Carbones who was a good and useful citizen. We knew Gnaeus Carbo and his brother the
          wit: were there ever greater scoundrels? About the one who is a friend of mine, the son of
          Rubrius, I say nothing. There have been those three brothers Carbo—Gaius, Gnaeus, Marcus.
          Of these, Marcus, a great thief, was condemned for malversation in Sicily on the
          accusation of Publius Flaccus: Gaius, when accused by Lucius Crassus, is said to have
          poisoned himself with cantharides; he behaved in a factious manner as tribune, and was
          also thought to have assassinated Publius Africanus. <note n="2" anchored="true">See Vol.
            ii., p.215. C. Papirius <foreign xml:lang="la">Carbo</foreign>, a friend and supporter
            of Tib. Gracchus, and one of the commissioners (after the death of Tiberius) for

          </note> who was put to death by my friend Pompey at Lilybaeum, there was never, in my
          opinion, a greater scoundrel. Even his father, on being accused by M. Antonius, is thought
          to have escaped condemnation by a dose of shoemaker's vitriol. Wherefore my opinion is
          that you should revert to the patrician Papirii: you see what a bad lot the plebeians
          were. <pb n="141"/>

        <p> I assure you<note n="1" anchored="true">Q Ligarius, who had as the <foreign

            exiled. His brothers tried to secure his recall, but the younger <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Tubero</foreign> brought a charge of <foreign xml:lang="la">majestas</foreign>
            against him, on which Cicero defended him. See letter CCCCLXXXVII. </note> that I am
          employing every effort and all my care and zeal in securing your recall<note n="2"
            anchored="true">November September before Caesar's rectification of the calendar.
            Besides the usual intercalary month of twenty-three days inserted at the end of
            February, two months of sixty-seven days in all were intercalated between the last day
            of November and the first of December. This year thus consisted of four hundred and
            forty-five days. </note> . For, to say nothing of the fact that I have always been
          deeply attached to you, the signal loyalty and love of your brothers, who have the same
          place as yourself in the warmest feelings of my heart, suffer me to neglect no task or
          opportunity of displaying my fidelity and zeal towards you. But what I am doing and have
          done for you, I prefer your learning from their letters rather than from mine. But what my
          hopes are, or what I feel confident of, and consider as certain in regard to your recall,
          that I wish you to be informed of by myself. For if there is anyone who is nervous in
          matters of moment and danger, and who is always more inclined to fear a reverse than to
          hope for success, I am that man, and if it is a fault, I confess that I am not without it.
          However, on the fifth day before the Kalends of the first intercalary month, I went at the
          request of your brothers to wait on Caesar at his morning reception, and endured all the
          humiliation and bore of securing an entrée and an inter-view with him. When your brothers
          had thrown themselves at his feet, and I had said what the merits of the case and your
          position demanded, I went away with a <pb n="142"/> conviction—gathered not only from the
          tone of Caesar's reply, which was gentle and courteous, but also from his eyes and
          expression, and many other signs besides, which it was easier to observe than it is to
          write—that I need have no doubt about your recall. Wherefore be sure you keep up your
          spirit and courage, and as you bore the stormiest times with philosophy, meet calmer
          weather with cheerfulness. However, I will attend to your business as though it were one
          of the most difficult possible: and on your behalf, as I have already done, I will with
          all the pleasure in life present my supplications not only to Caesar, but also to all his
          friends, whom I have learnt to be warmly attached to myself. Good-bye. </p>

        <p> C. Curtius Mithres is in fact, as you know, a freedman of my very intimate friend
          Postumus, but he pays me as much attention and respect as he does his own patron himself.
          At Ephesus, as often as I was in that town, his house was as open to me as my own, and
          many things occurred which gave me occasion to learn his affection and fidelity to myself.
          Accordingly, if either I or any of my friends had occasion for anything in Asia, it has

          and means as though they were my own. I tell you this at the greater length, to make you

        <p> Manius Curius, <note n="1" anchored="true">For this man's services to <foreign

            >Patrie</foreign>, see vol. ii. pp. 210-222. </note> who has a bank at Patrae has given
          me many weighty reasons for being attached to him. My friendship with him is of very old
          standing, dating from his first entrance into public life: and at Patrae on many previous
          occasions, and particularly during the late unhappy war, his house was put entirely at my
          disposal, and if there had been any occasion, I should have used it as my own. But my
          strongest tie to him is of what I may call a more sacred, obligation- is that he is a very
          close friend of my friend Atticus, and distinguishes him above everybody by his attentions
          and affection. If you are by any chance already acquainted with him, I think that I am too
          late in doing what I am now doing. For he is so cultivated and polite a <pb n="154"/> man,
          that I should regard him as already sufficiently recommended to you by his own Character.
          Yet, if this is so, I beg you earnestly that any inclination, which you have already
          conceived for him before getting my letter, may be enhanced to the highest possible degree
          by my recommendation. But if; owing to his retiring character, he has not put himself in
          your way or you have not yet become sufficiently acquainted with him, or if there is any
          reason of any sort for his wanting a warmer recommendation, I hereby recommend him to you,
          with a zeal as great and for reasons as sound as I could have for recommending anyone in
          the world. And I shall be acting in this as those are bound to act who recommend
          conscientiously and disinterestedly: for I shall be pledging my word to you, or rather I
          do hereby pledge my word and take upon me to promise, that the character of Manius Curius,
          and his culture no less than his honesty, are of such a nature that, if once he becomes
          known to you, you will think him deserving of your friendship and of such an earnest
          recommendation. I, at any rate, shall be exceedingly gratified, if I find that this letter
          has had the weight with you which, as I write, I feel confident that it will have. </p>

        <p> I WILL not allow that your most kind and courteous letter to Atticus—whom I see to be
          transported with delight-was more gratifying to him than to myself. For, though it was
          almost equally pleasing to us both, yet I was the more struck with admiration of the two.
          You would, of course, have made a courteous answer to Atticus if asked, or at least
          reminded: but (as for my part I never doubted that you would do) you spontaneously wrote
          to him, and, without his expecting it, offered him so warm an expression <pb n="155"/> of
          goodwill. <note n="1" anchored="true">We know that <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Atticus</foreign> had many transactions with towns in the <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Peloponnese</foreign>, and he probably required the countenance of Sulpicius, as
            governor of <foreign xml:lang="la">Achaia</foreign>, to get his interest on capital paid
            (vol. i., pp.57, 60, 66). </note> On this subject not only ought I not to ask you to be
          more zealous in that respect for my sake also—for nothing could go beyond your
          promises—but I should be wrong even to thank you, since you have acted for his own sake
          and on your own initiative. However, I will say this, that I am exceedingly gratified at
          what you have done. For such appreciation on your part of a man who has a place apart in
          my affections cannot fail to be supremely delightful to me: and, that being so, it of
          course excites my gratitude. But all the same, since considering our intimacy a faux pas
          in writing to you is allowable to me, I will do both the things that I said that I ought
          not to do. In the first place, to what you have shewn that you will do for the sake of
          Atticus I would have you make as large an addition as our mutual affection can suggest: in
          the second place, though I said just now that I feared to thank you, I now do so outright:
          and I would wish you to believe that, under whatever obligations you place Atticus,
          whether in regard to his affairs in Epirus or elsewhere, I shall consider myself to be
          equally bound to you by them. </p>

        <p> WITH Lyso of Patrae <note n="2" anchored="true">The doctor at <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Patrae</foreign> who attended <foreign xml:lang="la">Tiro</foreign>. See vol. ii.,
            p.209. </note> I have indeed a long-standing tie ot hospitality—a tie which, I think,
          ought to be conscientiously maintained. That is a position shared by many others: but I
          never was so intimate with any other foreigner, and that intimacy has been so much
          enhanced both by many services <pb n="156"/> on his part and by an almost daily
          intercourse, that nothing could now be closer than ours is. He stayed a year at Rome
          almost living in my house, and though we were in great hopes that, in consequence of my
          letter and recommendation, you would take great pains in doing what you have actually
          done, namely, protect his property and fortune in his absence; yet, as everything was in
          the power of one man, and as Lyso had been engaged on our side and was under our
          protection, we were in daily dread of something happening. However, his own brilliant
          character, and the zeal of myself and others of his hosts, have secured all that we wished
          from Caesar, as you will learn from Caesar's despatch to you. <milestone unit="para"/>In
          view of this, I not only do not in any way abate the earnestness of my recommendation to
          you, on the ground of having now got everything we wanted, but I rather urge all the more
          strongly that you should admit him to your confidence and intimacy. When his position was
          less secure I pressed you on the point with rather less boldness, being afraid that
          something might happen to him of a nature beyond even your power to remedy. Now that his
          pardon is secured, I ask you with the greatest earnestness and anxiety to do all you can.
          Not to go into details, I commend his whole establishment to you, and among them his young
          son, whom. my client Cn. Maenius Gemellus, having been during his exile made a citizen of
          Patrae, adopted according to the laws of the town. Pray therefore support his legal claim
          to the inheritance. The main point is that you should admit Lyso, whom I have found to be
          a most excellent and grateful man, to your society and friendship. If you do so, I do not
          doubt that, in shewing him affection and in afterwards recommending him to other people,
          you will come to the same conclusion about him and entertain the same feeling towards him
          that I do. I am very eager that you should do this, but I am also afraid lest, if you
          shall appear to have done less than the very best for him in some particular, he should
          think that I have not written earnestly enough, rather than that you have forgotten me.
          How much you value me he has had the opportunity of learning both from our everyday
          conversations and from your letters. <pb n="157"/>

        <p> M. Aemilius Avianius has always from his earliest manhood shewn me attention and
          affection. He is both a good and cultivated man, and worthy of your favour in every kind
          of employment. If I had thought that he was at Sicyon, and had I not been told that he was
          still staying where I left him at Cibyra, there had been no necessity for my writing at
          any greater length to you about him. For he would of himself have secured your affection

          he enjoys mine and that of all his other friends. But as I suppose him to be away, I

          property, especially his freedman C. Avianius Hammonius, whom indeed I commend to you on
          his own account also. For, while he has earned my esteem by his remarkable loyalty and
          fidelity to his patron, he has also done me personally some valuable services, and stood
          by me in the time of my greatest distress with a fidelity and affection as great as though
          I had myself liberated him. Accordingly, I beg you to support Hammonius for himself; as
          well as in his patron's business, and to go so far as to like and reckon among your
          friends both his agent, whom I am commending to you, and Avianius himself. You will find

        <p> I am very fond of T. Manlius, a banker at Thespiae; for he always paid me respect, and
          was most constant in his attentions, and has besides some taste for our branch of
          learning. I may add that Varro Murena <note n="1" anchored="true">A. Licinius <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Murena</foreign> was adopted by Terentius <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Varro</foreign>, and was thus called A. Terentius <foreign xml:lang="la">Varro
              Murena</foreign>. His sister <foreign xml:lang="la">Terentia</foreign> was wife of
            Maecenas, and his brother was Proculeius, celebrated for his liberality by Horace (Odes,
            2.2). His augurship is honoured by another ode of Horace (iii. 19), who also gave him a
            hint as to the rashness which seems to have led to his ruin in <date when="-0022">B.C.
              22</date>, the year after his consulship, when he was implicated with Fannius Caepio
            in a plot against Augustus (<bibl n="Hor. Carm. 2.10">Horace, Od. 2.10</bibl>; <bibl
              n="Suet. Aug. 19">Suet. Aug. 19</bibl>; Tib. 8; Dio, 54, 3). </note> is very desirous

          a letter of his own in which he had commended Manlius to you, some additional advantage
          would be gained by a recommendation from me. For myself; both my intimacy with Manlius and
          Varro s eagerness have induced me to write to you as seriously as <pb n="159"/> I could.
          You will therefore do me a very great favour, if you will regard this recommendation as
          one calling for your utmost consideration, that is, if you will assist and honour Titus
          Manlius in the highest degree in every way consistent with your honour and character.

          reap all the benefit you are accustomed to expect from good men's services. </p>

        <p> I am very intimate with L. Cossinius, your friend and fellow tribesman. For not only is

          Cossinius is attached to me, and especially his freedman L. Cossinius Anchialus, a man who
          possesses the high esteem both of his patron and his patron's friends, of whom I am one. I
          recommend him to you as I would a freedman of my own, and as though he held the same

        <p> As it gave me great pleasure before to find that you had remembered my earnest
          recommendation of Lyso, my host and friend, so also, when I found from his letter that he
          had been the object of your undeserved suspicion, I was exceedingly rejoiced that I had
          been so earnest in recommending him. For he writes me word that my recommendation has been
          of the greatest assistance to him, as he says that a report had been brought you of his
          being in the habit of speaking disrespectfully of you at Rome. And though he writes word
          that your good nature and kindness of heart have enabled him to clear himself on that
          point, yet, first of all, as in duty bound, I thank you warmly that my letter has had such
          influence with you as to cause you on its perusal to lay aside all that irritating
          suspicion which you had entertained of Lyso. In the next place, I would have you believe
          me, when I assert that I write this not more in the name of Lyso than of everybody
          else—that no one has ever mentioned you except in the terms of the highest respect. As for
          Lyso, indeed, while he was with me every day and almost lived with me, not only because he
          thought that I liked hearing it, but also because it gave him still more pleasure to say
          it himself; he used to speak to me in praise of everything you did and said. Wherefore,
          though he is now being treated by you in a way that makes a recommendation from me
          unnecessary, and makes him think that he has got all he wants by means of one letter from
          me, yet I do beg of you with no common earnestness to continue to receive him with
          kindness and liberality. I would have written a description of his character, as I did in
          my previous letter, had I not thought that by this time he was sufficiently well known to

            That Sulpicius should be asked to protect a man in Thessaly, as before he was asked to

        <p> My connexion with L. Mescinius is that which arises from the fact that he was my
          quaestor. But this tie—which I, in accordance with the usage of antiquity, have ever
          regarded as a strong one—he has rendered more complete by his personal excellence and
          kindness. Accordingly, nothing could more intimate and more pleasant to myself than my <pb
            n="162"/> intercourse with him. Now, although he seemed to feel certain that you would
          be pleased to do all you honourably could for him for his own sake, he yet hoped that a
          letter from me would also have great weight with you. He judged that to be the case for
          himself; but as he was very intimate with me he had also often heard me say how delightful
          and close our union was. I ask you, therefore, with all the earnestness with which you
          understand that I ought to ask on behalf of a man so near and dear to me, to facilitate
          and settle the business matters which he has in Achaia arising from the fact 'of his being
          the heir of his cousin M. Mindius, late a banker at Elis, not only by your legal
          prerogative and authority, but also by your influence and advice. For I have directed
          ,those to whom I have intrusted my business, that in all 'points which give rise to
          dispute, they were to appeal to you as arbitrator and—so far as was consistent with your
          convenience—as final judge. That you should in compliment to me undertake that business, I
          earnestly and repeatedly beg of you. There is one other point in which you will
          particularly oblige me, if you don't think it inconsistent with your position; it is that,
          as the controversy is with a senator, you should refer to Rome such of the parties as
          prove too stubborn to allow the business to be settled without an issue being tried. <note

            for the <foreign xml:lang="la">ecdici</foreign> sent to Rome on such appeal business.
            The system of thus removing the venue of such cases was, of course, open to abuse; but
            it must often have been more satisfactory than trusting to the local courts, especially
            when the governor was corrupt or tyrannically disposed. </note> That you might be able
          to do that with the less hesitation, I have secured a despatch to you from the consul M.
          Lepidus, not conveying any order—for that I did not think consonant with your position—but
          to a certain extent and in a manner commendatory. I would have mentioned how well invested
          such a favour is sure to be in the case of Mescinius, had I not, in the first place, felt
          certain that you knew, and had I not also been asking for myself: for I would have you
          believe that I am quite as anxious about his interests as he is himself. But while I am
          eager that he should come by his own without difficulty, I am also anxious that he should
          think that he owes his success in no small degree to my recommendation. <pb n="163"/>

        <p> I FREQUENTLY send you letters of this kind, which are replicas of each other, in
          thanking you for paying such prompt attention to my letters of introduction. I have done
          so in the cases of others and shall often, as I see, have occasion to do so again.
          Nevertheless I will not spare labour, and, as you jurisconsults are in the habit of doing
          in your formulae, I will in my letters "state the same case in a different manner." Well
          then, C. Avianius Hammonius has written to me with profuse thanks in his own name and in
          .that of his patron Aemilius Avianius, saying that neither he him self; who was on the
          spot, nor the property of his absent patron, could have been treated with greater
          liberality or consideration. That was gratifying to me for the sake of those whom I had
          recommended to you, induced thereto by our very close friendship and union—for M. Aemilius
          is one of my most intimate and closest friends, a man eminently attached and bound to me
          by great services on my part, and about the most grateful of all those who appear to be
          under some obligation to me. But it is much more gratifying that you should be so disposed
          towards me as to do more for my friends than I perhaps could have done if I had been on
          the spot, I presume, because I should have been more doubtful what to do for their sake,
          than you are what to do for mine. But this I do not doubt—that you feel that you have
          obliged me. I only ask you to believe that those persons also are grateful: I pledge you
          my word and solemnly assert that it is so. Wherefore pray do your best that, whatever
          business they have on hand, they may get it settled whilst you still governing Achaia. I
          am living on the pleasantest and most harmonious terms with your son Servius, and derive
          great pleasure from his natural abilities and signal industry, as well as from his
          virtuous and straightforward character. <pb n="164"/>

        <p> THOUGH I take pleasure in asking you for anything that any one of my friends requires,
          yet I take much greater in thanking you, when you have done something on my
          recommendation, as you are always doing. For it is beyond belief what thanks I get from
          all, even from those who have been recommended by me to you with only moderate warmth.
          Every instance gives me gratification, but none 30 much as that of L. Mescinius. For he
          told me that directly you had read my letter you promised his agents all they wanted, and
          have in fact been much better than your word. In that matter therefore—for I think I ought
          to say it again and again—I would have you believe that I am excessively obliged to you. I
          am, indeed, all the more delighted at this, because I see clearly that you will get the
          highest pleasure from Mescinius himself. For he is not only a man of virtue and
          uprightness, very serviceable and exceedingly attentive, but he has also the same literary
          pursuits as ourselves, which in old times were our recreation, but now are life itself.
          For the future I would have you supplement your kindnesses to him in all things consonant
          with your character. There are two things which I ask of you specifically: first, that if
          any undertaking has to be given "against farther claims on that head," you would see to
          its being given on my security: and, in the second place, seeing that his inheritance
          consists almost entirely of the property appropriated by Oppia, who was once Mindius's
          wife, that you should give your assistance and concert measures for bringing her over to
          Rome. If she thinks that is going to be done, in my opinion, we shall settle the business.
          I beg you again and again to enable us to do that. What I said above I now solemnly
          confirm and take upon myself to guarantee—that you will <pb n="165"/> find what you have
          done in the past and are going to do in the future for the sake of Mescinius so well
          invested, as to convince you that you have bestowed your kindness on the most grateful,
          the most delightful man in the world. For this is the addition which I desire to what you
          have done for my sake. </p>

        <p> I DO not think, on the one hand, that the Lacedaemonians doubt being sufficiently
          recommended to your honour and justice by their own and their ancestors' reputation, and
          I, on the other, knowing you as well as I do, had no doubt of the rights and deserts of
          the several nations being thoroughly well known to you. Accordingly, when Philippus the
          Lacedaemonian begged me to recommend the city to you, though I remembered that I was under
          all sorts of obligations to it, I nevertheless answered that Lacedaemonians needed no
          recommendation with you. Accordingly, I would have you believe that, considering the
          disturbed state of the times, I look upon all the cities of Achaia as being happy in
          having you as their governor; and that I also think that, knowing thoroughly as you do not
          only our own records but also all those of Greece, you are and will be a friend to the
          Lacedaemonians. Wherefore I only ask this of you, that, when you do for the Lacedaemonians
          what your honour, high position, and justice shall demand, you should let them know—if you
          think it right—that you are not other-wise than glad to find that what you are doing is
          gratifying to me also. For it affects my loyalty that they should think that I am
          attentive to their interests. I again and again urge this upon you with warmth. <pb

        <p> DEMOCRITUS of Sicyon is not only my guest-firend, but also very intimate with me, as is

            to mutual entertainment, not necessarily implying intimacy. For Cicero's view as to
            intimacy with Greeks, see vol. 1., p.127. </note> especially if they are Greeks. For his
          honesty and virtue are of the highest kind, and he is exceedingly liberal and attentive to
          his guest-friends, and distinguishes me above the rest by his respect, attentions, and
          affection. You must regard him as the leading man not only of his fellow citizens, but
          almost of all Achaia. For such a man I do no more than open the door and pave the way to
          an acquaintance with you: when you once know him, your natural disposition is such that
          you will decide him to be worthy of your friendship and society. What I ask of you, then,
          is that on reading this letter you should accord him your patronage, and promise to do
          everything for him for my sake. For the rest, if; as I feel sure will be the case, you
          ascertain him to be deserving of your friendship and society, I ask you to receive him
          with open arms, to love him, and to regard him as one of your own family. That will be a
          more than common favour to me. Good-bye. </p>

          to you with an earnestness beyond which I cannot go in recommending anyone. Gaius Avianius
          is in Sicily; Marcus is with us. I beg you to promote the social standing of the former,
          who is with you, and to defend the property of both. You cannot oblige me more by anything
          you do in your province. I beg you warmly and repeatedly to do so. </p>

        <p> LARGUS, who is devoted to you, having told me that the 1st of January was the limit
          fixed for you, and having my-self noticed that any ordinance made by Balbus and Oppius in
          Caesar's absence was usually ratified by him, I urged upon them with warmth to grant me as
          a favour that you should be permitted to remain in Sicily as long as we wished. Though
          they have been in the habit of freely promising me anything which was not calculated to
          hurt the feelings of that party, or even of refusing it and giving a reason for their
          refusal, to this request or rather demand of mine they gave no immediate answer. However,
          they came to see me again the same day: they granted me permission for you to remain in
          Sicily as long as you chose: they said that they would answer for your not prejudicing
          your interests at all by doing so. Now, since you know what you have licence to do, I
          think you ought to know what my Opinion is. After this business had been settled I
          received a letter from you asking my advice as to whether you should settle in Sicily, or
          go to look after the remains of your <pb n="168"/> business in Asia. This deliberation on
          your part did not appear to me to tally with the words of Largus. For in his conversation
          with me he had implied that you were forbidden to stay in Sicily: you, on the other hand,
          are deliberating, as though the permission had been given. But, for my part, whether the
          former or the latter is the case, I am for your staying in Sicily. The nearness of the
          locality is of advantage, either for securing your recall, because of the frequency of
          letters and messengers, or for a rapid return, when either that point, as I hope it will
          be, is gained or some other plan arranged. Therefore I am strongly in favour of your
          staying. I will be very earnest in recommending you to T. Furfanius Postumus, who is a
          friend of mine, and to his legates, who are also friends, when they come here: at present
          they are all at Mutina. They are excellent men, fond of men like you, and on intimate
          terms with me. Whatever occurs to me that I think likely to be to your advantage, I will
          do without being asked: if there is anything I don't know, at the first hint of it I will
          surpass the zeal of everybody. Although I shall speak to Furfanius personally about you in
          such a way as to render a letter from me to him quite unnecessary for you, yet, as your
          relations have decided that you should have a letter of mine to give him, I have complied
          with their wish. I append a copy of the letter. </p>

        <p> No intimacy or friendship could be closer than that which I have always had with Aulus
          Caecina. For I was constantly in the society of that illustrious and gallant man his
          father: and my affection for this man also from his childhood has been such as to make the
          intimacy between us close as it is possible to have with anyone-partly <pb n="169"/>
          because he seemed to me to give great promise of supreme excellence, honesty, and
          eloquence; and partly because he lived with me in the most complete sympathy, not only
          from our mutual services of friendship, but also from a community of literary tastes. I
          need not write at greater length. How bound I am to protect his safety and property by
          every means in my power you see. It only remains, since I know from many circumstances
          what your sentiments are as to the fortune of the loyalists and the disasters to the
          Republic, that I should beg nothing of you except that to the goodwill, which you are sure
          spontaneously to entertain towards him, there may be added a supplement proportionate to
          the value which I know you have for me. You cannot oblige me more than by doing this.

        <p> Though of all the world I am by far the least fitted to offer you<note n="1"
            anchored="true">We cannot tell which of the <foreign xml:lang="la">Titii</foreign>, of
            whom several occur in the correspondence, this is, nor when the letter was written. The
            mention of the pestilential year might tempt us to put it in <date when="-0043">B.C.
              43</date> (Dio, 45, 17); but then pestilences were frequent in Rome, and the general
            tone in regard to public affairs seems rather in unison with the other letters of <date
              when="-0046">B.C. 46</date>, and one would have expected some allusion to his own loss
            if it had been written after Tullia's death. The letter has the air of a"commonplace," a
            sort of model of ordinary condolence: "One writes that 'other friends remain': That
            'loss is common to the race': And common is the commonplace, And vacant chaff well meant
            for grain." </note> consolation, because your sorrow has caused me so much pain that I
          needed consolation myself; yet since my sorrow was farther removed from the acuteness of
          the deepest grief than your own, I have resolved that our close connexion and my warm
          feelings for you make it <pb n="170"/> incumbent on me not to be so long silent in what
          causes you such deep mourning, but to offer some reasonable consolation such as may
          suffice to lighten, if it could not wholly heal your sorrow. Now there is a source of
          consolation-hackneyed indeed to the last degree—which we ought ever to have on our lips
          and in our hearts: we should remember that we are men, born under the conditions which
          expose our life to all the missiles of fortune; and we must not decline life on the
          conditions under which we were born, nor rebel so violently under mischances which we are
          unable to avoid by any precautions; and by recalling what has happened to others we should
          reflect that nothing strange has betided us. But neither these, nor other sources of
          consolation, which have been employed by the greatest philosophers and have been recorded
          in literature, ought, it seems, to be of so much avail, as the position of the state
          itself and the disruption of these evil times, which make those the happiest who have
          never had children, and those who have lost them at such a crisis less miserable than if
          they had done so when the Republic was in a good state, or indeed had any existence at
          all. But if your own loss affects you, or if you mourn at the thought of your own
          position, I do not think that you will find that grief easy to remove in its entirety. If
          on the other hand what wrings your heart is grief for the miserable fate of those who have
          fallen—a thought more natural to an affectionate heart—to say nothing of what I have
          repeatedly read and heard, that there is no evil in death, after which if any sensation
          remains it is to be regarded as immortality rather than death, while if it is all lost, it
          follows that nothing must be regarded as misery which is not felt-yet this much I can
          assert, that confusions are brewing, disasters preparing and threatening the Republic,
          such that whoever has left them cannot possibly, as it seems to me, be in the wrong. For
          what place is there now, I don't say for conscience, uprightness, virtue, right feeling,
          and good qualities, but for bare freedom and safety? By Heaven, I have never been told of
          any young man or boy having died in this most unhealthy and pestilent year, who did not
          seem to me to be rescued by the immortal gods from the miseries of this world and from a
          most intolerable condition of life. Wherefore, if this one idea can be <pb n="171"/>
          removed from your mind, so as to convince you that no evil has happened to those you
          loved, your grief will have been very much lessened. For there will then only be left that
          single strain of sorrow which will not be concerned with them, but will have reference to
          yourself alone: in regard to which it is not consonant with a high character and wisdom
          such as you have displayed from boyhood, to show excessive sorrow for a misfortune that
          has befallen you, when it does not at all involve misery or evil to those whom you have
          loved. In fact, the qualities you have displayed both in private and public business
          entail the necessity of preserving your dignity and supporting your character for
          consistency. For that which length of time is sure to bring us of itself—which removes the
          bitterest sorrows by the natural process of decay—we ought to anticipate by reflexion and
          wisdom. Why, if there never was a woman so weak-minded on the death of her children, as
          not sooner or later to put a period to her mourning, certainly we men ought to anticipate
          by reflexion what lapse of time is sure to bring, and not to wait for a cure from time,
          when we can have it on the spot from reason. If I have done you any good by this letter, I
          think that I have accomplished a desirable object: but if by chance it has been of no
          avail, I hold that I have done the duty of one who wishes you all that is best and loves
          you very dearly. Such a one I would have you think that I have been, and believe that I
          shall be to you in the future. </p>

            command of Caesar's fleet before <date when="-0046">B.C. 46</date>, but had then ceased

            which, though not a regular province-being generally attached either to Macedonia or (as
            in Caesar's case) to Gaul—was during this period made subject to a separate command. It

            letter toVatinius in <date when="-0045">B.C. 45</date>, against all MSS. </note>,
          imperator. Though in these times it is not my <pb n="172"/> custom to appear often in the

          the honour proposed for you, with due regard to the claims of our old friendship and of
          the many acts of kindness that have passed between us. Accordingly, I attended and had
          great pleasure in voting for the supplicatio in your honour, nor in the future will I at
          any time fail to support your interests, character, or public position. So, that your
          family may be aware of this feeling of mine towards you, pray write and tell them that in
          anything you need they should not hesitate to inform me of it as a matter of right.
            <milestone unit="para"/>I strongly commend Marcus Bolanus to you as an excellent and
          gallant man, highly accomplished in every way, and an old friend of my own. You will much
          oblige me if you will take care to make him understand that this introduction has been of
          great service to him. He will himself convince you of his excellent character and grateful
          disposition: and I promise you that you will reap great pleasure from his friendship.
            <milestone unit="para"/>Once more I beg you with more than common earnestness, in the
          name of our friendship and your unbroken zeal in my service, to bestow some pains on the
          following matter also. Dionysius, a slave of mine who had the care of my library, worth a
          large sum of money, having purloined a large number of books, and thinking that he could
          not escape punishment, absconded. He is in your province: my friend Marcus Bolanus and
          many others saw him at Narona; but they believed his assertion that I had given him his
          freedom. If you would take the trouble to restore this man to me, I can't tell you how
          much obliged I shall be to you. It is a small matter in itself; yet my vexation is
          serious. Bolanus will inform you where he is and what can be done. If I recover the man by

              Trebonius.</note>During this year Cicero remained at Rome or some of his country
            villas, till the death of his daughter Tullia after childbirth. In deep grief he retired
            to Astura, where he sought consolation partly in prosecuting a design for building a
            temple in her memory, partly in writing. He produced a Consolatio, and the two
            treatises, de Finibus and Academica (the latter first in two books, afterwards
            rearranged in four). He also projected, but did not carry out, a treatise on the
            reconstruction of the constitution, to be addressed to Caesar. In December of the
            previous year Caesar had started for Spain to attack the Pompeian army commanded by
            Gnaeus and Sextus Pompeius. The victory of Munda (17th March) and the subsequent death
            of Gnaeus seemed to settle the question of Spain—though the opposition under Sextus
            Pompeius survived many years—and Caesar returned to Rome in October. Much of the
            correspondence of this year concerns Cicero's grief for his daughter. When he touches on
            political affairs, however, his discontent with the Caesarian government and general
            policy is made very evident. </p>

            Messrs. Tyrrell and Purser and Mueller place it. Caesar only left Rome for Spain on the
            2nd of December, and Cicero could hardly have been expecting news so soon. Moreover,
            Cassius—who declined to accompany Caesar to Spain—seems to have gone on his tour in the

        <p> I think you must be a little ashamed at this being the third letter inflicted on you
          before I have a page or a syllable from you. But I will not press you: I shall expect, or
          rather exact, a longer letter. For my part, if I had a messenger always at hand, I should
          write even three an hour. For somehow it makes you seem almost present when I write
          anything to you, and that not "by way of phantoms of images," as your new friends express
          it, <note n="2" anchored="true">The Epicureans. The Greek terms which follow are those
            used by them-<foreign xml:lang="grc">kat' ei)dw/lwn fantasi/as</foreign>, "according to

              fantasi/as</foreign>, "mental impressions." These refer to the doctrines of Democritus
            as to the formation of mental impressions by fine atoms thrown off the surface of
            things, which, retaining the same position and relation, and hurrying through the void,
            strike the senses, which convey these "atom-pictures" to the mind. Cicero hits the true
            objection, founded on the fact that we can recall these pictures at will. </note> who
          hold that "mental pictures" are caused by what Catius called "spectres"—for I must remind
          you that Catius Insuber the Epicurean, lately dead, calls "spectres" what the famous <pb
            n="175"/> Gargettius, and before him Democritus, used to call "images." Well, even if my
          eyes were capable of being struck by these "spectres," because they spontaneously run in
          upon them at your will, I do not see how the mind can be struck. You will be obliged to
          explain it to me, when you return safe and sound, whether the "spectre" of you is at my
          command, so as to occur to me as soon as I have taken the fancy to think about you; and
          not only about you, who are in my heart's core, but supposing I begin thinking about the
          island of Britain—will its image fly at once into my mind? But of this later on. I am just
          sounding you now to see how you take it. For if you are angry and annoyed, I shall say
          more and demand that you be restored to the sect from which you have been ejected by
          "violence and armed force." <note n="1" anchored="true">From the Stoic sect. </note> In an
          injunction of this sort the words "within this year" are not usually added. Therefore,

          so. And yet to whom am I speaking? It is to you, the most gallant of men, who ever since
          you entered public life have done nothing that was not imbued to the utmost with the
          highest principle. In that very sect of yours I have a misgiving that there must be more
          stuff than I thought, if only because you accept it. "How did that come into your head?"
          you will say. Because I had nothing else to say. About politics I can write nothing: for I
          don't choose to write down my real opinions. </p>

        <p> FOR my book not having been delivered to you so quickly, forgive my timidity, and pity
          my position. My son, I am <pb n="176"/> told, was very much alarmed at the book <note

          being put in circulation, and with reason—since it does not matter so much in what spirit
          it is written, as in what spirit it is taken—for fear lest a stupid thing like that should
          stand in my light, and that too when I am still suffering for the sins of my pen. In that
          matter my fate has been a strange one: for whereas a slip of the pen is cured by erasure,
          and stupidity is punished by loss of reputation, my mistake is corrected by exile: though
          my greatest crime is having spoken ill of the enemy when engaged in active service. There
          was no one on our side, I presume, who did not pray for victory for himself; no one who,
          even when offering sacrifice for something else, did not breathe a wish for Caesar's
          speedy defeat. If he imagines that not to be the case, he is a very fortunate man. If he
          does know it, and has no delusion on the subject, why be angry with a man who has written
          something against his views, when he has pardoned all those who offered every sort of
          petition to the gods against his safety? <milestone unit="para"/>But to return to my
          subject, the cause of my fear was this. I have written about you, on my honour, sparingly
          and timidly, not merely checking myself, but almost beating a retreat. Now everyone knows
          that this style of writing ought not merely to be free, but even vehement and lofty. One
          is thought to have a free hand in attacking another, yet you must take care not to fall
          into mere violence: it is not open to one to praise oneself, lest the result should be the
          vice of egotism: there is no other course than to praise the man, on whom any blame that
          you may cast is necessarily set down to weakness or jealousy. And I rather think that you
          will like it all the better, and think it more suited to your present position. For what I
          could not do in good style, it was in my power first of all not to touch upon, and, as
          next best, to do so as sparingly as possible. But after all I did check myself: I softened
          many phrases, cut out many, and a very large number I did not write down at all. Then, as
          in a ladder, if you were to remove some rounds, cut out others, leave some loosely
          fastened, you would be contriving the means of a fall, not preparing a way of ascent, just
          so <pb n="177"/> with a writer's genius: if it is at once hampered and frustrated by so
          many disadvantages, what can it produce worth listening to or likely to satisfy? When,
          indeed, I come to mention Caesar himself, I tremble in every limb, not from fear of his
          punishing, but of his criticising me. For I do not know Caesar thoroughly. What do you
          think of a courage that talks thus to itself? "He will approve of this: that expression is
          open to suspicion." "What if I change it to this? But I fear that will be worse." Well,
          suppose I am praising some one: "Shan't I offend him ?" Or when I am criticising some one
          adversely: "What if it is against his wish ?" "He punishes the pen of a man engaged in a
          campaign: what will he do to that of a man conquered and not yet restored ?" <milestone
            unit="para"/>You yourself add to my alarm, because in your Orator you shield yourself
          under the name of Brutus, <note n="1" anchored="true">In the Orator (§ 35) Cicero says
            that he wrote his <foreign xml:lang="la">Cato</foreign> at the instigation of <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign>. </note> and try to make him a party to your apology.
          When the universal "patron" does this, what ought I to do—an old client of yours, and now
          everyone's client? Amidst such misgivings therefore created by fear, and on the rack of
          such blind suspicion, when most of what one writes has to be adapted to what one imagines
          are the feelings of another, not to one's own judgment, I feel how difficult it is to come
          off successfully, though you have not found the same difficulty, because your supreme and
          surpassing genius has armed you for every eventuality. Nevertheless, I told my son to read
          the book to you, and then to take it away, or only to give it to you on condition that you
          would promise to correct it, that is, if you would give it a totally new complexion.
            <milestone unit="para"/>About my journey to Asia, though the necessity for my making it
          was very urgent, I have obeyed your commands. Why should I urge you to exert yourself for
          me? You are fully aware that the time has come when my case must be decided. There is no
          occasion, my dear Cicero, for you to wait for my son. He is a young man: he cannot from
          his warmth of feeling, or his youth, or his timidity, think of all necessary measures. The
          whole business must rest on you: you is all my hope. Your acuteness enables you to hit <pb
            n="178"/> upon the measures which Caesar likes, and which win his favour. Everything
          must originate with you, and be brought to the desired conclusion by you. You have great
          influence with Caesar himself, very great with all his friends. If you will convince
          yourself of this one thing, that your duty is not merely to do what you are asked—though
          that is a great and important thing—but that the whole burden rests on you, you will carry
          it through: unless—which I don't believe—my misfortunes make me too inconsiderate, or my
          friendship too bold, in placing this burden upon you. But your lifelong habits suggest an
          excuse for both: for from your habit of exerting yourself for your friends, your intimates
          have come not so much to hope for that favour at your hands, as to demand it as a right.
          As for my book, which my son will give you, I beg that you will not let it out of your
          hands, or that you will so correct it as to prevent it doing me any harm. </p>

        <p> EVERY time I see your son—and that is nearly every day—I promise him my zealous and
          active support, without any reserve as to labour, prior engagement, or time: but the
          exertion of my interest or favour with this reservation, "as far as I have the opportunity
          or power." Your book has been read and is still being read by me with attention, and kept
          under lock and key with the greatest care. Your prospects and fortunes are of the highest
          concern to me. They seem to me to grow brighter and less complicated every day: and I can
          see that many are much interested in them, of whose zeal, 'as well as of his own hopes, I
          feel certain that your son has written fully to you. But as to those particulars, in which
          I am reduced to conjecture, I do not take upon myself to profess greater <pb n="179"/>
          foresight than I am convinced that your own eyes and your own intelligence give you: but
          all the same, as it may. very well be that your reflexions on those points are somewhat
          agitated, I think it is incumbent upon me to explain my opinions. It is neither in the
          nature of things nor the ordinary revolutions of time that a position such as either your
          own or that of the rest should be protracted, or that so outrageous an injustice should be
          persistently maintained in so good a cause and in the case of such good citizens. In which
          matter, in addition to the hope which your own case gives me to a degree beyond the
          common—I don't mean only from your high position and admirable character, for these are
          distinctions which you share with others-there are the claims which brilliant genius and
          eminent virtue make peculiar to yourself. And to these, by Hercules, he in whose power we
          are allows much weight. Accordingly, you would not have remained even a moment in your
          present position, had it not been that he thought himself to have been insulted by
          precisely that accomplishment of yours, in which he takes delight. But this feeling is
          softening every day, and those who live with him hint to me, that this very opinion which
          he entertains of your genius will do you a great deal of good with him. Wherefore, in the
          first place, keep up your spirits and courage: for your birth, education, learning, and
          character in the world demand that you should do so. In the next place, entertain the most
          certain hopes for the reasons which I have given you. On my side, indeed, I would have you
          feel sure that everything I can do is most completely at your service and at that of your
          sons: for this is no more than our longstanding friendship, and my invariable conduct to
          my friends, and your many kindnesses to me demand. <pb n="180"/>

        <p> Immediately on the receipt of the letter from your servant Seleucus I sent a note to
          Balbus asking him what the provision of the law was. He answered that auctioneers in
          actual business were excluded from being municipal counsellors, retired auctioneers were
          not excluded. <note n="1" anchored="true">In the <foreign xml:lang="la">lex</foreign>

            that the law was not actually passed, as he would have been able to see for himself that
              <foreign xml:lang="la">qui faciet</foreign> would not exclude those who had followed
            these occupations in the past. He has to apply to Caesar's agent for information about
            it. Auctioneers were disliked—as brokers—because they had to do with confiscated
            property, as with ruined estates generally. See 2 Phil. 64, <foreign xml:lang="la">vox

          need not be alarmed, for it would have been intolerable, while those who were now acting

          auctioneers should be excluded from becoming counsellors in the municipal towns.
            <milestone unit="para"/>There is no news from Spain. However, it is ascertained to be
          true that Pompey has a great army: for Caesar has himself sent me a copy of a despatch
          from Paciaecus, in which the number was reckoned as eleven legions. Messalla has also
          written to Quintus Salassus to say that his brother Publius Curtius has been put to death
          by Pompey's order in the presence of the army, for having, as he alleged, made a compact
          with certain Spaniards, that if Pompey entered a particular town to get corn, they should
          arrest him and take him to Caesar. As to your business in regard to your being a guarantee

          </note> two letters from you, dated Corcyra. In one of these you congratulated me because
          you had heard, as you say, that I was enjoying my former position; in the other you said
          that you wished what I had done might turn out well and prosperously. Well, certainly, if
          they entertain honest sentiments on public affairs and to get good men to agree with them
          constitute a "position," then I do hold my position. But if "position" depends upon the
          power of giving effect to your opinion, or in fine of supporting it by freedom of speech,
          then I have not a trace of my old position left: and it is great good fortune if I am able
          to put sufficient restraint upon myself to endure without excessive distress what is
          partly upon us already and partly threatens to come. That is the difficulty in a war of
          this kind: its result shews a prospect of massacre on the one side, and slavery on the
          other. In this danger it affords me no little consolation to remember that I foresaw all
          this at the time when I was feeling greatly alarmed even at our successes-not merely at
          our reverses—and perceived at what immense risk the question of constitutional right was
          to be decided in arms. And if in that appeal to arms those had conquered, to whom, induced
          by the hope of peace and not the desire for war, I had given in my adhesion, I
          nevertheless was well aware how bloody the victory of men swayed by anger, rapacity, and
          overbearing pride was certain <pb n="183"/> to be: while if they had been conquered, what
          a clean sweep would be surely made of citizens, some of the highest rank, some too of the
          highest character, who, when I predicted these things and advised the measures best for
          their safety, preferred that I should be considered over-timid rather than moderately
          wise. <milestone unit="para"/>For your congratulations on what I have done, I am sure you
          speak your real wishes: but at such an unhappy time as this I should not have taken any
          new step, had it not been that at my return I found my domestic affairs in no better order
          than those of the state. For when, owing to the misconduct of those, to whom, considering
          my never-to-be-forgotten services, my safety and my fortune ought to have been their
          dearest object, I saw nothing safe within the walls of my house, nothing that was not the
          subject of some intrigue, I thought it was time to protect myself by the fidelity of new
          relations against the treachery of the old. But enough, or rather too much, about my own
          affairs. <note n="1" anchored="true">Cicero in this paragraph is referring to his divorce

        <p> I DID not venture to allow our friend Salvius to go without a letter to you; yet, by
          Hercules, I have nothing to say except that I love you dearly : <note n="1"
            anchored="true">An astonishing remark to a man whom Cicero's daughter had just divorced

          that <pb n="185"/> you do not doubt without my writing a word. In any case I ought rather
          to expect a letter from you, than you one from me. For there is nothing going on at Rome
          such as you would care to know: unless it would interest you to know that I am acting as
          arbitrator between our friend Nicias and Vidius! The latter puts forward in two lines, I
          think, a claim for money advanced to Nicias: the former, like a second Aristarchus,
          obelizes them. I am to be in the position of a critic of old days, and to judge whether
          they really are the poet's or are interpolations. I imagine you putting in here: "Have you
          forgotten, then, those mushrooms which you had at Nicias's dinner, and the big dishes
          joined to Septima's learned talk?" <note n="1" anchored="true">The text is corrupt, and we

          him, that Plancus Bursa <note n="2" anchored="true">For Bursa, see vol. i., p. 365. Cicero

          </note> may have some one to teach him his rudiments. <milestone unit="para"/>But what am

          as generally happens in war, are involved in some more important anxiety or occupation,
          yet I drift on farther and farther. So when I shall have ascertained for certain that you
          are in the vein for a laugh, I will write at greater length. However, I want you to know
          this, that the people have been very anxious about the death of Publius Sulla before they
          knew it for certain. Since then they have ceased to inquire how he perished: they think in
          knowing that they know enough. For the rest I bear it with equanimity: the only thing I

        <p> ROME (JANUARY) Though<note n="1" anchored="true">Aulus Manlius Torquatus was praetor in
              <date when="-0052">B.C. 52</date>, and presided at the trial of <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Milo</foreign>. He had supported Cicero at various times of difficulty (<foreign
              xml:lang="la">de</foreign> Fin. 2, § 72). </note> the universal upset is such that
          each man thinks his position the worst possible, and that there is no one who does not
          wish to be anywhere but where he is, yet I feel no doubt that at the present moment the
          most miserable place for a good man to be in is Rome. For though wherever any man is, he
          must have the same feeling and the same pang from the ruin that has overtaken the fortunes
          both of himself and of the state, yet, after all, one's eyes add to the pain, which force
          us to see what others only hear, <note n="2" anchored="true">Cicero had suggested just the
            reverse to Marcellus, p.184. </note> and do not allow us to turn our thoughts from our
          miseries. Therefore, though you must necessarily be pained by the absence of many objects,
          yet from that particular sorrow, with which I am told that you are specially
          overpowered—that you are not at Rome—pray free your mind. For though you must feel great
          uneasiness at being without your family and your surroundings, yet, after all, the objects
          of your regret are maintaining all their rights. They could not maintain them better, if
          you were here, nor are they in any special danger. Nor ought you, when thinking of your
          family, to demand any special favour of fortune for yourself, or to refuse to bear what is
          common to all. In regard to <pb n="187"/> yourself personally, Torquatus, your duty is to
          think over everything, but not to take counsel with despair or fear. For it is not the
          case that the man, who has as yet been harsher to you than your character deserved, has
          given no signs of softened feeling towards you. But, after all, that person himself, of
          whom your safety is being asked, is far from having the way to secure his own clear and
          plain before him. And while the results of all wars are uncertain, I perceive that from
          the victory of the one side there is no danger for you, seeing that such danger has
          nothing to do with the general overthrow, while from the victory of the other I feel sure
          that you yourself have never had any fear. I must therefore conclude that the very thing
          which I count as a consolation—the common danger to the state—is what is chiefly torturing
          you. That is an evil so great that, however philosophers may talk, I fear it admits of no
          real consolation being found, except that which is exactly proportioned to the strength
          and mettle of each man's mind. For if right thinking and right doing are sufficient to
          secure a good and happy life, I fear that it is impious to call a man miserable who can
          support himself by the consciousness of having acted on the best motives. For neither do I
          consider that we abandoned country and children and property at that time from the hope of
          the rewards of victory on the contrary, I think we were following a just and sacred duty,
          due at once to the Republic and our own honour-neither, at the time we did so, were we so
          mad as to feel certain of victory. Wherefore, if that has happened, of which, when we were
          entering upon the cause, the possibility was fully before us, we ought not to be crushed
          in spirit, as though something had happened which we never contemplated as possible. Let
          us then take the view, which reason and truth alike enjoin, that in this life we should
          not feel ourselves bound to guarantee anything except to do nothing wrong: and that, since
          we are free from that imputation, we should bear every misfortune incident to humanity
          with calmness and good temper. And so my discourse amounts to this, that, though all be
          lost, virtue should shew that she can after all support herself. But if there is some hope
          of a public recovery, you certainly ought not to be without your share in it, whatever the
          constitution of the future is to be. <pb n="188"/> And yet, as I write this, it occurs to
          me that I am the man whose despair you were wont to blame, and whom you used your
          influence to rouse from a state of hesitation and anxiety. It was at a time, indeed, when
          it was not the goodness of our cause, but the wisdom of our policy with which I was
          dissatisfied. For I saw that, when too late, we were opposing arms which had long before
          been rendered formidable by ourselves, and I grieved that a constitutional question should
          be settled by spears and swords, not by consultation and the weight of our influence. Nor,
          when I said that those things would occur, which actually did do so, was I divining the
          future. I was only expressing a fear lest what I saw to be possible and likely to be
          ruinous, if it did occur, should happen; especially as, if I had to promise one way or the
          other about the result and end of the campaign, what did actually occur would have been
          the more obvious promise for me to make. For the points in which we had the advantage were
          not those which appear on the field of battle, while in the use of arms and the vigour of
          our soldiers we were at a disadvantage. But pray shew the spirit now which you thought
          that I ought to have shewn then. I write this because on my making all sorts of inquiries
          about you from your freedman Philargyrus, he told me with feelings, as I thought, of the
          utmost devotion to you, that at times you were apt to be excessively anxious. You ought
          not to be so, nor to doubt either that, if any form of constitution is restored, you will
          have your due place in it, or that, if it is gone for ever, you will be in no worse
          position than the rest. The present position, indeed, which is one of alarm and suspense
          for us all, you ought to bear with the greater calm-ness of spirit from the fact that you
          are living in a city which gave birth to and fostered a systematic rule of life, and that
          you have with you in Servius Sulpicius one for whom you have always had a singular
          affection: one who no doubt consoles you by his kindness and wisdom; whose example and
          advice, if we had followed, we should have remained at peace under Caesar's supremacy,
          rather than have taken up arms and submitted to a conqueror. <milestone unit="para"/>But
          perhaps I have treated these points at too great a length: the following, which are more
          important, I will express more briefly. There is no one to whom I owe more <pb n="189"/>
          than to yourself. Those, to whom I was indebted to an extent of which you are aware, the
          result of this war has snatched from me. My position at the present moment I fully
          understand. But since there is no one so utterly prostrate as not to be able, if he gives
          his whole attention to what he is doing, to accomplish and carry out something, I should
          wish you to consider as deservedly at the service of yourself and your children, of course
          all my zeal, but also all my powers of counsel and action. </p>

        <p> IN my former letter I was somewhat lengthy, more from warmth of affection than because
          the occasion demanded it. For neither did your virtue require fortifying by me, nor were
          my own case and position of such a nature as to allow of my encouraging another when in
          want of every source of encouragement myself. On the present occasion I ought to he
          briefer. For if there was no need of so many words then, there is no more need of them
          now, or if there was need of them then, what I said is enough, especially as there has
          been nothing new to add. For though I am every day told some items of news, which I think
          are conveyed to you, yet the upshot is the same, as is also the result: a result which I
          see as clearly in my mind as what I actually see with my eyes; and yet in truth I see
          nothing that I am not well assured that you see also. For though no one can prophesy the
          result of a battle, yet the result of a war I can see: and if not that, yet at least
          this—since one or the other side must win—how victory on the one side or the other will be
          used. And having a clear grasp of this, what I see convinces me that no evil will occur,
          if that <pb n="190"/> shall have happened to me, even before, which is held out as the
          most formidable of all terrors. For to live on the terms on which one would then have to
          live, is a most miserable thing, while no philosopher has asserted death to be a miserable
          thing even for a prosperous man. But you are in a city in which the very walls of the
          houses seem capable of telling you these things, even at greater length and in nobler
          style. I assure you of this—though the miseries of others supply but a poor
          consolation—that you are now in no greater danger than anyone else, either of those who
          went away, <note n="1" anchored="true">I.e., from the Pompeian army after <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Pharsalia</foreign>. </note> or of those who remained. The one party are
          now in arms, the other in terror of the conqueror. But this, I repeat, is a poor
          consolation. There is another, which I hope you use, as I certainly do: I will never,
          while hive, let any-thing give me pain, so long as I have done nothing wrong: and if I
          cease to live, I shall cease to have any sensation. But to write this to you is again a

        <p> I have no news to give you, and if there is some after all, I know that you are usually
          informed of it by your family. About the future, however, difficult as it always is to
          speak, you may yet sometimes get nearer the truth by conjecture, when the matter is of the
          kind whose issue admits of being foreseen. In the present instance I think that I perceive
          thus much, that the war will not be a protracted one, though <pb n="191"/> even as to that
          there are some who think I am wrong. For myself, even as I write this, I believe that
          something decisive has occurred, not that I know it for certain, but because the
          conjecture is an easy one. For while all chances in war are open, and the results of all
          battles are uncertain, yet on this occasion the forces on both sides are so large, and are
          said to be in such a state of preparation for a pitched battle, that whichever of the two
          conquers it will be no matter of surprise. It is an opinion that grows daily stronger that
          even if there is considerable difference in the merits of the causes of the combatants,
          there will yet be little difference in the way in which they will use their victory. Of
          the one side we have now had a pretty full experience: of the other there is no one that
          does not reflect how much reason there is to fear an armed victor inflamed with rage.
            <milestone unit="para"/>On this point, if I appear to increase your anxiety while I
          ought to have been lightening it by consolation, I confess that I can find no consolation
          for our common disasters except that one, which after all—if you can avail yourself of
          it—is the highest and the one to which I have daily greater recourse: namely, that the
          consciousness of good intentions is the greatest consoler of misfortune, and that there is
          no serious evil except misconduct. As from this last we are so far removed, that our
          sentiments have been absolutely unimpeachable, while it is the result of our policy, not
          the policy itself, which is criticised: and as we have fulfilled all our obligations, let
          us bear what has happened without excessive grief. But I do not take upon myself, after
          all, to console you for misfortunes affecting all alike. Rightly to console them requires
          a greater intelligence, and to bear them requires unique courage. But anyone can easily
          shew you why you ought not to feel any sorrow peculiar to yourself. For as to Caesar's
          decision concerning your restoration, though he has been somewhat slower in relieving you
          than I had thought he would be, I have no doubt whatever. As to the other party, I do not
          think that you are at a loss to know my sentiments. Finally, there is the pain that you
          feel at being so long absent from your family. It is distressing, especially considering
          the character of your sons, than which nothing can be more charming. But, as I said in my
          last letter, the state of things is such that everyone <pb n="192"/> thinks his own
          position the most miserable of all, and most dislikes being precisely where he is. For my
          part, I consider that the most wretched of all are we who are at Rome, not merely because
          in all misfortunes it is more painful to see than to hear, but also because we are more
          exposed to all the risks of sudden perils, than if we were out of town. For myself
          however, who set up to console you, my feelings have become softened, not so much by
          literature, to which I have always been devoted, as by lapse of time. You remember how
          keen my sorrow was. In regard to that the first consolation is that I shewed greater
          foresight than the rest, when I desired to have peace on any terms however inequitable.
          And although this was from chance, and not from any prophetic powers of mine, yet I take
          pleasure in this poor reputation for wisdom. Another source of consolation common to us
          both is that, if I am called upon to end my life, I shall not be torn from a republic such
          as I should grieve to lose, especially as I shall then be beyond all consciousness. An
          additional consolation is my age and the fact that my life is now all but over, which both
          gives me pleasure in reflecting upon its honourably accomplished career, and forbids my
          fearing any violence at a period to which nature herself has now almost brought me.
          Lastly, considering what a great man, or rather what great men, fell in that war, it seems
          shameless to decline to share the same fortune, if circumstances render it necessary. For
          my part, I regard everything as possible for myself, nor is there any evil too great for
          me to believe to be hanging over my head. But since there is more evil in fear than in the
          thing itself which is feared, I cease to indulge in it, especially as that now hangs over
          me, in which there will not only be no pain, but also the end of all pain. But I have said
          enough, or rather more than was needed. It is not love of talking, however, but affection
          for you that makes my letters too long. I was sorry to hear that Servius had left Athens;
          for I do not doubt that your daily meeting, and the conversation of a man at once most
          intimate and of the highest character and wisdom have been a great alleviation to you.
          Pray keep up your spirits, as you ought and are accustomed to do, by your own virtue. For
          myself, I shall look after everything with zeal and diligence which I may think to be <pb
            n="193"/> in accordance with your wishes or for the interests of your self and your
          family. In doing so I shall imitate your goodness to me, I shall never equal your
          services. </p>

        <p> YOU have most unreasonable letter-carriers, though I am not personally angry with them.
          But, after all, when they are leaving me they demand a letter, when they come to me they
          bring none. And even as to the former, they would have consulted my convenience better if
          they had given me some interval for writing; but they come to me with their travelling
          caps on, declaring that their company is waiting for them at the city gate. Therefore you
          must pardon me: you shall have here another short note, but expect full details presently.
          Yet why should I apologize to you, when your men come to me with empty hands and return to
          you with letters. Here—for after all I will write something to you—we have the death of P.
          Sulla <note n="1" anchored="true">See p. 185. </note> the elder: according to some from an
          attack of footpads, according to others from an attack of indigestion. The people don't
          trouble themselves, for they are assured that he is dead and burnt. Your philosophy will
          enable you to bear this; though we have lost a well-known "feature of the city." People
          think that Caesar will be vexed for fear of his auctions becoming flat. Mindius Marcellus

        <p> If you are well, I am glad. There is nothing, by Hercules, that I more like doing on
          this tour of mine than writing to you: for I seem to be talking and joking with you in
          person. Nor does this Come to pass owing to Catius's "images" : <note n="4"
            anchored="true">See p.175; vol. i., p. 68. </note> for which expression I will in my
          next retort on you by quoting such a number of ill-educated Stoics, that you will
          acknowledge Catius to have been a true-born Athenian. That our friend Pansa left the city
          in military array with such expressions of goodwill from everybody, I rejoice both for his
          own sake and also, by Hercules, for the sake of all our party. For I hope that people will
          understand how odious cruelty is to everybody, and how attractive honesty <pb n="195"/>
          and clemency: and that the objects which bad men seek and desire above everything come
          spontaneously to the good. For it is difficult to persuade men that "the good is desirable
          for its own sake": but that "pleasure" and "peace of mind" <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)taraci/an</foreign>, a Stoic term. Cassius retorts on the

            best obtained by the Epicurean doctrines. </note> are obtained by virtue, justice, and
          "the good" is both true and convincing. In fact, Epicurus himself says-from whom all your
          Catiuses and Amafiniuses, those poor translators of his words, proceed—"to live pleasantly
          is impossible without living well and justly." So it is that Pansa, whose summum bonum is
          "pleasure," keeps his virtue; and those too who are called by you "pleasure-lovers" are
          "lovers of the good" and "lovers of the just," <note n="2" anchored="true">Cassius uses

          </note> and practise and maintain all the virtues. Accordingly Sulla, whose judgment we
          are bound to respect, seeing that philosophers disagreed, did not ask what was good, but
          bought up all goods indifferently: whose death, by Hercules, I have borne with some
          fortitude! Nor will Caesar, after all, allow us to feel his loss very long: for he has
          plenty of condemned persons to restore for us in his place, nor will he be without some
          one to bid at his auctions as long as Sulla's son is in his sight. <milestone unit="para"

        <p> C. SUBERNIUS of Cales is both my friend and very closely connected with Lepta, who is a
          very intimate friend of mine. Having for the express purpose of avoiding the war one to
          Spain with M. Varro before it began, with a view of being in a province in which none of
          us had thought that there was likely to be any war after the defeat of Afranius, <note

              when="-0049">B.C. 49</date>. See p. 1. </note> he found himself plunged into the
          precise evils which he had done his very best to avoid. For he was overtaken by a sudden
          war, which being set in motion by Scapula was afterwards raised to such serious
          proportions by Pompey, that it became impossible for him to extricate himself from that
          unhappy affair. <note n="2" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Baetica</foreign> and the legions there were disaffected to
            Caesar all along. They turned out Caesar's first governor, Cassius, and afterwards
            Trebonius. After Thapsus (<date when="-0046">B.C. 46</date>) they invited the surviving
            Pompeians to come to them, and meanwhile elected Titus Quintus Scapula and Quintus
            Afranius to command them. When Cn. and Sextus Pompeius and the other survivors of
            Thapsus arrived, the state of things became so serious that Caesar had to go to Spain
            himself. </note> M. Planius Heres, also of Cales, and also a very close friend of our
          friend Lepta, is in much the same position. These two men, therefore, I commend to your
          protection with a care, zeal, and heartfelt anxiety beyond which I cannot go in commending
          anyone. I wish it for their own sake, and in this matter I am also strongly influenced by
          motives of humanity no less than by friendship. For since Lepta is so anxious that his
          fortunes would seem to be at stake, I cannot but be in a state of anxiety next or even
          equal to his. Therefore, although I have often had proof of how much you loved me, yet I
          would have you be convinced that I shall have no better opportunity than this of judging
          that to be so. I therefore ask you, or, if you allow <pb n="197"/> it, I implore you to
          save from disfranchisement two unhappy men, who owe their loss of citizenship to
          fortune—which none can avoid-rather than to any fault of their own. Be so good as to allow
          me by your help to bestow this favour both on the men themselves, who are my friends, and
          also on the municipium of Cales, with which I have strong ties, and lastly upon Lepta,
          whom I regard more than all the rest. What I am going to say I think is not much to the
          point, yet, after all, there is no harm in saying it. The property of one of them is very
          small, of the other scarcely up to the equestrian standard. Wherefore, seeing that Caesar,
          with his usual high-mindedness, has granted them their lives, and since there is very
          little else that can be taken from them, do secure these men their return, if you love me
          as much as I am sure you do. The only possible difficulty is the long journey; which their
          motive for not shirking is their desire to be with their families and to die at home. That
          you do your best and exert yourself, or rather that you carry it through—for as to your
          ability to do it I have no doubt—I strongly and repeatedly entreat you. </p>

        <p> OF all our men of rank there is no one of whom I have been fonder than of Publius
          Crassus the younger; and though I have had very great hopes of him from his earliest
          years, I began at once to entertain brilliant ideas of his abilities when I was informed
          of your high opinion of him. His freedman Apollonius I always valued and thought well of
          even when Crassus was alive: for he was very attentive to Crassus and extremely well
          suited to promote his best tastes: and, accordingly, was much liked by him. But after the
          death of Crassus he seemed the more worthy of admission to my confidence and friendship,
          because he regarded it as <pb n="198"/> his duty to be attentive and polite to those whom
          the late Crassus had loved and by whom he had been beloved. Accordingly, he came to stay
          with me in Cilicia, and in many particulars his fidelity and good sense were of great use
          to me; and, as I think, he rendered you all the service in the Alexandrine war that was
          within the range of ability and fidelity. Hoping that you would think the same, he has
          started to join you in Spain—chiefly indeed on his own initiative, but also on my advice.
          I did not promise him a letter of recommendation, not because I doubted its weight with
          you, but because he did not seem to want any, for he had been on active service in your
          army, and had been put on your staff from respect to the memory of Crassus. And if he did
          choose to avail himself of introductions, I saw that he could accomplish that by means of
          others. It is a testimony to my opinion of him, which he values highly and which I also
          have found to have weight with you, that I hereby give him with pleasure. Well, then, I
          have found him to be well instructed and devoted to the highest pursuits, and that from a
          boy. For he lived much at my house from his boyhood along with the Stoic Diodotus, a man
          in my opinion of the most profound learning. At present, fired with admiration of your
          achievements, he desires to write a history of them in Greek. I think he is capable of
          doing it. He has great genius: great experience: for a long time past he has been engaged
          in that branch of study and literature: he is wonderfully eager to do justice to the
          immortal fame of your glorious achievements. You have here the record of my opinion, but
          your supreme wisdom will enable you to decide with much greater ease upon this point. Yet,
          after all, though I said I would not do so, I recommend him to you. Whatever favour you
          shew him will be more than ordinarily gratifying to me.</p>

        <p> WHEN I received the news of your daughter Tullia's death, I was indeed as much grieved
          and distressed as I was bound to be, and looked upon it as a calamity in which I shared.
          For, if I had been at home, I should not have failed to be at your side, and should have
          made my sorrow plain to you face to face. That kind of consolation involves much distress
          and pain, because the relations and friends, whose part it is to offer it, are themselves
          overcome by an equal sorrow. They cannot attempt it without many tears, so that they seem
          to require consolation themselves rather than to be able to afford it to others. Still I
          have decided to set down briefly for your benefit such thoughts as have occurred to my
          mind, not because I suppose them to be unknown to you, but because your sorrow may perhaps
          hinder you from being so keenly alive to them. <milestone unit="para"/>Why is it that a
          private grief should agitate you so deeply? Think how fortune has hitherto dealt with us.
          Reflect that We have had snatched from us what ought to be no less dear to human beings
          than their children-country, honour, rank, every political distinction. What additional
          wound to your feelings could be inflicted by this particular loss? Or where is the heart
          that should not by this time have lost all sensibility and learn to regard everything else
          as of minor importance? Is it on her account, pray, that you sorrow? How many times have
          you recurred to the thought—and I have often been struck with the same idea—that in times
          like these theirs is far from being the worst fate to whom it has been granted to exchange
          life for a painless death? Now what was there at such an epoch that could greatly tempt
          her to live? What scope, what hope, what heart's Solace? That she might spend her life
          with some young and distinguished husband? How impossible for a man of <pb n="210"/> your
          rank to select from the present generation of young men a son-in-law, to whose honour you
          might think yourself safe in trusting your child! Was it that she might bear children to
          cheer her with the sight of their vigorous youth? who might by their own character
          maintain the position handed down to them by their parent, might be expected to stand for
          the offices in their order, might exercise their freedom in supporting their friends? What
          single one of these prospects has not been taken away before it was given? But, it will be
          said, after all it is an evil to lose one's children. Yes, it is: only it is a worse one
          to endure and submit to the present state of things. <milestone unit="para"/>I wish to
          mention to you a circumstance which gave me no common consolation, on the chance of its
          also proving capable of diminishing your sorrow. On my voyage from Asia, as I was sailing
          from Aegina towards Megara, I began to survey the localities that were on every side of
          me. Behind me was Aegina, in front Megara, on my right Piraeus, on my left Corinth: towns
          which at one time were most flourishing, but now lay before my eyes m ruin and decay. I
          began to reflect to myself thus: "Hah! do we mannikins feel rebellious if one of us
          perishes or is killed—we whose life ought to be still shorter—when the corpses of so many
          towns lie in helpless ruin? Will you please, Servius, restrain yourself and recollect that
          you are born a mortal man?" Believe me, I was no little strengthened by that reflexion.
          Now take the trouble, if you agree with me, to put this thought before your eyes. Not long
          ago all those most illustrious men perished at one blow: the empire of the Roman people
          suffered that huge loss: all the provinces were shaken to their foundations. If you have
          become the poorer by the frail spirit of one poor girl, are you agitated thus violently?
          If she had not died now, she would yet have had to die a few years hence, for she was
          mortal born. You, too, withdraw soul and thought from such things, and rather remember
          those which become the part you have played in life: that she lived as long as life had
          anything to give her; that her life outlasted that of the Republic; that she lived to see
          you—her own father-praetor, consul, and augur; that she married young men of the highest
          rank; that she had enjoyed nearly, every possible blessing; that, <pb n="211"/> when the
          Republic fell, she departed from life. What fault have you or she to find with fortune on
          this score? In fine, do not forget that you are Cicero, and a man accustomed to instruct
          and advise others; and do not imitate bad physicians, who in the diseases of others
          profess to understand the art of healing, but are unable to prescribe for themselves.
          Rather suggest to yourself and bring home to your own mind the very maxims which you are
          accustomed to impress upon others. There is no sorrow beyond the power of time at length
          to diminish and soften: it is a reflexion on you that you should wait for this period, and
          not rather anticipate that result by the aid of your wisdom. But if there is any
          consciousness still existing in the world below, such was her love for you and her dutiful
          affection for all her family, that she certainly does not wish you to act as you are
          acting. Grant this to her-your lost one! Grant it to your friends and comrades who mourn
          with you in your sorrow! Grant it to your country, that if the need arises she may have
          the use of your services and advice. <milestone unit="para"/>Finally—since we are reduced
          by fortune to the necessity of taking precautions on this point also—do not allow anyone
          to think that you are not mourning so much for your daughter as for the state of public
          affairs and the victory of others. I am ashamed to say any more to you on this subject,
          lest I should appear to distrust your wisdom. Therefore I will only make one suggestion
          before bringing my letter to an end. We have seen you on many occasions bear good fortune
          with a noble dignity which greatly enhanced your fame: now is the time for you to convince
          us that you are able to bear bad fortune equally well, and that it does not appear to you
          to be a heavier burden than you ought to think it. I would not have this be the only one
          of all the virtues that you do not possess. <milestone unit="para"/>As far as I am
          concerned, when I learn that your mind is more composed, I will write you an account of
          what is going on here, and of the condition of the province. Good-bye. <pb n="212"/>

        <p> Cicero to Caesar, imperator.<note n="1" anchored="true">I leave this letter in the
            position it occupies in Tyrrell and Purser's work with great doubt. On the one hand, it
            seems very unlikely to have been written after Tullia's death; on the other, Cicero—who
            is careful in such matters-gives Caesar the title of <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >imperator</foreign>, with which his soldiers greeted him on the 19th of February.
            Mueller puts it close to Letter CXLII. </note>I recommend Precilius to your special
          favour, the son of a connexion of your own, a very intimate friend of mine, and a most
          excellent man. For the young man himself I have an extraordinary affection on account of
          his rectitude, culture, and the spirit and affection he has displayed to myself: but of
          his father also I have had practical reason to know and thoroughly learn what a warm
          friend he has ever been to me. Now see!—this is the man that more than anyone else has
          been used to ridicule and chide me for not attaching myself to you, especially when
          invited to do so by you in the most Complimentary manner: <quote>But in my breast my heart
            he ne'er could move.</quote> For I heard our nobles shouting: <quote>
            <l>Be staunch, and unborn men shall speak thee fair. </l>
            <l>He spake, and on him fell black clouds of woe.</l>
          </quote> However, these same men give me consolation also: they wish even now—though once
          singed—to inflame me with the fire of glory, and speak thus: "Nay, not a coward's death
          nor shorn of fame, But after some high deed to live for aye." <note n="2" anchored="true"
            >Il 22.304, quoted more than once before. See vol. ii., p.357. </note> But they move me
          less than of yore, as you see. <pb n="229"/> Accordingly from the high style of Homer I
          transfer myself to the true maxims of Euripides: <quote>Out on the sage that cannot guide
            himself!</quote> This is a verse that the elder Precilius praises to the skies, and says
          that a man may be able to see both "before and behind," and yet <quote>Still may excel and
            rise above the crowd.</quote> But to return to what I began with: you will greatly
          oblige me, if you give this young man the benefit of the kindness which so distinguishes
          you, and will add to what I think you would do for the sake of the Precilii themselves as
          much as my recommendation may be worth. I have adopted a new style of letter to you, that
          you might understand that my recommendation is no common one. <note n="1" anchored="true"
            >Cicero may well have apologized for the style of letter. The accumulation of not very
            apt tags from Homer, the rather flippant allusion to his own conduct to Caesar, the
            familiar En, <foreign xml:lang="la">hic ille est</foreign>, etc., all go to make up a
            letter very unlike even the most off-hand of Cicero's letters, though full of his usual
            phrases. It is not the sort of letter which one would expect to be written to the head
            of the state, and I should not be surprised if it was never sent. <milestone unit="para"

          <dateline>ASTURA (MARCH)</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> Although the consolation contained in your letter is in itself exceedingly gratifying to
          me—for it displays the greatest kindness joined to an equal amount of good sense-yet quite
          the greatest profit which I received from that letter was the assurance that you were
          shewing a noble disdain of human vicissitudes, and were thoroughly armed and <pb n="230"/>
          prepared against fortune. And I assert it to be the highest compliment to philosophy that
          a man should not depend upon externals, nor allow his calculations as to the happiness or
          unhappiness of his life to be governed by anything outside himself. Now this conviction,
          though it had never been altogether lost—for it had sunk deep—had yet by the violence of
          tempests and a combination of misfortunes been considerably shaken and loosened at its
          roots. I see that you are for giving it support, and I also feel that by your last letter
          you have actually done so, and that with considerable success. Therefore, in my opinion, I
          ought to repeat this often, and not merely hint to you, but openly to declare, that
          nothing could be more acceptable to me than your letter. But while the arguments which you
          have collected with such taste and learning help to console me, yet nothing does so more
          than the clear perception I have got of the unbending firmness and unshaken confidence of
          your spirit, not to imitate which I think would be an utter disgrace. And so I consider
          that I am even braver than yourself—who give me lessons in courage—in this respect, that
          you appear to me still to cherish a hope that things will be some day better: at least
          "the changes and chances of gladiatorial combats" and your illustrations, as well as the
          arguments collected by you in your essay, were meant to forbid me entirely to despair of
          the republic. Accordingly, in one respect it is not so wonderful that you should be
          braver, since you still cherish hope: in another it is surprising that you should still
          have any hope. For what is there that is not so weakened as to make you acknowledge it to
          be practically destroyed and extinct? Cast your eye upon all the limbs of the republic,
          with which you are most intimately acquainted: you will not find one that is not broken or
          enfeebled. I would have gone into details, if I had seen things more clearly than you see
          them, or had been able to mention them without sorrow: though in accordance with your
          lessons and precepts all sorrow ought to be put away. Therefore I will bear my domestic
          misfortunes in the spirit of your admonition, and those of the state perhaps with even a
          little more courage than even you, who admonish me. For you are supported, as you say, by
          some hope; but I shall keep up my courage though I despair of everything, as in spite <pb
            n="231"/> of that you exhort and admonish me to do. Yes, you give me pleasant reminders
          of what my conscience tells me I have done, and of those achievements which I performed
          with you among my foremost supporters. For I did for my country at least not less than I
          was bound to do, certainly more than was demanded from the spirit or wisdom of any one
          human being. Pray pardon my saying something about myself. You wished me to be relieved
          from my sorrow by thinking over these things. Well, even by mentioning them I obtain
          alleviation. Therefore, according to your advice, I will withdraw myself to the best of my
          power from all sorrows and anguish, and fix my mind on those topics by which prosperity
          receives an added charm, and adversity a support. I will be in your society also exactly
          as much as our respective age and health will allow; and if we cannot be together as much
          as we desire, we will so enjoy our union of hearts and community of tastes as to seem
          never separated. </p>

        <p> Although at the moment of my writing this letter,<note n="1" anchored="true">There is
            nothing to shew where this letter was written, and only the allusion to the expectation
            of a decisive blow in Spain to put the time as late as March. Yet Cicero had begun
            speaking of expected news from Spain ever since January, and the absence of a reference
            to Tullia's death is an argument—though not quite decisive—of an earlier date. It does
            not much matter, however, as it represents Cicero's abiding view of the political
            situation, and is somewhat a relief in the rather monotonous lamentations for <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Tullia</foreign> and plans for her memorial. C. Toranius was aedile with
            Octavius, father of Augustus, and one of the <foreign xml:lang="la">tutores</foreign> of
            Augustus himself. He perished in the proscription of <date when="-0043">B.C. 43</date>,
            betrayed by his son. Perhaps Augustus acquiesced in it because he had found him an
            unfaithful tutor. See <bibl n="Suet. Aug. 27">Suet. Aug. 27</bibl>; App. <date

          </note> the end of this most disastrous war appears to be approaching, and <pb n="232"/>
          already some decisive blow to have been struck, yet I daily mention that you were the one
          man in that immense army who agreed with me and I with you, and that we two alone saw what
          terrible evil was involved in that war. For when all hope of peace was shut out, victory
          itself was likely to be calamitous in its results, since it meant death if you were on the
          losing, and slavery if on the winning, side. Accordingly I, whom at the time those brave
          and wise men the Domitii and Lentuli declared to be frightened—and I was so without doubt,
          for I feared that what actually happened would occur—am now in my turn afraid of nothing,
          and am prepared for anything that may happen. So long as any precaution seemed possible, I
          was grieved at its being neglected. Now, however, when all is ruined, when no good can be
          done by wise policy, the only plan seems to be to bear with resignation whatever occurs:
          especially as death ends all, and my conscience tells me that, as long as I was able to do
          so, I consulted for the dignity of the republic and, when that was lost, determined to
          save its existence. <note n="1" anchored="true">Reading <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >voluisse</foreign> with the MSS. The <foreign xml:lang="la">noluisse</foreign>

            joining Pompey was right and his duty to the constitution, yet that his abandoning the
            Pompeians after <foreign xml:lang="la">Pharsalia</foreign> was necessary for the safety
            of the state. He did not refuse to maintain his own safety. </note> I have written thus
          much, not with the object of talking about myself, but that you, who have been most
          closely united with me in sentiment and purpose, might entertain the same thoughts: for it
          is a great consolation to remember, even when there has been a disaster, that your
          presentiments were after all right and true. And I only hope we may eventually enjoy some
          form of constitution, and may live to compare the anxieties which we endured at the time
          when we were looked upon as timid, because we said that what has actually happened would
          do so. For your own fortunes I assure you that you have nothing to fear beyond the
          destruction affecting the republic in general; and of me I would have you think as of one

        </opener>
        <p> YES, indeed, my dear Servius, I would have wished—as you say—that you had been by my
          side at the time of my grievous loss. How much help your presence might have given me,
          both by consolation and by your taking an almost equal share in my sorrow, I can easily
          gather from the fact that after reading your letter I experienced a great feeling of
          relief. For not only was what you wrote calculated to soothe a mourner, but in offering me
          consolation you manifested no slight sorrow of heart yourself. Yet, after all, your son
          Servius by all the kindnesses of which such a time admitted made it evident, both how much
          he personally valued me, and how gratifying to you he thought such affection for me would
          be. His kind offices have of course often been pleasanter to me, yet never more
          acceptable. For myself again, it is not only your words and (I had almost said) your
          partnership in my sorrow that consoles me, it is your character also. For I think it a
          disgrace that I should not bear my loss as you—a man of such wisdom-think it should be
          borne. But at times I am taken by surprise and scarcely offer any resistance to my grief,
          because those consolations fail me, which were not wanting in a similar misfortune to
          those others, whose examples I put before my eyes. For instance, Quintus Maximus, who lost
          a son who had been consul and was of illustrious character and brilliant achievements, and
          Lucius Paullus, who lost two within seven days, and your kinsman Gallus and M. Cato, who
          each lost a son of the highest character and valour;-all lived in circumstances which
          permitted their own great position, earned by their public services, to assuage their
          grief. In my case, after losing the honours which you yourself mention, and which I had
          gained by the greatest possible exertions, there was only that one solace left which has
            <pb n="234"/> now been torn away. My sad musings were not interrupted by the business of
          my friends, nor by the management of public affairs: there was nothing I cared to do in
          the forum: I could not bear the sight of the senate-house; I thought—as was the fact—that
          I had lost all the fruits both of my industry and of fortune. But while I thought that I
          shared these losses with you and certain others, and while I was conquering my feelings
          and forcing myself to bear them with patience, I had a refuge, one bosom where I could
          find repose, one in whose conversation and sweetness I could lay aside all anxieties and
          sorrows. But now, after such a crushing blow as this, the wounds which seemed to have
          healed break out afresh. For there is no republic now to offer me a refuge and a
          consolation by its good fortunes when I leave my home in sorrow, as there once was a home
          to receive me when I returned saddened by the state of public affairs. Hence I absent
          myself both from home and forum, because home can no longer console the sorrow which
          public affairs cause me, nor public affairs that which I suffer at home. All the more I
          look forward to your coming, and long to see you as soon as possible. No reasoning can
          give me greater solace than a renewal of our intercourse and conversation. However, I hope
          your arrival is approaching, for that is what I am told. For myself, while I have many
          reasons for wishing to see you as soon as possible, there is this one especially—that we
          may discuss beforehand on what principles we should live through this period of entire
          submission to the will of one man who is at once wise and liberal, far, as I think I
          perceive, from being hostile to me, and very friendly to you. But though that is so, yet
          it is a matter for serious thought what plans, I, don't say of action, but of passing a
          quiet life by his leave and kindness, we should adopt. Good-bye. <pb n="235"/>

        <p> I BEG you not to think that forgetfulness of you is the cause of my writing to you less
          often than I used to do; but either illness-from which however I am now recovering—or
          absence from the city, which prevents my knowing who is starting to where you are.
          Wherefore I would have you make up your mind that I always remember you with the most
          perfect affection, and regard all your interests as of no less concern to me than my own.
          That your case has experienced more vicissitudes than people either wished or expected is
          not, believe me, in these bad times a thing to give you anxiety. For it is inevitable that
          the republic should either be burdened by an unending war, or should at last recover
          itself by its cessation, or should utterly perish. If arms are to carry the day, you have
          no need to fear either the party by whom you are being taken back, nor that which you
          actually assisted; if—when arms are either laid down by a composition or thrown down from
          sheer weariness—the state ever recovers its breath, you will be permitted to enjoy your
          position and property. But if universal ruin is to be the result, and the end is to be
          what that very clear-sighted man Marcus Antonius used long ago to fear when he suspected
          that all this misfortune was impending, there is this consolation—a wretched one indeed,
          especially for such a citizen and such a man as yourself, but yet the only one we can
          have—that no one may make a private grievance of what affects all alike. If, as I am sure
          you will, you rightly conceive the meaning of these few words—for it was not proper to
          trust more to an epistle-you will certainly understand even without a letter from me that
          you have something to hope, nothing under this or any definite form of the constitution to
          fear. If there is general ruin, as you would not wish, even if you could, to <pb n="236"/>
          survive the republic, you must bear your fortune, especially one which involves no blame
          to you. But enough of this. Pray write and tell me how you are and where you intend to
          stay, that I may know where to write or come. </p>

        </opener>
        <p> If you are well, I am glad: I am as usual, or even a little worse than usual. I have
          often wished to see you. I was surprised to find that you have not been at Rome since your
          departure: <note n="1" anchored="true">Reading (with Mueller) <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >discesseras</foreign>. The phrase is rather elaborate and fanciful, but so is the
            whole style of Lucceius throughout the letter. </note> and I am still surprised at it. I
          don't feel certain as to the exact motive which withdraws you from Rome. If it is solitude
          that charms you, provided that you write or carry on some of your accustomed pursuits, I
          rejoice, and have no fault to find with your resolution. For nothing can be pleasanter
          than that, I don't mean merely in such unhappy and grievous times as these, but even when
          everything is peaceful and answerable to our wishes. Especially if your mind is either so
          far wearied as to need repose after heavy engagements, or so richly endowed as ever to be
          producing something capable of charming others and adding brilliancy to your own
          reputation. If, however, as you indicate, you have surrendered yourself to tears and
          melancholy thoughts, I grieve that you are grieving and suffering: I cannot—if you permit
          me to say what I really think-altogether acquit you of blame. For reflect: will you be the
          only man not to see what is as clear as day, you whose acuteness detects the most profound
          secrets? Will you fail to understand that you do no good by daily lamentations? Will you
          fail to understand that the sorrow is doubled, which your wisdom expects you to remove?
          Well, if I cannot prevail upon you by persuasion, I put it to you as a personal favour and
          as a special request, that, if you care to do anything for my sake, you would free
          yourself from the bonds of that sorrow and return to our society and to your ordinary way
          of life, whether that which we share in common with you, or that <pb n="246"/> which is
          characteristic of and peculiar to yourself. My desire is not to worry you, if I cannot
          give you pleasure, by a display of earnestness on my part: what I desire is to prevent you
          from abiding by your present purpose. At present these two opposite desires do somewhat
          puzzle me—I should wish you either in regard to the latter of them to yield to my advice,
          or in regard to the former not to feel any annoyance with me. Good-bye. </p>

        <p> YOUR perfect affection manifests itself in every sentence of the last letter which I
          received from you: not that it was anything new to me, but all the same it was grateful to
          my feelings and all that I could desire. I should have called it "delightful," had not
          that word been lost to me for ever: and not for that one reason which you imagine, and in
          regard to which you chide me severely, though in the gentlest and most affectionate terms,
          but because what ought to have been the remedies for that sorrow are all gone. Well then!
          Am I to seek comfort with my friends? How many of them are there? You know—for they were
          common to us both. Some of them have fallen, others I know not how have grown callous.
          With you indeed I might have gone on living, and there is nothing I should have liked
          better. Long-standing affection, habit, community of tastes—what tie, I ask, is there
          lacking to our union? Is it possible then for us to be together? Well, by Hercules, I know
          not what prevents it: but, at any rate, we have not been so hitherto, though we were
          neighbours at Tusculum and Puteoli, to say nothing of Rome; where, as the forum is a
          common meeting-place, nearness of residence does not matter. But by some misfortune our
          age has fallen upon circumstances, which, just when we ought to be at the very height of
          prosperity, make us ashamed even of being alive. For what had I to fly to when deprived of
          everything that could afford me distinction or console my feelings at home or in public
          life? Literature, I suppose. Well, I devote myself to that without ceasing. But <pb
            n="248"/> in some indefinable way literature itself seems to shut me out from harbour
          and refuge, and as it were to reproach me for continuing a life in which there is nothing
          but extension of utter wretchedness. In these circumstances, do you wonder at my keeping
          away from the city, in which my own house has no pleasure to offer me, while the state of
          affairs, the men, the forum, and the senate-house are all utterly repulsive to me?
          Accordingly, what I seek from literature, on which I spend my whole time, is not a lasting
          cure but a brief oblivion of pain. But if you and I had done what on account of our daily
          fears it never occurred to us to do, we should have been always together, and neither
          would your weak health have annoyed me, nor my sorrow you. Let us aim at securing this as
          far as it may be possible: for what could suit both of us better? I will see you therefore
          at an early day. </p>

          <dateline>ATHENS, 31 MAY</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> Servius sends many good wishes to Cicero. Though I know that I shall be giving you no
          very pleasant news, <pb n="273"/> yet since chance and nature bear the sway among us men,
          I thought it incumbent on me to give you information of whatever kind it might be. On the
          23rd of May, on sailing into the Piraeus, I met my colleague M. Marcellus, <note n="1"
            anchored="true">This is the M. Marcellus, whose restoration by Caesar called out
            Cicero's senatorial speech <foreign xml:lang="la">pro</foreign> Marcello. He had been
              <foreign xml:lang="la">consul</foreign> with Sulpicius in <date when="-0051">B.C.
              51</date>. His assassination appears to have arisen from jealousy on the part of
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Cilo</foreign>, who had not been recalled. </note> and spent
          the day there in order to enjoy his society. Next day, when I parted from him with the
          design of going from Athens to Boeotia, and finishing what remained of my legal business,
            <note n="2" anchored="true">The <foreign xml:lang="la">conventus</foreign> or assizes.
            Sulpicius had been appointed by Caesar to govern Greece. See p. 136. </note> he told me
          that he intended to sail round Cape Malea and make for Italy. On the third day after that,
          just as I was intending to start from Athens, at the tenth hour of the night my friend
          Publius Postumius called on me with the information that my colleague M. Marcellus just
          after dinner had been stabbed with a dagger by his friend P. Magius Cilo, and had received
          two wounds, one in the stomach, a second in the head behind the ear; but that hopes were
          entertained that he might survive; and that Magius had killed himself afterwards. He added
          that he had been sent by Marcellus to tell me this, and to ask me to send some physicians.
          Accordingly, I summoned some physicians, and immediately started just as day was breaking.
          When I was not far from Piraeus, a slave of Acidinus met me bearing a note containing the
          information that Marcellus had expired a little before daybreak. So there is a man of most
          illustrious character cut off in a most distressing manner by the vilest of men. His
          personal enemies had spared him in consideration of his character; but one of his own
          friends was found to inflict death upon him. However, I continued my journey to his tent.
          There I found two freedmen and a few slaves: they said the rest had run away in terror,
          because their master had been killed in front of the tent. <note n="3" anchored="true"
            >Slaves of a murdered master were liable to be put to death. </note> I was obliged to
          carry him back to the city in the same litter in which I had ridden down and to use my own
          bearers: and there, considering the means at my disposal at Athens, I saw to his having an
            <pb n="274"/> honourable funeral. I could not induce the Athenians to grant him a place
          of burial within the city, <note n="1" anchored="true">Athens was a <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >libera civitas</foreign>, and had complete management of internal affairs. The
            Athenians had been rather Pompeian in sympathy, and were perhaps afraid to shew special
            favour now to a prominent member of the beaten party. </note> as they alleged that they
          were prevented by religious scruples from doing so; and it is a fact that they had never
          granted that privilege to anyone. But they allowed us, which was the next best thing, to
          bury him in any gymnasium we chose. <note n="2" anchored="true">That is, in the grounds
            about a gymnasium. </note> We chose a place in the most famous gymnasium in the
          world—that of the Academy—and there we burnt the body, and afterwards saw to these same
          Athenians giving out a contract for the construction of a marble monument over him. So I
          think I have done all for him alive and dead required by our colleagueship and close
          connexion. Goodbye. <milestone unit="para"/>31 May, Athens. </p>

        <p> Hitherto I have felt nothing more than a natural affection for Dolabella: I was under no
          obligation to him—for it never chanced to be necessary—and he was in my debt for my having
          stood by him in his hours of danger. <note n="2" anchored="true">Cicero had twice defended
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Dolabella</foreign> (vol. ii., pp. 160-161). </note> Now,
          however, I have become bound to him by so strong an obligation—for having previously in

          gratified me to the fullest possible degree—that I can owe no one more than I do him. In
          regard to this matter, while I warmly congratulate you, I wish you to congratulate rather
          than thank me. The latter I do not in the least desire, the former you will be able to do
          with truth. For the rest, since your high character and worth have secured <pb n="280"/>
          your return to your family, you will be acting in a manner worthy of your wisdom and
          magnanimity if you forget what you have lost, and think of what you have recovered. You
          will be living with your family; you will be living with us; you have gained more in

          position would have been a greater source of pleasure to you, if there had been any

        <p> I like modesty in language: you prefer plain speaking. <note n="2" anchored="true"
            >Reading <foreign xml:lang="la">Amo verecundiam, tu potius libertatem
            loquendi</foreign>. The MS. reading <foreign xml:lang="la">vel potius</foreign>, etc.,
            might be explained if <foreign xml:lang="la">libertatem</foreign> could mean "freedom
            from the constraint of double entendre," as if Cicero had meant "I like a modest and
            simple use of language without suggestiveness." But it is very difficult. </note> The
          latter I know was the doctrine of Zeno, a man by heaven! of keen insight, though our
          Academy had a serious quarrel with him. However, as I say, the Stoic doctrine is to call
          everything by its right name. <note n="3" anchored="true">In the <bibl n="Cic. Off. 1.127"
              >de Off. 1.127</bibl>-128, Cicero attributes this to the Cynics or Stoics, who were
            almost Cynics, and expresses disapproval of it. </note> They argue as follows: nothing
          is obscene, nothing unfit to be expressed: for if there is anything disgraceful in
          obscenity, it consists either in the thing meant or in the word: there is no third
          alternative. Now it is not in the thing meant. Accordingly, in tragedies as well as in
          comedies there is no concealment. <pb n="294"/> For Comedy, take the character in the
          Demiurgus : <note n="1" anchored="true">A comedy of Sextus Turpilius (died about <date
              when="-00101">B.C. 101</date>). We have no clue to the context of the words, though
            the few fragments of the play (Ribbeck, p. 78) shew that a <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >meretrix</foreign> was an important character in it. </note> you know the monologue
          beginning "Lately by chance," and you remember how Roscius recited, "So naked has she left
          me": the whole speech is covert in language, in meaning is very immodest. As for tragedy,
          what do you say to this: "The woman who"—notice the expression—"uses more than one bed."
          Or again, "He dared intrude upon her bed, Pheres." Or again: <quote>
            <l>A virgin I, and sheer against my will </l>
            <l>Did luppiter achieve his end by force.</l>
          </quote>
          <note n="2" anchored="true">It is not known from what tragedies these scraps are taken
            (Ribbeck, Trg. fragm., p.217). Cicero quotes the first as from Accius in <bibl
              n="Cic. Orat. 156">Orator 156.</bibl>
          </note> "Achieve his end" is a decent way of putting it; and yet it means the same as a
          coarser word, which however no one would have endured. You see then that though the thing
          meant is the same, yet, because the words are not so, there is thought to be no
          impropriety. Therefore obscenity is not in the thing meant: much less is it in the
          expressions. For if the thing meant by a word is not improper, the word which signifies it
          cannot be improper. For instance, you call the anus by another name; why not by its own?
          If mention of it is improper, don't mention it even under another name. If not, do so for
          choice by its own. The ancients called a tail a penis; whence comes the word penicillus
          ("paint-brush"), from its similarity in appearance. Nowadays penis is regarded as an
          obscene word. "But," you will say, "the famous Piso Frugi in his 'Annals' complains of
          young men being given up to lust (peni)." What you call in your letter by its own name,
          he, with more reserve, calls penis. Yes; but it is because many use the word in that sense
          that it has become as obscene as the word you used. Again, suppose we use the common
          phrase: "When we (cum nos) desired to visit you"—does that suggest obscenity? I remember
          once in the senate an eloquent consular expressing himself thus: <pb n="295"/> "Am I to
          say that this or that is the greater culpability?" Could it have been expressed more
          obscenely ? <note n="1" anchored="true">The first syllable of culpam perhaps suggested
            culleus, the scrotum; illam dicam might produce laudica, the clitoris. But it is very
            far-fetched. </note> "Not so," you say, "for he did not mean it in that sense."
          Therefore obscenity does not consist in the word used: I have shewn that it does not do so
          in the thing meant: therefore it does not exist anywhere. How entirely decent is the
          expression: "To exert oneself for children "? Even fathers beg their sons to do so, though
          they do not venture to mention the name of the "exertion." Socrates was taught the lyre by
          a very famous musician named Connus: do you think the name obscene? When we use the
          numeral terni there is no suggestion of obscenity: but if I speak of bini there is. "Only
          to Greeks," <note n="2" anchored="true">From the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc"
              >binei=n</foreign>. </note> you will say. That shews that there is nothing obscene in
          a word, for I know Greek and yet use the word bini to you; and you assume that I am
          speaking Greek and not Latin. Again, we may speak without impropriety of "rue" (ruta) and
          "mint" (menta); but if I wish to use the diminutive of menta (mentula)-as one can
          perfectly well use that of ruta (rutula)-that is a forbidden word. So we may, without a
          breach of good manners, use the diminutive of tectoria (tectoriola); but if you try to do
          the same with pavimenta (pavimentula), you find yourself pulled up. Don't you see, then,
          that these are nothing but empty distinctions? That impropriety exists neither in word nor
          thing, and therefore is non-existent? <milestone unit="para"/>The fact is that we
          introduce obscene meaning into words in themselves pure. For instance, is not the word
          divisio beyond reproach? Yet in it there is a word (visium or visio, "a stench") which may
          have an improper meaning, to which the last syllables of the word intercapedo (pedo
          iripow) correspond. Are we, therefore, to regard these words as obscene? Again, we make a
          ridiculous distinction: if we say, "So-and—so strangled his father," we don't prefix any
          apologetic word. But if we use the word of Aurelia or Lollia we must use such an apology.
          Nay, more, words that are not obscene have come to be considered so. The word "grind," he
          says, is shameful; much more the <pb n="296"/> word "knead." And yet neither is obscene.
          The world is full of fools. Testes is quite a respectable word in a Court of law:
          elsewhere not too much so. Again, "Lanuvinian bags " is a decent phrase; not so "bags" of
          Cliternum. <milestone unit="para"/>Again, can the same thing be at one time decent, at
          another indecent? Suppose a man to break wind—it is an outrage on decency. Presently he
          will be in a bath naked, and you will have no fault to find. Here is your Stoic
          decision—"The wise man will call a spade a spade." <milestone unit="para"/>What a long
          commentary on a single word of yours! I am pleased that you have no scruple in saying
          anything to me. For my own part I maintain and shall maintain Plato's modesty: and
          accordingly, in my letter to you, I have expressed in veiled language what the Stoics
          express in the broadest: for they say that breaking wind should be as free as a hiccough.

            n="305"/> provocation: nevertheless I have so much looked forward to your present that I
          venture to remind you of it, though not to press for it. So I have sent you four reminders
          who are not afflicted with excessive modesty: for you know how brazen-faced the New
          Academy is. Accordingly, I am sending ambassadors enlisted from its ranks, who I fear may
          by chance lodge a demand, though I have only commissioned them to ask a favour. I have
          been waiting in fact for a long time now, and have been holding back, so as not to address
          any work to you before I had received something from you, in order that I might repay you
          as nearly as possible in your own coin. But as you were somewhat slow in doing it—that is,
          as I construe it, somewhat unusually careful—I could not refrain from making manifest by
          such literary composition as I was capable of producing the union of our tastes and
          affections. I have therefore composed a dialogue purposing to be held between us in my
          villa at Cumae, Pomponius being there also. I have assigned to you the doctrines of
          Antiochus, which I thought I understood to have your approval; I have taken those of Philo
          for myself. I imagine that when you read it you will be surprised at our holding a
          conversation, which we never did hold; but you know the usual method of dialogues. At some
          future time, my dear Varro, we shall—if such is your pleasure-have many a long
          conversation of our own also. It may perhaps be some time hence: but let the fortune of
          the state excuse the past; it is our business to secure this ourselves. And oh that we
          might pursue these studies together in a time of tranquillity and with the constitution
          established on some basis, which if not good may be at any rate definitely fixed! Though
          in that case there would be other calls upon us-honourable responsibilities and political
          activities. As things are now, however, what is there to induce us to live without these
          studies? In my eyes indeed, even with them, it is barely worth while: when they are
          withdrawn, not even so much as that. But of this when we meet, and often hereafter. I hope
          your change of houses and new purchase may turn out everything you can desire. I think you
          were quite right to make them. Be careful of your health. <pb n="306"/>

        </opener>
        <p> Three days ago I delivered a letter for you to the servants of Gnaeus Plancius. I shall
          therefore be briefer, and as I tried to console you before, on the present occasion I
          shall offer you some advice. I think your wisest course is to wait where you are until you
          can ascertain what you ought to do. For, over and above the danger of a long voyage in
          winter and along a coast very ill-furnished with harbours, which you will thus have
          avoided, there is this point also of no small importance—that you can start at a moment's
          notice from where you are as soon as you get any certain intelligence. There is besides no
          reason for your being all agog to present yourself to them on their way home. <note n="1"
            anchored="true">The idea of Toranius apparently was to go somewhere to meet Caesar on
            his way from Spain. The "voyage without harbours" best suits the east coast of Italy,
            and it has been supposed that he meant to go to <foreign xml:lang="la"
            >Ravenna</foreign>, and thence cross the continent and meet Caesar somewhere in Gaul. As
            a matter of fact, Caesar did not come home that way. </note> Several other fears occur
          to me which I have imparted to our friend Cilo. <milestone unit="para"/>To cut a long
          story short: in your present unfortunate position you could be in no more convenient spot
          from which to transfer yourself with the greatest facility and despatch whithersoever it
          shall be necessary for you to go. Thus, if Caesar gets home up to time, you will be at
          hand. But if—for many accidents may happen-something either stops or delays him, you will
          be in a place to get full information. This I am strongly of opinion is your better
          course. For the future, as I have repeatedly impressed on you by letter, I would have you
          convince yourself that in regard to your position you have nothing to fear beyond the
          calamity common to the whole state. And though that is <pb n="310"/> exceedingly serious,
          yet we have lived in such a way and are at such a time of life, that we ought to bear with
          Courage whatever happens to us without fault on our part. Here in Rome all your family are
          in good health, and with the most perfect loyalty regret your absence, and retain their
          affection and respect for you., Mind you take care of your health and do not move from

        <p> I am glad Macula has done his duty. His Falernian villa always seemed to me suitable for

          have conferred a favour rather than received one. However, we should look out for
          something, but something which may give you some distinction; otherwise I think that you
          not only ought not to seek for it, but should even avoid it. For myself, I think I shall

        <p> I hope from your letter that you are better, at any rate I desire it. Devote your whole

          in staying away. You are with me if you are taking care of yourself. Therefore I would

          pleasure both to hear and see you, it will give me much more pleasure If you are well. I
          am being idle here, because I don't write without an amanuensis; but I find extreme
          pleasure in reading. As you are on the spot, <pb n="314"/> if there is anything in my
          handwriting which the copyists can't make out, please instruct them. There is at least one
          inserted passage somewhat difficult to decipher, which I often find it hard to make out
          myself-about Cato when he was four years old. <note n="1" anchored="true">A story is told
            by Plutarch (Cat. min. 2) of how, at the beginning of the Marsic or Social War,
            Pompaedius Silo, staying in the house of Cato's uncle Drusus, suggested to the boy that
            he should ask his uncle to side with the allies, and when he refused, picked him up and,
            holding him out of the window, threatened to drop him down if he didn't. But the boy
            held out. As <foreign xml:lang="la">Cato</foreign> was just four years old then (b.
              <date when="-0095">B.C. 95</date>) this is probably the story, and the book alluded to
            Cicero's <foreign xml:lang="la">Cato</foreign>, published in <date when="-0046">B.C.
              46</date>, of which the <foreign xml:lang="la">librarii</foreign> would be making
            fresh copies. Schmidt, however, reads <foreign xml:lang="la">de quadrivio
              Catonis</foreign>, and refers it to Cato's exposition of the Stoic philosophy in the
              <foreign xml:lang="la">de</foreign> Finibus. </note> Look after the dinner table, as
          you have been doing. Tertia will come so long as Publius is not there. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Tertia</foreign> was sister of <foreign xml:lang="la"

            him we cannot tell. <foreign xml:lang="la">Dolabella</foreign> is suggested. </note>
          Your friend Demetrius was never quite a Demetrius of Phalerum, but now he has become a
          regular Billienus. <note n="3" anchored="true">Demetrius is unknown, except from these
            letters to <foreign xml:lang="la">Tiro</foreign>, but it is likely that Cicero found him
            tiresome. He is not, he says, quite a "Demetrius of <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Phalerum</foreign>," i.e., the philosophic and eloquent governor of Athens in the
            later Macedonian period (<date>B.C. <date to="-307" from="-317">317</date>-307</date>).
            Billienus was the slave of this or another Demetrius: he murdered a certain Domitius at
            Ventimiglia, which led to an outbreak which Caelius (<date when="-0049">B.C. 49</date>)
            was sent by Caesar to quiet (see vol. ii., p.299). There is also a Demetrius, a freedman
            of Pompey (vol. i., p.253), who may be the Demetrius meant. Why Cicero should say that
            Demetrius has become a Billienus is not clear. Some have suggested a pun on <foreign
              xml:lang="la">bilis</foreign>, as though he were ill-tempered. </note> Accordingly, I

        <p> I see what you are about: you want your letters also to be collected into books. But
          look here! You set up to be a standard of correctness in my writings—how came you to use
          such an unauthorized expression as "by faithfully devoting myself to my health"? How does
          fideliter come in there? The proper habitat of that word is in what refers to duty to
          others—though it often migrates to spheres not belonging to it. For instance: "learning,"
          "house," "art,,' "land," can be called fidelis, granting, as Theophrastus holds, that the
          metaphor is not pushed too far. <note n="1" anchored="true">It is not easy to see in what
            Tiro's solecism consists. It is suggested that <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >fideliter</foreign> must refer to duty to another, but that is probably what <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Tiro</foreign> meant—"he took care of his health as in duty bound to
            Cicero." But <foreign xml:lang="la">fideliter—</foreign>"thoroughly,"
            "conscientiously"—may at any rate be defended by Ovid's <foreign xml:lang="la">didicisse

            said diligenter, but Cicero seems to me to have been hypercritical. </note> But of this

            affectations are described by Horace, Sat. i. 2, 3, sq. </note> I perceived from your

          intention. But I must say a few words on the subject. Cipius I think it was who said, "I
          am not asleep to everybody." <note n="5" anchored="true">Cipius was a complaisant husband
            who feigned sleep for the benefit of his wife and her lover, but woke when a slave began

          such deference as I am now by all Caesar's most intimate friends, except by this fellow. I
          regard it as something gained that I no longer endure a fellow more pestilent than his

            <foreign xml:lang="la">Sardinia</foreign>, notoriously unhealthy (vol. i., p.217).

          </note> But observe the cause of his anger with me. I had undertaken Phamea's cause, for
          his own sake, because he was an intimate friend. Phamea came to me and said that the
          arbitrator had arranged to take his case on the very day on which the jury were obliged to
          consider their verdict in regard to P. Sestius. <note n="4" anchored="true">This is not

        <p> I will answer the end part of your last letter first—for I have noticed that that is
          what you great orators occasionally do. You express disappointment at not getting letters
          from me; whereas I never fail to send one whenever I am informed by your family that
          somebody is going to you. I think I gather from your letter that you are not likely to
          take any step rashly, nor to decide on any plan before you know in what direction that
          fellow Caecilius Bassus <note n="1" anchored="true">Q Caecilius Bassus (quaestor <date

            and, taking advantage of rumours in <date when="-0046">B.C. 46</date> of Caesar being
            defeated in Africa, he caused Sext. Iulius to be assassinated and took over the
            government of Syria. He fortified <foreign xml:lang="la">Apamea</foreign>, and there
            repulsed Antistius Vetus and Statius Murcus, who were successively sent against him, and
            had dealings with the Parthians. Though Murcus was reinforced by Crispus, governor of

            unharmed. </note> is likely to break out. That is what I had hoped, for I felt
          confidence in your wisdom, and now your very welcome letter makes me quite secure. And I
          beg you as a special favour that you will, as often as you can, make it possible for me to
          know what you are doing, what is being done, and also what you intend to do. Although I
          felt much distressed at your leaving me, I consoled myself at the time by thinking that
          you were going to a scene of the most profound tranquillity, and were leaving the cloud of
          serious troubles overhanging us. In both cases the actual truth has been the reverse.
          Where you are a war has broken out: with us there has followed a period of peace. Yet,
          after all, it is a peace in which, had you been here, there would have been many things
          that would not have pleased you, things in fact <pb n="336"/> which do not please Caesar
          himself. In truth, this is always among the results of civil wars—that it is not only what
          the victor wishes that is done: concessions have also to be made to those by whose aid the
          victory was won. For my part, I have become so hardened that at our friend Caesar's games
          I saw T. Plancus <note n="1" anchored="true">T. Munatius Plancus Bursa, tribune in <date

            condemed for <foreign xml:lang="la">vis</foreign>, and seeing him at the games Cicero
            knew that he had been recalled by Caesar. See vol. i., p. 365. </note> and listened to
          the poems of Laberius and Publilius <note n="2" anchored="true">Decimus Laberius and

            <bibl n="Cic. Att. 14.2">Att. 14.2</bibl>). It is said that Caesar, who employed them in
            these games, taunted Laberius with being surpassed by the improvisations of the
            foreigner Syrus. A number of <foreign xml:lang="la">sententiae</foreign> or sententious
            verses are extant under the name of Syrus, and a fragment of his on luxury is preserved
            by Petronius Arbiter, § 55. Laberius died at <foreign xml:lang="la">Puteoli</foreign> in

          of so much as of some one with whom to laugh at these things in a confidential and

        <p> I read your letter with very great pleasure. The most gratifying thing in it was to
          learn that mine had reached your hands; for I felt no doubt that you would find pleasure
          in reading it. I was afraid it would not reach you. I learn from your letter that the war
          now raging in Syria and the province of Syria itself have been put in your hands by
          Caesar. I hope it may turn out to your honour and success. I feel confident that it will
          do so, for I have full reliance both on your activity and prudence. But what you <pb
            n="337"/> say as to the suspicion of a Parthian invasion caused me great uneasiness. For
          I was able to conjecture the amount of your forces, and your letter confirms my
          calculation. Therefore I can only hope that that nation will not move until the legions
          reach you, which I hear are on their way But if you have not forces adequate for the
          struggle, do not forget to follow the policy of M. Bibulus, who kept himself shut up in a
          very strongly fortified and well-supplied town, as long as the Parthians were in the
          province. <note n="1" anchored="true">There is a touch of malice in this suggestion.

          circumstances. For myself, I shall continue to feel anxious as to what you are doing,

        <p> Marcus Cicero<note n="2" anchored="true">There is really nothing to decide the exact
            date of these two letters to <foreign xml:lang="la">Orca</foreign>. The land commission
            referred to was established in the previous year (<date when="-0046">B.C. 46</date>),
            and the letters may possibly belong to that year. </note> greets Quintus Valerius, son
          of Quintus, legatus pro praetore. <note n="3" anchored="true">This was Orca's title as
            head of the land commission; he was "legate (i.e., of Caesar) with rank of praetor." For
            Caesar's use of public land for his veterans at this time, see <bibl n="Suet. Jul. 38"
              >Suet. Iul. 38</bibl>. </note> I have very close ties with the townsmen of Volaterrae.
          In fact, having received great kindness from me, they repaid me to the full: for they
          never failed me either in my prosperity or my adversity. And even if there were no special
          reason for our union, yet, having a very warm affection for you, and feeling that you have
          a high value for me, I should have warned and urged you to have a regard <pb n="338"/> for
          their fortunes, especially as their case for the retention of civil rights is unusually
          strong: first, because by the blessing of heaven they contrived to elude the vindictive
          measures of the Sullan epoch; and secondly, because my defence of them in my consulship
          received the hearty approval of the Roman people. <note n="1" anchored="true">The
            circumstances were these. <foreign xml:lang="la">Volaterrae</foreign> had taken the side
            of Marius against <foreign xml:lang="la">Sulla</foreign>, and offered a refuge to many
            of the defeated party. Owing to the advantages of its position, it had held out against
            a two years' siege by <foreign xml:lang="la">Sulla</foreign> (<date>B.C. <date to="-80"
                from="-81">81</date>-80</date>, <foreign xml:lang="la">Strabo</foreign>, 5, 2, 6;
            Livy, Ep. 89; <bibl n="Cic. S. Rosc. 20">Cic. pro Sext. Am. § 20). Sulla therefore
              carried a law disfranchising it and declaring its lands forfeited (pro Caec. § 18,
              104); but for some reason the lands thus made "public" were never divided among new
              owners (vol. i., p.54; </bibl><bibl n="Cic. Att. 1.19">Att. 1.19</bibl>). Attempts
            were, however, made by various land reformers to deal with the territory as public land.
            Cicero here says that he successfully resisted one of these in <date when="-0063">B.C.
              63</date>, and that in Caesar's <foreign xml:lang="la">lex agraria</foreign> of <date
              when="-0059">B.C. 59</date> it was specially exempted, and the full citizenship of the
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Volaterrani</foreign> acknowledged. </note> For the tribunes
          having promulgated an exceedingly unfair law about their lands, I easily persuaded the
          senate and people of Rome to allow citizens, whom fortune had spared, to retain their
          rights. This policy of mine was confirmed by the agrarian law of Gaius Caesar in his first
          consulship, which freed the territory and town of Volaterrae from all danger for ever.
          This makes me feel sure that a man who seeks the support of new adherents will wish that
          old benefits conferred by him should be maintained. It is only therefore what your
          prudence would dictate, either to keep to the precedent set by the man to whose party and
          authority you have with so much personal honour adhered, or at least to reserve the whole
          case for his decision. There is one thing about which you can have no hesitation: you
          would wish to have a town of such sound and well-established credit and of so honourable a
          character for ever bound to you by a service of the highest utility on your part.
            <milestone unit="para"/>Thus far the purpose of my words is to exhort and persuade you.
          What remains will be of the nature of a personal request. For I don't wish you to think
          that I offer you advice for your own sake only, but that I am also preferring a request to
          you and asking for what is of consequence to myself. Well then, you will oblige me in the
          highest degree, if you decide that the Volaterrani are to be left intact in <pb n="339"/>
          every respect and in full possession of their rights. Their homes and houses, their
          property and fortunes—which have already been preserved by the immortal gods, as well as
          by the most eminent citizens of our Republic with the warmest approval of the Roman
          people—I commend to your honour, justice, and liberality. If circumstances had granted me
          the power, proportionate to my old influence, of defending the Volaterrani in the same way
          as I was accustomed to protect my friends, there is no service, no struggle in fact
          calculated to be of use to them, that I would have omitted. But since I feel sure that
          with you I have no less influence than I ever had with all the world, I beg you in the
          name of close ties and of the mutual and equal goodwill existing between us, to serve the
          people of Volaterrae in such a way as to make them think that you have been set over that
          business by a special interposition of providence, as the one man with whom I, their
          undeviating supporter, was able to exert the greatest influence. </p>

        <p> CICERO greets Q. Valerius, legatus pro praetore. I am not sorry that my friendship for
          you is known as widely as possible. Not, however, that I wish on that plea—as you may well
          believe—to prevent your carrying out the business you have undertaken with good faith and
          activity, to the satisfaction of Caesar, who has intrusted to you a matter of great
          importance and difficulty. For though I am besieged with petitions from men who are
          assured of your kindness to me, I am always careful not to embarrass you in the
          performance of your duty by any self-seeking on my part. <milestone unit="para"/>I have
          been very intimate with Gaius Curtius from our earliest days. I was grieved at the most
          undeserved calamity which befell him and the others in the Sullan epoch: and <pb n="340"/>
          when it appeared that those who had suffered a similar wrong, though they lost all their
          property, were yet allowed by universal consent to return to their native country, I
          supported the removal of his disability. This man has a holding <note n="1"
            anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Possessio</foreign>, a term properly applied to the holding of
              <foreign xml:lang="la">ager publicus;</foreign> it was short of <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >dominium</foreign>, "absolute ownership." </note> in the territory of Volaterrae,
          having betaken himself to it as a kind of salvage from shipwreck. Recently also Caesar has
          selected him for a seat in the senate—a rank which he can scarcely maintain if he loses
          this holding. <note n="2" anchored="true">That is, with proper social distinction. It
            seems certain that at this time there was no legal qualification as to property
            necessary for a senator. </note> Now it is a great hardship that, having been raised in
          rank, he should occupy an inferior position in regard to wealth, and it is not at all
          consistent that a man who is a senator by Caesar's favour should be dispossessed of land
          which is being divided by Caesar's order. But I don't so much care to write at length on
          the legal merits of the case, lest I should be thought to have had influence with you
          owing to its strength rather than from your personal feeling for me. Wherefore I beg you
          with more than common earnestness to look upon Gaius Curtius's affair as mine; and
          whatever you do for my sake, I beg you to consider, though you have done it for Gaius
          Curtius, that I have from your hand what he has obtained through my influence. I reiterate
          this request with warmth. </p>

          <dateline>ROME (AUTUMN)</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> WHEN on your departure for Gaul you called at my house, as was natural from our close
          connexion and the great courtesy you have always shewn to me, I spoke to you about the
          land in Gaul which paid rent to the municipal town of Atella; and I indicated to you how
          warmly interested I was <pb n="341"/> in the welfare of that town. Since your departure,
          however; as a question has arisen as to a matter of great importance to this most
          respectable town-very closely connected with me—and as to the performance of a duty on my
          part, I thought I ought to write to you in more explicit terms. I am quite aware, however,
          of the nature of the circumstances' and the limits of your power, and clearly understand
          that what Caesar has assigned to you is the transaction of a certain business, not the
          exercise of judicial powers. <note n="1" anchored="true">That is, Caesar has commissioned
            him to divide certain lands, not to decide which are to be divided. </note> Therefore I
          only ask of you as much as I think that you have both the power and the will to do for my
          sake. And to begin with I would have you consider—what is the fact—that the whole wealth
          of the town consists of that rent, while in the present state of affairs it is
          hard-pressed by very serious burdens, and is labouring under the greatest difficulties.
          Although this seems to be a misfortune common to many others, I assure you that certain
          special calamities have befallen this particular municipality, which I don't specify for
          fear that, while bewailing the miseries of my own connexions. I should seem to be casting
          a reflexion upon certain persons upon whom I have no wish to do so. Accordingly, if I had'
          not had a strong hope of our being able to secure the approval of Gaius Caesar for the
          plea of this town, there would have been no reason for my making an effort at this time to
          secure any favour from you. But because I feel sure that he will take into consideration
          both the respectability of the town and the justice of its case, and also its good
          disposition towards himself, I have not hesitated to urge upon you to reserve this cause
          for his decision. This request I should nevertheless have made to you if I had never heard
          of your having done anything of the sort; yet I did conceive a stronger hope of gaining my
          request when I was told that the people of Regium had obtained the same favour from you.
          Although these latter have a certain connexion with you, yet your affection for me compels
          me to hope that the indulgence you extend to your own friends you will also extend to
          mine: especially as these are the only ones for whom I prefer the request, whereas I have
          a considerable <pb n="342"/> number of connexions who are in a similarly hard case. Though
          I think you believe that I am not doing this without good reason, and am not influenced by
          a frivolous and selfish motive in preferring this request, yet I would have you believe my
          definite assertion, that I owe a very great deal to this municipality, and that there has
          been no time either of my prosperity or adversity in which its zeal for my service has not
          been displayed in a remarkable manner. Wherefore again and again, in the name of our close
          union and of your unbroken and eminent affection for me, I ask and implore this of you
          with no common earnestness. Since you understand that the fortunes of a town are involved,
          which is very closely connected with me by ties of relationship, interchange of services
          and affection, do, if we obtain from Caesar what we hope, allow us to consider that we
          have obtained it by your kindness. But if we do not,. instead of that allow us to consider
          that at least you have done your best to enable us to obtain it. By doing this you will
          not only have greatly obliged me, but by a signal service you will have bound to yourself
          and your family men of the highest character, a number of the most honourable as well as
          the most grateful people, eminently worthy of being connected with you. </p>

        </opener>
        <p> As I was conscious of how much I valued you, and had had practical proof of your kind
          feeling towards me, I did not hesitate to make a request to you which it was incumbent
          upon me to make. How much I value P. Sestius I know in my own heart; how much I am bound
          to value him is known both to you and all the world. Having learnt from others that you
          were very much attached to me, he asked me to write in very explicit terms to you about
          the affair of <pb n="343"/> Gaius Albinius, a member of the senate, whose daughter is the
          mother of L. Sestius, a young man of very high character, the son of P. Sestius. My reason
          for writing this letter is to inform you that not only am I anxious on behalf of P.
          Sestius, but that Sestius is so also on behalf of Albinius. The case is this: Gaius
          Albinius received some properties from M. Laberius on a valuation, properties which
          Laberius had bought from Caesar forming part of the property of Plotius. If I should say
          that it was not in the interests of the state that those properties should be divided, I
          should appear to be trying to enlighten you rather than to be asking a favour of you.
          Nevertheless, since it is Caesar's will that the sales and assignments of land effected by
          Sulla should hold good, in order to give the impression of greater security to his own,
          pray what security can Caesar's own sales have, if properties are divided which he himself
          caused to be sold? However, that is a difficulty for your own wisdom to consider. My plain
          request to you—and I could not make it with greater earnestness or in a juster cause or
          more from the bottom of my heart—is that you should spare Albinius and not lay a finger on
          the properties of Laberius. You will not only cause me great delight, but will in a
          certain sense raise my reputation also, if I am the cause of Publius Sestius satisfying
          the claims of a man very closely connected with me, since I owe him more than anyone else
          in the world. I warmly and repeatedly beg you to do so. You cannot do me a greater favour:
          you shall have reason to know that I am exceedingly obliged by it. </p>

            grounds. </note> I am glad the sweating has done you good. If only Tusculum has done so
          also, good heavens! what a charm that would add to the place in my eyes! But if you love
          me, as you do, or make a very pretty imitation of doing—an imitation which quite answers
          its purpose-well, however that may be, nurse your health now, to which, while devoting
          yourself to my service, you have not been devoted enough. You know what it requires-good
          digestion, freedom from fatigue, moderate walking, friction of the skin, easy operation of
          the bowels. <note n="2" anchored="true">These words are given in Greek, as medical terms
            usually were. </note> Be sure you come back looking well. That would make me still
          fonder of Tusculum as well as of you. Stir up Parhedrus to hire the garden for himself: by
          doing so you will keep the actual gardener up to the mark. <note n="3" anchored="true">It

              <foreign xml:lang="la">Tusculum</foreign> wasn't doing well. Cicero says, "Get
            Parhedrus to take it-supplying what is wanted in the house as part rent—he will keep the
            workman up to his work. Helico is a great rascal not to do better by the garden, for he
            has had it at a small rent, never raised in spite of all the improvements which I have
            made. Parhedrus will pay more, and also be more satisfactory." </note> That utter
          scoundrel Helico used to pay a thousand sesterces, when there was no hot-bed, no water
          turned on, no wall, no garden-shed. Is he to have the laugh of us, after we have spent all
          that money? <pb n="356"/> Warm the fellow up, as I do Motho <note n="1" anchored="true"

              Cornelius Dolabella.</note>This momentous year opened apparently without any special
            signs of danger. Cicero was employed in finishing his <title>Tusculan
              Disputations</title>, and we have practically only one letter from him before the Ides
            of March (the others being mere letters of introduction of the usual formal kind). But
            in the one addressed to Curius, he takes occasion to shew his discontent at the regime.
            He seems to have been specially annoyed at the disparagement of the consular dignity
            involved in Caesar appointing Rebilus to that office for one day, the last of the year,
            in order to reward him by the rank of a consular. This calm was suddenly interrupted by
            the murder of Caesar, and Cicero immediately threw himself into politics again with the
            idea that the republic was restored. He soon found however that the regnum had not ended
            with the death of the rex, and that Antony had no intention of sinking into the position
            of a mere constitutional magistrate, to say nothing of the claims of the young
            Octavius—whom Cicero at first hoped to play off against Antony. From about June to the
            end of August therefore Cicero again avoided politics by visiting his villas and
            devoting himself to literature, intending also to visit his son at Athens. The <title>de
              Natura Deorum</title>, <title>de Divinatione</title>, <title>de Fato</title>,
              <title>de Senectute</title>, <title>de Amicitia</title>, <title>de Gloria</title>,
              <title>de Officiis</title>, and <title>Topica</title>, were all finished in this year,
            and probably in the first half of it. After the beginning of September he was engaged
            heart and soul in the leadership of the senatorial patty against Antony. The first four
            speeches against Antony (<title>Phil. 1-4</title>) were written and three of them
            delivered before the end of the year. The last letter to Atticus is written in December
            of this year. </p>

        <p> No, I now neither urge nor ask you to return home. Nay, I am longing myself to fly away

          the time when you fled from Rome. Though these things are painful even to hear of; yet
          after all hearing is more bearable than seeing. At any rate you were not on the Campus
          Martius when, the comitia for the quaestors being opened at 7 o'clock in the morning, the

            when Caesar resigned the consulship after his return from Spain. </note> —was set in its
          place, and then on his death being announced was removed: whereupon Caesar, who had taken
          the auspices as for a comitia tributa, held a comitia centuriata, <note n="2"
            anchored="true">It does not appear that any difference in the manner of taking the
            auspices was observed between the two assemblies, which after all were the same, though
            the manner of taking the votes was different. The quaestors were elected by the <foreign

              >centuriata</foreign>. </note> and between 12 and 1 o'clock announced the election of
          a consul to hold office till the 1st of January, which was the next day. Thus I may inform
          you that no one breakfasted in the consulship of Caninius. <note n="3" anchored="true"
            >Because his consulship ended at midnight, as the Roman civil day —like ours—did. C.
            Caninius Rebilus—who had been Caesar's legate in Gaul (vol. ii., p.219) and
            elsewhere-was only <foreign xml:lang="la">consul</foreign> for about eleven hours. The
            object, according to Tacitus, Hist. 3, 37, was to reward him for his services by this
            sort of brevet rank. </note> However, no mischief was done while he was consul, for he
          was of such astonishing vigilance that throughout his consulship he never had a wink of
          sleep. You think this a joke, for you are not here. If you had been you would not have
          refrained from tears. There is a great deal else that I might tell you; for there are
          countless transactions of the same kind. I in fact could not have endured them had I not
          taken refuge in the harbour of Philosophy, and had I not had my friend Atticus as a
          companion in my studies. You say you are his by right of ownership and legal bond, but
          mine in regard to enjoyment and profit: well, I am content with that, for a man's property

          the Dalmatian cold, which forced me out of that country, has again frozen me here.
          However, I will not give up till I have sooner or later got hold of him. Yet after all you
          are always setting me some hard task. You wrote something or other to me about Catilius

          waste so many countries! The fellow—half-ape and not worth twopence—took up arms against
          me, and I have taken him prisoner in war. But after all, my dear Cicero, what can I do? I

          punishment which I was going to inflict on him as my prisoner, I freely remit in deference

          of their property, the capture of their ships, the murder of their brothers, sons, and
          parents? Even if I had, by Jove, the impudence of Appius, into whose place in the college

          <milestone unit="para"/>Pray defend me at Rome if there is any occasion for it. Caesar is
          still treating me unfairly. He still doesn't bring any motion before the senate about the
          supplication in my honour, or about my Dalmatian campaign: as though my operations in
          Dalmatia did not in truth most thoroughly deserve a triumph! For if I have to wait until I
          finish the whole war, there are thirty ancient cities in Dalmatia; those which the
          Dalmatians have themselves annexed are more than sixty. If no supplication is to be

        <p>THOUGH I hope that I shall have many occasions for observing, what after all I have long
          ago observed, that I am beloved by you, yet you have now before you a case in which you
          have a ready means of shewing your goodwill towards me. Lucius Oppius, son of Marcus
          Philomelius, is a banker, and my intimate friend. I commend him to you in a special
          manner, and all the more so, that while I like the man himself, he is also manager of the
          business of L. Egnatius Rufus, my most intimate friend among the Roman knights, and one
          most closely united to me both by daily association and by very numerous and very
          important services. I therefore beg you to shew affection for Oppius who is with you, and
          protect the interests of Egnatius who is not, as earnestly as if it were my own business.
          In order to aid your memory I should like you to give him some sort of writing to be
          returned to you in the province. Write it in such a way that whenever you read it you may
          easily recall the earnestness of this recommendation of mine. I beg you warmly and
          repeatedly to do this. </p>

          my most intimate friend, L. Egnatius, who is not. He is so closely allied and so intimate
          with me, that I could not be more anxious if it were my own affair. Therefore you will
          very greatly oblige me if you take care that he understands that I am as much beloved by
          you as I think I am myself. You cannot possibly oblige me more, and I beg you warmly to do

        <p> I write to let you know our position. Yesterday evening Hirtius called on me, and told
          me about the disposition of Antony. It is of course as bad and untrustworthy as <pb n="2"
          /> possible. For he said that he could not give me my province, and did not think that it
          was safe for any of us to remain in Rome, considering the extreme irritation of the
          soldiery and the common people. I think you are aware that both these allegations are
          false, and that the truth is what Hirtius affirmed, namely, that Antony is afraid that, if
          we got even a moderate assistance in support of our position, there would be no part left
          for them to play in the state. Being in these straits I determined to demand a free
          legation <note n="1" anchored="true">See p. 26, and vol. i., p.110, note. </note> for
          myself and the rest of us, in order to obtain a decent excuse for leaving the City. He
          promised that he would procure it, but I don't feel sure that he will do so; for people
          are so unreasonable and the set against us is so strong. Even if they granted our request,
          I yet think that before long we should be declared public enemies and forbidden water and
          fire. <milestone unit="para"/>"What, then," you say, "is your advice?" We must yield to

          fairly well we will live in exile; if the worst comes to the worst, we will have recourse
          to extreme measures in our support. <note n="3" anchored="true">That is, take up arms
            against the government. </note> Perhaps it will here occur to one of you—why should we
          wait for the worst, rather than make some attempt at once? Because we have no one to
          depend upon for safety except Sextus Pompeius and Caecilius Bassus, <note n="4"
            anchored="true">Sext. Pompeius had a large fleet in Sicily and neighbouring islands.

          still more determined when they hear the news about Caesar. It will be soon enough for us
          to join them when we know their strength. If you wish me to give any undertaking for
          Cassius and yourself, I will give it: for Hirtius demands that I should do so. I beg you
          to answer this letter as promptly as possible—for I have no doubt that Hirtius will inform
          me on these points <note n="5" anchored="true">That is, as to the <foreign xml:lang="la"

          tell me where we can meet and to what place you wish me to come. <milestone unit="para"
          />After my last Conversation with Hirtius I decided to ask that we should be allowed to
          remain at Rome under the protection of a state guard. I don't think they will concede
          that; for we shall be casting a grave slur upon them. However, I thought I must not omit
          to make any demand which I considered equitable. </p>

          His nationality made me think that he was a proper person to whom to give it: unless he
          too has availed himself of the licence of candidates and has suddenly adopted this
          surname. However, the modesty of his look and the gravity of his conversation seemed to me
          to smack somewhat of Cures. <note n="1" anchored="true">Cicero is referring to the
            primitive manners and morals of the Sabines—often celebrated by Horace. The reference to
            the possible assumption of a name after the manner of candidates is believed to refer to
            Ventidius Bassus having done so in his canvass this year for the praetor. ship. </note>
          But enough about Sabinus. <milestone unit="para"/>Since at your departure, my dear
          Trebonius, while wishing to aid me to bear with greater patience my warm regret for your
          absence, you only poured a good deal of oil on the fire of my love for you, pray bombard
          me with frequent letters on the understanding that I will do the same to you. There are,
          however, two reasons why you should be more regular in performing that service than
          myself: First, that in old days those remaining at Rome were accustomed to write on public
          affairs to their friends in the provinces; whereas you are now bound to write to us: for
          the Republic is there. Secondly, because I have the opportunity of serving you during your
          absence in other ways, while I do not see how you can do that for me except by letters.
          But you must write on other matters to me afterwards; at present the first thing I desire
          to know is what sort of journey you are having; where you have seen our friend Brutus, how
          long you have been together. Presently, when you have got farther on your way, you must
          write to me about military affairs, and the whole business, that I may know how we <pb

            beginning of <date when="-0045">B.C. 45</date>. It is no doubt strange that, writing to
            one of the assassins, Cicero should not refer to Caesar's death or the change it had
            made. But there are reasons against thinking that the journey referred to was that which
            Trebonius took to <foreign xml:lang="la">Narbo</foreign>, for that was in <date

            hardly have said that he relied entirely on Trebonius for authentic information as to
            the Spanish campaign; whereas he went to Asia with a full understanding with the
            Anti-Caesarians that he was to organize a force in Asia to aid <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Brutus</foreign> and Cassius. The Orator was no doubt now a year and a half old; but
            Trebonius may have asked for a copy on his joumey, for he was in Spain when it first

          mutiny has now been put down in such a way that I think we shall be secured for all time,
          at any rate from that most degrading of dangers. Things still remaining to be done are
          both important and numerous; but they all rest with you three. However, let me expound
          each in its turn. Well then, as far as we have gone as yet, we seem not to have been freed
          from a tyranny—only from a tyrant: for though the tyrant has been killed, we obey his
          every nod. And not only so, but measures which he himself, had he been alive, would not
          have taken, we allow to pass on the plea that they were meditated by him. And to this
          indeed I see no limit: decrees are fastened up; immunities are granted; immense sums of
          money are squandered ; <note n="1" anchored="true">For these accusations against Antony,
            see 2 Phil. §§ 93-98. </note> exiles are being recalled; forged decrees of the senate
          are being entered in the aerarium. Surely then nothing has been accomplished except to
          dispel the indignation at our slavery and the resentment against an unprincipled man: the
          Republic still lies involved in the confusions into which he brought it. These are all
          questions demanding your solution; and you must not think that the Republic has had all it
          can claim from you three. It has had indeed more than it ever occurred to me to desire,
          but it is not content yet. Its demands are great in <pb n="37"/> proportion to the
          greatness of your spirits and of your services. Up to the present it has avenged its
          injuries by the death of the tyrant through your hands: nothing more. Which of its
          dignities has it recovered? Is it that it now obeys the man in his grave whom it could not
          endure in his life-time? Do we support the rough drafts of a man, whose laws we ought to
          have torn down from the walls? "But"—you will say—"we so decreed in the senate." <note

              <foreign xml:lang="la">acta</foreign> were confirmed. See p.17. </note> Yes, we did so
          as a concession to the exigencies of the time, which always been of decisive importance in
          politics. But they are abusing our concession without moderation or gratitude. However, of
          this and much else before long when we meet. Meanwhile, I would have you feel fully
          persuaded that, both for the sake of the Republic—always the object of my greatest
          devotion—and for the sake of our mutual affection, your position in the state is the
          object of the greatest importance in my eyes. Take great care of your health. </p>

          <salute>GAIUS TREBONIUS TO CICERO</salute>
          <dateline>ATHENS, 25 MAY</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> IF you are well, I am glad. I arrived at Athens on the 22nd of May, and there, as I was
          very anxious to do, I saw your son devoting himself to the best kinds of learning, and
          enjoying an excellent reputation for steadiness. How much pleasure that gave me you can
          imagine without a word from me: for you are not ignorant of my high esteem for you, and
          how much our very old friendship and very sincere affection make me rejoice in everything
          good that happens to you, however small, to say nothing of such a great blessing as this.
          Do not imagine, my dear Cicero, that I send you this report merely to please you. Nothing
          could be more popular with everybody at Athens than your young man-indeed I should call
          him ours, for I can have no interest disconnected with yourself. Nor could there be
          greater devotion than his to the studies which you love above everything, that is, to the
          most excellent. Accordingly, as I can do with sincerity, I am delighted to congratulate
          you—and myself quite as much—that we have in him, whom we should be obliged to love in any
          case, whatever his conduct, one whom we can love with pleasure as well. In the course of
          conversation he remarked to me that he would like to visit Asia, and was not only invited
          but pressed by me to do so if possible while I was governing the province. You ought to
          have no doubt that in affection and love I shall be a father to him in your place. Another
          thing I shall take care of is that Cratippus accompanies him, that you may not imagine him
          in Asia as taking a complete holiday from the studies to which he is inspired by your
          admonitions. For though I see that he is fully prepared, and has already taken a great
          stride in that direction, I will not omit my exhortations, to induce him to make farther
          progress every day by learning and keeping himself in practice. <pb n="59"/>
          <milestone unit="para"/>What you at home are doing in politics I am at the moment of
          despatching this quite ignorant. I hear rumours of certain revolutionary proceedings: but
          I hope they are false, that we may at length have the enjoyment of liberty and peace-two
          things that up to now have really never fallen to my lot. However, as I got a brief time
          of repose during my voyage, I have composed a trifle to send you, as I had designed to do.
          I have included in it a bon mot of yours which implied a high compliment to myself, and
          have added a footnote ascribing it to you. In these poor verses, if I seem to you in
          certain passages to be un peu libre, the abominable character of the man against whom I am
          too freely inveighing will plead my excuse. You will also pardon my passion, which is no
          more than is right against people of that kind, both as men and as citizens. Again, why
          should Lucilius have been allowed to claim this amount of liberty any more than ourselves
          ? <note n="1" anchored="true">The great freedom with which Lucilius (<date>B.C. <date
                to="-103" from="-148">148</date>-103</date>) attacked living people is noticed by
            Juvenal (i. 165) and Persius (i. 114). The epigrams or satire of Trebonius appear to
            have been directed against Antony, who afterwards expressed satisfaction at the death
            which before many months were over he met with at the hands of <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Dolabella</foreign> (<bibl n="Cic. Phil. 13.22">Phil. 13.22</bibl>). </note> For even
          if his wrath against the objects of his attack was as keen as ours, those objects
          themselves were certainly not more deserving of being attacked with all that freedom of
          speech. In return I claim your promise of being introduced in one of your dialogues at the
          earliest opportunity. For I feel certain that, if you write anything about Caesar's death,
          you will not allow me to sustain the least distinguished part either in actual deed <note
            n="2" anchored="true">Trebonius did not actually strike a blow in the assassination, but
            was employed in keeping Antony at a distance under pretence of making him some
            communication. </note> or in the expression of your affection. Good-bye. I commend my
          mother and family to your care. <milestone unit="para"/>Athens, 25 May. <pb n="60"/>

        <p> Brutus and Cassius, praetors, to M. Antonius, consul. If we had not been convinced of
          your honour and kind feeling to ourselves, we should not have written this letter to you.
          And this being the state of your mind, you will, we feel sure, receive it with all
          possible favour. Our correspondents inform us that a crowd of veterans has already
          collected at <pb n="64"/> Rome, and that there will be a much greater one there by the 1st
          of June. <note n="1" anchored="true">See pp. 48, 90, for Antony's picked guard. </note> If
          we entertained any doubt or fear of you, we should be untrue to ourselves. But since we
          have put ourselves in your hands, and under your advice have dismissed our friends from
          the country towns, and done so by a circular letter as well as by an edict, we have a
          claim to be admitted to your confidence, especially in a matter which touches ourselves.
            <milestone unit="para"/>Wherefore we beg you to let us know what your feeling towards us
          is: whether you think that we shall be safe in the midst of such a crowd of veteran
          soldiers, who, we hear, even think of replacing the altar. <note n="2" anchored="true">The
            altar and column erected by the pseudo-Marius in the forum on the spot where Caesar's
            body had been burnt. <foreign xml:lang="la">Dolabella</foreign> had removed it. See
            pp.33, 35, 40. </note> That is a thing which we think that hardly anyone can wish or
          approve, who desires our safety and honour. The result shews clearly that our aim from the
          first was peace, and that we have had no other object than the liberty of all. No one can
          beguile us except yourself, and that is a course of conduct quite alien to your virtue and
          honour. But no one else has the means of deceiving us: for it is you alone that we have
          trusted and intend to trust. Our friends are disturbed by a very great alarm on our
          account. For though they have every confidence in your good faith, they yet cannot help
          reflecting that the crowd of veteran soldiers can be more easily moved by others in any
          particular direction, than they can be held back by you. We ask you to write back and
          explain everything. For the suggestion that notice has been given to the veterans to
          appear, because you intended to bring in a law about their pensions in June, is wholly
          inadequate and meaningless. For whom do you think likely to hinder it, since in regard to
          ourselves we have made up our minds to do nothing whatever? We ought not to be thought by
          anyone too greedy of life, since nothing can happen to us without general disaster and
          confusion. <pb n="65"/>

            named in the will took formal possession of the estate, and the party who would be heir
            if there was no will agreed to pay down some forfeit of money if the decision was
            against him. The question then nominally tried was, "had the praetor given such a
            decision?" Of course the real question tried was the validity of the will, which in this
            case turned on the question whether <foreign xml:lang="la">Turpilia</foreign> had
            satisfied all the formal requirements for enabling a woman to make a valid will. </note>
          he remarked, that Servius's doctrine was that a will made by a party who had not the legal

        <p> WHEN I was hesitating—as my friend Atticus knows-about the entire idea of my journey,
          because many considerations on both sides kept occurring to my mind, your judgment and
          advice had great weight in clearing away all feeling of hesitation: for not only did your
          letter express your opinion frankly, but Atticus also conveyed to me what you had said by
          word of mouth. It has ever been my opinion that nothing could exceed your wisdom in
          conceiving or your honesty in imparting advice. I had a supreme instance of this when I
            <pb n="89"/> wrote to consult you at the beginning of the civil war as to what you
          thought I ought to do—go to Pompey, or stay in Italy. You advised me to consider what was

          honesty and conscientiousness in giving advice. For though you thought that your dearest
          friend would wish it to be otherwise, your duty to me was of superior importance in your
          eyes to his wishes. For my part, even before that time I was attached to you, and always
          felt that you were attached to me. And when I was abroad and in the midst of great
          dangers, I remember that both I myself in my absence and my family who were at home
          enjoyed your attentions and protection. Again, after my return I can call all who usually
          observe such things to witness on what intimate terms you have been with me, and what
          feelings I have both entertained and avowed in regard to you. But the weightiest
          expression of your judgment as to my honour and consistency was given by you when, after
          Caesar's death, you devoted yourself heart and soul to my friendship. If I fail to justify
          that judgment by displaying the warmest affection for you and serving you in every
          possible way, I shall regard myself as a monster of ingratitude. Pray, my dear Oppius,
          maintain your love for me—though, after all, I say this more because it is usual to say
          it, than from an idea that you need to be reminded—and continue to protect all my
          interests. As to what they are I have charged Atticus to enlighten you. As soon as I have
          secured a little leisure you may expect a longer letter from me. Take good care to keep
          well; you cannot oblige me more than by doing that. <pb n="90"/>

        <p> Velia seemed to me the more charming because I perceived that you were popular there.
          But why name you, who are a universal favourite? Even your friend Rufio, upon my word, was
          as much in request as though he had been one of us. But I don't blame you for having taken
          him away to superintend your building operations; for although Velia is as valuable as the
          Lupercal, yet I would rather be where you are than own all your property here. If you will
          listen to me, as you usually do, you will keep this paternal estate—for the Velians seemed
          a little afraid that you wouldn't—and will not abandon that noble stream, the Hales, nor
          desert the Papirian mansion—though that other has a famous lotus <pb n="110"/> which
          attracts even foreign visitors, but which would after all much improve your view if it
          were cut down. But, above all, it seems a most desirable thing, especially in such times
          as these, to have as a refuge in the first place a town whose citizens are attached to
          you, and in the second place a house and lands of your own, and that in a retired,
          healthy, and picturesque spot. And this, my dear Trebatius, is to my interest also, I
          think. But keep well and see to my affairs, and expect me home D.V. before the winter. I

        <p> SEE how greatly I value you: and it is no more than your due, for I do not surpass you
          in affection. However, what I almost refused, or at any rate did not give you, when you
          were with me, I could not make up my mind to continue to owe you now that you are away.
          Accordingly, no sooner had I begun my voyage from Velia than I set to work to translate
          Aristotle's Topica, having been reminded by the sight of a city so warmly attached to you.
          I send you this book from Rhegium written in as clear a style as the subject admitted. But
          if certain parts appear to you to be somewhat obscure, you must reflect that no art can be
          learnt out of books without some one to explain it and without some practical exercise in
          it. You will not have to go far for an instance. Can the art of you jurisconsults be
          learnt out of books? Though there are a great number of them, they yet require a teacher
          and actual practice. However, if you read this with attention and repeatedly, you will be
          able to grasp the whole subject by yourself—at least so far as to <pb n="113"/> understand
          it. But that such loci communes should at once occur to your own mind upon any question
          being proposed, you can only secure by practice. To this, indeed, I shall keep you, if I
          get home safe and find things safe at Rome. <milestone unit="para"/>28 July, Rhegium. </p>

        </opener>
        <p> NAPLES, 4 AUGUST If you are well, we are glad. We have perused a letter from you very
          closely corresponding to your edict-insulting, threatening, and not at all such as should
          have been addressed to us by you. We have not, Antonius, used any words of insult to you,
          nor did we suppose that you would be surprised if as praetors and men of such rank we had
          demanded in an edict something of a consul. But if you feel indignation at our having
          ventured to do so, at least allow us to feel aggrieved that even this much is refused by
          you to a Brutus and a Cassius. For as to the holding of levies and demanding money
          contributions, tampering with armies and sending couriers across sea—of which you say that
          you have not complained—we of course believe that your action has been dictated by the
          best motives. Nevertheless, we do not acknowledge any one of these allegations, and we
          feel surprised that, after restraining your tongue on these matters, you have not been
          able to refrain from taunting us in your anger with the death of Caesar. Rather consider
          yourself how intolerable it is that praetors are not allowed for the sake of peace and
          liberty to announce in an edict that they waive their rights, without the consul
          threatening them with armed violence. By relying on arms you cannot daunt us: for it is
          neither right nor fitting for us to allow our courage to be overborne by any danger, nor
          ought Antonius to expect to tyrannize over those by whose action he is a free man. If
          other <pb n="119"/> considerations impelled us to wish for a civil war, your letter would
          not have had any effect upon the question: for words of menace have no weight with free
          men. But you know full well that we cannot be driven in any direction, and perhaps you use
          menaces in that matter to give what is the result of our deliberate judgment the
          appearance of fear. Our feeling is that, while we desire you to have a great and
          honourable position in a free state, and do not challenge you to any quarrel, we yet value
          our liberty higher than your friendship. Consider again and again what you are taking upon
          yourself, what you are capable of maintaining, and be careful to consider not how long
          Caesar lived, but how long he reigned. We pray the gods that your designs may be for the
          safety of the Republic; if not, we hope that they may damage your-self as little as is
          consistent with its safety and honour. <milestone unit="para"/>4 August. </p>

        </opener>
        <p> I have not yet been able to make up my mind whether Trebatius—kind man and devoted
          friend of us both-brought me more pain or pleasure. The fact is that I having reached
          Tusculum in the evening, early next day he <pb n="123"/> called on me: though he was not
          fully recovered. I scolded him for not being sufficiently considerate of his weak health:
          but he said that nothing had been more wearisome to him than waiting to see me. "Nothing
          fresh happened, has there?" said I. Then he told me of your grievance. But before I answer
          it I will put before you a few facts. As far back as I can remember I have no older friend
          than your-self. But after all the length of a friendship is something in which many others
          share. Not so warmth of affection. I became attached to you the first day I knew you, and
          formed the opinion that you were attached to me. After that your absence—which was a very
          prolonged one—my own official career, and the different line we took in life did not allow
          our inclinations to be cemented by a constant intercourse. Nevertheless, I had proof of
          your affection for me many years before the civil war, when Caesar was in Gaul. For you
          secured what you were strongly of opinion was to my advantage and not without advantage to
          Caesar himself—that the latter should like me, pay me attention, and rate me among his
          friends. I pass over instances in those times of words, letters, and various
          communications of the most friendly character passing between us. For a more dangerous
          crisis followed: and at the beginning of the civil war, when you were on your way to
          Brundisium to join Caesar, you came to call on me at Formiae. How much that implies in
          itself, to begin with, especially at such a crisis! And in the next place, do you suppose
          that I have forgotten your advice, conversation, and kindly interest? And in these I
          remember that Trebatius took part. <note n="1" anchored="true">For a joint letter from
            Matius and Trebatius acquainting Cicero with Caesar's movements in <date when="-0049"

          whether you call it shame or duty or fortune compelled me to go abroad to join Pompey.
          What service or zeal was wanting on your part, either towards myself when away from town,
          or my family, who were still there? Whom did all my family regard as more warmly attached

          forgotten with what speed you flew to me from Tarentum, as soon as you heard of it? Or, of
          how patiently you sat by my side, talked to me, and strengthened my courage, which had
          been broken by the dread of the universal ruin? At length our residence at Rome began:
          could anything be more intimate than we were? In questions of the first importance I
          consulted you as to my attitude towards Caesar, and in other matters availed myself of
          your good offices. Setting Caesar aside, whom else but me did you so far distinguish as to
          visit constantly at home, where you often spent many hours in the most delightful
          conversation? And it was then too, if you remember, that you instigated me to write these
          philosophical works. After Caesar's return, was there any object dearer to you than that I
          should be on the terms of closest friendship with him? And this you had accomplished.
            <milestone unit="para"/>To what end, therefore, is this preamble which has run to
          greater length than I anticipated? Why, to explain my surprise that you, who were bound to
          have known all this, should have believed me capable of having done anything incompatible
          with our friendship. For besides these facts, which are well attested and as clear as the
          day, I could mention many others of a more secret nature, such as I can hardly express in
          words. Everything about you gives me pleasure: but above all your surpassing fidelity in
          friendship, the prudence, trustworthiness and consistency of your character, as well as
          the charm of your manners, the cultivation of your intellect, and your knowledge of
          literature. <milestone unit="para"/>This being understood, I return to your statement of
          grievance. That you voted for that law <note n="2" anchored="true">We have no certain
            indication of what law is meant. It may mean the law which gave Antony <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Gallia Cisalpina</foreign> and the Macedonian legions </note> I at first
          refused to believe. In the next place, if I had believed it, I should never have believed
          that you did so without some sound reason. Your rank makes it inevitable that whatever you
          do should be noticed: while the ill-nature of the world causes certain things to be
          represented in a harsher light <pb n="125"/> than your actions have really warranted. If
          you never hear such observations I don't know what to say. For my part, whenever I hear
          them I defend you, as I know that I am always defended by you against my detractors. Now
          my line of defence is twofold. There are some statements which I meet with a blank denial,
          as about that very vote of yours. Others I defend on the ground of the loyalty and
          kindness of your motives, as in regard to the superintendence of the games. <note n="1"
            anchored="true">See p.52. </note> But it does not escape a mind so highly cultivated as
          yours that, if Caesar was a tyrant—as I think he was-two opposite theories are capable of
          being maintained in regard to your services. One is mine—when I hold that your loyalty and
          kindness are to be commended for shewing affection to a friend, even after his death. The
          opposite theory, advanced by some, is that the liberty of our country is to be preferred
          to the life of a friend. From such discussions as these I only wish that the arguments I
          have advanced had come to your ears! Two other points, which above everything else redound
          to you reputation, no one could put oftener and with more satisfaction than I do: that
          your voice was the strongest both against beginning the civil war, and for moderation in
          victory. And in this I have never found anyone who did not agree with me. Therefore I am
          grateful to our friend Trebatius for giving me an excuse for writing this letter. And if
          you do not believe in it, you will thereby condemn me as wanting in duty and good feeling:
          than which nothing can be more discreditable to me or more foreign to your own character.

        <p> Your letter gave me great pleasure by convincing me that your opinion of me was what I
          had hoped and wished that <pb n="126"/> it should be. And although I had no doubt about
          that, yet, as I valued it very highly, I was anxious that it should remain intact. I was,
          moreover, conscious in my own mind of having done nothing calculated to wound the feelings
          of any good man. Therefore I was all the less inclined to believe that a man of your many
          splendid qualities could be induced to adopt any opinion inconsiderately, especially as my
          good feeling towards you had always been, and still was, heartfelt and uninterrupted. As
          then I know this to be as I wished it to be, I will now answer the charges, which—as was
          natural from your unparalleled kindness and our friendship-you have often rebutted in my
          behalf. <milestone unit="para"/>Now I am well acquainted with the allegations made against
          me since Caesar's death. People blame me for shewing grief at the death of a dear friend,
          and expressing my indignation that the man whom I loved had been killed. For they say that
          country should be preferred to friendship, as though they had actually proved that his
          death has been beneficial to the Republic. Well, I will speak frankly. I confess that I
          have not attained to that height of philosophy. For in the political controversy it was
          not Caesar that I followed, but it was a friend whom—though disapproving of what was being
          done—I yet refused to desert. Nor did I ever approve of a civil war, nor of the motive of
          the quarrel, which in fact I strove my utmost to have nipped in the bud. Accordingly, when
          my friend was victorious I was not fascinated by the charm either of promotion or of
          money-rewards upon which others, though less influential with him than I was, seized with
          such intemperate avidity. In fact, even my own personal property was curtailed by the law
          of Caesar, <note n="1" anchored="true">There were two financial laws of Caesar's, one in
              <date when="-0049">B.C. 49</date>, which provided for the payment of loans-minus
            interest—by transferring property at a valuation, and regulated the proportion of money
            to be invested in Italian land (<bibl n="TLG551.17 3.48">App. B.C. 3.48</bibl>; Caes.
            B.C. iii. I; Dio, 41, 38); and a second of <date when="-0047">B.C. 47</date>, remitting
            certain proportions of house and land rent in Rome and Italy (Dio, 42, 51; <bibl
              n="Suet. Jul. 38">Suet. Iul. 38</bibl>). Matius may be referring to either or both. He
            lost by them, being an investor rather than a borrower of money. See vol. iii., pp.93,
            98. </note> thanks to which most of those who now exult in Caesar's death maintained
          their position in the state. I was as anxious that conquered citizens should be spared as
          I was for my own safety. Wishing therefore the preservation of all, could <pb n="127"/> I
          fail to be indignant that the man by whose means that preservation had been secured had
          perished? Especially when the very same men had caused both the feeling against him. and
          the death which befell him. "Well then," say they, "you are assailed for venturing to shew
          your disapprobation of our deed." What unheard—of tyranny! One party are to boast of a
          crime, others are not to be allowed even to grieve at it with impunity! Why, even slaves
          have always been free to fear, to rejoice, and to grieve at their own will rather than at
          the behest of another-emotions of which, to judge from the frequent remarks of your
          champions of liberty, they are now endeavouring to deprive us by force. But they are
          throwing away their labour. I shall never be deterred from duty and humanity by the
          threats of any danger. For I have convinced myself that an honourable death is never to be
          shunned, is often even to be sought. But why are they angry with me for wishing them to
          repent of what they have do e? For I desire Caesar's death to be regretted by all. 'But,"
          say they, "I ought as a citizen to desire the safety of the Republic." If my past life and
          future hopes do not prove me—without my saying a word—to desire that, I do not expect to
          convince them by anything I can say. Therefore I ask you with more than usual earnestness
          to regard facts as more convincing than words; and if you think it good for the world that
          right should prevail, to believe that I can have nothing in common with criminals. The
          principles which I maintained as a young man, when I might have had some excuse for going
          wrong, am I now that my life is drawing to its close entirely to change and with my own
          lips to give the lie to my whole career? I will not do so! Yet I will not act in a way to
          cause offence farther than by avowing my grief at the hard fate of one so deeply loved,
          and a man of such extraordinary distinction. But if I were otherwise disposed I would
          never deny what I was doing, lest I should get the reputation of being at once
          unscrupulous in committing crime, and timid and false in disavowing it. <milestone
            unit="para"/>"But," say they, "I superintended the games given by the young Caesar in
          honour of Caesar's victory." That is a matter of private obligation with no constitutional
          significance. Yet, after all, a service which I was bound to <pb n="128"/> render to the
          memory of a dear friend even after his death, I could not refuse to the request of a young
          man of very great promise and in the highest degree worthy of Caesar. <milestone
            unit="para"/>I have also frequently been to the house of the consul Antonius to pay my
          respects. Yes, and those who now regard me as unpatriotic you will find going there in
          crowds to prefer some petition or to pocket some bounty. But what insolence is this that,
          whereas Caesar never interfered with my being intimate with whom I chose, even with those
          whom he personally disliked, these men who have torn my friend from me should now
          endeavour by their captious remarks to prevent my loving whom I choose? But I have no fear
          either of the regularity of my life not being sufficient to protect me hereafter, or of
          those very men who hate me for my constancy to Caesar not preferring to have friends like
          me rather than like themselves. For myself, if I get what I like, I shall spend the
          remainder of my life in retirement at Rhodes: but if some accident intervenes, though I am
          at Rome I shall always desire the right to prevail. I am very much obliged to our friend
          Trebatius, for having shewn me your true-hearted and affectionate feeling towards myself,
          and for having given me additional reasons for being still more bound to cultivate and
          respect a man for whom I have always felt a spontaneous affection. Good-bye, and do not
          cease to love me. </p>

        <p> After I had been anxiously expecting letter-carriers day after day, at length they
          arrived forty-six days after they left you. <note n="1" anchored="true">This was slow
            travelling. Cicero speaks of twenty-one days being very rapid travelling for a
            letter-carrier from Rome to Athens (vol. ii., p. 201), but more than double of that
            implies bad weather or very leisurely movements. </note> Their arrival was most welcome
          to me: for while I <pb n="129"/> took the greatest possible pleasure in the letter of the
          kindest and most beloved of fathers, still your most delightful letter put a finishing
          stroke to my joy. So I no longer repent of having suspended writing for a time, but am
          rather rejoiced at it; for I have reaped a great reward in your kindness from my pen
          having been silent. I am therefore exceedingly glad that you have unhesitatingly accepted
          my excuse. I am sure, dearest Tiro, that the reports about me which reach you answer your
          best wishes and hopes. I will make them good, and will do my best that this belief in me,
          which day by day becomes more and more en evidence, shall be doubled. Wherefore you may
          with confidence and assurance fulfil your promise of being the trumpeter of my reputation.
          For the errors of my youth have caused me so much remorse and suffering, that not only
          does my heart shrink from what I did, my very ears abhor the mention of it. And of this
          anguish and sorrow I know and am assured that you have taken your share. And I don't
          wonder at it! for while you wished me all success for my sake, you did so also for your
          own; for I have ever meant you to be my partner in all my good fortunes. Since, therefore,
          you have suffered sorrow through me, I will now take care that through me your joy shall
          be doubled. Let me assure you that my very close attachment to Cratippus is that of a son
          rather than a pupil: for though I enjoy his lectures, I am also specially charmed with his
          delightful manners. I spend whole days with him, and often part of the night: for I induce
          him to dine with me as often as possible. This intimacy having been established, he often
          drops in upon us unexpectedly while we are at dinner, and laying aside the stiff airs of a
          philosopher joins in our jests with the greatest possible freedom. He is such a man—so
          delightful, so distinguished—that you should take pains to make his acquaintance at the
          earliest possible opportunity. I need hardly mention Bruttius, whom I never allow to leave
          my, side. He is a man of a strict and moral life, as well as being the most delightful
          company. For in him fun is not divorced from literature and the daily philosophical
          inquiries which we make in common. I have hired a residence next door to him, and as far
          as I can with my poor pittance I subsidize his narrow means. Farthermore, I have begun <pb
            n="130"/> practising declamation in Greek with Cassius; in Latin I like having my
          practice with Bruttius. My intimate friends and daily company are those whom Cratippus
          brought with him from Mitylene—good scholars, of whom he has the highest opinion. I also

          that sort. So now you know how I am going on. <milestone unit="para"/>You remark in your
          letter on the character of Gorgias. The fact is, I found him very useful in my daily
          practice of declamation; but I subordinated everything to obeying my father's injunctions,
          for he had written ordering me to give him up at once. I wouldn't shilly-shally about the
          business, for fear my making a fuss should cause my father to harbour some suspicion.
          Moreover, it occurred to me that it would be offensive for me to express an opinion on a
          decision of my father's. However, your interest and advice are welcome and acceptable.
          Your apology for lack of time I quite accept; for I know how busy you always are. I air
          very glad that you have bought an estate, and you have my best wishes for the success of
          your purchase. Don't be surprised at my congratulations coming in at this point in my
          letter, for it was at the corresponding point in yours that you told me of your purchase.
          You are a man of property! You must drop your city manners: you have become a Roman
          country-gentleman. How clearly I have your dearest face before my eyes at this moment! For
          I seem to see you buying things for the farm, talking to your bailiff, saving the seeds at
          dessert in the corner of your cloak. But as to the matter of money, I am as sorry as you
          that I was not on the spot to help you. But do not doubt, my dear Tiro, of my assisting
          you in the future, if fortune does but stand by me; especially as I know that this estate
          has been purchased for our joint advantage. As to my commissions about which you are
          taking trouble-many thanks! But I beg you to send me a secretary at the earliest
          opportunity—if possible a Greek; for he will save me a great deal of trouble in copying
          out notes. Above all, take care of your health, that we may have some literary talk
          together hereafter. I commend Anteros to you. <note n="1" anchored="true">This amusing

          would suit many students in all universities. The account of his reformation is therefore

          arms of the most violent and headstrong of men: in which neither senate nor people has any
          power of control: in which there are neither laws nor law courts <note n="1"
            anchored="true">Two proposals of Antony's were looked upon by Cicero as fatal to the
            working of the law courts: (1) the addition of a <foreign xml:lang="la"

          have not only maintained but have even increased, seemed to demand that I should admonish
          and exhort you to devote yourself heart and soul to the service of the Republic. If it
          survives till your term of office, all will be plain sailing. But that it should so
          survive demands not only great assiduity and care on your part, but also great good
          fortune. <milestone unit="para"/>But to begin with we shall have you with us, I hope, a

        <p> I was very glad to see Furnius for his own sake, but all the more glad because in
          listening to him I seemed to be listening to you. He vividly described your valour in war,
          the justice of your administration in the province, and the wisdom you displayed in every
          department. He mentioned besides—what our association and intimacy had not left me
          ignorant of—the courtesy of your manners, as well also as your very liberal conduct to
          himself. All these were very pleasant hearing to me: the last roused my gratitude also.
            <milestone unit="para"/>I have had, my dear Plancus, a close bond of friendship with
          your family, formed a considerable time before you were born, a personal affection for you
          from your boyhood, and, when you grew up, an intimacy begun from inclination on my part
          and from deliberate judgment on yours. For these reasons I take extraordinary pains to
          support your political position, which I am convinced ought to be associated with my own.
          You have attained to the highest distinctions in every department, virtue shewing the way,
          and fortune marching by your side. And these you have won though you had many detractors,
          whom you have baffled by your talents and industry. At present, if you will listen to
          me—who love you dearly and yield to no one in his claim to be a closer and older friend
          -you will look for every advancement in the rest of your life from the best possible
          settlement of the constitution. You know of course—for it could not possibly have escaped
          you—that there has been a period during which people thought you too much inclined to
          yield to the circumstances of the time. I should have thought so, too, had I thought that
          you approved of the things to which you submitted. But as I well knew your real
          sentiments, I considered that it was <pb n="135"/> only that you saw the limits of your
          power. Now the case is different. The decision on all points is in your own hands and is
          unfettered. You are consul-designate: at the prime of life: a first-rate orator. And all
          this when the state is unusually destitute of men of this sort. In the name of Heaven,
          throw yourself heart and soul into the measures calculated to bring you reputation and
          glory. The one path to glory, especially at a time like this, when the Republic has been
          harassed to death for so many years, is that of honest administration. It was my personal
          affection that impelled me to write this to you, rather than any idea of your needing
          admonition and precept. For I know that you imbibed them from the same fountains as
          myself. Therefore I will put a period to these exhortations. For the present I thought I
          should only give a hint—rather to shew you my affection than to display my wisdom.
          Meanwhile I will attend with zeal and minute care to whatever I think will affect your
          high position. </p>

          I should say "we" are condemned: for that madman asserts that I was the head and front of
          that most glorious deed of yours. Would that I had been! He would not have been troubling
          us now. <note n="2" anchored="true">Cicero often repeats this sentiment, that if he had
            been one of the assassins, he would have killed Antony also. See, e.g., <bibl
              n="Cic. Phil. 2.34">Phil. 2.34</bibl>; supra, p.46. </note> But it is you and your
          fellows who are responsible for this: and since it is past and done with, I only wish I
          had some advice to give you. But the fact is, I cannot feel satisfied even of what I
          myself ought to do. For what is possible against force without having any force oneself?
          Now the gist of this policy of theirs is to punish the death of Caesar. Accordingly, on
          the 2nd of October, being introduced to an assembly by Cannutius, Antony got indeed a very
          sorry reception: still, he did deliver himself of remarks about the saviours of the
          country which ought only to have been made about traitors. As to me, indeed, he declared
          outright both that you had acted and that Cannutius was acting in everything on my advice.
          You may judge of the rest from the fact that they have deprived your legatus of his
          travelling money. <note n="3" anchored="true">Though <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Dolabella</foreign> had gone to take possession of the province of Syria, Cassius
            still meant to possess himself of it in value of his appointment in Caesar's time.
            Meanwhile that appointment had been cancelled by the senate, and he had been nominated
            to <foreign xml:lang="la">Cyrene</foreign>, and could therefore have <foreign
              xml:lang="la">legati</foreign>, and a legal allowance for them. Antony no doubt
            interfered because he knew that Cassius would not go to <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Cyrene</foreign>, but would defy this <foreign xml:lang="la">senatus
              consultum</foreign> and go to Syria (Appian B.C. iii. 8, 12). </note> What explanation
          of that do you suppose that they give? They say, forsooth, that it is being conveyed to a
          public enemy! What a grievous thing, that we could not endure a master, and yet are slaves
          to a fellow slave! Yet after all, though my will is better than my hopes, there does
          remain even now some hope in your valour. But where to get forces? As to the future I
          would rather you consulted your own feelings, than listened to words of mine. <pb n="139"

        <p> Tratorius has explained to me the whole state of the case regarding your governorship
          and the position of your province. How many intolerable things are being done in all
          quarters! But considering your high rank, the treatment accorded to you is still less
          endurable. For because you put up with these things in the loftiness of your spirit and
          character without excessive irritation, they none the less call for your vengeance, even
          though they do not sting your heart. But of this at a future time. <note n="1"
            anchored="true">Q. Cornificius had gone as governor to Africa in <date when="-0045">B.C.
              45</date> (vol. iii., p. 200). A law of Caesar's had limited a praetorian province to
            one year. But though Antony had caused that law to be revoked (<bibl n="Cic. Phil. 1.19"
              >Phil. 1.19</bibl>), a successor had yet been nominated to Cornificius in the person
            of C. Calvisius Sabinus (praetor <date when="-0043">B.C. 43</date>), who had already
            been there before Cornificius (3 Phil § 26), and was a devoted Caesarian. See infra,
            Letter DCCCXXII. </note>
          <milestone unit="para"/>I feel sure that a gazette of transactions in the city reaches
          you. If I had not thought so I would have written an account of them myself, and first and
          foremost of the attempt made by Octavianus. In regard to this the common people think it a
          charge trumped up by Antony, as an excuse for making an inroad upon the young man's money.
          Men of the world, however, and loyalists both believe that it took place and approve of
          it. <note n="2" anchored="true">Whether Octavian did really countenance the attempt to
            assassinate Antony is a matter of much dispute. Appian (<bibl n="TLG551.17 3.39">B.C.
              3.39</bibl>) denies it, shewing that it was not in his interest to get rid of Antony
            at this time. Plutarch (Ant. 16) disbelieved it, and Nicolas (vit. Aug. 30), who
            probably gives Octavian's own version, says that Antony invented both plot and the
            report inculpating Octavian, who, as soon as be heard of it, went to Antony's house and
            offered to act as one of his guard. Suetonius (Aug. 10) of course believes it. See also
            Seneca, <foreign xml:lang="la">de</foreign> Clem. i. 9, 1. Cicero evidently had no
            definite knowledge on the subject. I am myself inclined to the version of Nicolas that
            the whole thing was a deliberate canard. </note> In short, I have great hopes <pb
            n="140"/> of him. There is nothing he may not be expected to do in future for fame and
          glory's sake. Antonius, however, our whilom intimate friend, feels himself to be the
          object of such violent dislike, that though he caught the assassins within his own doors,
          he does not venture to make the fact public. On the 9th of October he set out to meet the
          four Macedonian legions, which his idea is to win over to his side by money-bounties, to
          lead them to the city, and station them as fetters for our necks. <note n="1"
            anchored="true">There were six legions stationed in Macedonia by Caesar with full
            complement of cavalry and equipment for the Getic and Parthian wars. Antony first
            extorted from the senate the command of them on the plea that the <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Getae</foreign> were threatening Macedonia. Having surrendered one of the legions to
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Dolabella</foreign>, he shortly afterwards asked the senate to
            give him Cisalpine Gaul instead of Macedonia—which was to be transferred to his brother
            Gaius. The senators-seeing how they were entrapped—refused, but Antony carried it over
            their heads by a <foreign xml:lang="la">lex</foreign>: and then sent Gaius to bring over
            the four legions, leaving one for the protection of Macedonia. With these he proposed to
            drive Decimus <foreign xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign> from Cisalpine Gaul, which the
            senate secretly instigated <foreign xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign> to retain. See <bibl

          indeed it was at least possible to hope: now even that is snatched from us. For what hope
          can there be, when Antony ventures to say in a public meeting that Cannutius is "seeking a

          For being careful to pay such attentions I have innumerable reasons, whether I look to the
          close ties between our fathers, or my reverence for you which began with my childhood, or
          your mutual affection for me. Wherefore, my dear Cicero; as far as our respective ages
          permit, Convince yourself that you are the one man whose society has enabled me to
          maintain the purity of life of which my father gave me an example. Therefore all the
          counsels you give are, in my eyes, inspired not more by wisdom—though in that they are
          supreme-than by loyal friendship, which I gauge by person. It was either never renewed, or
          subsequent letters have been all lost. These are the last words that have come to us of a
          correspondence between two men among the most remarkable existing for its continuity, as
          well as for its candour and complete unreserve. The remainder of the correspondence,
          though it carries us through almost the most momentous and exciting months ever
          experienced in Rome, has indeed all the agitation and stir of life, but lacks the note of
          complete confidence and self-revelation of the letters to Atticus. <pb n="162"/> my own
          heart. Supposing me then to be otherwise minded, your reprimand at any rate would have
          been sufficient to stop me: or supposing me to be hesitating, your exhortation would have
          sufficed to force me to follow the course which you thought to be the most honourable. As
          it is, however, what is there to draw me in a different direction? Whatever advantages I
          possess, whether bestowed upon me by the kindness of fortune or acquired by my own labour,
          though your affection induces you to value them with partial kindness, are yet so great in
          the judgment even of my bitterest opponent, that they lack nothing but the good opinion of
          the world. Wherefore, if you were ever sure of anything, be sure of this—whatever effort
          my bodily strength, whatever provision my mental powers, whatever impression my personal
          influence, are capable of making—all these shall ever be at the service of the Republic.
          Your sentiments are not unknown to me: and if I had the opportunity—as I wish with all my
          heart I had—of seeing you face to face, I should never have dissented from your policy;
          nor even as it is will I allow any act of mine to deserve your just rebuke. I am anxiously
          awaiting news from every quarter, to learn what goes on in Cisalpine Gaul, or in the city,
          when January comes. Meanwhile my greatest anxiety and concern here are lest, instigated by
          the malpractices of others, these tribes should regard our difficulty as their
          opportunity. But if my success equals my deserts, I shall at any rate satisfy the

          <dateline>ROME (DECEMBER)</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> MARCUS CICERO to Decimus Brutus, imperator, consul-designate. At the time that our
          common friend Lupus reached Rome, and during his few days' residence there, I was in the
          part of the country in which I thought I should be safest. That was the reason of Lupus
          returning to you without a letter from me, though he had nevertheless seen to yours being
          conveyed to me. I arrived at Rome, however, on the 9th of December, and my first object
          was an immediate visit to Pansa. His report of you was everything I could desire.
          Wherefore you require no encouragement, since in the execution of that great deed-surely
          the greatest known to history-you required none. Yet I think I ought briefly to point out
          that the Roman people looks entirely to you, and places on you its whole hope of
          eventually recovering its liberty. If you—as I am sure is the case-remember day and night
          how great a deed you have done, you certainly will not forget what great ones remain for
          you to do. For if the man now gets hold of your province—a man with whom I was always on
          friendly terms till I found that he was not only openly at war with the Republic, but glad
          to be so—I can see no hope of safety left. Wherefore I join my prayers to those of the
          people and senate of Rome, beseeching you to free the Republic from a tyrannical
          despotism, in order that you may end as you began. This is your task, this the part you
          have to play. It is from you that the state or rather all nations of the world-not only
          expect this, but even demand it. Since, however, as I said above, you do not need
          encouragement, I will not waste many words upon it. I will do no more than promise you—as
          in duty bound—all my services, zeal, care, and thought, which will henceforth be devoted
          to enhancing your fame and glory. Therefore pray convince yourself of this: not only for
          the sake of the <pb n="164"/> Republic, which is dearer to me than life itself, but also
          because I am devoted to you personally and desire the farther improvement of your
          political position, I will nowhere fail to support your loyal policy, your greatness, or
          your glory. </p>

        <p> I have received a letter from you in duplicate, which in itself shews me how careful you
          are: for I understood that you were anxious that a letter which I most ardently desired
          should reach my hands. From this letter I received a double satisfaction, such that it is
          difficult for me to decide by any comparison, whether to regard your affection for me or
          your loyalty to the Republic as the more valuable. As a general truth affection for one's
          country is, in my judgment at least, the greatest thing of all; but personal love and
          sympathy find certainly a softer place in our heart. Therefore your recalling the
          friendship of our fathers and the affection which you have bestowed on me from your
          childhood, and all the other circumstances accompanying that feeling, gave me the keenest
          pleasure. Again, the revelation of the sentiments which you entertain towards the Republic
          and intend to maintain was most delightful to me, and my joy was all the greater because
          it came in addition to what you had said before. Accordingly, my dear Plancus, I do not
          merely exhort you—I go so far as actually to entreat you—as I did in the letter to which
          you have made such an exceedingly kind answer—to throw yourself with all your soul and
          with every impulse of your heart into the cause of the Republic. There is nothing that can
          bring you higher reward or greater glory, nor is there anything that a human being can do
          more splendid or brilliant than to deserve well of the Republic. I say this because as
          yet—for your consummate kindness <pb n="165"/> and wisdom permit me to speak my sentiments
          with candour—you seem to have accomplished the most splendid achievements with the support
          of fortune; and though you could not have done so without personal merit, yet to a great
          extent those achievements are commonly put down to fortune and the circumstances of the
          time. But in a crisis of such supreme difficulty as the present, whatever help you give to
          the Republic will be wholly and peculiarly your own. You could scarcely believe how all
          citizens, except the rebel party, detest Antony. High hopes are placed on you and your
          army-great expectations. In heaven's name, do not let slip the opportunity for gaining
          such popularity and glory! I counsel you as a father might a son: I am as eager for your
          honour as for my own: I exhort you with the fervour inspired by my country's cause and the
          knowledge of your devoted friendship. </p>

        <p> LUPUS having brought both Libo and your cousin Servius to see me at my town house, I
          think that you will have learnt from Marcus Seius, who was present at our conversation,
          what opinion I expressed. The rest you will be able to learn from Graeceius, though he did
          stay long behind Seius. But the head and front of it all is that I wish you most carefully
          to notice and to remember that you must not wait to be authorized by the senate in
          preserving the safety of the Roman people, for the senate is not yet free. If you do so,
          in the first place you condemn your own action, for you freed the Republic without any
          public authority—which makes it still more glorious-and, in the second place, you decide
          that this young man, or rather this boy, Caesar has acted without justification in having
          assumed such a grave public responsibility on his own initiative. Lastly, you convict of
          madness those who are indeed rustics, but yet are most <pb n="166"/> gallant soldiers and
          loyal citizens <note n="1" anchored="true">Caesar's veterans, who had been settled in
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Campania</foreign>. See p.145. </note> —in the first place
          veterans who have served with you of old, and in the next place the Martian and the fourth

          safety of the Republic. The wishes of the senate must be regarded as its authorization,
          since that authorization is prevented by fear. Lastly, you have now twice espoused this
          cause: first on the Ides of March, and again recently by collecting a new army and new
          forces. Wherefore you ought to be prepared for everything, and inspired with the
          resolution not to decline doing anything without instructions, but to do what will secure
          universal praise and the greatest admiration. </p>

        <p> OUR friend Lupus, having reached Rome on the sixth day from Mutina, came to call on me
          next morning and delivered your message to me in the most explicit terms and gave me your
          letter. When you commend the defence of your political position to me, I regard you as at
          the same time commending to me my own, which, by heaven, I do not regard as dearer to me
          than yours. Wherefore you will be doing me the greatest favour, if you will regard it as a
          settled thing that no counsel or zeal on my part will ever be wanting in the promotion of
          your reputation. The tribunes of the plebs having given notice of a meeting of the senate
          for the 20th of December, and designing to make a proposal for <pb n="167"/> the
          protection of the consuls-designate, though I had resolved not to attend the senate before
          the 1st of January, yet as your edict also was put up on that same day, I thought that it
          would be shocking either that a meeting of the senate should be held without any mention
          being made of your brilliant services to the Republic—which would have been the case had I
          been absent—or that, if anything complimentary to you were said, I should not be there to
          support it. Accordingly, I went to the senate early, and when that was observed there was
          a very full house. The motion I made in regard to you in the senate, and the speech I made
          in a very crowded public meeting, I should prefer your learning from the letters of
          others. <note n="1" anchored="true">The speech delivered by Cicero in the senate is that
            known as the third Philippic, the speech in the public meeting as the fourth Philippic.
            The speech in the senate ended with a series of resolutions, or rather a resolution in
            several heads (§§ 37-39): <list type="simple">
              <item>(1) C. <foreign xml:lang="la">Pansa</foreign> and A. Hirtius, the

              <item>(2) In regard to the edict of <foreign xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign> his
                services are to be commended, and he-like the other governors—is to hold his
                province for the full term of his appointment by the <foreign xml:lang="la"
                  >lex</foreign> Iulia, and until successors are named by the senate. </item>
              <item>(3) The action of Octavian (whom he now calls Gaius Caesar) in raising the
                veterans is to be commended, and also that of the Martian and fourth legions, as
                done in the defence of senate and people.</item>

        <p> HERE at Rome we are waging war with the most abandoned, gladiator in the world, our
          colleague <note n="1" anchored="true">That is, colleague in the college of augurs.
            "Gladiator" is the favourite term of abuse of Antony. See 2 Phil. §§ 7, 63; p.136.
          </note> Antony, but not on equal terms, for it is words against arms. Nay, he even goes so
          far as to make speeches against you: but he won't do that with impunity, for he will be
          made to feel what sort of men he has attacked. For myself, I imagine that all public
          occurences are detailed to you in the letters of others: what you should learn from me is
          the future, as to which the conjecture is not difficult. It is a scene of universal
          depression: the loyalists have no leader, and our tyrannicides are in remote regions.
          Pansa both entertains excellent sentiments and speaks with courage. Our friend Hirtius is
          somewhat slow in recovering his health. What will happen I do not know at all: my one
          hope, however, is that the Roman people will at last shew itself worthy of its ancestors.
          I at least will stand by the Republic, and whatever happens—as long as I have nothing for
          which to blamee myself—I will bear with a brave heart. This at least I will do to the best
          of my ability: I will support your reputation and political position. On the 20th of
          December a very full meeting of the senate supported my motion, which among other matters
          of great importance confirmed the retention of the provinces by the actual holders, and
          prohibited their being handed over to any successors, except those nominated by a decree
          of the senate. <note n="2" anchored="true">See last letter. </note> This motion was made
          by me in the interests of the Republic, but also, I assure you, with the primary object of
          sustaining your position. Therefore I beg you for the sake of our affection, I exhort you
          in the name of the Republic, not to suffer anyone to exercise any jurisdiction in your
          province, <pb n="169"/> and to act in all respects with an eye to your official position,
          which is paramount to everything. I will be frank with you, as our friendship demands. If
          you had obeyed my letter in the case of Sempronius, <note n="1" anchored="true">What had
            happened about Senipronius is not known. Cicero thought that Cornificius had in some way
            either allowed him to do something illegal, or assumesome illegal position in his
            province. See pp. 186, 193. </note> you would have received the loudest praise from
          everybody. But that is past and is not very important: but that you should keep your
          province in its obedience to the Republic is a matter of great gravity. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">A decree of the senate had transferred the province of Africa to C.
            Calvisius (<bibl n="Cic. Phil. 3.26">Phil. 3.26</bibl>), but Cicero regards that as
            canceled by the resolution moved at the end of his speech on the 20th of December. The
            other transactions he holds to have been carried out under comulsion from Antony.

        <p> YOUR letter contained a remarkable castigation of my idleness. For what my brother had
          written in more reserved terms—no doubt from modesty and haste-you have written to me
          without mincing matters and in accordance with the facts. This is specially the case in
          regard to the consuls-designate, whom I know thoroughly to be compact of vice and the most
          womanish weakness. If they do not quit the helm, there is the greatest danger of universal
          shipwreck. You could scarcely believe what I know of those men having done in the summer
          camp in face of the Gallic laager. And that ruffian Antony, unless some firm step is
          taken, will win them over by the infection of his vices. We must make a stand by aid of
          the tribunes or by an understanding between unofficial persons. For as to those two
          fellows—they are scarcely fit, the one to have charge of Caesena, the other of the vaults
          of Cossutius's wine-shops. <note n="1" anchored="true">"Hirtius would hardly do to command
            a small frontier town (<foreign xml:lang="la">Caesena</foreign> is on the Rubicon),
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Pansa</foreign> can scarcely be trusted to look after
            wine-cellars, as he is given to drink." Hirtius was the author of the eighth book of the
            commentaries on the Gallic War, and both he and <foreign xml:lang="la">Pansa</foreign>
            were with Caesar in Gaul, but neither is mentioned in any way. Yet Caesar must have
            thought well of them, for he constantly employed and promoted them. </note> You, as I

            possessed by us is dated not later than the 27th of July: he was murdered on the 7th of
            December. For the last four months of his life therefore we have nothing from him to
            tell us of the events leading up to his death. But up to the battle of Forum Gallorum
            (15th of April) we have letters from or to Cicero which carry us through the exciting
            events of the early months. Antony's investment of Decimus Brutus in Mutina: the
            negotiations between him and the senate, the march to the relief of Mutina of Octavian,
            and the consuls Hirtius and Pansa successively, and the final battles which compelled or
            induced Antony to raise the siege of Mutina and march away to Gallia Narbonensis. But it
            only lets us see the beginning of the subsequent collapse of the senatorial hopes. How
            Decimus Brutus failed to retain the support of Octavian, and in his vain pursuit of
            Antony—after being first joined and then deserted by Plancus—found his army melt away,
            till he lost his own life. How Antony, reinforced by Ventidius Bassus, was joined first
            by Lentulus and then by Pollio, and finally by Plancus in Narbonensis. How Octavian,
            having first marched upon Rome and forced an unwilling senate to allow him to be
            returned consul, then came to terms with Antony and Lepidus, ostensibly to attack whom
            he had again marched from Rome. How the triumvirate was arranged, nominally as a corn
            mission of reform, really to override the constitution itself, and the terrible
            vengeance the three were to take upon their enemies—and upon the Ciceros among the
            first. Cicero, though of course he could not foretell the exact course which events were
            to take, yet well knew that he and his party were in the gravest danger. His one hope
            was in provincial governors known to be favourable to the constitution and in command of
            forces-especially Cornificius in Africa, Cassius in Syria, and Marcus Brutus in
            Macedonia. We find him therefore to the last exhorting them to come to Italy with their
            troops, that the senate might resist possible attacks from Antony and deal with a free
            hand with Octavian. But when on Octavian's entry into Rome (August) Cicero made his last
            despairing effort to collect the senate and organize an opposition, he must have known
            that all hope was over, and he probably spent the next two months in retirement at
            Tusculum, till he heard of the triumvirate and the proscription lists. Cicero's literary
            work was now all over; but the Philippic Speeches (5-14) belong to the first four months
            of this year, and represent vividly to us the progressive steps in the quarrel with
            Antony. <pb n="172"/>

            Antony while encamped before <foreign xml:lang="la">Mutina</foreign>. This measure had
            been proposed on the 1st ofJanuary, but successfully resisted by Cicero (fifth
            Philippic): it was, however, carried on the 6th, and Servius Sulpicius, L. <foreign

            in the course of the negotiations, and the other two brought back a very uncompromising
            answer. See the eighth Philippic. </note> of whose success there is as yet no news.
          However, I thought I ought to write and tell you this much: the senate and people of Rome
          are very anxious about you, not merely for the sake of their own security, but also for
          that of your political position. In fact the affection in which your name is held is
          remarkable, and the love of all the citizens for you is unparalleled. For they rest great
          hopes in you, and feel confident that as you formerly freed the Republic from a tyrant you
          will now free it from a tyranny. A levy is being held in Rome and throughout Italy, if it
          is to be called a levy, when all offer themselves spontaneously. Such is the enthusiasm
          which has taken possession of men's minds from a yearning for liberty and a loathing for
          their long-continued slavery. On other matters we ought by this time to be expecting a
          despatch from you telling us what you and our friend Hirtius are doing, and my dear
          Caesar, both of whom I hope will be before long united to you in the fellowship of
          victory. All that remains for me to say is what I prefer your learning from the letters of
          your family, as I hope you do—that I am not failing in any particular to support your
          position, and will never do so. <pb n="173"/>

        <p> I OMIT no opportunity—as is indeed my bounden duty-not only of sounding your praises,
          but even of securing you marks of distinction. But my exertions on your behalf I prefer
          being known to you from the letters of your family rather than from my own. Nevertheless,
          I exhort you, on your part, to throw yourself heart and soul into the cause of the
          Republic. This is the proper task of a spirit and a character such as yours: it is this
          which is called for by the hope, which you ought to entertain, of enhancing your position.
          But on this point at greater length at another time. For at the moment of writing this
          everything is in a state of suspense. The ambassadors have not yet returned, whom the
          senate sent, not to beg for peace, but to proclaim war in case he did not comply with the
          message of its emissaries. Nevertheless, as soon as the opportunity was afforded me, I
          spoke in defence of the constitution in my old style. I put myself forward as a leader of
          the senate and Roman people: nor have I since thus undertaking the cause of freedom lost a
          single moment in supporting the common safety and liberty. But this, too, I should prefer
          your learning from others. I commend Titus Pinarius to you—my most intimate friend-with an
          earnestness beyond which I cannot go. I am very much attached to him for all his high
          qualities as well as for the tastes which we have in common. He is managing the accounts
          and business affairs of our friend Dionysius, of whom you are very fond, while I regard
          him as one of the first of men. This recommendation ought not to require any word of mine,
          yet I make it all the same. Pray therefore let me learn from Pinarius's letters—that most
          grateful of men—of your kind ness both to him and Dionysius. <pb n="174"/>

        <p> I could wish that you had invited me to the banquet of the Ides of March: there would
          have been nothing left over! As it is, your leavings give me much trouble-yes, me more
          than anybody. Though our consuls are splendid, our consulars are utterly shameful. Though
          the senate is courageous, it is the lowest in rank that are most so. Nothing, indeed, can
          surpass the resolute bearing of the people, and of all Italy with one accord. Nothing, on
          the other hand, can well be more scandalous and unprincipled than our emissaries Philippus
          and Piso. For having been sent to deliver to Antony certain definite orders, in accordance
          with the vote of the senate, upon his refusing to comply with one of them, they have
          brought back to us some intolerable demands on his part. <note n="1" anchored="true">This
            is the subject of the eighth Philippic delivered on the 3rd of February. Antony's
              <foreign xml:lang="la">postulata</foreign> are discussed in §§ 25-58. They included:
            (1) amnesty for all proceedings of the past year; (2) confirmation of his consular
              <foreign xml:lang="la">acta;</foreign> (3) lands for his soldiers; (4) no inquiry as
            to the money taken from the temple of <foreign xml:lang="la">Ops;</foreign> (5) the
            amnesty to include all his agents and friends; (6) the governorship of <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Gallia Comata</foreign> for five years with six legions. In return he
            will give up <foreign xml:lang="la">Gallia Cisalpina</foreign>. </note> The result is
          that my house is thronged, and that though I am supporting a sound constitutional measure,
          I have now become a popular hero. <milestone unit="para"/>But what you are doing or
          intending to do, even where you are, I do not know. Report will have it that you are in
          Syria. But there is no confirmation of it. About M. Brutus, as he is less remote, news
          seems more trustworthy. Dolabella is being soundly abused by the wits for being so prompt
          in relieving you before you had been full thirty days in Syria. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Dolabella</foreign> had spent some time in Asia on his way to
            Syria. The murder of Trebonius took place on the 2nd of February. He then went on to
            Syria. The quidnuncs spoke jestingly of his Opposition to Cassius </note> So all are
          agreed that he ought not to be <pb n="175"/> admitted into Syria. You and Brutus are both
          highly commended because you are thought to have collected an army beyond what was hoped.
          I would have written at greater length, had I known the facts and the real state of the

        <p> How I could wish that you had invited me to that most glorious banquet on the Ides of
          March! We should have had no leavings! While, as it is, we are having such a trouble with
          them, that the magnificent service which you men then did the state leaves room for some
          grumbling. In fact, for Antony's having been taken out of the way by you—the best of
          men—and that it was by your kindness that this pest still survives, I sometimes do feel,
          though perhaps I have no right to do so, a little angry with you. For you have left behind
          an amount of trouble which is greater for me than for everyone else put together.
            <milestone unit="para"/>For as soon as a meeting of the senate could be freely held,
          after Antony's very undignified departure, <note n="1" anchored="true">When Antony had met
            the legions from Macedonia at <foreign xml:lang="la">Brundisium</foreign>, he preceded
            them with a strong detachment to Rome, arriving between the 15th and 22nd of November,
            his main body of troops being ordered to muster at <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Tibur</foreign>. He ordered in an edict a meeting of the senate un the 23rd, but did
            not appear, having put off the meeting by another edict to the 28th. He, however, only
            transacted some formal business—a <foreign xml:lang="la">supplicatio</foreign> in honour
            of Lepidus, and a <foreign xml:lang="la">sortitio</foreign> of the provinces—and then
            hurriedly left the city for <foreign xml:lang="la">Tibur</foreign>, probably on hearing
            of the desertion of the two legions. </note> I returned to that old courage of mine,
          which along with that gallant taking over the province, as though he were "succeeding" to
          the governorship, without allowing his predecessor even the thirty days beyond his year
          given him by the Julian law. <pb n="176"/> citizen, your father, you ever had upon your
          lips and in your heart. For the tribunes having summoned the senate for the 20th of
          December, and having brought a different piece of business before it, I reviewed the
          situation as a whole, and spoke with the greatest fire, and tried all I could to recall
          the now languid and wearied senate to its ancient and traditional valour, more by an
          exhibition of high spirit than of eloquence. <note n="1" anchored="true">This is the
            speech known as the third Philippic. </note>
          <milestone unit="para"/>This day and this earnest appeal from me were the first things
          that inspired the Roman people with the hope of recovering its liberty. And had not I
          supposed that a gazette of the city and of all acts of the senate was transmitted to you,
          I would have written you out a copy with my own hand, though I have been overpowered with
          a multiplicity of business. But you will learn all that from others. From me you shall
          have a brief narrative, and that a mere summary. Our senate is courageous, but the
          consulars are partly timid, partly disaffected. <note n="2" anchored="true">Cicero had
            advocated in the senate on the 1st and following days of January the most uncompromising
            hostility to Antony, the fullest recognition of Octavian and of the action of the two
            legions, and of Decimus <foreign xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign>. But he could not get
            his motion passed, the embassy to Antony being voted on the 7th, as a tentative measure
            before <foreign xml:lang="la">pro-</foreign> ceeding to extremities. </note> We have had
          a great loss in Servius. <note n="3" anchored="true">Servius Sulpicius Rufus, who died
            while on the mission in Antony's camp, near <foreign xml:lang="la">Mutina</foreign>.
          </note> Lucius Caesar entertains the most loyal sentiments, but, being Antony's uncle, he
          refrains from very strong language in the senate. The consuls are splendid. Decimus Brutus
          is covering himself with glory. The youthful Caesar is behaving excellently, and I hope he
          will go on as he has begun. You may at any rate be sure of this—that, had he not speedily
          enrolled the veterans, <note n="4" anchored="true">See p.145. </note> and had not the two

          from Antony's army to his command, and had not Antony been confronted with that danger,
          there is no crime or cruelty which he would have omitted to practise. Though I suppose
          these facts to have been told you, yet I wished you to know them still better. I will

        <p> Your friend Rufus, on whose behalf you have now twice written to me, I would have
          assisted to the best of my power, even if he had done me an injury, when I saw that you
          were so anxious in his favour. Since, however, both from your letter and from one which he
          has himself written to me, I perceive and am convinced that my safety has been a matter of
          much anxiety to him, I cannot fail to be his friend: and that not solely from your
          recommendation which has deservedly the greatest weight with me—but also from my own
          feeling and deliberate judgment For I wish you to know, my dear Paetus, that your own
          letter was the -origin of suspicion, caution, and careful inquiry on my part; and I
          afterwards received other letters from many quarters which were of like tone to yours. For
          both at Aquinum and Fabrateria plots were laid against me, of which I perceive that you
          have had some information; and as though these men divined how much trouble I was likely
          to give them, their design was nothing short of my complete ruin. Being then totally
          unsuspicious of this, I should have been more off my guard, had I not received this hint
          from you. Therefore that friend of yours requires no recommendation with me. Heaven send
          that the future of the Republic be such as to make it possible for him to appreciate my
          extreme gratitude! But enough of this. <milestone unit="para"/>I am sorry to hear that you
          have given up going out to dinner: for you have deprived yourself of a great source of
          amusement and pleasure. Again, I am even afraid-you'll allow me to speak frankly—that you
          will unlearn and partly forget that habit of yours—the giving of little dinners! For if
          even when you had models on which to form yourself, you made so little progress in the
          art, what am I to expect <pb n="178"/> of you now? <note n="1" anchored="true">Playful
            irony, for Paetus gave good though not extravagant dinners (vol. iii., p.98). </note>
          Spurinna, indeed, when I told him about it and described your former way of living,
          pointed out the serious danger to the state if you did not recur to your old habits with
          the first breath of Spring. It might, he said, be endured at this time of year, if you
          could not stand the cold! But, by Hercules, my dear Paetus, without joking I advise you to
          cultivate the society of good, agreeable, and affectionate friends, for that is the secret
          of happiness. Nothing, I say, is more satisfying or contributes more to a happy life. And
          I do not found this on mere pleasure, but on the social intercourse and companionship, and
          that unbending of the mind which is best secured by familiar conversation, nowhere found
          in a more captivating form than at dinner-parties. This is more wisely indicated by us
          Latins than by the Greeks. The latter talk of<foreign xml:lang="grc">sumpo/sia</foreign>
          and <foreign xml:lang="grc">su/ndeipna</foreign>, that is, "drinkings together" and
          "suppings together," we of "living together" (convivium), because in no other circumstance
          is life more truly lived than in company. <note n="2" anchored="true">Cicero is quoting
            ftom his own essay on Old Age. See <foreign xml:lang="la">de</foreign> Sen. § 45. For
            his liking for dinner-parties, see vol. iii., p.103. </note> Do you see I am using
          philosophy to try and lure you back to dinners? Take care of your health: that you will
          secure with least difficulty by dining out. But pray, as you love me, don't suppose that
          because I write jestingly I have cast off all care for the state. Be assured, my dear
          Paetus, that I work for nothing, care for nothing all day and night except the safety and
          freedom of my fellow citizens. I omit no occasion of warning, pleading, adopting
          precautions. In fact, my feeling is that, if I have to give my very life to this task and
          to pushing these measures, I shall think myself supremely fortunate. Goodbye! Good-bye!

        <p> I SUPPOSE that the winter has as yet prevented us from getting any certain news from
          you, as to what you are doing, and above all where you are. Nevertheless, it is the
          general talk—the wish, no doubt, is father to the thought—that you are in Syria and in
          possession of forces. That statement finds the readier belief that it seems likely in
          itself. Our friend Brutus for his part has gained a brilliant reputation: for his
          achievements have been so great and unexpected that, while welcome in themselves, their
          distinction was enhanced by their rapidity. <note n="1" anchored="true">Referring to M.
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign> having collected an army, occupied Greece,

              B.C. 3.79</bibl>; Dlo, 47, 21 sq.). </note> But if you command the extent of territory
          which we suppose, the Republic has gained very strong supports. For from the nearest shore
          of Greece as far as Egypt we shall have been put under the protection of the authority and
          forces of the most loyal citizens. However, unless I am mistaken, as the situation now
          stands, the ultimate decision of the whole war seems to rest with Decimus Brutus. If he,
          as we hope, breaks cut from Mutina, I think there will be a complete collapse of the war.
          The forces at present besieging him are very small, because Antony is occupying Bononia
          with a large army. Our friend Hirtius, moreover, is at Claterna, <note n="2"
            anchored="true">Modern Quaderna, on the Aemilian road between Forum Cornelium and
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Bononia</foreign> (Bologna). </note> Caesar at Forum Cornelium,
          both with a strong army; while Pansa has collected large forces at Rome from the levy in
          Italy. Winter has at present prevented any movement. Hirtius seems likely to do nothing,
          as he tells me in frequent letters, without careful preparation. Except Bononia, Regium
          Lepidi, and Parma, we have the whole of Gaul devoted heart and soul to the constitution.
          Even your clients the Transpadani we find attached to the cause with <pb n="180"/>
          surprising unanimity. The senate, with the exception of the consulars, is most resolute,
            <note n="1" anchored="true">The surviving consulars were in several cases those who had

          rest, some are inactive and some disloyal A certain number are envious of the reputation
          of those whom they see to be held in honour in the Republic. But the unanimity of the
          Roman people and the whole of Italy is wonderful. This is pretty well all which I wanted
          you to know. My present hope and prayer is that the sun of your valour may shine forth
          from those regions of the East. </p>

            that way, and letter-carriers starting from Rome might be stopped nearer the city by
            Antony or some of his followers. </note> Accordingly, if I didn't get letters by sea, I
          should be entirely ignorant of what was going on at Rome. Now, however, having got an
          opportunity, since navigation has begun, <note n="2" anchored="true">Vegetius (<foreign
              xml:lang="la">Res</foreign> Mil. 5.9) reckons the close season, during which ordinary

          shall write to you with the greatest eagerness and as frequently as I can. There is no
          danger of my being affected by the conversation of the man, <note n="3" anchored="true">We
            cannot be sure who is meant. It is evidently some one with Pollio, and not Antony, as
            has been generally thought, and some one against whom Cicero had warned Pollio. It may
            be—as has been suggested -his fraudulent quaestor Balbus. See Letter DCCCXCIII. </note>
          whom <pb n="183"/> —though there is no one who can bear the sight of him-men can yet never
          hate as much as he deserves. For he is so utterly detestable in my eyes that everything I
          have to do with him is odious to me. Moreover, my actual disposition and pursuits incline
          me to desire peace and liberty. Accordingly, I have often bitterly mourned over that first
          step in the civil war. Since, however, it was impossible for me to be neutral, because I
          had bitter enemies on both sides, I shunned the camp, in which I knew for certain that I
          should not be safe from the plots of my personal enemy. <note n="1" anchored="true">There
            is no means of deciding what particular person Pollio means. We have heard of his
            prosecuting Gaius <foreign xml:lang="la">Cato</foreign> (vol. i., p.281); and Quintilian
            mentions a speech against Labienus. But Pollio was a great orator, and may have
            prosecuted many persons and thus made enemies. </note> Being thus compelled to go to the
          last place to which I desired to go, that I might not be lost in the crowd, I boldly
          confronted dangers without any hesitation. To Caesar, indeed, who regarded me as one of
          his oldest friends, though he had not known me until he had reached his own splendid
          position, I was attached with the utmost devotion and fidelity. What I was permitted to do
          in harmony with my own opinion I did in such a manner as to procure the warmest
          approbation of all the best men. When I acted under orders, I did so with so much
          deliberation and in such a spirit as made it evident that I was an unwilling recipient of
          the commands. But the wholly undeserved odium roused by my conduct sufficed to teach me
          the charm of liberty and the wretchedness of life under a tyranny. Accordingly, if the
          object of the present proceedings is to bring everything once more under the power of a
          single person, whoever he is, I avow myself his enemy: nor is there any danger which I
          would shun or deprecate on behalf of liberty. But the consuls have neither by senatorial
          decree nor by despatch given me any instructions as to what I was to do. For I have only
          received one despatch from Pansa, and that not till the 15th of March, in which he urges
          me to write a letter to the senate declaring that I and my army will be at its disposal..
          But seeing that Lepidus was making speeches and <pb n="184"/> writing to tell everybody
          that he was at one with Antony, this was the most awkward possible step for me to take.
          For by what road was I to lead my legions through his province against his will? Or if I
          had effected the rest of the journey, could I take wings and fly over the Alps, which are
          occupied by his force? Add to this the impossibility of a despatch getting through on any
          terms: for letter-carriers are examined in countless places, and finally are even detained
          by Lepidus. No one will question the sincerity of my public pronouncement at Corduba, that
          I would hand over the province to no one who did not arrive with a commission from the
          senate. For why need I describe the violent controversies I have had about handing over
          the thirtieth legion? And if I had handed it oyer, who does not know how much less
          effective in serving the state I was likely to be? For I assure you that it is the most
          gallant and best fighting legion in existence. Wherefore make up your mind that I am, to
          begin with a man most strongly in favour of peace—for I am seriously desirous that all
          citizens should be unmolested—and in the second place one prepared to assert my own and
          the state's freedom alike. Your admitting my friend into the list of yours is more
          gratifying to me than you can think: yet I am envious of his walking and jesting with you.
          You will ask me how much I value that. If ever I am allowed to enjoy leisure you shall
          find out from experience: for I will never budge a step from your side. One thing does
          profoundly surprise me—that you have never written to tell me whether I could better serve
          the Republic by remaining in my province or by leading my army into Italy. For my part,
          though it is safer and less laborious to remain, yet because I see that at such a crisis
          there is much more occasion for legions than for provinces (especially such as can be
          recovered without difficulty) I have resolved, as things are now, to start with my army.
          For the restt, you will learn everything from my despatch to Pansa, for I am inclosing a
          copy of it for your perusal. 16 March, Corduba. <pb n="185"/>

        </opener>
        <p> ON the 17th of March I received your letter, which your son handed to me on the 21st
          day—as he said-from its despatch. Neither on that nor the following day was there any
          meeting of the senate. On the Quinquatrus Minervae (19th of March) before a full house I
          pleaded your cause-not unfavoured by Minerva herself.For in fact on that very day the
          senate decreed that my statue of Minerva, which a storm had thrown down, should be
          restored. <note n="1" anchored="true">Cicero uses the common phrase <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >non invita</foreign> Minerva, "not without success" (vol. i., p. 363), in order to

              xml:lang="la">Minervae</foreign>) and to the statue of bust of Minerva which he had
            dedicated on the Capitol before he went into exile, as a guardian goddess of the city.
            See <bibl n="Cic. Leg. 2.42">de Leg. 2.42</bibl>. </note> Pansa read your despatch. It
          was followed by strong expression of approval from the senate, to my great joy and the
          great chagrin of the "Minotaur "-I mean Calvisius and Taurus; <note n="2" anchored="true"
            >As to Calvisius, appointed to succeed Sulpicius, see p. 139. T. Statilius Taurus had
            been named his <foreign xml:lang="la">legatus</foreign>. The senate now confirmed
            Sulpicius in the province of Africa. </note> and a decree was passed about you in
          complimentary terms. A demand was even made that these men should have some stigma
          inflicted upon them, but Pansa was for milder measures. For myself, my dear Cornificius,
          on the day (the 20th of December) on which I first conceived a hope of freedom and, while
          everybody else shrank from beginning, laid the foundations of a recovered constitution—on
          that very day, I say, I made careful provision and calculation for the maintenance of your
          position. For it was for my motion as to the retention of the provinces <note n="3"
            anchored="true">See p.167-168. </note> that the senate voted. Nor indeed did I
          subsequently cease from discrediting the man, who to your great injury and to the
          discredit of the Republic <pb n="186"/> was retaining the province, though he had himself
          left it. <note n="1" anchored="true">C. Calvisius made provision for retaining the
            province of Africa by leaving two of his legates there. See p. 160; <bibl
              n="Cic. Phil. 3.26">Phil. 3.26</bibl>. </note> Accordingly, he was unable to stand out
          against my frequent, or rather daily attacks upon him, and unwillingly returned to Rome:
          and was driven not from a mere hope, but from what was now a certainty and an actual
          possession, by my most righteous and dignified invective. That you have employed your
          eminent courage in successfully retaining your position, and have been complimented by the
          greatest honours a province can bestow, is a subject of lively satisfaction to me.
            <milestone unit="para"/>As to your defence of yourself in regard to Sempronius, <note
            n="2" anchored="true">See <foreign xml:lang="la">ante</foreign>, p.169. </note> I accept
          your explanation; for that was a dark period of servitude. I, the supporter of your policy
          and champion of your position, enraged at the position of affairs and despairing of
          freedom, was on the point of hurrying off to Greece, when the Etesian winds, like loyal
          citizens, refused to further me in my desertion of the Republic, and a south wind blowing
          in my teeth carried me back by his strongest blast to your fellow tribesmen of Rhegium.
          And so from thence I hurried at full speed-sail and oar together—to my country; and the
          day after my arrival was the one free man in a nation of slaves. <note n="3"
            anchored="true">Because he refused Antony's summons to the senate on the 1st of

          endeavoured at one time to entice me to give him an excuse for bloodshed, at another tried
          to entrap me. But I hunted him belching and vomiting into the toils of Caesar Octavianus.
          For that illustrious youth collected for himself a protecting force—at first in favour of
          our party, and subsequently in that of the supreme state. And if it hadn't been for him,
          Antony's return from Brundisium <note n="6" anchored="true">Where he had been to meet the
            legions. </note> would have sealed the fate of Rome. The events which followed I think
          you know. But to return to the point from which I have strayed. I accept your explanation
          as to <pb n="187"/> Sempronius: for you could have no fixed principle of procedure in the
          midst of such complete disorganization. <quote>

          But whatever the winds may be, skill on my part at least shall not be wanting: for to what

          and reflect that your whole position must needs stand and fall with the Republic. </p>

        </opener>
        <p> WHAT our friend Furnius reported as to your disposition towards the Republic was highly
          pleasing to the senate and most cordially approved of by the Roman people. But your
          despatch, which was read in the senate, did not seem at all to harmonize with the verbal
          report of Furnius. For you are for peace, though that illustrious man your colleague <note
            n="2" anchored="true">Decimus <foreign xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign> with Plancus was
            consul-designate for <date when="-0042">B.C. 42</date>. </note> is being actually
          besieged by the most abandoned outlaws, who ought to beg for peace after laying down their
          arms; or if they demand it with arms in their hands, we must attain that peace by victory,
          not by making terms. But how your despatch about peace, or that of Lepidus, has been
          received you will be able to learn from that honourable man your brother, <note n="3"
            anchored="true">Gnaeus Munatius Plancus, who was a praetor this year. Hence Cicero
            mentions him with the complimentary <foreign xml:lang="la">viro optimo</foreign>, almost
            "his excellency." </note> and from Gaius Furnius. However, my affection for you has <pb
            n="188"/> made me anxious that, although you are not yourself wanting in sagacity, and
          although you have the goodwill and loyal wisdom of your brother and Furnius ever at your
          side, yet, Considering the many ties between us, some injunction should reach you with the
          cachet of my authority also. Well then believe me, my dear Plancus, that all the steps in
          official promotion which you have hitherto attained—and they are of the most honourable
          nature-will convey nothing but the empty titles of office without the true marks of
          dignity, unless you throw in your lot with the liberty of the Roman people and the
          authority of the senate. Separate yourself, I beseech you, at length from those to whom
          you have been bound, not by your own deliberate judgment, but by the chains of
          circumstance. Many in the confusion of public affairs have received the title of
          consulars, not one of whom is regarded as really a consular, unless he has shewn the true
          spirit of a consular towards the state. This is the sort of man that you are bound to be,
          first in withdrawing yourself from association with disloyal citizens extremely unlike
          yourself; next in giving your services as supporter, champion, leader to the senate and
          the whole loyalist party; and lastly in making up your mind that peace does not consist in
          merely laying aside arms, but in dispelling the fear of arms and slavery. If this is your
          policy and these your sentiments, you will not only be a consul and a consular, but also a
          great consul and a great consular. If not, in these splendid titles of office there will
          not only be no dignity, there will be the extremity of dishonour. Under the influence of
          my warm feeling for you I write these words with somewhat unusual gravity. But you will
          find them to be true, if you put them to the test of practice—the only method worthy of

        <p> SINCE from my extreme goodwill to you it is a matter of much concern to me that you

          men are resolved to prefer death to slavery. So in my opinion you will be acting with more

          THE CAMP AT MUTINA (MARCH) THE news of the death of Gaius Trebonius caused me as much
          regret as joy. One cannot help being glad that a <pb n="190"/> wicked wretch has given
          satisfaction to the ashes and bones of a most illustrious man, and that Divine Providence
          has manifested its power before the end of one revolving year in the punishment, or
          immediate prospect of the punishment, of parricide. On the other hand, one cannot repress
          a sigh that Dolabella at such a time as this should be adjudged a public enemy for having
          killed a murderer; and that the Roman people should care more for the son of a mere
          man-about-town than for Gaius Caesar. But the most painful thing of all, Aulus Hirtius, is
          that you who were ennobled by the favours of Caesar and left by him in a position which
          surprises yourself—and that you, young sir, who owe everything to his name—are acting in a
          way to sanction Dolabella's condemnation and to release this pestilent fellow from his
          state of siege. In order, I suppose, that Brutus and Cassius may be all-powerful! The fact
          is, you regard the present situation as you did the former, when you used to speak of
          Pompey's camp as "the senate." You have taken Cicero as your leader, who was beaten then;
          you are strengthening Macedonia with troops; you have intrusted Africa to Varus, who had
          been twice made a prisoner; you have sent Cassius to Syria; you have allowed Casca to be

          shew that it was hopeless to deal with Antony. It puts forcibly Antony's case, and
          therefore I have thought it well to insert it here. It is extracted from the thirteenth

          in endangering the lives of their own quaestor or commander or fellow soldiers. In fact
          what have you not consented to or done which Gnaeus Pompeius would do, if he could come to
          life again, or his son if he could regain his home? Lastly, you say that there can be no
          peace, unless I either allow Decimus Brutus to march out or supply him with corn. Do you
          mean to tell me that this is the opinion of the veterans who have not yet committed
          themselves, even though you have been corrupted by flattery and insidious gifts to come
          here? But, you will say, it is besieged soldiers that you are attempting to relieve. Them
          I have no objection to spare and to allow to go wherever you order them, on the one
          condition that they give him <note n="3" anchored="true">Decimus <foreign xml:lang="la"

          letter that mention has been made in the senate of a pacification, and that five consulars
          have been appointed as legates. It is difficult to believe that the men who violently
          repelled me, though I offered the most equitable terms, and was thinking nevertheless of
          mitigating even them, should be entertaining any thoughts of moderation or be likely to
          act with common charity. It is scarcely likely even that men who have declared Dolabella a
          public enemy for a most righteous act should be capable of sparing us who are at one with
          him in heart. <milestone unit="para"/>Wherefore I would have you consider which of the two
          courses is in the better taste and the more advantageous to your party—to punish the death
          of Trebonius or that of Caesar: and whether it is more right that we should meet as foes
          and so allow the Pompeian cause so often defeated to revive, or that we should come to
          terms and so avoid being a <pb n="192"/> laughing-stock to our enemies, who will be the
          gainers whichever of us perishes? Such a spectacle as this Fortune herself as yet has
          shunned. She has not seen, that is, two armies of the same body politic fighting like
          gladiators with Cicero for a trainer, who has been so far successful as to deceive you
          both by the same formal honours by which he has boasted of having deceived Caesar. <note

          resolved not to submit to the degradation of myself or my friends, nor to desert the party
          which Pompey hated, nor to allow the veterans to be turned out of their homes, nor to be
          dragged off one by one to punishment, nor to break the faith which I pledged to Dolabella,
          nor to violate my compact with that devoted patriot Lepidus, nor to betray Plancus who is
          a sharer in my policy. <milestone unit="para"/>If the immortal gods, as I hope they will,
          aid me in my plain and honest course, I shall survive with satisfaction to myself; but if
          a different fate awaits me, I feel an anticipatory pleasure in the punishment which will
          befall you. For if the Pompeians are so arrogant in defeat, I would rather you than I
          should experience what they will be in victory. In fact the upshot of my decision is this:
          I am ready to put up with the injuries done to my party, if they will either consent to
          forget that they are Caesar's assassins, or are prepared to join us in avenging his death.
          I cannot believe in legates approaching a place which is being at the same time menaced by
          war. When they have arrived I shall learn their demands. </p>

        <p> I agree with you that the men whom you say in your letter are threatening Lilybaeum
          ought to have been punished on <pb n="193"/> the spot; but you feared, you say, being
          thought to be giving too free a rein to vengeance. That is as much as to say, you feared
          being thought a high-minded citizen, too courageous, too worthy of yourself. I am obliged
          to you for renewing the partnership with me—inherited from your father—in working for the
          best interests of the state. That partnership, my dear Cornificius, will always be kept up
          between us. I am obliged also by your thinking that I needed no thanks on your behalf. For
          there ought to be no question of thanks between you and me. The senate would have been
          more frequently called upon to compliment you, if in the absence of the consuls it had
          been ever summoned except for the consideration of some fresh complication. Accordingly,
          neither in the business of the 20 sestertia, nor of the 700 sestertia, can anything be now
          done in the senate. I think, however, that in virtue of the original senatorial decree
            <note n="1" anchored="true">The senatorial decree which settled the expenses of a
            provincial governor (<foreign xml:lang="la">de ornanda provincia</foreign>). </note> you
          must raise the money by impost or loan. What is going on in political matters I expect you
          know from the letters of those whose duty it is to send you copies of the acta. I am in
          good heart. In prudence, vigilance, and labour I am not wanting. To all enemies of the
          constitution I avow my most uncompromising hostility. Even now the situation does not
          appear to be a very difficult one, and it would have been quite free from difficulty had
          it not been for misconduct in certain quarters. <note n="2" anchored="true">He probably

          of like character to himself his heirs-Gnaeus Saturninus, Sextus Aufidius, Quintus
          Considius Gallus, Lucius Servilius Postumus, Gaius Rubellius. From what these men have
          said to me, I have gathered that what they require is a letter of thanks rather than of
          recommendation. For they spoke of having experienced such great kindness at your hands,
          that I came to the conclusion that you had already done more for them than I should
          venture to ask. However, I will venture: for I know how much weight a recommendation of

          displayed without any letter from me, to receive a finishing touch as complete as possible
          by this one. The chief point, however, of my recommendation is that you should not allow
          Eros Turius, the freedman of Quintus Turius, to possess himself of the property left by
          the latter, as up to the present time he has done; and that you should regard these men in

        <p> NOT you only, who are most intimately acquainted with all my concerns, but nobody in all
          Rome I think is ignorant of the great friendship existing between me and Lucius Lamia. For
          it was displayed before a large audience at the time of his being banished from the city
            <note n="1" anchored="true">See p.285. </note> by the consul Aulus Gabinius for having
          supported my recall with freedom and courage. Nor was that the first origin of our
          affection, but it was just because of its long standing and depth that he did not hesitate
          to confront any danger on my behalf. To these acts of kindness, or, as I should rather
          call them, these <pb n="196"/> claims upon my gratitude, an intimate intercourse is to be
          added, so exceedingly charming, that there is literally no one in whom I take more
          delight. I do not suppose in these circumstances that you are at a loss to imagine what
          the terms of my commendation of him will be. For you know well what words are the natural
          expression of such a strong affection. Consider me to have employed them all. I would
          merely wish to assure you that if you support Lamia's business, agents, freedmen, or
          slaves in anything whatever that they may require, you will be obliging me more than if
          that kindness of yours had affected my own property. Nor do I doubt that even without a
          recommendation from me you—who are so excellent a judge of men—are certain to do
          everything with enthusiasm for Lamia's own sake. However, I have been told that you think
          Lamia assisted in drawing up some senatorial decree <note n="1" anchored="true">See vol
            ii., p. 76. The decree referred to is very likely that giving the province to Calvisius.
            See p. 185. </note> which militated against your position. But the fact is, he did not
          assist in drawing up any decree whatever in that consulship. <note n="2" anchored="true"

            But we know nothing about it. </note> —though I wasn't even in town, as I told you in my

        <p> I would have written you a longer letter about my plans and given you an account of all
          my movements in greater detail, to convince you more fully that I have done every-thing
          for the Republic which your exhortation first suggested to me, and which I took upon
          myself to perform—for I always wished for your approval as much as for your love, and did
          not so much secure you as my defender in case of committing a fault, as wish for you as a

          doing something worthy both of my consulship and of what you and your friends expect of

        </opener>
        <p> GALLIA COMATA (23 MARCH) PLANCUS, imperator, consul-designate, greets the Consuls,
          praetors, tribunes of the plebs, the senate, the people and commons of Rome. <milestone
            unit="para"/>In case anyone thinks that I have kept public expectation and the hopes of
          the state as to my disposition too long in suspense, I think I must offer an explanation
          to such a man before proceeding to promise anything to anybody as to my future services.
          For I do not wish to have the appearance of having made up for a previous error, but to be
          delivering in the fullness of time the long-cherished sentiments of a loyal heart. It did
          not escape me that at a time of such profound public anxiety and such great political
          confusion the profession of loyal sentiments is a most profitable thing to make, and I saw
          that a considerable number of people had secured high honours by that means. But since
          fortune had brought me to such a pass as to force me to choose between making premature
          promises, and thereby of my own act raising up formidable obstacles to the accomplishment
          of any useful service, or putting a restraint upon myself in that respect, and thereby
          having better opportunities of rendering aid, I chose a course better calculated to secure
          the public safety than my own reputation. For who is there that in the high position I at
          present enjoy, and after a life such as I think the world knows mine to have been, and
          with the prospects which I actually possess, could submit to anything degrading or set his
          heart upon anything likely to be mischievous? But I required a considerable time, heavy
          labours, and great expense in order finally to make good my promises to the Republic and
          all loyal citizens, and in order not to approach the task of <pb n="199"/> aiding my
          country with no equipment except good intentions, but with the requisite resources. I had
          to secure the loyalty of my army, which had been often tampered with by the offer of great
          bounties, and to persuade it to look to the state for moderate rewards, rather than to a
          single person for unlimited ones. The loyalty also of numerous tribes had to be secured,
          which in the previous year <note n="1" anchored="true">Plancus had been preceded in the
            governorship of <foreign xml:lang="la">Gallia Comata</foreign> by Hirtius, who, however,
            had not gone there in person, but had governed by a <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >legatus</foreign> (see p. 16). Immediately after the death of Caesar, Antony had
            apparently taken means to secure the fidelity of the Gauls to himself. </note> had been
          laid under obligations by bounties and grants of compensations; and they had to be
          convinced that such rewards were shadowy, and that they must try to obtain the same
          privileges from more constitutional sources. I had also to sound the intentions of the
          other commanders of neighbouring provinces and armies, and induce them to join me in
          championing freedom in conjunction with the majority,' rather than that we should share
          with the minority a victory disastrous to the world at large. Moreover, I had to take
          precautions for my own safety by increasing my army and multiplying the number of my
          auxiliaries, in order that, while making no secret of my sentiments, I might yet incur no
          danger by its being publicly known, even though some objected, which side I meant to
          embrace. Accordingly, I shall never deny that, in order to arrive at the accomplishment of
          these designs, I have, contrary to my inclinations, pretended to feelings that I did not
          entertain, and with pain dissembled those that I did. For I saw from what had befallen my
          colleague the danger of a premature revelation of intentions by a loyal but unprepared
          citizen. <milestone unit="para"/>On this account I have given my legate Gaius Furnius—a
          gallant and energetic officer-still fuller instructions by word of mouth than are
          contained in this despatch, to the end that they might reach you with greater secrecy, and
          I might remain in greater security. And I have instructed him as to what is required for
          strengthening the public safety and properly equipping myself. And from this it may be
          understood that the care of the defence of our country's highest interests has not for
          long past been suffered to sleep in my <pb n="200"/> breast. By the blessing of heaven we
          are now in a better state of preparation in every particular, and we wish all the world
          not merely to have good hopes, but to feel certain, of us. I have five legions under
          colours, united by their own loyalty and excellence to the Republic with the most absolute
          fidelity, and at 'the same time devoted to me in response to my liberal treatment of them.
          I have a province in the best possible state from the unanimous consent of all its tribes,
          and inspired by the keenest emulation in its display of loyalty. My cavalry and auxiliary,
          forces are as numerous as the tribes in this country can raise in defence of their own
          safety and liberty. For myself I am fully prepared either to defend my province, or to go
          wheresoever the Republic calls me, or to hand over army, auxiliaries, and province. Or I
          would not even decline to bear the whole brunt of the war in my own person, provided that
          by my own disaster I might secure the safety of my country or delay its danger. I am
          making these promises when all difficulties have been already solved, and the political
          crisis is over, I shall rejoice in the benefit to my country, though I thereby lose my
          chance of earning reputation. But if I am to find myself involved in a share of dangers
          still at their most unabated height, I commend the defence of my policy to, impartial
          judges against the detraction of the envious. As for the reward of my own services, that
          is sufficiently secured in the safety of the state. Yet I think I ought to ask you to
          regard as commended to your consideration those who have followed my lead, and still more
          their duty to you, and have been proof against the deception of any promises or the terror
          of any threats. <pb n="201"/>

        <p> THOUGH I had been fully informed by our friend Furnius as to your sentiments and your,

          clearer judgment of your whole mind. Wherefore, though the entire fortune of the state is
          depending on the result of one battle—which I think by the time that you read these words
          will have been already decided-yet by the mere report of your sentiments which has gained
          currency you have earned great applause. Accordingly, it we had had a consul at Rome, the
          senate would have put on record in terms highly complimentary to you how much your
          contemplated movement and the preparations you have made are appreciated. And for that the
          time has not only not passed, but in my opinion is not even yet fully ripe. For in my eyes
          the only compliment worthy the name is that which is offered and given to illustrious men,
          not in hope of future advantage, but for important services actually rendered. Wherefore,
          if only some form of a state exists in which the light of honour is, capable of displaying
          its brightness, there are no honours, believe me, however splendid, with which you will
          not be lavishly endowed. Now this honour, which can be truly so called, is not meant to
          impart a momentary impulse, but is the reward of unvarying excellence. Wherefore, my dear
          Plancus, throw yourself heart and soul into the pursuit of glory: come to your country's
          rescue; relieve your colleague; support the unanimous desire and the wonderfully united
          aspiration of all nations. You will find in me a supporter of your policy, a promoter of
          your dignity, in every particular your most loving and faithful friend. For to the other
          reasons for our being united by love, mutual <pb n="202"/> good services, and long habit,

          <dateline>ROME, 11 APRIL</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> ALTHOUGH on public grounds I ought to be extremely rejoiced that you have given the
          state so much protection and so much aid in what is almost a desperate crisis, yet while I
          shall embrace you with my whole heart as conqueror if the constitution be restored, still
          what causes me a great part of my joy is the position you occupy, which I perceive is and
          will be of the most splendid kind. For do not imagine that any despatch was ever read in
          the senate which gave greater satisfaction than yours. <note n="1" anchored="true">This is
            Letter DCCCXXX. I think, if Cicero had not been blinded by his extreme desire for the
            loyalty of Plancus, he would have seen in that despatch the coming treason. It protests
            too much, and yet avoids really committing the writer. But in spite of Cicero's
            compliments to Plancus, he probably had his misgivings. </note> And that was the result
          not only of what I may call the brilliancy of your services to the Republic, but also of
          the loftiness of your language and sentiments. To me, indeed, it was nothing new, for I
          knew you, remembered the promises contained in your private letter to myself, and had a
          thorough acquaintance with your views from our friend Furnius. But to the senate your
          words seemed beyond what they had expected, not because it had ever doubted your good
          intentions, but because it had not thoroughly realized how much you could do nor how far
          you were willing to go. Accordingly, when Marcus Varisidius handed me your letter early in
          the morning of the 7th of April, and I had read it, I felt an amazing thrill of joy; and
          as a great crowd of the most distinguished men and citizens were escorting me from my
          house, I at once made them all sharers in my pleasure. Meanwhile our friend Munatius came
          as usual to see me. Well, I handed him your letter, for as yet he knew nothing about you,
          Varisidius <pb n="207"/> having come to me before anyone else, saying that such were your
          orders. A little later Munatius also allowed me to read the letter you had sent him, as
          well as your public despatch. We decided to transmit the despatch at once to the city
          praetor Cornutus, who, in the absence of the consuls, was, according to traditional
          custom, performing the consular functions. A meeting of the senate was at once summoned
          and there was a large attendance, owing to the rumour and general anticipation in regard
          to your despatch. After your despatch had been read a religious difficulty was suggested
          to Cornutus, because the pullarii informed him that he had not taken the auspices with the
          proper formalities, and that was confirmed by our augural college. Accordingly, business
          was postponed to the next day. Well, on that day I had a warm debate with Servilius <note
            n="1" anchored="true">P. Servilius <foreign xml:lang="la">Vatia</foreign> Isauricus,
            Caesar's colleague in the consulship of <date when="-0048">B.C. 48</date>. Cicero
            thought him too lukewarm in his condemnation of the party of Antony (9 Phil. §§ 7, 11).
          </note> in defence of your position. He had exercised his influence to get his motion put
          first, but a large majority of senators quitted him and voted directly against it. But
          when my motion, which was put second, was being largely supported, at the request of
          Servilius it was vetoed by P. Titius. The business was deferred till the next day.
          Servilius came prepared "to fight Iupiter himself," <note n="2" anchored="true">For this
            proverbial expression, see vol. ii., p.307. </note> in whose temple the debate was to be
          held. How I crushed him, and with what fiery eloquence I brought the vetoing Titius upon
          his knees, I would rather you learnt from the letters of others. Take this one fact from
          mine. The senate could not have been more resolute and firm or better disposed to your
          glory than it was on this occasion. Not that the senate is a bit more friendly to you than
          the whole body of citizens. For there is a surprising unanimity of feeling among the
          entire Roman people, with the united aspiration of all conditions and classes, in favour
          of recovering the public liberty. Go on, then, as you have begun, to make your name
          immortal! And as for all those empty shows of glory, founded on the most unsubstantial
          badges of external splendour, despise them; and regard them as short-lived, counterfeit,
          and perishable. <note n="3" anchored="true">The vote of thanks seems to have been
            successfully resisted by the </note> True glory rests on virtue, <pb n="208"/> which is
          shewn to the highest advantage by services done to the state. You have the most excellent
          Opportunity for performing these. Since you have embraced it and still possess it, see
          that the state owes you as much as you owe the state. You will find in me not only a
          supporter of your high position, but a promoter of its increase. That much I think I owe
          both to the Republic, which is dearer to me than life itself, and to our friendship. And
          in these exertions, which I have consecrated to the support of your position, I have found
          a great pleasure in the still clearer view I have gained of the wisdom and loyalty of
          Titus Munatius <note n="1" anchored="true">Brother of L. Plancus, the recipient of these
            letters. </note> —though I knew these before—as displayed in his extraordinary devotion
          and activity in your service. <milestone unit="para"/>11 April. </p>

        <p> CAMP NEAR MUTINA, 16 APRIL ON the 15th of April, the day on which Pansa was to arrive at
          the camp of Hirtius, with the former of whom I was—for I had gone along the road a hundred
          miles to hasten his arrival-Antony brought out two legions, the second and the
          thirty-fifth, and two praetorian cohorts, one his own and the other that of Silanus, and a
          party of reservists. He confronted us with such a force because he thought that we had
          only four legions of recruits. But in the course of the <pb n="212"/> night, in order to
          enable us to reach the camp in greater safety, Hirtius had sent us the Martian
          legion—which I usually command—and two praetorian cohorts. As soon as Antony's horsemen
          came in sight, neither the Martian legion nor the cavalry could be held back. The rest of
          us were obliged to follow them, as we could not stop them. Antony was keeping his men
          under cover at Forum Gallorum, and did not wish it to be known that he had the legions. He
          was allowing none but his cavalry and light-armed men to be seen. When Pansa saw that the
          legion was advancing in spite of him, he ordered two legions of recruits to follow his
          lead. As soon as we had got past the narrow ground of marsh and forest, our line was drawn
          up, consisting of twelve cohorts. The two legions had not yet come up. All on a sudden
          Antony brought his forces out of the village on to the field, and without waiting charged.
          At first the fighting was as keen as it was possible for it to be on both sides: although
          the right wing, on which I was with eight cohorts of the Martian legion, had at the first
          brush put Antony's thirty-fifth legion to flight, so that it advanced more than five
          hundred paces beyond the line from its original ground. Accordingly, when the cavalry
          attempted to outflank our wing, I began to retire and to throw my light-armed troops in
          the way of the Moorish cavalry, to prevent their charging my men in the rear. Meanwhile, I
          became conscious that I was between two bodies of Antony's troops, and that Antony was
          himself some way on my rear. I at once galloped towards the legion of recruits that was on
          its way up from camp, with my shield slung behind my back. Antony's men set off in pursuit
          of me; while our own men began pouring in a volley of pila. It was a stroke of good luck
          that I got safely out of it, for I was soon recognized by our men. On the Aemilian road
          itself, where Caesar's praetorian cohort was stationed, the fight was protracted. The left
          wing, being somewhat weak, consisting of two cohorts of the Martian legion and a
          praetorian cohort, began to give ground, because it was in danger of being outflanked by
          the cavalry, in which Antony is exceedingly strong. When all our lines had retired, I
          began retiring myself towards the camp on the extreme rear. Antony, regarding himself as
          having won the victory, thought that he could capture our <pb n="213"/> camp. But when he
          reached it he lost a large number of men without accomplishing anything. The news having
          reached Hirtius, he met Antony as he was returning to his own camp with twenty veteran
          cohorts, and destroyed or put to flight his whole force, on the same ground as the battle
          had been fought, namely, at Forum Gallorum. Antony, with his cavalry, reached his camp
          near Mutina at the fourth hour after sunset. Hirtius returned to the camp, from which
          Pansa had issued, where he had left the two legions which had been assaulted by Antony.
          Thus Antony has lost the greater part of his veteran forces. This, however, naturally
          could not be accomplished without some loss in our praetorian cohorts and the Martian
          legion. Two eagles and sixty colours of Antony's have been brought in. It is a great
          victory. <milestone unit="para"/>16 April, in camp. </p>

        <p> I am glad that I made no rash promise to you, and that you did not pledge yourself to
          anything for me without good <pb n="220"/> ground. At any rate you have the stronger
          evidence of my affection for you in the fact that I wished my plans to be known to you
          sooner than to anyone else. I hope you clearly perceive that additions to my services are
          being made every day. I undertake that you shall know it still better. As far as I am
          concerned, my dear Cicero—as surely as I hope that the state may be relieved through me of
          the evils that threaten it—though I regard with respect the rewards and honours which you
          senators have it in your power to bestow—worthy surely to be compared with immortality—yet
          even without them I am not likely to slacken at all in my zeal and persistence. Unless in
          the crowd of the most loyal citizens my enthusiasm has been conspicuous and my exertion
          eminent, I do not desire any accession to my honour by the votes of your house. I covet no
          honour for myself—it is against such covetousness that I am myself fighting. I am quite
          content that you should have the decision both of its amount and of its season. A citizen
          can never think honour paid him by his country either too late or insufficient. I got my
          army across the Rhone on the 26th of April by forced marches. I sent forward a thousand
          cavalry from Vienne by a shorter route. If I am not delayed by Lepidus, I shall myself
          leave nothing to be desired in the way of speed. If; however, he puts himself across my
          line of march, I shall take such measures as seem necessary. I am bringing a force
          thoroughly satisfactory as to numbers, nature, and loyalty. I beg you for your affection,
          as you know that it will be only mutual. </p>

        <p> WHAT a loss the Republic has sustained by the death of Pansa you must be well aware. In
          these circumstances you must use your influence and foresight to prevent our opponents
          hoping to regain their strength now that the consuls have been removed. I will take care
          that Antony is unable to keep any footing in Italy. I am following him in hot haste. I
          hope that I shall secure two things—that Ventidius does not slip past me <note n="4"
            anchored="true">See <foreign xml:lang="la">ante</foreign>, p. 218. Ventidius Bassus, as

          I specially beg you to send instructions to that shiftiest of men Lepidus, that he may not
          be in a position to renew the war against me if Antony effects a <pb n="222"/> junction
          with him. For as to Asinius Pollio, I think you are quite clear as to what he will do. The
          legions of Lepidus and Asinius are numerous, good, and strong. And I don't write this to
          you because I know that the same facts escape your notice, but because I am most
          thoroughly convinced that Lepidus will never go straight-should you by chance have any
          doubt on that point! I beg you also to keep Plancus up to the mark, who will—I hope-stick
          to the Republic now that Antony has been defeated. If Antony has got himself across the
          Alps, I have resolved to station a force on the Alps and to keep you informed of

        <p> I GIVE you undying thanks, and shall do so as long as I live: since I cannot promise to
          repay you. For I do not think that I can possibly make a return for such great services as
          yours, unless by chance, as you remarked in such eloquent and impressive words in your
          letter, you will consider me to have repaid you as long as I remember them. If it had been
          a question of your own son's position, you could not have acted at any rate more
          affectionately. Your first <pb n="223"/> motions in the senate proposing unlimited rewards
          for me, your later ones made to square with circumstances and the wishes of my friends,
          your constant and formal speeches about me, and your wordy-warfare on my behalf with my
          detractors-these are all most thoroughly known to me. I must be more than commonly careful
          to shew myself as a citizen worthy of your praise, mindful and grateful as your friend.
          For the future see that your bounty is not wasted; and if by results and facts you find
          that I am the man you wished me to be, defend me and take up my cause. Having crossed the
          Rhone with my troops, and having sent forward my brother with 3,000 cavalry, while I was
          myself on the march for Mutina, I was told on the road of the battle that had taken place,
          and of Brutus and Mutina being relieved. I saw that Antony and the remains of his force
          had no other place of retreat except in this district, and that he had two hopes in
          view-one of Lepidus himself; the other of his army. As a certain fraction of my army is as
          infatuated as those who were with Antony, I recalled my cavalry. I halted in the country
          of the Allobroges myself; that I might be as completely prepared for every eventuality as
          the situation required. If Antony comes into this district without forces, I think I am
          strong enough by myself to resist him, and to carry on the business of the country in
          accordance with the judgment of your house, even though he be admitted by the army of
          Lepidus. But if he brings some of his forces with him, and if the tenth veteran legion,
          which, having been recalled to its duty by my exertion, is now with the others, relapses
          into its old mad conduct, nevertheless I will do my best to prevent any loss; and I hope I
          shall prevent it, provided that forces from Rome are sent across, and by forming a
          junction with me find it easier to crush these abandoned men. This much I will promise
          you, my dear Cicero, that no vigour or careful attention shall be wanting on my part. I
          would to heaven there was no anxiety left, but if there is, I will not fall short of any
          man's loyalty or perseverance on behalf of you all. I am indeed doing my best to induce
          Lepidus to share this policy with me, and I am promising to defer to him in every way, if
          he will only consent to regard the interests of the Republic. I am employing as coadjutors
          and go-betweens in this negotiation <pb n="224"/> my brother, and Laterensis, and our
          friend Furnius. I will not be stopped by private quarrels from coming to an understanding
          with my bitterest foe on behalf of the safety of the Republic. But if I am unsuccessful,
          nevertheless I will do what you wish with the greatest determination, and perhaps with
          some addition of reputation to myself. Take care of your health, and give me love for
          love. </p>

        <p> I DO not think that the Republic owes me more than I owe you. You have good assurance of
          my being capable of greater gratitude to you than those misguided persons shew me: and
          that if after all my words seem to be dictated by the exigencies of the hour, I prefer
          your approval to that of all those people on the other side. For your judgment of us
          proceeds from an independent and sincere feeling: they are debarred from that by malice
          and jealousy. Let them interpose to prevent my receiving marks of honour, so long as they
          do not prevent the public service being properly conducted by me. The extreme danger in
          which that now stands I will explain as briefly as I can. To begin with, you cannot fail
          to observe what a confusion in city business is caused by the death of the consuls, and
          how much ambition this vacancy in the office inspires in men. I think I have written as
          much as can be committed to paper. For I know to whom I am writing. I now return to
          Antony, who, though when he fled he had only a handful of unarmed infantry, seems, by
          breaking open slave-barracks and requisitioning <pb n="230"/> every kind of human being,
          to have made up a very Considerable number. To this has been added the force of Ventidius,
          which after accomplishing a difficult march across the Apennines has reached Vada and has
          there affected a junction with Antony. There is a very considerable number of veterans and
          fully armed soldiers with Ventidius. Antony's plan of campaign must certainly be either to
          join Lepidus, if Lepidus will have him; or to keep behind the lines of the Apennines and
          Alps, and to lay waste the district which he has invaded by sending out parties of
          cavalry, of which he has large numbers; or to draw back into Etruria, since that part of
          Italy has no army in it. But if Caesar had listened to me and crossed the Apennines, I
          should have reduced Antony to such straits, that he would have been ruined by failure of
          provisions rather than by the sword. But neither can anyone control Caesar, nor can Caesar
          control his own army-both most disastrous facts. These things being so, I won't hinder
          anybody, as far as I am concerned, from interposing, as I said before. It alarms me to
          think how these difficulties are to be removed, and, when they are removed by you, of the
          fresh hindrances that may intervene. I am already unable to feed and pay my men. When I
          undertook the task of freeing the Republic I had more than 40,000 sestertia <note n="1"
            anchored="true">About £320,000. </note> in money. So far from any part of my private
          property remaining unencumbered, I have by this time loaded all my friends with debt. I am
          now supporting a force amounting to seven legions, you can imagine with what difficulty.
          Not if I had all the treasures of Varro, <note n="2" anchored="true">M. Terentius <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Varro</foreign> was not a particularly rich man, or at any rate not

            was rich till he could keep a legion on the interest of his capital (Pliny, N. H. 33, §
            134). Another suggestion is that it refers to some character in one of Varro's plays.

        <p> IF you are well, I am glad. I also am well. I have read your letter in which I
          recognized your uncommon affection for me. For you seemed not merely to wish me well—as
          you always have done on private arid public grounds alike—but to have involved yourself'in
          very grave responsibility and to be exceedingly anxious about us. Therefore, because in
          the first place I thought that you would believe that we could not remain inactive when
          the Republic was crushed: and in the second place because, as you suspected that we were
          moving, I thought you would be anxious as to our safety and the result of the operations,
          as soon as I received the legions brought by Aulus Allienus from Egypt, <note n="1"

          despatch to the senate, which I said was not to be delivered until it had been read to
          you—if by any chance my messengers have chosen to obey me. If these letters have not
          reached you, I have no doubt that Dolabella, who seized the government of Asia after the
          abominable murder of Treboinius, <note n="2" anchored="true">See pp. 204, 210. </note> has
          caught my letter-carriers and intercepted the despatches. I have now under me all the
          Roman forces in Syria. I have been delayed for a short time whilst providing the promised
          pay for the soldiers. I am only just free from that difficulty. I beg you to consider that
          the defence of my position is committed to you, as you know full well that I have declined
          no danger and no labour in the service of my country: as on your suggestion and advice I
          have taken up arms against the most, unscrupulous outlaws: as I have not only collected
          armies to defend the Republic and liberty, but have also rescued them from the most
          bloodthirsty tyrants. If <pb n="233"/> Dolabella had anticipated me in getting hold of
          these armies he would have strengthened Antony's hands, not only by their actual arrival,
          but also by giving him reason to think 'and expect that they were coming. For which
          achievements defend my soldiers, since you understand that they have done wonderfully,
          good service to the state, and secure' that they do not regret having preferred to make
          the Republic the object of their labours rather than the hope of booty and plunder.

        <p> From the first moment that the opportunity was given me of promoting your position, I
          omitted nothing that was calculated to do you honour, whether in the way of substantial
          reward for valour or of complimentary words. That you will be able to learn from the
          decree of the senate itself: for it was drawn up word for word as I delivered my motion
          from a written copy; which motion was carried by a full senate with great enthusiasm and
          striking unanimity. Although I clearly gathered from your letter to me that you cared more
          for the approval of good men than for the outward badges of distinction, yet I thought
          that we ought to <pb n="236"/> take into calculation-even if you made no demand—how much
          was due to you from the Republic. See that you make the end tally with the beginning. For
          the man who crushes Antony will have finished the war. Just so Homer did not give either
          Ajax or Achilles the title of" city-sacker," but Ulysses. <note n="1" anchored="true">This
            is true of the Odyssey, but in the Iliad Achilles is called <foreign xml:lang="grc"
              >ptolipo/rqios</foreign> four times (viii. 372; 15.77; 21.550; 24.108). But as the
            great critic Aristarchus made the same remark, he was either referring only to the
            Odyssey, or he disbelieved in the genuineness of these verses in the iliad. The point
            here is that, though Ajax and Achilles won victories, it was Ulysses who finished the
            war by leading the chiefs in the wooden horse; so it is the man who conquers Antony that
            will finish the war. </note>

        <p> I am not going to thank you any more; for when one can make a man no return in deeds, it
          is impossible to satisfy his just claims by mere words. I want you to notice what I have
          on my hands. For your insight is so great that you will take in the whole situation, if
          you read my letter with care. I was unable, my dear Cicero, to pursue Antony at once for
          the following reasons. I had no cavalry, no transport animals; I did not know that Hirtius
          was dead; I did not know that Aquila was dead; I couldn't put any confidence in Caesar
          without first visiting and holding a conversation with him. So passed the first day. Next
          day early I was summoned by Pansa to Bononia. While I was on the way news was brought to
          me that he was dead. I hurried back to my poor little force—for I can call it so with
          truth. It was most woefully reduced and in the very worst condition from want of every
          kind of necessary. Antony thus got two days start of me. He made much longer marches, as
          being in retreat, than I could in pursuit. For he marched in loose <pb n="237"/> order, I
          in close. Wherever he came he broke open the slave-barracks and forcibly requisitioned the
          men. He never made any halt anywhere till he reached Vada. <note n="1" anchored="true">See
            p.231. </note> I would like you to know about this place. It lies between the Apennines
          and the Alps, very difficult to reach by a march. When I was thirty miles from it, and
          when Ventidius had already effected a junction with him, a public speech delivered by
          Antony was reported to me, in which he began entreating his men to follow him across the
          Alps, telling them that he had an understanding with Marcus Lepidus. There was some
          murmuring, and from a good many of Ventidius's men—for Antony has very few of his own—that
          it was their duty to perish or conquer in Italy; and they began begging him to allow them
          to march to Pollentia. Not being able to withstand them, he arranged to begin his march
          the next day. When I received this intelligence I at once sent forward five cohorts to
          Pollentia and directed my march to that place. My advanced guard arrived at Pollentia an
          hour before Trebellius with his cavalry. <note n="2" anchored="true">There is no doubt

            This may have been sent with it. </note> was written I thought it for the public service
          that you should know. My persevering attention has, I hope, borne some fruit both for
          myself and the Republic. For by a continual interchange <pb n="238"/> of messages I urged
          Lepidus, laying aside all Controversies and admitting a reconciliation between us, to join
          me in coming to the rescue of the Republic; to have regard for himself; his children, and
          the city, as more precious than one abandoned and humiliated outlaw: and I promised him
          that he should find me thoroughly at his command in every undertaking if he did so. I have
          made some way with him; and accordingly he has by our intermediary Laterensis pledged his
          word to me that he will make war on Antony, if he fails to prevent his entrance into his
          province. He has asked me to join him and combine our forces. He is the more urgent on
          that point because Antony for his part is said to be strong in cavalry, while Lepidus
          himself is not even moderately equipped in that respect. For even from the small number
          that he did possess, ten of the best a few days ago had deserted to my camp. When I was
          informed of these facts I did not delay: I thought that Lepidus was to be encouraged in
          the path of loyalty. I saw what my arrival was likely to effect, either because I could,
          as I reckoned, pursue and crush his cavalry with mine, or because I might, I thought, by
          bringing my army up, reform and put pressure upon that part of Lepidus's army which was
          disaffected and disloyal to the state. Accordingly, having made a bridge in a single day
          across the Isara—a very large river which bounds the territory of the Allobroges—I got my
          army across on the 12th of May. Having, however, received information that Lucius Antonius
          with cavalry and some cohorts had been sent in advance and had arrived at Forum Iulli, I
          sent my brother with 4,000 cavalry on the 13th of May to meet him. I am going to follow
          him with four legions in fighting order and the rest of my cavalry as quickly as I can
          march. If the good fortune of the Republic aids us even to a moderate degree, we shall
          here find an end to the presumption of a set of ruffians and to our own anxiety. But if
          that outlaw gets timely warning of our approach and retreats into Italy, it will be the
          business of Brutus to meet him, who will not, I know, lack either strategy or courage.
          However, if that happens, I shall send my brother with the cavalry in pursuit of him, to
          protect Italy from being looted. Take care of your health and return my affection. <pb

        <p> I should have been ashamed of the contradictory nature of my despatches, had not this
          depended on the caprices of another. I had adopted every possible precaution for enabling
          me, by combining with Lepidus for the defence of the Republic, to resist these ruffians
          with less anxiety to you all at Rome. I conceded everything he demanded and volunteered
          much besides, and two days ago I wrote to tell you that I felt sure of finding Lepidus
          loyal, and that I should conduct the war in consultation with him. I trusted to his own
          handwriting, and to the personal assurances of Laterensis, who was then in my camp and was
          entreating me to be reconciled to Lepidus and to trust him. I was not long allowed to
          entertain good hopes of him. At least I have taken precautions, and will continue to do
          so, that the fortune of the Republic does not suffer from any credulity on my part. When
          after constructing a bridge in a single day I had got my army across the Isara, using all
          the rapidity which the gravity of the situation demanded, because he had written to me
          with his own hand asking me to hasten my arrival, I was met by his orderly bringing a
          despatch in which he warned me not to come, saying that lie could finish the affair
          independently, and that I should meanwhile wait for him on the Isara. I will tell you what
          my idea on the spur of the moment was. I had resolved to go all the same, thinking that
          what he was trying to avoid was having anyone to share in his glory. I thought that I
          could avoid trenching at all upon the reputation of a poor-spirited man, and yet could be
          at hand on some convenient ground, so as to be able to render prompt aid in case of any
          reverse. This was my idea in the innocence of my heart. But Laterensis, who is a
          thoroughly honourable man, sent me <pb n="240"/> a letter in his own handwriting,
          expressing excessive despair of himself; of the army, of the good faith of Lepidus, and
          complaining that he had been thrown over. In this letter also he openly warned me to be on
          my guard against being taken in: said that he had been true to his word: and begged me not
          to abandon the Republic. I have sent a copy of his original letter to Titius. <note n="1"
            anchored="true">A tribune (see p.207). Plancus wants to justify himself in the eyes of
            his opponents at Rome. </note> The original documents themselves, both those in which I
          believed, and those in which I thought no confidence was to be placed, I will give to
          Laevus Cispius—who was cognizant of all these transactions—to take home. <milestone
            unit="para"/>An additional complication is that when Lepidus harangued his men, the
          soldiers who are disaffected in themselves and have been also tampered with by their
          officers-your Canidii, Rufreni, and all that lot, whose names you shall know when
          needful-joined in shouting, excellent fellows! "that they desired peace and would not
          fight with anybody, after two distinguished consuls had been lost, so many citizens killed
          in defence of their country, and when finally all had been declared public enemies, and
          had their property confiscated." As this outbreak was neither punished nor allayed by
          Lepidus, I saw that I had been infatuated and rash to come here, and expose my thoroughly
          loyal army, my very numerous auxiliaries, the leading men of Gaul, and my whole province
          to those two combined armies. <note n="2" anchored="true">That is, of Antony and Lepidus.
          </note> I saw, too, that had I been overpowered in these circumstances, and dragged down
          the Republic with me into ruin, my death would not only have been without honour, but
          without even pity. Therefore I am about to return, and will not allow the possibility of
          such great advantages being presented to such scoundrels. I will take care to keep my army
          on advantageous ground, to protect my province, even though Lepidus's army has joined in
          the defection, not to commit myself to anything, until you send reinforcements from home,
          and to defend the constitution here with the same good fortune as has been done elsewhere.
            <note n="3" anchored="true">That is, as at <foreign xml:lang="la">Mutina</foreign>.
          </note> At the same time, no one was ever more ready to fight a pitched battle, if
          occasion presents itself; or to stand a siege, if it turns out <pb n="241"/> to be
          necessary; or to die, if so it happens, in your defence. Wherefore I urge upon you, my
          dear Cicero, to see to an army being sent across to this district as soon as possible, and

        <p> NEED I write to you in vindication of my brother, gallant citizen and thoroughly
          prepared for every kind of duty as he is? His hard work has brought on a feverish attack,
          which is persistent and rather troublesome. As soon as he is well enough he will not
          hesitate to hurry back to Rome, so as not to be wanting in his duty to the Republic
          anywhere. <note n="1" anchored="true">Cn. Munatius Plancus was praetor. See p.187. </note>
          I pray you to consider that the defence of my position is committed to you. I have no
          occasion for any ambition: I have in you a most devoted friend and—what I always
          desired-possessed now of the greatest influence. It is for you to consider the extent and
          time of your favours to me. The only request I make to you is that you give me Hirtius's
          place both in your affection and in the privilege of shewing you attentions. <pb n="242"/>

        <p> I have received three letters from you on the same day: one a short one which you had
          intrusted to Volumnius Flaccus; two of greater length, one of which the letter-carrier of
          Titus Vibius brought, the other was forwarded to me by Lupus. To judge from your letters
          and from what Graeceius says, the war, so far from being extinguished, is hotter than
          ever. However, I feel sure that your eminent wisdom makes it clear to you that, if Antony
          gets any firm foothold, all those brilliant services of yours to the state will come to
          nothing. For the news that reached Rome, and what everybody believed, was that Antony had
          fled with a small body of men, who were without arms, panic-stricken, and utterly
          demoralized. But if he is in such a position, as Graeceius tells me, that he cannot be
          offered battle without risk, he appears to me not to have fled from Mutina, but merely to
          have changed the seat of war. Accordingly, there is a general revulsion of feeling. Some
          people even grumble at your not having pursued him: they think that he might have been
          crushed if expeditious measures had been taken. It is ever the way with a populace, and
          above all with that of Rome—they vent their freedom without restraint on the very man who
          secured it for them. All the same, we must take care that there is no just cause of
          complaint. The fact is this: that man will have finished the war, who has crushed Antony.
          The point of that remark I would rather leave you to grasp than express it more openly
          myself. <pb n="243"/>

        <p> If you are well, I am glad. I am well. Having been informed that Antony, after sending
          Lucius Antonius in advance with a detachment of his cavalry, was coming with his forces
          into my province, I moved with my army from the confluence of the Rhone <note n="1"
            anchored="true">The confluence of the <foreign xml:lang="la">Rhone</foreign> and the

          by daily marches to Forum Voconii, <note n="2" anchored="true">A station on the via
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Aurelia</foreign>, but its exact site is uncertain. Mr. Hall

              >le</foreign> Luc, twenty-four Roman miles west of Fréjus. </note> and to the east of
          that town I have pitched a camp on the river Argens opposite the Antonians. Publius
          Ventidius has united his three legions with him and has pitched a camp still farther to
          the east. Antony had before this junction the fifth legion, and a large number of men
          drawn from the other legions, but without arms. He has a large force of cavalry: for it
          got away after the battle without loss, so that there are more than five thousand
          troopers. A large number of infantry and cavalry have deserted to me from him, and his
          force is shrinking every day. Silanus and Culleo have abandoned him. <note n="3"

            do nothing. Q. Terentius Culleo—mentioned once or twice before-must have been a rather
            lukewarm Caesarian (see vol. i., p. 162; vol. ii., p.301). Lepidus had, however,

        <p> WHAT I had in my mind when Laevus and Nerva quitted me you have been able to ascertain
          by the letter which I forwarded by them and from these men personally, who have taken part
          in all my actions and consultations- There has happened to me what usually does happen to
          a man of honour and one who is desirous of doing his duty to the state, in fact to all
          good men, that I preferred to pursue a dangerous course with an approving conscience,
          rather than a safe one which might lay me open to some reproach. Accordingly, after the
          departure of his legates, as Lepidus in two successive letters begged me to join him, and
          Laterensis still more strongly begged me to do so in terms almost of entreaty-shewing no
          dread of anything except what causes me also some alarm, the fickleness and untrustworthy
          temper of his army—I thought I ought not to hesitate about hurrying to his assistance and
          confronting the common danger. Now the safe course for me was to wait on the Isére till
          Dec. Brutus got his army across the mountains, and to go to meet the enemy with a
          colleague in sympathy with my views and an army in full accord and well-affected to the
          had not opposed Antony's passage, and indeed seems to have joined him (<bibl
            n="TLG551.17 3.83">App. B.C. 3.83</bibl>). <pb n="259"/> Republic, as his soldiers are.
          Nevertheless I knew that if Lepidus while entertaining loyal ideas came to any harm, it
          would all be laid to the charge either of my obstinacy or my timidity. I saw plainly that
          this would' be so, if I either failed to relieve a man closely united with the Republic,
          though on bad terms with myself, or had myself withdrawn from the struggle in a war of
          such moment. So I preferred to run the risk, and to see whether my presence might afford
          Lepidus protection and render his army better-affected, rather than appear over-cautious.
          At any rate I think there never was anyone more anxious, without any fault of his own,
          than myself. For the very situation which was causing me no hesitation, supposing
          Lepidus's army away, in the present state of things brings me great anxiety and involves
          great risk. For if it had been my fortune to encounter Antony first, he would not, by
          heaven, have held his ground an hour. So confident do I feel in myself and so completely
          do I despise his demoralized forces and the division of Ventidius the mule-man. <note
            n="1" anchored="true">P. Ventidius Bassus had in earlier life contracted for the supply
            of mules to Caesar's army. It was in that capacity that he seems to have attracted
            Caesar's notice and confidence. </note> But I cannot but shudder at the idea of some
          hidden wound, which may cause mischief before it can be known and treated. But certainly
          unless I had remained on the same ground Lepidus himself and the well-affected part of his
          army would have incurred great danger. The unscrupulous enemy also would have secured a
          great accession of force, if they had withdrawn any of his troops from Lepidus. And if my
          arrival has stopped these things occurring I shall thank my stars and my own firmness,
          which incited me to make this experiment. Therefore on the 20th of May I broke up my camp
          on the Isére: I left the bridge standing, however, which I had constructed over that
          river, with a fort placed at each end of it; and in them I stationed strong garrisons,
          that there might be a means of crossing without delay ready for Brutus and his army when
          he came. <note n="2" anchored="true">Decimus <foreign xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign> was

            to cross the Isére. </note> I shall myself, I hope, in eight days from the despatch of
          this letter effect a junction with the forces of Lepidus. <pb n="260"/>

        <p> THOUGH from the message which you gave to Galba and Volumnius for the senate I have a
          good guess as to what you thought was the danger ahead, yet the message seemed to me to be
          less confident than suited the victory gained by yourself and the Roman people. The
          senate, however, my dear Brutus, is resolute and has resolute leaders. It was therefore
          somewhat hurt that it should be considered timid and spiritless by you, whom it considered
          the bravest of men. For considering that even when you were invested everybody retained
          the most confident hope in your valour, though Antony was in full vigour, who could be
          afraid of anything after he had been defeated and you released? Nor, indeed, are we afraid
          of Lepidus. For who in the world could expect him to be such a madman as, after saying in
          the midst of a most formidable war that he desired peace, to proclaim war against the
          Republic after the ardently desired peace had been obtained? And I do not doubt your
          seeing farther ahead than we can. But nevertheless a renewal of alarm so soon after the
          thanksgiving which we offered at all the temples in your name does cause bitter
          disappointment. Therefore, for my part, my wish is—as it is my hope—that Antony has been
          entirely ruined and crushed: but if he has by chance collected some forces, he shall feel
          that the senate is not without wisdom, nor the Roman people without valour, nor the
          Republic—as long as you are alive—without a general. <milestone unit="para"/>19 May. <pb

        <p> ON the 15th of May Antony reached Forum Iulii with his advanced guard. Ventidius is two
          days' march behind him. Lepidus is encamped at Forum Voconii, which is twenty-four miles
          from Forum Iulli, and has settled to await me there, as he has himself written to tell me.
          But if neither Lepidus himself nor fortune disappoints me in any way, I pledge myself to
          finish this business quickly in the manner in which you in the senate desire. I told you
          in a previous letter that my brother was ill, worn out by continuous work and rapid
          movements. Nevertheless, as soon as he could set foot to ground, considering that his
          restored health was not his own more than the state's, he was for leading the forlorn hope
          everywhere. But I have not merely urged, I have forced him to start for Rome—partly on the
          grounds that in his state of health he was more likely to wear himself to death than to
          assist me in camp, and partly because I thought that the Republic, having been left bare
          by the most regrettable death of the consuls, required the presence of such an eminent
          citizen as praetor for the conduct of city business. But if any of you at Rome disapprove,
          let it be known that it was I that lacked prudence in counsel, not he fidelity to his
          country. After all, Lepidus did what I wanted him to do—he sent me Apella to hold as a
          hostage of his good faith and of his co-operation in the public service. In that business
          I was well satisfied with the services of L. Gellius, <note n="1" anchored="true">After
            this name the MSS. have <foreign xml:lang="la">ex tribus fratribus</foreign> Segaviano,

          serve the state well. Take care of your health, return my affection for you, and defend my

          the most ill-equipped raw recruits, it is inevitable that I should be much alarmed both on
          my own account and on yours. The people of Vicetia shew very great attention to me and
          Marcus Brutus. I beg you to see that no wrong is done them in the senate on the question
          concerning their home-born slaves. They have a <pb n="265"/> very strong case, are very
          loyal to the Republic, and have a class of men opposed to them seditious and extremely

        <p> WHAT I don't do for myself my love for you and your kindnesses to me force me to do—to
          fear. For though I have often heard the story before, and never thought lightly of it,
          quite recently Segulius Labeo—and it was exactly like him-tells me that he has been in
          Caesar's company, and that there was a great deal of talk about you. That Caesar himself
          had no complaint to make against you, except as to an epigram which he said that you
          uttered: "that the young man must be complimented, honoured, and—got rid of." <note n="1"
            anchored="true">The point of the jest is in the double meaning of <foreign xml:lang="la"

          that he did not mean to give them the chance of getting rid of him. I believe for my part
          that Labeo told him this epigram or made it up himself, and that it was not mentioned
          first by the young man. As for the veterans, Labeo would have me believe that their
          language is abominable, that you are in imminent danger from them, and that they are
          exceedingly indignant at neither Caesar nor myself being among the ten commissioners,

          march, I did not think that I ought to allow myself to cross the Alps until I knew what
          was going on with you in Rome. For as to your danger, believe me they hope by swaggering
          language and threats of danger to <pb n="267"/> make great profit for themselves, when
          they have cowed you and egged on the young man, and that all that talk about your epigram
          has one origin-their desire to do as good a stroke of business as possible. Not, however,
          that I wouldn't have you be cautious and avoid traps: for nothing can be dearer and more
          precious to me than your life. Take care that you are not forced to be still more afraid
          by being timid, and that you meet the wishes of the veterans by whatever means that can be
          done. First, do what they want about the commission of ten. Next, as to rewards, vote, if
          you think good, that the lands of those veteran soldiers who have served with Antony be
          transferred to them by both Caesar and myself. As for the coinage, tell them that the
          senate with deliberation, and after a full investigation of the money, will
          authoritatively settle that business. For the four legions <note n="1" anchored="true"
            >Those with Octavian—the fourth, the <foreign xml:lang="la">Martia</foreign>, and the
            two veteran legions which he had raised. </note> to whom you in the senate have voted
          that lands should be given, I see there will be enough land to draw upon from the
          confiscations of Sulla and the territory of Capua. I think these lands should be given to
          the legions share and share alike, or by drawing lots. It is no particular wisdom of mine
          that makes me write this to you, but my love for you and my yearning for peace, which
          cannot be firmly secured without you. Unless it is absolutely necessary I shall not quit
          Italy. I am arming and preparing my legions. I hope that I shall have an army that will
          not be very unfit to grapple with all chances of fortune and all attacks of men. From the
          army commanded by Pansa Caesar does not intend to allow a legion to join me. Please answer
          this letter at once, or if the matter is very confidential, and one which you think I
          ought to know, send one of your men. <milestone unit="para"/>24 May, Eporedia. <pb n="268"

          You will say, "What did you think before?" Well, <pb n="269"/> I always knew it, but never
          with greater clearness. Your despatch was wonderfully liked by the senate, both for the
          facts it contained, which were of the utmost importance and significance, indicating
          supreme courage and consummate strategy, and also for the impressiveness of its sentiments
          and language. But, my dear Plancus, push on with all your might and finish the last
          struggles of the war. In this you will find the greatest popularity and glory. Of course
          the object of all my desires is the Republic: but, by heaven, I am by this time tired out

        <p> IF it is of importance to the Republic—as is the general belief—that you should complete
          the work in the same spirit as you have begun to do it and have actually done it, and that
          you should take part in the important operations for extinguishing the last sparks of the
          war, I think you can do nothing better or more laudable or more to your honour: and in my
          opinion this labour, activity, and patriotic spirit on your part is to be preferred to any
          hurrying on of the praetorship. For I would not have you ignorant of the amount of
          reputation which you have gained. Believe me, it is second only to Plancus, and that too
          on the testimony of Plancus himself, as well as by the report and knowledge of everybody
          else. Wherefore, if there is still any labour left for you to perform, my opinion is that
          you should throw yourself into it with energy. What can be more to your honour? And what
          is to be preferred to honour? But if <pb n="270"/> you think that you have done all you
          are bound to do for the state, I think you should come with all speed to the comitia, for
          they are likely to take place early: provided only that this hurry to secure office does
          not detract in any way from the glory which we have secured. There have been many very
          illustrious men who, being abroad on the public service, have missed their proper year for
          canvassing. And this is easier in our case, because this is not the year marked out for
          you, on the principle that if you had been aedile your year would have been two years
          later. <note n="1" anchored="true">The rule was that a full year must elapse between the
            aedileship and election to the praetorship—that is, two full years between the actual
            holding of the two offices. Thus, if Furnius had been aedile in <date when="-0044">B.C.
              44</date>, he could only have been elected praetor in <date when="-0042">B.C.
              42</date>, and held the praetorship in <date when="-0043">B.C. 43</date>. </note> As
          it is, you will appear not to omit any of the customary observance, and what is a
          quasi-statutory period of canvassing. <note n="2" anchored="true">The law required a
              <foreign xml:lang="la">professio</foreign> seventeen days (<foreign xml:lang="la"
              >trinundinum</foreign>) before the election. The year's canvassing was a matter of
            custom, not law, but of such common custom that Cicero calls it "quasi-statutory."
          </note> Moreover, I foresee that with Plancus consul <note n="3" anchored="true">Plancus
            was consul-designate for <date when="-0042">B.C. 42</date>. </note> (although even
          without him your path would be clear) your canvass would be after all more brilliant,
          provided that the campaign on which you are now engaged shall have been brought to the
          conclusion we desire. On the whole I don't think that there is much need for me to write
          any more, considering your great prudence and judgment, yet nevertheless I was unwilling
          that you should be ignorant of my opinion: the upshot of which is that I would rather you
          should judge of everything by consideration for your true position than from the chance of
          official promotion, and should look for your reward in a lasting reputation rather than in
          a rapid attainment of the praetorship. This was the gist of what I said in my house at a
          conference with my brother Quintus, Caecina, and Calvisius—all men most devoted to
          you—your freedman Dardanus being also present. My speech seemed to be approved by all of
          them. But after all you will judge best for yourself. <pb n="271"/>

        <p> Never within living memory have I seen anything happen, Plancus, more glorious, more
          welcome, or more exactly in the nick of time, than your despatch. For it was delivered to
          Cornutus <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Praetor</foreign> Urbanus, presiding in absence of consuls. See
            pp.207, 235. </note> in a full meeting of the senate just after he had read aloud the
          cold and shuffling despatch of Lepidus. Immediately after it yours was read and was
          received with loud cheers. For it was not only most welcome for the actual news it
          contained and the zeal and good services to the state which it implied, but its language
          and sentiments were also most impressive. Cries were raised that Cornutus should at once
          bring forward a motion arising from your despatch. He said that he wished time for
          consideration. When this had brought down on him a severe remonstrance from the whole
          senate, five of the tribunes brought forward a motion. Servilius <note n="2"
            anchored="true">P. Servilius <foreign xml:lang="la">Vatia</foreign> Isauricus. Cicero
            thinks him always too lenient towards the party of Antony (see p.207). He had been

            much junior to Cicero as a consular, he seems to have been called on first. </note>
          being called upon voted for postponing the business. I then delivered an opinion with
          which they all agreed to a man. What it was you will learn from the decree itself. As for
          you, though you are in no want of prudence, or rather have enough and to spare, you ought
          yet to resolve to refer nothing here, nor in the midst of such sudden and pressing
          emergencies to think yourself bound to ask advice from the senate. Be your own senate, and
          follow wherever the interest of the public service shall lead you. Let it be your object
          that we hear of some brilliant operation by you before we thought that it was going to
          happen. I pledge my word to you that whatever you achieve the senate will accept as having
          been done not merely with loyal intention, but also with wisdom. <pb n="272"/>

            assassination, joined the assassins on the Capitol and professed to have been in the
            plot. He was now in Asia, whither he had gone as quaestor with Trebonius. His year of
            quaestorship being over at the end of <date when="-0044">B.C. 44</date>, he is now
            proquaestor, as having had no successor appointed. </note> been to see our friend Brutus
            <note n="2" anchored="true">After the murder of Trebonius, Lentulus went into Macedonia
            to ask the advice of <foreign xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign> (see p.276). <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign> and Cassius had received special authority over all
            provinces east of the Adriatic from the senate (<bibl n="TLG551.17 3.63">App. B.C.
              3.63</bibl>). </note> and discovered that he was not coming to Asia for some time, I
          returned to Asia to finish off the arrears of my business and to transmit the money <note
            n="3" anchored="true">Of the taxes, which he would receive as quaestor. </note> to Rome
          as soon as possible. Meanwhile I was informed that Dolabella's fleet was in Lycia, and
          more than a hundred ships of burden, on board which his army might be embarked; and that
          Dolabella's plan was that, if he was disappointed of his hopes of getting possession of
          Syria, he should take ship and make for Italy, and there join the Antonies and the other
          outlaws. That so alarmed me that, throwing all other business aside, I endeavoured to
          reach these ships with a fleet of fewer and smaller vessels. And had I not been hindered
          by the Rhodians, that force would have perhaps been entirely destroyed. After all, it was
          to a great extent put out of action; for the fleet itself was scattered in all directions
          by the terror of our approach, the soldiers and officers took flight, the ships of burden,
          to the last vessel, fell into our hands. At least, I think I have secured—what was causing
          the greatest alarm—that Dolabella <pb n="273"/> cannot reach Italy, nor make your
          difficulties greater by reinforcing his allies. How completely the Rhodians thought that
          it was all over with us and the Republic you will learn from my public despatch. And
          indeed I have written much more mildly about their delusion than I found it in real fact
          to be. But do not be surprised at my having mentioned them in my despatch at all, for
          their infatuation is really surprising. I was not moved by any private wrong received from
          them at any time; it was their ill-will in a matter involving our lives, their violent
          adherence to the other side, the persistent disrespect shewn by them to all the best
          loyalists, that were intolerable to me. Yet after all I don't think that they were all bad
          men: but that same party of them who in old times refused to receive my father in his
          flight, <note n="1" anchored="true">From <foreign xml:lang="la">Pharsalia</foreign>. See

            of the Rhodians to receive Pompey is not mentioned by any other authority. Appian (<bibl

            triremes from Rhodes. Caesar (<bibl n="Caes. Civ. 3.102">B.C. 3.102</bibl>) tells the
            story of the exclusion of the two <foreign xml:lang="la">Lentuli</foreign>. It was at
            Cyprus and Antioch apparently that Pompey met with rebuffs. </note> and other men of the
          greatest distinction, these same men, I say, as though by some fatality are now either
          actual magistrates or have those who are in office in their power. And so they shew the
          same proud obstinacy in their malice. That the evil propensities of these men should
          sooner or later be checked, and that we should not allow them to increase by impunity, is
          not only to the advantage of the Republic, but absolutely necessary. I hope you will
          continue as before to defend my position whenever you get an opportunity, and in the
          senate and elsewhere give your Support to my reputation. Since Asia has been assigned by
          decree to the consuls, <note n="4" anchored="true">That is, Hirtius and <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Pansa</foreign>, of whose death Lentulus is still ignorant. They would
            in the ordinary course of things draw lots for it. Meanwhile the senate had given
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign> and Cassius a general superintendence of all
            the provinces between the Adriatic and Syria (<bibl n="TLG551.17 4.58">App. B.C.
              4.58</bibl>). </note> and they have been allowed until their arrival to commit the
          administration to the magistrates now in possession, I beg you to ask them to select me
          before anyone else for this position, and to commit the administration of Asia to me till
          one or the other of them <pb n="274"/> arrives. For there is no reason for their hurrying
          hither during their year of office or sending an army. For Dolabella is in Syria, and, as
          you have foreseen in your prophetic soul and have foretold, Cassius will crush him while
          they are on their way. For Dolabella has had the gates of Antioch shut in his face and got
          a good beating in trying to storm it. Not trusting in any other city, he has betaken
          himself to Laodicea, on the sea-coast of Syria. There I hope he will speedily pay the
          penalty of his crime: for he has no place of refuge, nor will he much longer be able there
          to stand out against an army as large as that of Cassius. I even hope that Dolabella has
          by this time been overpowered and crushed. Wherefore I don't suppose that Pansa and
          Hirtius will hurry themselves to go to their provinces whilst they are consuls, but will
          conduct the consulship at Rome. Therefore, if you will ask them to give me the
          administration of Asia in the meantime, I hope you may be able to get it for me. Besides,
          Pansa and Hirtius promised me personally, and wrote to me when I was away, and Pansa
          faithfully promised our friend Verrius that he would see to no successor being appointed
          for me during their consulship. It is not, upon my honour, from any special desire of a
          province that I wish my period of office prolonged; for this province has been to me the
          source of much labour, danger, and loss. And I am very anxious that I may not have
          undergone all these in vain, nor be forced to leave it before I wind up what, in spite of
          my diligence, there still remains to be done. For if I had been able to send the whole sum
          which I have levied, I should have asked to be relieved. As it is, I want to get in and
          make up what I have advanced to Cassius, what I have lost by the death of Trebonius, or by
          the cruelty of Dolabella, or the perfidy of those who have not kept their word with me and
          the Republic. And this cannot be done unless I have time. Pray take care—as is your
          habit—that I get my wish through you. I think my services to the state have been
          sufficient to give me a right to expect not only the reward of this province, but as much
          as Cassius and the two Bruti got, not only because I shared in that glorious deed and the
          danger of it, but also from the zeal and integrity of my conduct now. For I was the first
          to defy the laws passed by Antony; I was the first to bring over Dolabella's cavalry to
          the <pb n="275"/> Republic and hand them on to Cassius; I was the first to hold a levy to
          protect the common safety against a most criminal Conspiracy. I was the sole cause of
          Syria and the armies in it being put under the authority of Cassius and the Republic. For
          unless I had handed to Cassius such a large sum of money and such strong forces, and with
          such promptitude, he would not have even had the courage to enter Syria, and at this
          moment no less dangers would have been threatening the Republic from Dolabella than from
          Antony. And then, too, I did all this though I was a club-fellow and most intimate friend
          of Dolabella, most closely allied in blood to the Antonies, and, moreover, in possession
          of a province by their favour; yet, "loving my country more," <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">filw= te/kn' a)lla\ patri/d' e)mh\n ma=llon filw=n</foreign>,
            said to be from the Erechtheus of Euripides. </note> I was the first to proclaim war
          against men who were all my friends. Though I am aware that these things have as yet not
          brought me much profit, nevertheless I do not despair, nor shall I be prevented by fatigue
          from abiding not merely in my passion for freedom, but also in labour and dangers. Still,
          after all, if I am encouraged by some just and well-deserved credit through the good
          offices of the senate and aristocracy, I shall enjoy a greater prestige with others, and
          be able to be so much the more serviceable to the Republic. I could not see your son when
          I visited Brutus, because he had already started with the cavalry into winter quarters,
          but upon my honour I am rejoiced at the reputation he enjoys, both for your sake and his,
          and especially for mine. For he is like a brother to me, as being your son and worthy of
          you. Good-bye. <milestone unit="para"/>29 May, Perga. <pb n="276"/>

        <p> If you<note n="1" anchored="true">The title of proquaestor was explained in a note to
            the previous letter: that of propraetor arose from the fact that, as there was no
            regular praetorius or <foreign xml:lang="la">consularis</foreign> in the province
            (Trebonius being killed), and as the senate had committed the province to the consuls,
            Lentulus's position was that of <foreign xml:lang="la">legatus</foreign> to the consuls,
            and in that case he exercised praetorial functions, and his regular designation was
              <foreign xml:lang="la">legatus pro</foreign> praetore. A few years later Augustus used
            this title for all governors of imperial provinces. </note> and your children are well,
          I am glad. I am well. Asia having been overrun by the criminal proceedings of Dolabella, I
          betook myself to the neighbouring province of Macedonia and to those defences of the
          Republic which the honourable citizen Marcus Brutus had under his command, and urged that
          the province of Asia and its revenues should be restored to your authority by those who
          could do so most promptly. This alarmed Dolabella, and therefore, after plundering the
          province, seizing its revenues, selecting Roman citizens especially to beggar and sell up,
          he quitted Asia quicker than the protecting force could be brought into it. I therefore
          did not think it necessary to delay any longer, nor to wait for the garrison, and I
          conceived that I ought to return at the earliest opportunity to my duty, in order that I
          might both collect the arrears of revenue and call in the money I had deposited, and
          ascertain as soon as possible what part of it had been seized, or by whose fault that had
          occurred, and inform you about the whole affair. <milestone unit="para"/>Meanwhile on my
          voyage by the island route <note n="2" anchored="true">As opposed to crossing the

              <foreign xml:lang="grc">dia\ nh/swn</foreign>. </note> into Asia I <pb n="277"/> was
          met by the information that Dolabella's fleet was in Lycia, and that the Rhodians had a
          number of vessels fully equipped and ready launched. Accordingly, with the ships which
          either I had brought with me or the proquaestor Patiscus had secured—a man very closely
          united to me both by intimate friendship and political sympathies—I diverted my course to
          Rhodes, trusting in your authority and the decree of the senate, by which you had declared
          Dolabella a public enemy, and also in the treaty which had been renewed with them in the
          consulship of M. Marcellus and Servius Sulpicius, <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <date when="-0051">B.C. 51</date>. </note> in which the Rhodians had sworn to have the
          same enemies as the senate and Roman people. However, I found myself entirely mistaken.
          For so far from our strengthening our fleet by any assistance from them, our soldiers were
          even warned off by the Rhodians from city, harbour, the roadstead outside the city, from
          purchasing provisions, and finally even from taking in water; while I myself was only just
          allowed to approach in a single boat. This insult and derogation from the dignity, not
          only of my official position, but also of the imperial position of the Roman people, I did
          not resent, because from an intercepted despatch I had learnt that Dolabella, if he had
          despaired of Syria and Egypt—as was certain to happen-was prepared to embark on board his
          ships with all his outlaws and all his money and make for Italy; and that for that purpose
          also some transports, not one of which was less than 2,000 amphorae burden, <note n="2"
            anchored="true">About sixty tons burden. </note> collected in Lycia were being guarded
          by his fleet. Dismayed by the alarming nature of this report, fathers of the senate, I
          preferred to submit to the insult and to try first every means, though involving personal
          indignities. Therefore, being in accordance with their wishes introduced into the city and
          senate, I pleaded the cause of the Republic with the greatest earnestness of which I was
          capable, and stated the whole danger of the situation which threatened us, if that outlaw
          embarked with all his forces. But I found the Rhodians to be so utterly misguided, that
          they thought the loyalists were the weakest of all parties: that they were more ready to
          disbelieve in the existing unanimity and agreement of all orders in the defence of
          liberty: that they were <pb n="278"/> confident that the tolerance of the senate and the
          aristocracy was even now what it had been before, and that no one would have the Courage
          to declare Dolabella a public enemy: in fact that they regarded as true all the figments
          of the traitors rather than what had really taken place and was being stated by me. It was
          with these views that even before my arrival, after the atrocious murder of Trebonius and
          numerous other abominable crimes, two embassies from them had gone to Dolabella, and that
          too contrary to all precedent, <note n="1" anchored="true">Because they always dealt
            directly with the senate. </note> it being against their own laws, and in spite of the
          prohibition of the then existing magistrates. Though they might easily have applied a
          remedy for this crisis, they refused to do so. I don't know whether it was, as they give
          out, from fear for the lands which they possess on the continent, or from the infatuation
          or tolerance of a few politicians who on previous occasions equally insulted men of the
          highest rank <note n="2" anchored="true">See previous letter, p.273. </note> and now do so
          to those actually in the chief offices, without precedent and without provocation from us.
          They refused—I say—in spite of the danger threatening us who were on the spot, and of that
          which threatened Italy and our city, if that murderer with his crew of outlaws sailed to
          Italy after being expelled from Asia and Syria. Some of us even suspected the magistrates
          of having detained us and of having wasted time until Dolabella's fleet was informed of
          our arrival. And this suspicion was deepened by several things that occurred afterwards,
          especially by the fact that Dolabella's legates Sextus Marius and Gaius Titius suddenly
          quitted the fleet on the Lycian coast and fled on board a ship of war, abandoning the
          transports, in the collection of which they had spent considerable time and labour.
          Accordingly, when we arrived at Lycia from Rhodes with the ships then in our possession,
          we took over the transports and sent them back to their owners. Thus we ceased to feel
          what had been our chief fear—that Dolabella might find means to reach Italy with his
          outlaws. We pursued his flying fleet as far as Sida, which is the farthest district of my
          province. There I ascertained that some of Dolabella's ships had scattered and fled, that
          the rest had made for Syria and Cyprus. These being thus dispersed, as <pb n="279"/> I
          knew that the very large fleet of the eminent citizen and general Cassius would be ready
          to meet him in Syria, I returned to my official duties: as I shall do my best, fathers of
          the senate, to give you and the Republic the full benefit of my zeal and industry; and as
          to money—I will collect as much as I can and with the greatest possible promptness, and
          will send it by every means in my power. When I have made a tour of my province and have
          ascertained who have been faithful to us and to the Republic in safeguarding the money
          which I deposited with them, and who are guilty of actually handing over public money and
          by this gift entering into a partnership with Dolabella in his crimes, I will inform you.
          And if you will pass a severe sentence, should it so please you, upon these men and back
          me up by the weight of your authority, I shall be able with greater ease both to collect
          the arrears of revenue and keep that already collected safe. Meantime, in order more
          thoroughly to protect the revenues and to defend my province from ill-treatment, I have
          enrolled a guard formed of volunteers and only such as was absolutely necessary. <note

            something lost by that, and I have followed Mueller therefore in maintaining the old
            arrangement. </note> about thirty soldiers, whom Dolabella had enlisted in Asia,
          escaping from Syria arrived in Pamphylia. They brought word that Dolabella bad arrived at
          Antioch in Syria: that not being admitted he made several attempts to force an entry, but
          had always been repulsed with great loss; and accordingly after losing about 600 men,
          abandoning his sick, he retreated by night from Antioch towards Laodicea: that in that
          night nearly all his Asiatic soldiers deserted him: that of these about 800 returned to
          Antioch and surrendered to the officers commanding the city who had been left there by
          Cassius: that the rest crossed Mount Amanus and descended into Cilicia, to which number
          they said that they also belonged themselves: <pb n="280"/> finally, that Cassius with his
          whole force was reported to be four days' march from Laodicea at the time when Dolabella
          was pressing on to that town. Wherefore I feel sure that a most villainous outlaw will be
          punished sooner than I thought. <milestone unit="para"/>2 June, Perga. </p>

        <p> ALL the news from your part of the world is so uncertain that nothing occurs to me to
          say to you. For at one time reports of Lepidus are satisfactory, at another the reverse.
          However, of you the report is unvarying—that you can be neither hoodwinked nor beaten. The
          credit for the latter is to a certain extent fortune's, for the former it wholly belongs
          to your own good sense. But I have received a letter from your colleague <note n="1"
            anchored="true">Decimus <foreign xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign>, who with Plancus was
            Consul-designate for <date when="-0042">B.C. 42</date>. </note> dated the 15th of May,
          in which he said that you had written to tell him that Antony was not being received by
          Lepidus. I shall feel more certain of this if you give me the same information in a
          letter, but perhaps you do not venture to do so owing to the ill-grounded cheerfulness of
          your former letter. But as it was possible for you, my dear Plancus, to make a mistake—for
          who escapes doing so ?-so no one can fail to see that it was impossible that you should be
          taken in. Now, however, even the plea of being mistaken has been taken away—"Twice on the

          will be the man. I am not at all surprised and am deeply gratified that my zeal on your

        <p> I am wonderfully pleased, my dear Brutus, that you approve of my policy and sentiments
          about the decemvirs, and about complimenting the young man. But what does it matter?
          Believe me—a man not given to brag—I am now, Brutus, quite in the cold shade. For my
          weapon was the senate: that has now gone to pieces. Your splendid breaking out from
          Mutina, and the flight of Antony after his army had been cut to pieces, had given us such
          a bright hope of certain victory, that the spirits of all have begun to flag, and those
          old fiery contests of mine seem to be, as it were, a mere fighting with shadows. But to
          return to business. People who know them say that the Martia and the fourth legion cannot
          by any persuasion whatever be brought over to you. <note n="1" anchored="true">This of
            course proved true. They kept with Octavian, and refused to have anything to do with an
            assassin of Caesar. See pp.264, 267. </note> As to the money you want, some means can be
          taken for that, and shall be taken. About summoning Marcus Brutus and keeping Caesar to
          protect Italy, I agree with you. But, as you say, you have some detractors. I have no
          difficulty in rebutting them, yet they do hamper one. We are expecting the legions from
          Africa. <note n="2" anchored="true">To be sent by Cornificius. They arrived on the same

          in a social point of view. Besides that, I am under great obligations to him for kindness

          I am thoroughly alarmed about the whole business, and think myself bound to back up Lamia.
          How much help you can give me in that affair I have no difficulty in seeing, nor indeed
          have I any doubt of how much you are willing to do for my sake. Pray therefore, my dear
          Brutus, convince yourself that I can make no request of you with greater earnestness, and
          that you cannot oblige me more than by assisting Lamia in his canvass with all your
          influence and all your zeal. I warmly beg you to do so. <note n="1" anchored="true">That
            Cicero should have written these two notes on the same subject and with some identical

        <p> IF you are well, I am glad. I am also well. Lepidus caused me to be later than I should
          have been in receiving intelligence of the battles fought near Mutina, for he detained my
          letter-carriers for nine days. However, it is almost a thing to be desired, that one
          should be as late as possible in hearing of such a calamity to the Republic, especially
          for those who can do no good or offer any cure for it. And oh! that by the same decree by
          which you summoned Plancus and Lepidus into Italy, you had also ordered me to come!
          Assuredly the Republic would not have sustained this blow. At which, if certain persons
          rejoice for the moment, because both officers and veterans of Caesar's party appear to
          have perished, it is yet inevitable that they will presently have cause to mourn, when
          they contemplate the havoc of Italy. For the flower and main stock of our soldiers have
          been destroyed, if at least the news reaching me is in any degree true. Nor do I fail to
          perceive of how <pb n="287"/> much service to the Republic I was likely to have been, had
          I come to Lepidus: for I should have dispelled all his hesitation, especially with the aid
          of Plancus. But it was clearly necessary for me to smooth down a man who writes me the
          sort of letter which I inclose for your perusal, exactly in the same tone as the harangues
          which he is said to have delivered at Narbo, <note n="1" anchored="true">See p.240.
          </note> if I wished to have any provisions during a march through his province. Besides I
          was afraid, if the battle took place before I had accomplished my purpose, that my
          detractors would put an exactly opposite interpretation on my patriotic design on account
          of my friendship with Antony, which after all was not greater than that with Plancus.
          Therefore in April having embarked two letter-carriers on two separate ships at Gades, I
          wrote to you and the consuls and Octavian, requesting to be informed how I could do the
          best service to the Republic. But, as I calculate the time, the ships started from Gades
          on the very day on which Pansa fought his battle : <note n="2" anchored="true">April 15th,
            at Forum <foreign xml:lang="la">Gallorum</foreign>. See p.182. </note> for that was the
          first day since the winter that navigation was possible. And by heaven, being far from any
          suspicion of the coming civil outbreak, <note n="3" anchored="true">He uses the
            constitutional word <foreign xml:lang="la">tumultus</foreign>, which was properly
            applied to civil war within the borders of Italy as opposed to <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >bellum</foreign>, a foreign war: though the latter is frequently used of it by Cicero
            and others, partly because the distinction is not observed in ordinary language, and
            partly <foreign xml:lang="la">ad invidiam</foreign>, Antony having been declared a
              <foreign xml:lang="la">hostis</foreign>. Pollio's having no suspicion of what was
            coming is a little too innocent. He was, in fact, at heart a Caesarian, and an opponent
            of Cicero. </note> I had put the legions into winter quarters in remote parts of
          Lusitania. Moreover, both sides were in such a hurry to fight, as though they were afraid
          of the war being settled without the greatest possible damage to the Republic. However, if
          such haste was necessary, I perceive that the strategy of Hirtius was in all respects that
          of a consummate general. At present I have the following news from Lepidus's district of
          Gaul <note n="4" anchored="true">Lepidus was governor of Northern Spain and <foreign
              xml:lang="la">Gallia Narbonensis</foreign>. </note> by letter and messengers: that

          Carfulenus killed: that in the battle fought by <pb n="288"/> Hirtius <note n="1"

            at Forum <foreign xml:lang="la">Gallorum</foreign> (April 15th-21st). </note> both the
          fourth legion and all Antony's alike were cut to pieces, as well as those of Hirtius; that
          the fourth, indeed, after also capturing Antony's camp were annihilated by the fifth: that
          there Hirtius also and Pontius Aquila perished: that Octavian also is said to have
          fallen—for this if true, which God forbid! <note n="2" anchored="true">Perhaps this
            parenthesis was inserted when the letters were edited. The mixture of truth and

              (<date to="1900" from="1899">1899</date>-1900). </note> I am exceedingly grieved: that
          Antony has abandoned the siege of Mutina with disgrace, but has 5,000 cavalry, three
          legions fully armed and organized, <note n="3" anchored="true">Lit. "under standards,"
            i.e., when the several cohorts and maniples were still under their proper standards, and
            the men not crowded together indiscriminately, as would be the case in a beaten and
            disorganized legion. </note> and one commanded by Publius Bagiennus: <note n="4"
            anchored="true">This name is very uncertain. The MSS. have <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >pupilli</foreign> Bagienni. It seems likely that a legion raised among the Bagienni
            living near the source of the Po is meant. "Publius the Bagiennian" may be the commander
            of <foreign xml:lang="la">it—a</foreign> Romanized native. </note> that Ventidius also
          with the seventh, eighth, and ninth legions has effected a junction with him: and that if
          Antony finds nothing to hope for from Lepidus, he will have recourse to extreme measures,
          and raise not only the native tribes, but also the slaves: that Parma has been sacked:

          the Alps. very doubtful whether this military organization of the equites existed at this
          time in reality. It was elaborated by Augustus some years later. Now if these things are
          true, not one of us ought to be idle or wait for a decree from the senate. For the
          situation forces all to aid in quenching such a dreadful conflagration, who wish the
          Empire, or in fact the very name, of the Roman people, to survive. For I hear that Decimus
          Brutus has only seventeen cohorts, and two weak legions of recruits, which Antony had
          enrolled. However, I have no doubt the survivors of Hirtius's army are all flocking to
          him. For I don't think there is much hope in a levy, especially as, nothing can be more
          risky than that Antony should have time given him for concentration. The season of the
          year too gives me more freedom of action, because the corn is by this <pb n="289"/> time
          in the fields <note n="1" anchored="true">That is, cut and stacked in the fields, and
            therefore he can get plenty without trouble. </note> or in the farmhouses. Therefore in
          my next letter my plans shall be explained: for I do not wish to fail in duty to or to
          survive the Republic. However, what vexes me most is the length and dangerous nature of
          the journey to my quarters, the result of which is that no news reaches me till the
          fortieth day after the event, or even later. </p>

        <p> IN the midst of excessive sorrow I find consolation in the fact that the world now knows
          that it was not without cause that I feared what has actually occurred. Let them consider
          whether to bring the legions from Africa or not, and also from Sardinia; and whether to
          summon Marcus Brutus or not; and whether to give or decree me pay for my soldiers. I am
          sending a despatch to the senate. Believe me that unless all these measures are taken as
          described in my despatch, we shall be in the greatest danger. I beseech you to see to whom
          to intrust the business of bringing the legions to me. What is necessary is loyalty and
          speed. <note n="2" anchored="true">We do not possess the public despatch referred to, or
            any more letters from Decimus <foreign xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign>. He evidently knew
            when he wrote this despairing note that Lepidus had joined Antony—as he did on the 29th
            of May—and that his chance was over. He did, however, effect a junction with Plancus at
              <foreign xml:lang="la">Cularo</foreign> (Grenoble) about the 27th of June, and the two
            kept open the Alpine pass and communication between <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >Eporedia</foreign> (Ivrea) and Grenoble for some weeks. But in August or early in

            Decimus with the other assassins to be condemned under the <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >lex</foreign> Pedia—Pollio arrived with his legions, joined Lepidus and Antony, and
            persuaded Plancus to do the same. The frantic attempts of Decimus to march across Italy
            to <foreign xml:lang="la">Ravenna</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="la">Aquileia</foreign>
            and take ship to join M. <foreign xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign> in Macedonia, the

              >Aquileia</foreign>, his flight to the Rhine, and his death by the hands of a
            Sequanian Gaul, at the command of Antony, followed in September—October. He was the
            third of the assassins to <foreign xml:lang="la">die</foreign> a violent death,
            Trebonius and Aquila having already fallen. He had perhaps less excuse than any for
            taking part in the crime and blunder of the Ides of March. Cicero exalts his character
            in grandiloquent terms, and Caesar trusted and employed him constantly; yet he seems to
            have been a man of little political ability. </note>

          obliged to you, my dear Brutus, as I ought to be for wishing me to know that piece of
          folly, whatever it amounted to. For you gave a great proof of your affection thereby. As

          who is always on the look-out for revolutionary bonnes fortunes—not that he has devoured
          his own, for he never had any, but he has made a hearty meal on this last tit-bit. Again,
          you say that what you would not do for yourself, you do for me— <pb n="291"/> namely, be

          which will admit of no precautions I do not much trouble myself. For I should be shameless
          if I asked more than a human being can have bestowed on him by nature. When you bid me
          take care lest by a timid line of policy I may be compelled to fear still more, you speak
          like the wise man and affectionate friend that you are. But pray believe that, as everyone
          knows you to be eminent in this particular excellence-never, that is, to be frightened,
          never to lose your head—so I come near this high quality of yours. Wherefore I will fear
          nothing and be on my guard about everything. But be careful, my dear Brutus, that it is
          not your fault if I am afraid of anything. For, encouraged by your resources and your
          consulship, even if we had been timid by nature, we should yet have shaken off all fear,
          especially as everyone would have been convinced, and I above all, that we were regarded

          Cicero, shall I repent of encountering the greatest dangers for my country, provided that,
          if anything happen to me, I escape the reproach of rashness. I confess that I should have
          made a slip from imprudence, if I had ever believed at the bottom of my heart in Lepidus.
          For credulity is an error rather than a crime, and indeed the honester the man the more
          easily does it find its way into his mind. But it was not by this defect that I was all
          but taken in: for I knew Lepidus thoroughly. What was it, then? It was
          over-scrupulousness—the most dangerous thing in war—that compelled me to incur this risk.
          For, if I had stopped there, I was afraid of being thought by <pb n="293"/> some of my
          detractors both to have been too obstinate in my quarrel with Lentulus, and to be actually
          fostering the war by my waiting policy. Accordingly, I brought up my forces almost to
          within sight of Lepidus and Antony, and leaving a space between us of forty miles I took
          up a position with the design of being able either to approach them with speed or to
          retire in safety. In selecting my ground I secured two advantages, a river in my front,
          which would delay an enemy in crossing it, and the Vocontii close at hand, through whose
          territory my road would be kept open without fear of treachery. Lepidus, having given up
          hope of my arrival, which he was very anxious to secure, effected a junction with Antony
          on the 29th of May, and on the same day they advanced against me. When they were twenty
          miles off I got news of this. By the blessing of heaven I managed to retire with speed
          without this movement having any appearance of a flight: without a single soldier or
          horseman or particle of baggage being lost or being intercepted by those hot-headed
          outlaws. Accordingly, on the 4th of June I got my whole force across the Isara and broke
          the bridge which I had constructed, that my men might have time to pull themselves
          together, and that I might meanwhile effect a junction with my colleague, whom I am
          expecting in three days from the date of this letter. I will always acknowledge the
          fidelity and eminent loyalty to the Republic of my friend Laterensis. But certainly his
          excessive consideration for Lepidus made him somewhat less acute in his view of these
          dangers. It is true that when he saw that he had been duped, he tried to lay the hands
          upon himself which he would have done better to have armed against Lepidus. In this
          attempt, however, he was interrupted, and is still alive, and is said to be likely to
          live: but of this after all I have no certain information. It was a great chagrin to those
          parricides that I escaped from their clutches: for they were coming inspired by the same
          madness against me as against their country. Their temper also had been embittered by
          recent events-because I had not ceased lashing Lepidus, urging him to put an end to the
          war; because I rejected the idea of conferences; because I had forbidden legates sent to
          me under the guarantee of Lepidus to come into my presence; because I had captured Gaius
          Catius Vestinus, a military tribune, sent by Antony to him <pb n="294"/> with, a despatch,
          and had treated him as an enemy. <note n="1" anchored="true">He may mean that he kept him
            as a prisoner of war, but I fear the phrase in Caesar usually means "put to the sword"
            (in <foreign xml:lang="la">numero hostis habere</foreign>). </note> And in all this I
          have at least this satisfaction, that at any rate the more eager they were to get me the
          more annoyance has their failure caused them. It is your part, my dear Cicero, to,
          continue as before using all your vigilance and energy in reinforcing us who are at the
          actual seat of war. Let Caesar come with the best troops he has, or, if any circumstance
          prevents him from coming himself, let his army be sent. <note n="2" anchored="true"

          All the ruffian element that was at any time likely to join the camp against their country
          has now combined. In defence, then, of the city's bare existence, why should we not employ

        <p> MY quaestor Balbus <note n="3" anchored="true">Balbus the younger, nephew of Cicero's
            client. He had been a warm Caesarian. See vol. ii., p.201. </note> having amassed from
          the public taxes a large sum of ready money, a great amount of bullion, and a still
          greater amount of silver, has withdrawn from <pb n="295"/> Gades without even paying the
          soldiers, and after being detained three days off Calpe by bad weather, on the 1st of June
          crossed into the kingdom of Bogudes, <note n="1" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Mauretania Tingitana</foreign> (Tangiers). Bogudes or Bogud was a
            supporter of the Caesarians. </note> with a very pretty bit of money in his pocket. With
          the rumours now going about I don't yet know whether he intends to return to Gades or to
          go to Rome—for at every fresh piece of news he changes his plans in the most contemptible
          manner. But besides his peculations and violent robberies and flogging of allies, he has
          done the following—as he is himself accustomed to boast—in imitation of Caesar. At the
          games which he gave at Gades, on the last day of the show, he presented the actor
          Herennius Gallus with a gold ring and formally conducted him to a seat in the fourteen
          rows <note n="2" anchored="true">That is, he made him an <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >eques</foreign>. Fourteen rows in the theatres, even in the provinces, were reserved
            for <foreign xml:lang="la">equites</foreign>, in accordance with the <foreign
              xml:lang="la">lex</foreign> Roscia. The gold ring had been the special mark of
              <foreign xml:lang="la">equites</foreign> since some period before the Punic wars. Once
            it had been confined to senators going abroad on missions, and under the empire it was
            used by all <foreign xml:lang="la">ingenui</foreign>. The reference to the action of
            Iulius Caesar is to his treatment of Decimus Laberius (see <bibl n="Suet. Jul. 39">Suet.
              Iul. 39</bibl>), who played his own mime: <foreign xml:lang="la">donatusque</foreign>
            L <foreign xml:lang="la">sestertiis et anulo aureo</foreign> in quattuordecim e <foreign
              xml:lang="la">scaena</foreign> per <foreign xml:lang="la">orchestram
              transiit</foreign>. But Suetonius infers that Laberius was an <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >eques</foreign> already. </note> —for he had arranged that number of rows for men of
          equestrian rank. He also caused his office as one of the quattuorviri <note n="3"
            anchored="true">The magistrates of <foreign xml:lang="la">Gades</foreign>, as a <foreign
              xml:lang="la">municipium</foreign>, were <foreign xml:lang="la"

              <foreign xml:lang="la">Gades</foreign>, and he no doubt, being in Spain, had as a
            favour to his town accepted the office, though he was a Roman quaestor. See the case of
            Cicero's son at <foreign xml:lang="la">Arpinum</foreign>, vol. iii., p 63. </note> to be
          continued beyond the year: he held elections for two years in two following days, that is,
          he declared whom he chose elected: he recalled exiles, not those of recent times, but of
          that period in which the senate was massacred or expelled by rebels in the proconsulship
          of Sextus Varus. <note n="4" anchored="true">
            <date when="-0056">B.C. 56</date>. Sextus Quintilius Varus was praetor in B.C 57.
          </note> The next thing, at any rate, is not covered by a precedent of Caesar's: he put on
          the stage a "Roman drama" representing his own expedition to solicit the proconsul Lucius
          Lentulus, and, what is more, whilst it was being acted he burst into tears, affected by
          the memory of his own adventures. <note n="5" anchored="true">The story is told by
            Velleius Paterculus (ii. 51) how Balbus," with a daring almost passing belief," made his
            way into Pompey's camp at <foreign xml:lang="la">Dyrrachium</foreign>, and tried to
            persuade Lentulus (<foreign xml:lang="la">consul</foreign>
            <date when="-0049">B.C. 49</date>) to desert to Caesar. </note> At the <pb n="296"/>
          gladiatorial Contests, moreover, there was the case of the old Pompeian soldier named
          Fadius. Because this man, having been pressed into the gladiatorial school, and having
          fought twice without pay, refused to bind himself as a professional gladiator, and threw
          himself on the protection of the people, he first of all sent a squadron of Gallic horse
          to charge the people—for stones were thrown at him as Fadius was being dragged off—and
          then, having seized him, he half buried him in the school and burnt him alive. While this
          was being done he walked about after dinner without his boots, <note n="1" anchored="true"
            >The <foreign xml:lang="la">calcei</foreign> were taken off before dinner in the house
            and slippers put on-called <foreign xml:lang="la">soleae</foreign> or <foreign

            the story of Caesar's emotion at hearing of Octavius's illness. He was at dinner, and
            springing up went to the house <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)nupo/dhtos</foreign>, i.e.,
              <foreign xml:lang="la">nudis pedibus</foreign>, with his dinner-slippers on. </note>
          with tunic ungirdled, and his hands behind his back, and in answer to the unhappy man
          crying out " I am a born Roman citizen," he replied: "Off with you then, and appeal to the
          people " <note n="2" anchored="true">The brutality is pointed by the wretched man being
            half-buried and unable to stir. </note> He also exposed Roman citizens to the beasts,
          among them a certain travelling pedlar—a very well-known character at Hispalis from his
          misshapen body. This is the kind of monster with whom I have had to deal. But more about
          him when we meet. For the present the important thing is to make up your minds what you
          want me to do. I have three strong legions, one of which—the twenty-eighth-Antonius tried
          to get to join him by promising that on the day it arrived in camp he would give each
          soldier 500 denarii, <note n="3" anchored="true">About £20. </note> and the same bounty in
          case of victory as to his own legions. And of such bounties who thinks that there will be
          any limit or end ?-Nevertheless I have managed to retain it though in a most restless
          state: nor should I have retained it, if I had kept it united and stationary, for certain
          cohorts have actually mutinied. My other legions also he has not ceased to solicit by
          letters and unlimited promises. Nor, indeed, has Lepidus been less urgent with me—in
          letters of his own and from Antony—to send them the <pb n="297"/> thirtieth legion. So the
          army which I have refused to part with at any price, or to weaken from fear of the dangers
          portended in case they were victorious, you ought to consider to have been retained and
          preserved for the Republic, and to believe that I was prepared to obey any future commands
          of yours, since I have obeyed those which you have given. For I have kept my province in
          peace and my army under my own control: I have not quitted the borders of my province in
          any direction: I have not despatched a single soldier anywhere-not only of the legions,
          but even of the auxiliaries; and such of the cavalry as I have detected in trying to get
          out of the country I have punished. For these acts I shall think myself sufficiently
          rewarded if the Republic is safe. But if the Republic and the majority of the senate had
          known me as well as they ought, they would have got greater advantages out of me. A
          despatch which I have addressed to Balbus, since he is at this moment in the province, I
          am sending for your perusal. Also if you will care to read a "Roman drama," <note n="1"

          <dateline>ROME (JUNE)</dateline>
        </opener>
        <p> Is it really so? Does no one bring a letter from me to you except suitors? There are a
          good many of that sort certainly: for you have created the impression that no one is
          effectively recommended to you without a letter from me. <note n="1" anchored="true">See
            the recommendatory letters to Cornificius, pp.194-196. </note> But who among all your
          friends ever told me of anyone to whom I could intrust a letter without my doing so? Or
          what greater pleasure have I than writing to you or reading a letter from you, since I am
          debarred from talking to you? What troubles me more than anything is that I am so
          overwhelmed with business as not to have the power of writing to you whenever I choose.
          For I should have bombarded you, not with mere letters, but with whole volumes, with
          which, however, I ought to have been first challenged by you to respond. For though you
          are busy, yet you have more leisure than I have, or, if you haven't any leisure either,
          don't cast modesty to the winds and vex me by demanding more frequent letters, when you
          only write to me yourself at long intervals. For though I was before this distracted with
          the most constant engagements, arising from the fact that I consider the safety of the
          state to require my every thought and care, yet at this present moment I am much more
          distracted than ever. For as an illness is more serious when after imagining themselves
          cured invalids suffer a relapse, so is our distress more acute when, after fighting a
          successful battle and almost putting an end to the contest, we are struggling with a
          recrudescence of the same war. But enough of this. Assure <pb n="302"/> yourself, my dear
          Cornificius, that I am not so feeble-minded, not to say unfeeling, as to be Capable of
          being surpassed by you in good offices or affection. I never doubted it indeed, but
          Chaerippus has all the same made your affection to me much more evident. What an excellent
          fellow! He always suited my taste, but now I find him quite delightful. It was not merely
          your sentiments and words that he conveyed to me: he brought vividly before me your every
          look. So don't be afraid of my having been annoyed with you for treating me as you do the
          rest of the world. I have indeed desired a letter from you addressed exclusively to
          myself, but it was never unreasonably, and always in an affectionate spirit. As to the
          money which you say you are spending and have spent on your army, I can do absolutely
          nothing to aid you, because the senate is made helpless by the loss of both consuls, <note
            n="1" anchored="true">The consuls had the power of issuing money from the treasury, and
            even drawing on the reserve fund (vol. ii., p. 263). But in their absence the control of
            the ordinary treasury was in the hands of the senate. Perhaps Cicero means that the only
            money available was the reserve, with which the senate could not or would not deal
            without a <foreign xml:lang="la">consul</foreign>. </note> and the treasury is in
          incredible straits for money, which is being called in on every side to satisfy the
          promises made to the soldiers who have done such excellent public service. Even this I
          think cannot be done without a property tax. <note n="2" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Tributum</foreign>, which had never been levied in Italy since
            the conquest of Macedonia, <date when="-00167">B.C. 167</date>. It was apparently levied
            in the course of this year, but the freedom from it remained the privilege of Italy for
            nearly three centuries afterwards. See <bibl n="Cic. Phil. 2.93">Phil. 2.93</bibl>;
              <bibl n="Cic. Off. 2.76">de Off. 2.76</bibl>. </note> That business of Attius
          Dionysius <note n="3" anchored="true">See p.173. For Tratorius, see p.139. </note> I think
          amounts to nothing, for Tratorius said nothing to me about it. As to Publius Lucceius
            <note n="4" anchored="true">See p.225. </note> I don't in any way yield to you in
          zealous interest: for he is a close friend of mine. But when I asked the liquidators <note

          </note> for a postponement, they satisfied me that they were prevented from granting it
          both by the agreement that had been come to and by their oath. Wherefore in my opinion
          Lucceius must appear. However, if he has obeyed the letter I wrote to him, he ought to be
          at Rome by the time you read this. As to the other matters you mention, <pb n="303"/> and
          especially as to money, you wrote in ignorance of Pansa's death about certain grants which
          you thought that you might get from him through me. In which you would not have been
          disappointed had he been alive, for he was attached to you. But after his death I fail to
          see what can be done. As to Venuleius, Latinus, and Horatius, I much commend you. The next
          thing you say, however, I don't approve—that in order to soften the matter for them you
          have deprived your legates also of their lictors: for in outward marks of honour they
          ought not to be put on a level with men who deserve to be disgraced; and I think that
          those three men ought in virtue of the senate's decree, if they do not quit the province,
          to be compelled to do so. This is what I had to say in answer to the letter which I
          received in duplicate. For the rest, be assured that my own political position is not
          dearer to me than yours. </p>

            is not mentioned before, but is referred to by Horace (Ep. i. 4, 3) as a writer of
            eminence, and the grammarians who annotated Horace say that he was an Epicurean and
            wrote satires, elegies and epigrams. He was executed by Augustus at Athens after the
            battle of Actium—the last of the assassins to perish. Two or three fragments of his
            poetry have been preserved: and Suetonius quotes part of a letter abusing Augustus. The
            elaborate and difficult style of this letter—the only one of his—indicates some pedantry

          your toga has been more fortunate than everyone else's <pb n="305"/> arms; and has now
          once more rescued the Republic, when all but conquered, from the hands of its enemies, and
          restored it to us. So now we shall live free men: now we shall have you—greatest of all
          citizens and most beloved by me, as you discovered in the darkest hour of the public
          fortunes—now, I say, we shall have you as a witness to our love both to you and to the
          Republic, which is so closely bound up with you. And that which you often promised that
          you would suppress while we were slaves, and would say of me when likely to be to my
          service, now, I shall not so much desire to be said as to be felt by you. For I would not
          wish to be commended by you to the good opinion of others more than to have been commended
          to your own in a manner worthy of my deserts, that you may judge these recent acts of mine
          to have been no mere hasty impulses or departures from principle, but in harmony with
          those lines of thought of which you are a witness; and may think that I deserve to be
          brought forward prominently by yourself, as giving promise of doing excellent service to
          my country. You, Marcus Tullius, have children and relatives worthy of you and deservedly
          most beloved by you. Next to them those also ought to be dear to you in public life who
          emulate your special branch of learning, of whom I wish you a goodly store: yet after all
          I don't regard myself as excluded, however great the crowd. You will always have room to
          receive me, and to employ me in everything you wish and approve. Of the goodness of my
          disposition perhaps you have already been convinced: my ability, certainly, such as it is,
          our prolonged servitude has allowed to appear less than after all it really is. <milestone
            unit="para"/>From the sea-coast of the province of Asia and from the islands we have
          launched all the ships we could; we have levied rowers, with great Opposition on the part
          of the cities, yet with fair rapidity; and we have pursued Dolabella's fleet, which is
          commanded by Lucius Figulus. This officer, by frequently holding out hopes of deserting to
          us, and yet keeping continually edging away, has by his most recent move got to Corycus,
            <note n="1" anchored="true">On the coast of <foreign xml:lang="la">Cilicia</foreign>
            Trachea (Korghoz). </note> and having closed the harbour, is beginning to offer
          resistance. Abandoning that fleet, because <pb n="306"/> we thought it better to make our
          way to the camp, and because there was another fleet coming, which Tillius Cimber had
          collected in the previous year, and the quaestor Turullius was commanding, we made for
          Cyprus. The information I got there I am anxious to tell you as quickly as possible. It is
          this: Dolabella has been actually invited not only by the people of Tarsus, the worst of
          allies, but also by the Laodiceans, who are still more disaffected. <note n="1"
            anchored="true">That is, Tarsus and Leodicea were Caesarian. </note> By the number of
          Greek soldiers which he has got from both these states, he has secured what looks like an
          army. He has a camp pitched outside the town of Laodicea, and has pulled down a part of
          the wall and united his camp with the town. Our friend Cassius with ten legions and twenty
          auxiliary cohorts, and cavalry 4,000 strong, has a camp pitched twenty miles away at
          Paltus, and thinks that he can win without a battle: for in Dolabella's quarters corn is
          already twelve drachmae the medimnus. Unless he manages to get some brought in by the
          ships of Laodicea, he must soon perish of hunger. That he should not be able to get any in
          we can easily secure between us—that is, Cassius's fleet, which is a fairly large one
          under the command of Sextilius Rufus, <note n="2" anchored="true">
            <foreign xml:lang="la">Quaestor</foreign> in Cyprus. See vol. iii., p.367. </note> and
          the three which I, Turullius, and Patiscus <note n="3" anchored="true">See p.277. </note>
          have brought up. I would have you be hopeful, and feel sure that, as you at Rome have
          relieved the Republic from its difficulties, so on our part it can be quickly relieved by
          us. Good-bye. <milestone unit="para"/>13 June, Cyprus, off Crommyuacris. <note n="4"

        <p> As I was waiting day after day for a letter from you, our friend Lupus suddenly gave me
          notice to write to you if I wanted to say anything. But I, though I had nothing to say—for
          I knew the gazette was being sent to you, and I was also told that the chatter of a letter
          with nothing in it was disagreeable to you—have aimed at brevity, following your teaching.
          Be it known to you then that our every hope rests on you and your colleague. As to M.
          Brutus we have as yet nothing certain: but I never stop calling on him in my confidential

        <p> THE brevity of your letter makes me the briefer in mine, and, to speak the honest truth,
          I can think of nothing to say. For what is going on with us I know for certain is conveyed
          to you in the gazette, what is going on with you we don't know. For just as though Asia
          were under blockade, nothing reaches us except rumours of Dolabella being crushed. These
          rumours are persistent enough, but they as yet lack confirmation. As for us, when we
          thought the war finished, we have suddenly been brought into the most extreme anxiety by
          your relative Lepidus. Therefore convince yourself that the chief hope of the Republic
          rests on you and your forces. We have, it is true, trustworthy armies: but nevertheless,
          though everything should go well, as I hope it will, it is of great importance that you
          should come. For the hope of the Republic is small—I shrink from saying "none"—but
          whatever it is, it is plighted to the year of your consulship. <note n="1" anchored="true"

          owing to the slowness with which opinions were expressed, and the delay thus caused to

        <p> After reading your letter in which you state that Narbonensis must be abandoned or a
          dangerous battle fought, the former course seemed to me the more formidable, which I am
          glad to hear has been avoided. You mention the Cordial union of Plancus and Decimus
          Brutus: in that I place my strongest hope of victory. As to the loyalty of the Gauls, we
          shall some day learn, as you say, by whose exertions that has been roused. But, believe
          me, we already know it. Therefore, most delightful as your letter was, I felt a little
          vexed at the end of it. For you say that if the elections are fixed for August you will
          hurry home: if they are already over you will come still sooner, "that you may not any
          longer play the fool and risk your life as well." Oh, my dear Furnius, how completely you
          fail to grasp your position, though so readily understanding other people's! Do you really
          suppose that you are now a candidate, or do you Contemplate hurrying home to the
          elections; or, if they are over, to live at your own house that—as you say—"you may not be
          the biggest fool alive and in danger as well "? I don't think these are your real
          sentiments; for I know your keenness for glory. But if you do really think as you write, I
          don't blame you more than I do my own opinion of you. Can it be that an untimely haste for
          an office of the most trivial and commonplace kind—if you get it in the same way as most
          people do—will withdraw you from the pursuit of such glorious deeds, for which all the
          world is rightly and sincerely praising you to the skies? The question, good heavens! is
          whether you become praetor at this election or the next, not whether you are to serve the
          Republic so as to be thought worthy above all men of every kind of honour! Is it that you
          are ignorant of the height to which you have climbed, or that you think <pb n="312"/> it
          worthless? If you are ignorant, I forgive you: the fault is ours. But if you are not, is
          any praetorship more attractive in your eyes than duty for which few, or than glory for
          which all, strive? On this point I and Calvisius—a man of very sound judgment and most
          devoted to you—daily find fault with you. As to the comitia—as you are depending on
          them—we are doing our best, thinking it for many reasons to be for the benefit of the
          Republic, to put them off till January. So then victory and health to you! </p>

        <p> LEPIDUS, your marriage relation, and my friend, was on the 30th of June declared a
          public enemy by a unanimous vote of the senate, as well as all who with him deserted the
          Republic. To them, however, a chance of returning to their right minds was given up to the
          1st of September. The senate was very resolute, but chiefly in reliance on your aid <pb
            n="315"/> There is, in fact, a very grave war in progress at the moment of my writing
          this, owing to the crime and instability of Lepidus. We daily hear satisfactory
          intelligence about Dolabella, but as yet by mere rumour-without definite source or
          confirmation. But though that is the case, still the letter which I have received from you
          dated from camp on the 7th of May has persuaded the whole city to believe that he has
          already been crushed, and that you are on your way to Italy with an army, so that, if
          affairs in these parts are settled as we wish, we may rely on your counsel and influence;
          and if there is any mishap—as will occur in war—we may rely on your army. This army,
          indeed, I will compliment by all the means in my power. The time for that will be when it
          has begun to be known what amount of aid it is likely to give to the Republic, or what
          amount it has already given. For at present we are only told of attempts-excellent indeed
          and most glorious—but we wait to hear of some decisive action: which for my own part I
          feel sure has taken place or is near doing so. Nothing can be more glorious than your
          valour and high spirit. Therefore we long to see you as soon as possible in Italy. We
          shall think that we have the Republic, if we have you. We had gained a splendid victory,
          had not Lepidus received Antony when he was without provisions or arms and in flight.
            <note n="1" anchored="true">Cicero's radical mistake was his view of Antony's
            retirement, as a flight of a helpless and demoralized force. It was, in fact, a masterly
            retreat, carried out with great skill and vigour, and with little or no loss; and before
            Antony came across Lepidus he had been strongly reinforced by Ventidius. </note>
          Therefore Antony was never such an object of dislike to the state as Lepidus is now. For
          the former stirred up war when the Republic was in a revolutionary state, the latter when
          victory had been crowned by peace. Opposed to this war we have the consuls-designate.
            <note n="2" anchored="true">Plancus and Decimus <foreign xml:lang="la">Brutus</foreign>.
          </note> In them we have indeed high hopes, but owing to the uncertainty of the results of
          battles, we are in all the anxiety of suspense. Assure yourself; therefore, that
          everything depends on you and Marcus Brutus, and that you are both anxiously expected,
          Brutus indeed now momentarily. And if; as I hope, your arrival finds our enemies
          conquered, yet your authority will enable the Republic to <pb n="316"/> raise its head and
          once more to stand on some tolerable foundation. For there will be many things demanding
          reform, even if the Republic shall seem fairly well released from the criminal attempts of
          its enemies. </p>

        <p> I cannot refrain from thanking you in view of the course of events and of your services.
          But, by heaven! I blush to do it. For an intimacy as close as that which you have wished
          me to have with you seems not to require any formal thanks, nor do I willingly pay the
          poor recompense of words in return for your supreme kindness, and I would rather, when we
          meet, prove my gratitude by my respect, my obedience to your wishes, and my constant
          attentions. But if to live on is my fate, in this same respect, obedience to your wishes,
          and constant attentions, I will surpass all your beloved friends and even your devoted
          relatives. For whether your affection for me and your opinion of me are likely to bring me
          greater reputation in perpetuity or greater daily pleasure, I should find it hard to
          decide. <milestone unit="para"/>You have concerned yourself as to the bounties to the
          soldiers; whom I wished to be rewarded by the senate, not to enhance my own power—for I am
          conscious of entertaining no thoughts except for the common benefit—but first of all,
          because in my opinion they deserved it; next, because I wished them to be still more
          closely attached to <pb n="327"/> the Republic in view of all eventualities; and lastly,
          in order that I might guarantee their continuing as completely proof against all attempts
          to tamper with their loyalty, as they have been up to this time. <milestone unit="para"
          />As yet we have kept everything here in statu quo. And this policy of ours, though I know
          how eager men are and with reason for a decisive victory, is yet, I hope, approved of by
          you. For if any disaster happens to these armies, the Republic has no great forces in
          reserve to resist any sudden attack or raid of the parricides. The amount of our forces I
          presume is known to you. In my camp there are three legions of veterans, one of recruits
          perhaps the finest of all: in the camp of Decimus Brutus there is one veteran legion, a
          second of two-years'-service men, eight of recruits. Therefore the whole force taken
          together is very strong in numbers, in stamina inferior. For how much it is safe to trust
          to raw levies in the field we have had too frequent experience. To the strength of these
          armies of ours, if there was added either the African army which consists of veterans, or
          that of Caesar, we should hazard the safety of the Republic on a battle without any
          uneasiness. Now, as to Caesar, we see that he is considerably the nearer of the two. I
          have therefore never ceased importuning him by letter, and he has uniformly replied that
          he is coming without delay: while all the time I perceive that he has given up that idea
          and has taken up some other scheme. Nevertheless, I have sent our friend Furnius <note
            n="1" anchored="true">Gaius Furnius. See p.311. </note> to him with a message and a
          letter, in case he may be able to do some good. You know, my dear Cicero, that in regard
          to love for Caesar you and I are partners, either because, being one of Iulius Caesar's
          intimates, I was obliged-while he was alive—to look after the boy and shew him affection;
          or because he was himself, as far as I could make out, of a very orderly and kindly
          disposition; or because, after such a remarkable friendship as existed between me and
          Iulius Caesar, it seems discreditable that I should not regard as a son one who was
          adopted into that position by his decision and by that of your house alike. <note n="2"
            anchored="true">For the adoption of Octavian, see p.21. By <foreign xml:lang="la"
              >vestro</foreign> Plancus seems to refer to the senate, which, though the <foreign
              xml:lang="la">curiate</foreign> law for the formal adoption had not yet been passed,
            yet practically acknowledged the adoption of Octavian in his great-uncle's will by the
            wording of its decrees. </note> Yet after all—and whatever I write <pb n="328"/> to you
          I write rather in sorrow than in anger—the fact that Antony is alive today, that Lepidus
          is with him, that they have far from contemptible armies, that they are hopeful and
          bold—for all these they may thank Caesar. I will not go back to old matters, but from the
          moment that he gave out that he was coming to me, if he had chosen to come, the war would
          at once have either been put an end to, or, to their very great loss, have been thrust
          back into Spain, which is most hostile in sentiment to them. What idea or whose advice has
          withdrawn him from such great glory, which was at the same time required by his interests
          and needful for his safety, and has turned his attention to the thought of a two-months'
          consulship, entailing a great and general panic, and demanded in a peremptory and
          offensive manner—I cannot conjecture. It seems to me that in this matter his relations
          could exercise considerable influence both for his sake and for that of the Republic: most
          of all, as I think, could you also do so, since he is more obliged to you than anyone else
          is except myself—for I shall never forget that the obligations I owe you are exceedingly
          great and numerous. I commissioned Furnius to urge these considerations upon him. But if I
          prove to have as great an influence with him as I ought to have, I shall have done him a
          great service himself. Meanwhile we are maintaining the war at a disadvantage, because we
          do not think an engagement the safest Solution of the difficulty, and yet will not allow
          the Republic to suffer greater loss by our retirement. But if either Caesar has bethought
          himself; or the African legions have come promptly, <note n="1" anchored="true">The
            African legions came from Cornificius, but they almost directly joined Octavian, which
            was the last blow to the hopes of Cicero and the senate (<bibl n="TLG551.17 3.91">App.
              B.C. 3.91</bibl>, 92). </note> we will relieve you of anxiety on this side. I beg you
          to continue to honour me with your regard, and to believe that I am peculiarly at your
          service. <milestone unit="para"/>28 July, in camp.</p>
