            <head>THE ARGUMENT</head>
            <p>After the last speech which was delivered A. U. C. 674, Cicero went to <placeName
                key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName>, where he remained eighteen months, and after
              his return he did not employ himself at first as an advocate but devoted himself
              rather to philosophical studies. But in the third year, A. U. C. 677, when his friend
              Roscius, the comic actor, was interested in a cause, he returned to the bar. The
              subject of the action in which this speech was this: A man of the name of Fannius
              Chaerea had articled a young slave to Roscius on condition that Roscius was to teach
              him the art of acting, and that he and Fannius were afterwards to share his earnings.
              The slave was afterwards killed and Roscius brought an action against the man who had
              killed him, Quintus Flavius by name and received as damages a farm worth 100,000
                <foreign xml:lang="lat">sesterces</foreign>—for his half share in the slave,
              according to his own account, but as the full value of the slave according to Fannius
              but the fact was that Fannius also had brought an action against Flavius and had
              recovered similar damages. Fannius sued Roscius for 50,000 <foreign xml:lang="lat"
                >sesterces</foreign>, as his share of the damages which he (Roscius) had received
              from Flavius, suppressing the fact of his having obtained a similar sum himself. The
              beginning of this speech is lost, and also a considerable portion at the end. </p>

          <p>... He, forsooth, excellent man, and of singular integrity, endeavours in his own cause
            to bring forward his account-books as witnesses. Men are accustomed to say.... <note
              anchored="true">There is a hiatus here so that though there are some words more in the
              Latin text, which I have omitted, it is impossible to make an sense of them.</note>
            Did I endeavour to corrupt such a man as that, so as to induce him to make a false
            entrance for my sake? I am waiting till Chaerea uses this argument. Was I able to induce
            this hand to be full of falsehood, and these fingers to make a false entry? But if he
            produces his accounts, Roscius will also produce his.</p></div> 
            <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2" resp="perseus"><p>
            These words will appear in the books of the one, but not in those of the other. Why
            should you trust one rather than the other? Oh, would he ever have written it if he had
            not borne this expense by his authority? No, says the other, would he not have written
            it if he had given the authority? For just as it is discreditable to put down what is
            not owed, so it is dishonest not to put down what you do owe. For his accounts are just
            as much condemned who omits to make an entry of the truth, as his who puts down what is
            false. But see now to what, relying on the abundance and cogency of my arguments, I am
            now coming. If Caius Fannius produces in his own behalf his accounts of money received
            and paid, written at his own pleasure, I do not object to your giving your decision in
            his favour. </p></div> 
            <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3" resp="perseus"><p>What brother would show so much indulgence
            to a brother, what father to a son, as to consider whatever he entered in this manner
            proof of a fact? Oh, Roscius will ratify it. Produce your books; what you were convinced
            of, he will be convinced of; what was approved of by you, will be approved of by him. A
            little while ago we demanded the accounts of Marcus Perperna, and of Publius Saturius.
            Now, O Caius Fannius Chaerea, we demand your accounts alone, and we do not object to the
            action being decided by them—Why then do you not produce them? </p></div> 
              <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4" resp="perseus"><p>
              Does he not keep accounts? Indeed he does most carefully. Does
            he not enter small matters in his books? Indeed be does everything. Is this a small and
            trifling sum? It is 100,000 <foreign xml:lang="lat">sesterces</foreign>. How is it that such
            an extraordinary sum us omitted?—how is it that a hundred thousand <foreign
              xml:lang="lat">sesterces</foreign>, received and expended, are not down in the books? Oh,
            ye immortal gods that there should be any one endued with such audacity, as to dare to
            demand a sum which he is afraid to enter in his account-books; not to hesitate to swear
            before the court to what, when not on his oath, he scrupled to put on paper; to
            endeavour to persuade another of what he is unable to make out to his own satisfaction.</p></div> 
              
            <milestone n="2" unit="chapter" resp="yonge"/><milestone unit="Para"/><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5" resp="perseus">
          <p>He says that I am indignant, and sent the accounts too soon; he confesses that he has
            not this sum entered in his book of money received and expended; but he asserts that it
            does occur in his memoranda. Are you then so fond of yourself, have you such a
            magnificent opinion of yourself, as to ask for money from us on the strength, not of
            your account-books, but of your memoranda? To read one's account-books instead of
            producing witnesses, is a piece of arrogance; but is it not insanity to produce mere
            notes of writings and scraps of paper?</p></div> 
            <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6" resp="perseus"><p>If memoranda
            have the same force and authority, and are arranged with the same care as accounts,
            where is the need of making an account-book? of making out careful lists? of keeping a
            regular order? of making a permanent record of old writings? But if we have adopted the
            custom of making account-books, because we put no trust in flying memoranda, shall that
            which, by all individuals, is considered unimportant and not to be relied on, be
            considered important and holy before a judge?</p></div> 
              <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7" resp="perseus"><p>Why is
            it that we write down memoranda carelessly, that we make up account-books carefully? For
            what reason? Because the one is to last a month, the other for ever; these are
            immediately expunged those are religiously preserved; these embrace the recollection of
            a short time, those pledge the good faith and honesty of a man for ever; these are
            thrown away, those are arranged in order. Therefore, no one ever produced memoranda at a
            trial; men do produce accounts, and read entries in books. 
                <milestone n="3" unit="chapter" resp="yonge"/><milestone unit="Para"/>
          You, O Caius Piso, a man of the greatest good faith, and virtue, and dignity, and
          authority, would not venture to demand money on the strength of memoranda.</p></div>
            
             <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8" resp="perseus"><p>I need not say any more about matters in which the custom is so
            notorious; but I ask you this, which is very material to the question, How long ago is
            it, O Fannius, that you made this entry in your memoranda? He blushes; he does not know
            what to answer; he is at a loss for anything to invent off-hand. “It is two
            months ago,” you will say; yet it ought to have been copied into the
            account-book of money received and paid. “It is more than six
            months.” Why then is it left so long in the memorandum-book? What if it is
            more than three years ago? How is it that, when every one else who makes up
            account-books transfers his accounts every month almost into his books you allow this
            sum to remain among your memoranda more than three years?</p></div> 
               
               <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9" resp="perseus"><p>Have you all other sums of money received and expended regularly
            entered, or not? If not, how is it that you make up your books? If you have, how is it
            that, when you were entering all other items in regular order, you leave this sum, which
            was one of the greatest of all in amount, for more than three years in your memoranda?
            “You did not like it to be known that Roscius was in your debt.” Why
            did you put it down at all? “You were asked not to enter it.” Why
            did you put it down in your memoranda? But, although I think this is strong enough, yet
            I cannot satisfy myself unless I get evidence from Caius Fannius himself that this money
            is not owed to him. It is a great thing which I am attempting; it is a difficult thing
            which I am undertaking; yet I will agree that Roscius shall not gain the verdict unless
            he has the same man both for his adversary and for his witness.</p></div>

          <p>A definite sum of money was owed to you, which is now sought to be recovered at law;
            and security for a legitimate portion of it has been given. In this case, if you have
            demanded one sesterce more than is owed to you, you have lost your cause; because trial
            before a judge is one thing, arbitration is another. <note anchored="true">Professor
              Long's explanation of the difference here laid down is little more than a translation
              of and comment on this passage. He says, “The following is the distinction
              between <foreign xml:lang="lat">arbitrium</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="lat"
                >judicium</foreign> according to Cicero (<bibl n="Cic. Q. Rosc. 4">Pro Rosc. Com.
                4</bibl>). In a <foreign xml:lang="lat">judicium</foreign> the demand was of a certain or
              definite amount, <foreign xml:lang="lat">pecuniae certae</foreign>).; in an <foreign
                xml:lang="lat">arbitrium</foreign> the amount was not determined (<foreign xml:lang="lat"
                >incertae</foreign>.) In a <foreign xml:lang="lat">judicium</foreign> the plaintiff
              obtained all that he claimed or nothing, as the words of the formula show,
                “<foreign xml:lang="lat">si paret H. S. 1000 dari
              oportere.</foreign>” (Compare <bibl n="Gaius Inst. 4.50">Gaius, iv.
                50.</bibl>) The corresponding words in the formula arbitraria were
                “<foreign xml:lang="lat">Quantum aequius melius, id dari</foreign>”;
              and their equivalents were “<foreign xml:lang="lat">ex fide bona; ut inter bonos
                bene agier.</foreign>” (Top. 17)... If the matter was brought before a
                <foreign xml:lang="lat">judex</foreign>, properly so called, the <foreign xml:lang="lat"
                >judicium</foreign> was constituted with a <foreign xml:lang="lat">poena</foreign>, that
              is <foreign xml:lang="lat">per sponsionem</foreign>; there was no <foreign xml:lang="lat"
                >poena</foreign> when an arbiter was demanded, and the proceeding was by the formula
                <foreign xml:lang="lat">arbitraria</foreign>. The proceeding by the <foreign xml:lang="lat"
                >sponsio</foreign> then was the strict one, “<foreign xml:lang="lat"
                >Angustissima formula sponsionis</foreign>,” (<bibl n="Cic. Q. Rosc. 14"
                >Cic. pro Rosc. Com. 14</bibl>); that of the <foreign xml:lang="lat">arbitrium</foreign>
              was <foreign xml:lang="lat">ex fide bona</foreign>, and the arbiter, though he was bound by
              the instructions of the formula, was allowed a greater latitude by its terms. The
              engagement between the parties who accepted an arbiter, by which they bound themselves
              to abide by his <foreign xml:lang="lat">arbitrium</foreign>, was <foreign xml:lang="lat"
                >compromissum</foreign>. (<bibl n="Cic. Q. Rosc. 40">Pro Rosc. Com. 40</bibl>) But
              this term was also employed, as it appears, to express the engagement by which parties
              agreed to settle their differences by arbitration, without the intervention of the
                <foreign xml:lang="lat">praetor</foreign>. Smith, Dict. Ant. v. 530 v. <foreign xml:lang="lat"
                >Judex</foreign>. </note> Trial before a judge is about a definite sum of money;
            arbitration about one which is not determined. We come before a judge so as either to
            gain the whole suit or to lose it; we go before an arbiter on the understanding that we
            may not get all we asked, and on the other hand may not get nothing.</p></div>  
            
            <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11" resp="perseus"><p>Of that the very words of the formula are a proof. What is the
            formula in a trial before a judge? Direct severe, and simple; “if it be plain
            that fifty thousand <foreign xml:lang="lat">sesterces</foreign> ought to be paid.”
            Unless he makes it plain that fifty thousand <foreign xml:lang="lat">sesterces</foreign> to a
            single farthing are due to him, he loses his cause. What is the formula in a cause
            brought before an arbiter? “That whatever is just and right shall be
            given.” But that man confesses that he is asking more than is owed to him, but
            that he will be satisfied and more than satisfied with what is given him by the arbiter.
            Therefore the one has confidence in his case, the other distrusts his.</p></div> 
              <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12" resp="perseus"><p>And as this is the case, I ask you why you made an agreement to abide
            by arbitration in a matter involving this sum, this very fifty thousand <foreign
              xml:lang="lat">sesterces</foreign>, and the credit of your own account-books? why you
            admitted an arbitrator in such a case to decide what it was right and proper should be
            paid to you; or secured to you by bond, if it so seemed good to him? Who was the
            arbitrator in this matter? I wish he were at <placeName key="tgn,7013962"
              >Rome</placeName>. He is at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>. I wish he
            were in court. He is. I wish he were sitting as assessor to Caius

            satisfy the judge why judgment ought to pass for Roscius. A definite sum of money has
            been demanded; security is given for a third part of it; this money must either have
            been given, or set down as paid, or promised. Fannius admits it was not given; the books

            that on account of its extraordinary brilliancy we ought to feel almost as much respect

            This is neither to be borne lightly nor to be defended carelessly. For if there are any

            three—the actions about trust, about guardianship, and about partnership. For
            it is equally perfidious and wicked to break faith, which is the bond of life, and to

            learning; whom the Roman people think even a better man than he is an actor; who is as

            the truth is, your praise was prompted by truth; the accusation by your duty to your

            seem to smell of wickedness, and to proclaim cunning? Does he not from his toe-nails to
            his head, if the voiceless figure of a man's person can enable men to conjecture his
            character, seem wholly made up of fraud, and cheating, and lies? He who has his head and
            eyebrows always shaved that he may not be said to have one hair of an honest man about
            him. And Roscius has been accustomed to represent his figure admirably on the stage, and
            yet he does no meet with the gratitude due to such kindness. For when he acts Ballio,
            that most worthless and perjured pimp, he represents Chaerea. That foul, and impure, and
            detestable character is represented in this man's manners, and nature, and life. And why
            he should have thought Roscius like himself in dishonesty and wickedness, I do not know;

            probable from the character of each man; both that Fannius had acted wickedly, and that
            Roscius had been cheated by his imprudence. So when Roscius is accused of having cheated
            Fannius, both parts of the story are incredible, both that Roscius should have sought

            low,—a farm which had not a house on it, and was not well cultivated in any
            respect, which is worth much more now than it was. And no wonder, for at that time, on
            account of the calamities of the republic, every one's possessions were uncertain; now,
            by the kindness of the immortal gods, the fortunes of every one are well assured: then
            it was an uncultivated farm, without a house; now it is beautifully cultivated, with an
            excellent villa on it.</p></div> 
            <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34" resp="perseus"><p>But since by nature you are so
            malevolent, I will never relieve you from that vexation and that anxiety. Roscius
            managed his business well; he got a most fertile farm. What is that to you? Do you
            settle your half of the matter anyhow you please. He then changes his plan of attack,
            and endeavours to invent a story which he cannot prove. “You,” says
            he, “arranged the whole matter, and not your share of it only.” The
            whole cause then is brought to this point,—whether Roscius came to a
            settlement with Flavius for his own share, or for the whole partnership.</p></div> 
              <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35" resp="perseus"><p>For I confess that, if Roscius touched anything on their joint
            account, he ought to pay it to the partnership. Did he settle the quarrel of the
            partnership, and not merely his own, when he received this farm from Flavius? If so, why
            did he not give security to Flavius, that no one else should make any demand on him? He
            who settles his own demand only, leaves to the rest their right of action unimpaired; he
            who acts for his partners, gives security that none of them shall afterwards make any
            demand. Why did it not occur to Flavius to take this precaution for himself? Was he,
            forsooth, not aware that Panurgus belonged to a partnership. He knew that. Was he not
            aware that Fannius was Roscius' partner? Thoroughly; for he himself had a law-suit
            commenced with him.</p></div>
                <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36" resp="perseus"><p>Why then does he settle this
            action, and not exact an agreement that no one shall make any further demand on him? Why
            does he lose the farm, and yet get no release from this action? Why does he act in so
            inexperienced a manner, as neither to bind Roscius by any stipulation, nor on the other
            hand to get a release from Fannius' action?</p></div> 
              <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37" resp="perseus"><p>This
            first argument, drawn both from the rules of civil rights, and from the customs
            prevailing with respect to such security, is a most important and powerful one, which I
            would press at greater length, if I had not other more undeniable and manifest proofs in
            the cause. <milestone n="13" unit="chapter" resp="yonge"/><milestone unit="Para"/>
                And that you may not say I have promised this on insufficient grounds, I will call
            you—you, I say, Fannius—from your seat as a witness against
            yourself.—What is your charge? That Roscius settled with Flavius on behalf of
            the partnership.—When? Four years ago.—What is my defence? That
            Roscius settled with Flavius for his share in the property. You yourself, three years
            ago, made a new engagement with Roscius.—What? Recite that stipulation
            plainly.—Attend, I beg you, O <persName><surname>Piso</surname></persName>—I am compelling Fannius against his will, and though he is
            shuffling off in every direction, to give evidence against himself. For what are the
            words of this new agreement? “Whatever I receive from Flavius, I undertake to
            pay one half of to Roscius.” These are your words, O Fannius.</p></div> 
            <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38" resp="perseus"><p>What can you get from Flavius, if Flavius owes you nothing?
            Moreover, why does he now enter into a mutual engagement about a sum which he has
            already exacted some time ago? But what can Flavius be going to give you, if he has
            already paid Roscius everything that he owed? Why is this new mutual arrangement
            interposed in so old an affair, in a matter so entirely settled, in a partnership which
            has been dissolved? Who is the drawer up of this agreement? who is the witness? who is
            the arbitrator? who? You, O <persName><surname>Piso</surname></persName>: for you
            begged Quintus Roscius to give Fannius fifteen thousand <foreign xml:lang="lat"
              >sesterces</foreign>, for his care, for his labour, for having been his agent, and for
            having given security, on this condition, that, if he get anything from Flavius, he
            should give half of that sum to Roscius. Does not that agreement seem to show you with
            sufficient clearness that Roscius settled the affair on his own behalf alone?</p></div> 
             <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39" resp="perseus"><p>But perhaps this also may occur to you, that Fannius did in
            requital promise Roscius half of whatever he might get from Flavius, but that be got
            nothing at all. What has that to do with it? You ought to regard not the result of the
            demand, but the beginning of the mutual agreement. And it does not follow, if he did not
            choose to prosecute his demand, that he did not for all that, as far as it depended on
            him, show his opinion that Roscius had only settled his own claim, and not the claim of
            the partnership. What more? Suppose I make it evident, that after the whole settlement
            come to by Roscius, after this fresh mutual agreement entered into by Fannius, Fannius
            also recovered a hundred thousand <foreign xml:lang="lat">sesterces</foreign> from Flavius,
            for the loss of Panurgus? Will he after that still dare to sport with the character of
            that most excellent man, Quintus Roscius?</p></div>

          <p>I asked a little before—what was very material to the business, on what
            account Flavius, when (as they say) he was settling the whole claim, did neither take
            security from Roscius, nor obtain a release from all demands from Fannius? But now I ask
            how it was that, when he had settled the whole affair with Roscius, he paid also a
            hundred thousand <foreign xml:lang="lat">sesterces</foreign> to Fannius on his separate
            account? (a thing still more strange and incredible.) I should like to know, O Saturius,
            what answer are you preparing to give to this? Whether you are going to say that Fannius
            never got a hundred thousand <foreign xml:lang="lat">sesterces</foreign> from Flavius at all,
            or that he got them for some other claim, and on some other account?</p></div> 
            <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41" resp="perseus"><p>If you say it was on some other account, what dealings had you ever
            had with him? None. Had you obtained any verdict against him? No. I am wasting time to
            no purpose. He never, he says, got a hundred thousand <foreign xml:lang="lat"
              >sesterces</foreign> from Flavius at all, neither on account of Panurgus, nor of any
            one else. If I prove that, after this recent agreement with Roscius, you did get a
            hundred thousand <foreign xml:lang="lat">sesterces</foreign> from Flavius, what have you to
            allege why you should not leave the court defeated with disgrace? By what witness then

              <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42" resp="perseus"><p>This affair, as I imagine,
            came to trial. Certainly. Who was the plaintiff? Fannius. Who the defendant? Flavius.
            Who was the judge? Cluvius. Of all these men I must produce one as witness who can say
            that the money was paid. Who of these is the most authoritative witness? Beyond all
            controversy, he who was approved of as judge by the sentence of every one. Which of the
            three then will you look to me for as a witness? The plaintiff? That is Fannius; he will
            never give evidence against himself. The defendant? That is Flavius. He has been dead
            some time. The judge? That is Cluvius. What does he say? That Flavius did pay a hundred
            thousand <foreign xml:lang="lat">sesterces</foreign> to Fannius on account of Panurgus. And
            if you look at the rank of Cluvius, he is a Roman knight; if at his life, he is a most
            illustrious man; if at your own opinion of him, you chose him as judge; if to his truth,
            he has said what he both could know, and ought to know.</p></div> 
              <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43" resp="perseus"><p>Deny now, deny, if you can, that credit ought to be given to a Roman knight, to an

            recite the testimony of Cluvius. We will recite it; you are mistaken, you are consoling
            yourself with a slight and empty hope. Recite the testimony of Titus Manilius and Caius
            Luscius Ocrea, two senators, most accomplished men, who heard it from Cluvius. 
            (<emph>The secretary reads the evidence of Manilius and Luscius.</emph>) What do you
            say now—that we are not to believe Luscius and Manilius, or that we are not to

            Manilius? On this point I am of a calm and easy mind, and I am not particularly anxious
            as to which way you answer. For the cause of Roscius is fortified by the strongest and
            most solemn evidence of most excellent men. If you have taken time enough to consider to

            <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="44" resp="perseus"><p>Do you say that one must not believe Manilius and Luscius? Say it. Dare to say it.
            Such a saying suits your obstinacy, your arrogance, your whole life. What! Are you
            waiting till I say presently of Luscius and Manilius that they are as to rank senators;
            as to age, old; as to their nature, pious and religious; as to their property, rich and
            wealthy I will not do so; I will not, on pretence of giving these men the credit due to
            a life passed with the greatest strictness, put myself in so bad a light as to venture
            to panegyrize men so much older and nobler than myself, whose characters stand in no
            need of my praise. My youth is in more need of their favourable opinion than their
            strict old age is of my commendation. But you, O Piso, must deliberate and consider for
            a long time whether you will rather believe Chaerea, though not on his oath, and in his

            approved of as a judge? Will he say that you ought not to trust that man whom he has
            trusted himself? Will he disparage the credit of that man as a witness to the judge,
            when on account of his opinion of his good faith and scrupulousness as a judge, he
            brought witnesses before him? When I produce that man as a witness, will he dare to find
            fault with him, when if I were to bring him as a judge even, he would be bound not to
            decline him? Oh, but says he, he was not on his oath when he said that to Luscius and

          <p>But what is the difference between a perjurer and a liar? He who is in the habit of

            shall easily be able to prevail on to take a false oath. For he who has once departed
            from truth, is easily led on, with no greater scruples to perjury than to a lie. For who
            is influenced by just a mention of the gods in the way of deprecating their anger, and
            not by the influence of conscience? Because the same punishment which is appointed by
            the immortal gods for a perjurer is appointed also for a liar. For the immortal gods are
            accustomed to be indignant and angry, not on account of the form of words in which an

            men over eager in being a witness in a cause in which he had been judge. But now he must
            appear to all his enemies most upright and most wise, inasmuch as he only tells his

            dwell on this point for a short time. Whence was all this lie drawn, and where was it
            forged? Roscius, forsooth, is a deep and crafty man. He began to think of this from the
            first. Since, said he to himself, Fannius claims fifty thousand <foreign xml:lang="lat"
              >sesterces</foreign> from me, I will ask Caius Cluvius, a Roman knight, a most
            accomplished man, to tell a lie for my sake; to say that a settlement was made which was
            not made; that a hundred thousand <foreign xml:lang="lat">sesterces</foreign> were given by
            Flavius to Fannius, which were not given. This is the first idea of a wicked mind, of a

              <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="49" resp="perseus"><p>After he had thoroughly made up his mind, he came to Cluvius. What

            him, he began to ask him, in gentle and elegant language to be
            sure,—“Tell a lie for my sake, tell some excellent men, your own
            intimate friends who are here with you, that Flavius settled with Fannius about
            Panurgus, though in truth he did not; tell them that he paid a hundred thousand <foreign

            What answer did he give? “Oh, indeed, I will willingly and eagerly tell lies
            for your sake; and if at any time you wish me to perjure myself in order to make a
            little profit, know that I am quite ready; you need not have taken so much trouble as to

            issue of the trial? Or would Cluvius have granted it to Roscius at his request, even if
            he had been to be a sharer in the whole booty? I scarcely, by the gods, think that you,
            O Fannius, would dare to make this request to Ballio, or to any one like him; and that
            you would be able to succeed in a matter not only false, but in its nature incredible.
            For I say nothing about Roscius and Cluvius being excellent men. I imagine them for this

            <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51" resp="perseus"><p>Roscius, then, suborned

            sesterce. Secondly; if Cluvius was, by this time, persuaded to tell lies, why did he say
            that a hundred thousand <foreign xml:lang="lat">sesterces</foreign> had been given to Fannius
            by Flavius, rather than three hundred thousand; when, according to the mutual agreement,
            a half-share of it belonged to Roscius. By this time you see, O Caius Piso, that Roscius
            had made his demand for himself alone, and had made no demand for the partnership. When
            Saturius perceives that this is proved, he does not dare to resist and struggle against

            he got for himself became the common property of the partnership” than which
            nothing more tricky or more scandalous can be said. For I ask whether Roscius had the
            power to demand his share from the partnership, or not? If he could not, how did he get
            it? If he could, how was it that he did not demand it for himself? For that which is

            agent. Is it not so? If her had been your agent, you would get your own, because he had
            gained the action. But he preferred this claim in his own name; so what he got he got

            sustained by the loss, you were made the agent of Roscius for that action? especially
            when, according to what you now say, whatever claim you made for yourself you made for
            him; whatever recompense you exacted for yourself, would belong to the partnership. But
            if nothing would have come to Roscius which you had got from Flavius, unless he had
            appointed you agent for his action, so nothing ought to come to you which Roscius has

              <foreign xml:lang="lat">sesterces</foreign> from him? If he did leave it, why do you claim
            from him what you ought to demand and follow up yourself? For partnership is very like
            inheritance, and, as it were, its twin sister. As a partner has a share in a
            partnership, so an heir has a share in an inheritance. As an heir prefers a claim for
            himself alone, and not for his co-heirs, so a partner prefers a claim for himself alone,
            and not for his partners. And as each prefers a claim for his own share, so he makes
            payments for his share alone; the heir, out of the share which he has received of the
            inheritance the partner, out of that property with which he entered into the
