    <head>THE SPEECH OF M. T. CICERO IN DEFENCE OF THE PROPOSED MANILIAN LAW.</head>
    <div type="commentary" resp="ed">
   <head>THE ARGUMENT.</head>
   <p>In the year B.C. <date when="-0067">67</date>, Aulus Gabinius had obtained the passing of a
    decree by which Pompey was invested for three years with the supreme command over all the
    Mediterranean, and over all the coasts of that sea, to a distance of four hundred furlongs from
    the sea. And in this command he had acted with great vigour and with complete success;
    destroying all the pirates' strongholds, and distributing the men themselves as colonists among
    the inland towns of <placeName key="tgn,7002294">Asia Minor</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>. After this achievement he did not return to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, but remained in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, making various regulations for the towns which he had conquered. </p>
   <p>During this period Lucullus had been prosecuting the war against Mithridates, and proceeding
    gradually in the reduction of <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>; he had
    penetrated also into <placeName key="tgn,7001554">Mesopotamia</placeName>, but had subsequently
    been distressed by seditions in his army, excited by Clodius, his brother-in-law; and these
    seditions had given fresh courage to Mithridates who had fallen on Caius Triarius, one of his
    lieutenants, and routed his army with great slaughter. At the time that Pompey commenced his
    campaign against the pirates, the consul Marcus Aquillius Glabrio was sent to supersede
    Lucullus in his command, but he was perfectly incompetent to oppose Mithridates, who seemed
    likely with such an enemy to recover all the power of which Lucullus had deprived him. So in
    the year B.C. <date when="-0066">66</date>, while Glabrio was still in <placeName key="tgn,7016608">Bithynia</placeName>, and Pompey in <placeName key="tgn,7002294">Asia
     Minor</placeName>, Caius Manilius, a tribune of the people, brought forward a proposition,
    that, in addition to the command which Pompey already possessed, he should be invested with
    unlimited power in <placeName key="tgn,7016608">Bithynia</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName>,
    for the purpose of conducting the war against Mithridates. The measure was strongly opposed by
    Catulus and by Hortensius, but it was supported by Caesar, and by Cicero in the following
    speech, which is the first which he ever addressed to the people; and the proposition was
    carried.</p></div>
   
   <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/>
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1" resp="perseus"><p>
   <milestone unit="para"/>Although, O Romans, your numerous assembly has always seemed to me the most agreeable body
    that any one can address, and this place, which is most honourable to plead in, has also seemed
    always the most distinguished place for delivering an oration in, still I have been prevented
    from trying this road to glory, which has at all times been entirely open to every virtuous man,
    not indeed by my own will, but by the system of life which I have adopted from my earliest
    years. For as hitherto I have not dared, on account of my youth, to intrude upon the authority
    of this place, and as I considered that no arguments ought to be brought to this place except
    such as were the fruit of great ability, and worked up with the greatest industry, I have
    thought it fit to devote all my time to the necessities of my friends. </p></div>
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2" resp="perseus"><p> And accordingly, this place has never been unoccupied by men who were
    defending your cause, and my industry, which has been virtuously and honestly employed about the
    dangers of private individuals, has received its most honourable reward in your approbation. For
    when, on account of the adjournment of the comitia, I was three times elected the first praetor
    by all the centuries, I easily perceived, O Romans, what your opinion of me was, and what
    conduct you enjoined to others. Now, when there is that authority in me which you, by conferring
    honours on me, have chosen that there should be, and all that facility in pleading which almost
    daily practice in speaking can give a vigilant man who has habituated himself to the forum, at
    all events, if I have any authority, I will employ it before those who have given it to me; and
    if I can accomplish anything by speaking, I will display it to those men above all others, who
    have thought fit, by their decision, to confer honours on that qualification. </p></div>
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3" resp="perseus"><p> And, above all things, I see that I have reason to rejoice on this account,
    that, since I am speaking in this place, to which I am so entirely unaccustomed, I have a cause
    to advocate in which eloquence can hardly fail any one; for I have to speak of the eminent and
    extraordinary virtue of Cnaeus Pompey; and it is harder for me to find out how to end a
    discourse on such a subject, than how to begin one. So that what I have to seek for is not so
    much a variety of arguments, as moderation in employing them.</p></div>
   <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4" resp="perseus"><p>
   <milestone unit="para"/>And, that my oration may take its origin from the same source from which all this cause is to
    be maintained; an important war, and one perilous to your revenues and to your allies, is being
    waged against you by two most powerful kings, Mithridates and Tigranes. One of these having been
    left to himself, and the other having been attacked, thinks that an opportunity offers itself to
    him to occupy all <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>. Letters are brought from
     <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> every day to Roman knights, most honourable men,
    who have great property at stake, which is all employed in the collection of your revenues; and
    they, in consequence of the intimate connection which I have with their order, have come to me
    and entrusted me with the task of pleading the cause of the republic, and warding off danger
    from their private fortunes. </p></div>
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5" resp="perseus"><p> They say that many of the
    villages of <placeName key="tgn,7016608">Bithynia</placeName>, which is at present a province
    belonging to you, have been burnt; that the kingdom of Ariobarzanes, which borders on those
    districts from which you derive a revenue, is wholly in the power of the enemy; that Lucullus,
    after having performed great exploits, is departing from that war; that it is not enough that
    whoever succeeds him should be prepared for the conduct of so important a war; that one general
    is demanded and required by all men, both allies and citizens, for that war; that he alone is
    feared by the enemy, and that no one else is. </p></div>
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6" resp="perseus"><p>
   <milestone unit="para"/>You see what the case is; now consider what you ought to do. It seems to me that I ought to
    speak in the first place of the sort of war that exists; in the second place, of its importance;
    and lastly, of the selection of a general. The kind of war is such as ought above all others to
    excite and inflame your minds to a determination to persevere in it. It is a war in which the
    glory of the Roman people is at stake; that glory which has been handed down to you from your
    ancestors, great indeed in everything, but most especially in military affairs. The safety of
    our friends and allies is at stake, in behalf of which your ancestors have waged many most
    important wars. The most certain and the largest revenues of the Roman people are at stake; and
    if they be lost, you will be at a loss for the luxuries of peace, and the sinews of war. The
    property of many citizens is at stake, which you ought greatly to regard, both for your own
    sake, and for that of the republic</p></div>
   <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7" resp="perseus"><p>
   <milestone unit="para"/>And since you have at all times been covetous of glory and greedy of praise beyond all other
    nations, you have to wipe out that stain, received in the former Mithridates War, which has now
    fixed itself deeply and eaten its way into the Roman name, the stain arising from the fact that
    he, who in one day marked down by one order, and one single letter, all the Roman citizens in
    all <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, scattered as they were over so many cities,
    for slaughter and butchery, has not only never yet suffered any chastisement worthy of his
    wickedness, but now, twenty-three years after that time, is still a king, and a king in such a
    way that he is not content to hide himself in <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>,
    or in the recesses of <placeName key="tgn,6003016">Cappadocia</placeName>, but he seeks to
    emerge from his hereditary kingdom, and to range among your revenues, in the broad light of
     <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>. </p></div>
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8" resp="perseus"><p> Indeed up to
    this time your generals have been, contending with the king so as to carry off tokens of victory
    rather than actual victory. Lucius Sulla has triumphed, Lucius Murena has triumphed over
    Mithridates, two most gallant men, and most consummate generals; but yet they have triumphed in
    such a way that he, though routed and defeated, was still king. Not but what praise is to be
    given to those generals for what they did. Pardon must be conceded to them for what they left
    undone; because the republic recalled Sulla from that war into <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, and Sulla recalled Murena.</p></div>
   <milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9" resp="perseus"><p>
   <milestone unit="para"/>But Mithridates employed all the time which he had left to him, not in forgetting the old war,
    but in preparing for a new one; and, after he had built and equipped very large fleets, and had
    got together mighty armies from every nation he could, and had pretended to be preparing war
    against the tribes of the Bosphorus, his neighbours, sent ambassadors and letters as far as
     <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> to those chiefs with whom we were at war at the
    time, in order that, as you would by that means have war waged against you in the two parts of
    the world the furthest separated and most remote of all from one another, by two separate
    enemies warring against you with one uniform plan, you, hampered by the double enmity, might
    find that you were fighting for the empire itself.</p></div> 
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10" resp="perseus"><p>
    However; the danger on one side, the danger from Sertorius and from <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, which had much the most solid foundation and the most formidable strength,
    was warded off by the divine wisdom and extraordinary valour of Cnaeus Pompeius. And on the
    other side of the empire, affairs were so managed by Lucilius Lucullus, that most illustrious of
    men, that the beginning, of all those achievements in those countries, great and eminent as they
    were, deserve to be attributed not to his good fortune but to his valour; but the latter events
    which have taken place lately, ought to be imputed not to his fault, but to his ill-fortune.
    However, of Lucullus I will speak hereafter, and I will speak, O Romans, in such a manner, that
    his true glory shall not appear to be at all disparaged by my pleading, nor, on the other hand,
    shall any undeserved credit seem to be given to him. </p></div>
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11" resp="perseus"><p> At
    present, when we are speaking of the dignity and glory of your empire, since that is the
    beginning of my oration, consider what feelings you think you ought to entertain. <milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/>
   <milestone unit="para"/>Your ancestors have often waged war on account of their merchants and seafaring men having
    been injuriously treated. What ought to be your feelings when so many thousand Roman citizens
    have been put to death by one order and at one time? Because their ambassadors had been spoken
    to with insolence, your ancestors determined that <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, the light of all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, should
    be destroyed. Will you allow that king to remain unpunished, who has murdered a lieutenant of
    the Roman people of consular rank, having tortured him with chains and scourging, and every sort
    of punishment? They would not allow the freedom of Roman citizens to be diminished; will you be
    indifferent to their lives being taken? They avenged the privileges of our embassy when they
    were violated by a word; will you abandon an ambassador who has been put to death with every
    sort of cruelty? </p></div>
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12" resp="perseus"><p> Take care lest, as it was a most glorious
    thing for them, to leave you such wide renown and such a powerful empire, it should be a most
    discreditable thing for you, not to be able to defend and preserve that which you have received.
    What more shall I say? Shall I say, that the safety of our allies is involved in the greatest
    hazard and danger? King Ariobarzanes has been driven from his kingdom, an ally and friend of the
    Roman people; two kings are threatening all <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, who
    are not only most hostile to you, but also to your friends and allies. And every city throughout
    all Asia, and throughout all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, is compelled by
    the magnitude of the danger to put its whole trust in the expectation of your assistance. They
    do not dare to beg of you any particular general, especially since you have sent them another,
    nor do they think that they can do this without extreme danger. </p></div>
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13" resp="perseus"><p> They see and feel this, the same thing which you too see and feel,—that there is one man in
    whom all qualities are in the highest perfection, and that he is near, (which circumstance makes
    it seem harder to be deprived of him,) by whose mere arrival and name, although it was a
    maritime war for which he came, they are nevertheless aware that the attacks of the enemy were
    retarded and repressed. They then, since they cannot speak freely, silently entreat you to think
    them (as you have thought your allies in the other provinces) worthy of having their safety
    recommended to such a man; and to think them worthy even more than others, because we often send
    men with absolute authority into such a province as theirs, of such character, that, even if
    they protect them from the enemy, still their arrival among the cities of the allies is not very
    different from an invasion of the enemy. They used to hear of him before, now they see him among
    them; a man of such moderation, such mildness, such humanity, that those seem to be the happiest
    people among whom he remains for the longest time.</p></div>
   <milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14" resp="perseus"><p>
   <milestone unit="para"/>Wherefore, if on account of their allies, though they themselves had not been roused by any
    injuries, your ancestors waged war against Antiochus, against Philip, against the Aetolians, and
    against the Carthaginians; with how much earnestness ought you, when you yourselves have been
    provoked by injurious treatment, to defend the safety of the allies, and at the same time, the
    dignity of your empire? especially when your greatest revenues are at stake. For the revenues of
    the other provinces, O Romans, are such that we can scarcely derive enough from them for the
    protection of the provinces themselves. But <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> is so
    rich and so productive, that in the fertility of its soil, and in the variety of its fruits, and
    in the vastness of its pasture lands, and in the multitude of all those things which are matters
    of exportation, it is greatly superior to all other countries. Therefore, O Romans, this
    province, if you have any regard for what tends to your advantage in time of war, and to your
    dignity in time of peace, must be defended by you, not only from all calamity, but from all fear
    of calamity. </p></div>
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15" resp="perseus"><p> For in other matters when calamity comes on one,
    then damage is sustained; but in the case of revenues, not only the arrival of evil, but the
    bare dread of it, brings disaster. For when the troops of the enemy are not far off, even though
    no actual irruption takes place, still the flocks are abandoned, agriculture is relinquished,
    the sailing of merchants is at an end. And accordingly, neither from harbour dues, nor from
    tenths, nor from the tax on pasture lands, can any revenue be maintained. And therefore it often
    happens that the produce of an entire year is lost by one rumour of danger, and by one alarm of
    war. </p></div>
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16" resp="perseus"><p> What do you think ought to be the feelings of those who
    pay us tribute, or of those who get it in, and exact it, when two kings with very numerous
    armies are all but on the spot? when one inroad of cavalry may in a very short time carry off
    the revenue of a whole year? when the publicans think that they retain the large households of
    slaves which they have in the salt-works, in the fields, in the harbours, and custom-houses, at
    the greatest risk? Do you think that you can enjoy these advantages unless you preserve those
    men who are productive to you, free not only, as I said before, from calamity, but even from the
    dread of calamity?</p></div>
   <milestone n="7" unit="chapter"/><div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17" resp="perseus"><p>
   <milestone unit="para"/>And even this must not be neglected by you, which I had proposed to myself as the last thing
    to be mentioned, when I was to speak of the kind of war, for it concerns the property of many
    Roman citizens; whom you, as becomes your wisdom, O Romans, must regard with the most careful
    solicitude. The publicans, <note anchored="true">It has been said before that the publicans were

    your humanity to protect a large number of those citizens from misfortune; it will become your
    wisdom to perceive that the misfortune of many citizens cannot be separated from the misfortune
    of the republic. In truth, firstly, it is of but little consequence for you afterwards to

    For this may be said of it,—that it is a kind of war so necessary, that it must absolutely be
    waged, and yet not one of such magnitude as to be formidable. And in this we must take the
    greatest care that those things do not appear to you contemptible which require to be most
    diligently guarded against. And that all men may understand that I give Lucius Lucullus all the
    praise that is due to a gallant man, and most wise <note anchored="true">The Latin is, “<foreign xml:lang="lat">forti <emph>viro</emph>, et sapientissimo <emph>homini</emph></foreign>,” and
     this opposition of <foreign xml:lang="lat">vir</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="lat">homo</foreign> is not uncommon in Cicero's orations. “<foreign xml:lang="lat">Homo</foreign>

    first arrived in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, the forces of Mithridates were

     <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, and the one, too, that was most friendly to us,
    the city of <placeName key="perseus,Cyzicus">Cyzicus</placeName>, was besieged by the king in
    person, with an enormous army, and that the siege had been pressed most vigorously, when Lucius
    Lucullus, by his valour, and perseverance, and wisdom, relieved it from the most extreme danger.
     </p></div>
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21" resp="perseus"><p> I say that he also, when general, defeated and destroyed
    that great and well-appointed fleet, which the chiefs of Sertorius's party were leading against
     <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> with furious zeal; I say besides, that by him
    numerous armies of the enemy were destroyed in several battles, and that <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName> was opened to our legions, which before his time had been

    his grandfather, and forced to betake himself as a suppliant to other kings and other nations;
    and that all these great deeds were achieved without any injury to the allies of the Roman
    people, or any diminution of its revenues. I think that this is praise enough;—such praise that
    you must see, O Romans, that Lucius Lucullus has not been praised as much from this rostrum by

   <milestone unit="para"/>Perhaps now it will be asked, how, when all this has been already done, there can be any great
    war left behind. I will explain this, O Romans; for this does not seem an unreasonable question.
    At first Mithridates fled from his kingdom, as Medea is formerly said to have fled from the same
    region of <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>; for they say that she, in her flight,
    strewed about the limbs of her brother in those places along which her father was likely to
    pursue her, in order that the collection of them, dispersed as they were, and the grief which
    would afflict his father, might delay the rapidity of his pursuit. Mithridates, flying in the
    same manner, left in <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName> the whole of the vast
    quantity of gold and silver, and of beautiful things which he had inherited from his ancestors,
    and which he himself had collected and brought into his own kingdom, having obtained them by
    plunder in the former war from all <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>. While our men
    were diligently occupied in collecting all this, the king himself escaped out of their hands.And so grief retarded the father of Medea in his pursuit,
    but delight delayed our men.
     </p></div>
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23" resp="perseus"><p> In this alarm and flight of his, Tigranes, the king of <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName>, received him, encouraged him while despairing of his
    fortunes, gave him new spirit in his depression, and recruited with new strength his powerless
    condition. And after Lucius Lucullus arrived in his kingdom, very many tribes were excited to
    hostilities against our general. For those nations which the Roman people never had thought
    either of attacking in war or tampering with, had been inspired with fear. There was, besides, a
    general opinion which had taken deep root, and had spread over all the barbarian tribes in those
    districts, that our army had been led into those countries with the object of plundering a very
    wealthy and most religiously worshipped temple. And so, many powerful nations were roused
    against us by a fresh dread and alarm. But our army although it had taken a city of Tigranes's
    kingdom, and had fought some successful battles, still was out of spirits at its immense
    distance from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and its separation from its
    friends. </p></div>
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24" resp="perseus"><p> At present I will not say more; for the result of
    these feelings of theirs was, that they were more anxious for a speedy return home than for any
    further advance into the enemies' country. But Mithridates had by this time strengthened his
    army by reinforcements of those men belonging to his own dominions who had assembled together,
    and by large promiscuous forces belonging to many other kings and tribes. And we see that this
    is almost invariably the case, that kings when in misfortune easily induce many to pity and
    assist them, especially such as are either kings themselves, or who live under kingly power,
    because to them the name of king appears something great and sacred. </p></div>
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25" resp="perseus"><p> And accordingly he, when conquered, was able to accomplish what, when he was
    in the full enjoyment of his powers, he never dared even to wish for. For when he had returned
    to his kingdom, he was not content (though that had happened to him beyond all his hopes) with
    again setting his foot on that land after he had been expelled from it; but he even volunteered
    an attack on your army, flushed as it was with glory and victory. Allow me, in this place, O
    Romans, (just as poets do who write of Roman affairs,) to pass over our disaster, which was so
    great that it came to Lucius Lucullus's ears, not by means of a messenger despatched from the
    scene of action, but through the report of common conversation. </p></div>

    limits ought to be put to length of command, discharged a part of his soldiers who had served
    their appointed time, and delivered over part to Glabrio. I pass over many things designedly;
    but you yourselves can easily conjecture how important you ought to consider that war which most
    powerful kings are uniting in,—which disturbed nations are renewing,—which nations, whose
    strength is unimpaired, are undertaking, and which anew general of yours has to encounter after

   <milestone unit="para"/>I wish, O Romans, that you had such an abundance of brave and honest men, that it was a
    difficult subject for your deliberations, whom you thought most desirable to be appointed to the
    conduct of such important affairs, and so vast a war. But now, when there is Cnaeus Pompeius
    alone, who has exceeded in valour, not only the glory of these men who are now alive, but even
    all recollections of antiquity, what is there that, in this case, can raise a doubt in the mind
    of any one? </p></div>
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28" resp="perseus"><p> For I think that these four qualities are
    indispensable in a great general,—knowledge of military affairs, valour, authority and good
    fortune. Who, then, ever was, or ought to have been, better acquainted with military affairs
    than this man? who, the moment that he left school and finished his education as a boy, at a
    time when there was a most important war going on, and most active enemies were banded against
    us, went to his father's army and to the discipline of the camp; who, when scarcely out of his
    boyhood, became a soldier of a consummate general,—when entering on manhood, became himself the
    general of a mighty army; who has been more frequently engaged with the enemy, than any one else
    has ever disputed with an adversary; who has himself, as general, conducted more wars than other
    men have read of; who has subdued more provinces than other men have wished for; whose youth was
    trained to the knowledge of military affairs, not by the precepts of others, but by commanding
    himself,—not by the disasters of war, but by victories,—not by campaigns, but by triumphs. In
    short, what description of war can there be in which the fortune of the republic has not given
    him practice? Civil war, African war, Transalpine war, Spanish war, promiscuous war of the most
    warlike cities and nations, servile war, naval war, every variety and diversity of wars and of
    enemies, has not only been encountered by this one man, but encountered victoriously; and these
    exploits show plainly that there is no circumstance, in military practice which can elude the

    business, fortitude amid dangers, energy in acting, rapidity in executing, wisdom in foreseeing;

    to perform such long journeys, with as great celerity as Cnaeus Pompeius has performed his

    ambassadors to implore his mercy even into <placeName key="tgn,7002611">Pamphylia</placeName> to
    him, he did not deny them hopes of being allowed to surrender, and he exacted hostages from
    them. And thus Cnaeus Pompeius at the end of winter prepared, at the beginning of spring
    undertook, and by the middle of summer terminated, this most important war, which had lasted so
    long, which was scattered in such distant and such various places, and by which every nation and

    how great are his other exploits which I began to mention a short time back; for we are not only
    to seek for skill in war in a consummate and perfect general, but there are many other eminent
    qualities which are the satellites and companions of this virtue. And first of all, how great
    should be the incorruptibility of generals! How great should be their moderation in everything!
    How perfect their good faith! How universal should be their affability! how brilliant their

    exist in Cnaeus Pompeius. For they are all of the highest importance, O Romans, but yet they are
    to be seen and ascertained more by comparison with the conduct of others than by any display
    which they make of themselves. </p></div>

    and have been constantly sold in his army? What great or honourable thoughts can we suppose that

    you will more easily imagine what is the course pursued among foreign nations. Do you think that
    of late years more cities of the enemy have been destroyed by the arms of your soldiers, or more
    cities of your own allies by their winter campaigns? For that general who does not restrain
    himself can never restrain his army; nor can he be strict in judging others who is unwilling for
    others to be strict in judging him. </p></div>
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39" resp="perseus"><p> Do we wonder now that

    voyage? For it was no unexampled number of rowers, no hitherto unknown skill in navigation, no
    new winds, which bore him so swiftly to the most distant lands; but those circumstances which
    are wont to delay other men did not delay him. No avarice turned him aside from his intended
    route in pursuit of some plunder or other; no lust led him away in pursuit of pleasure; no
    luxury allured him to seek its delights; the illustrious reputation of no city tempted him to
    make its acquaintance; even labour did not turn him aside to seek rest. Lastly, as for the
    statues, and pictures, and other embellishments of Greek cities, which other men think worth

    reason that, when we had magistrates of the same moderation, their ancestors preferred being
    subject to the Roman people to being themselves lords of other nations. But now the access of
    all private individuals to him is so easy, their complaints of the injuries received from others
    are so little checked, that he who in dignity is superior to the noblest men, in affability

    which authority has in war, all our instances of splendid exploits in war must be taken from
    this same Cnaeus Pompeius. The very day that he was appointed by you commander-in-chief of the

    ours in their island came almost to the end of the world to Cnaeus Pompeius, and said, all the

    another, just as a man may extol the power of the gods. For my judgment is this, that very often
    commands have been conferred upon, and armies have been entrusted to Maximus, to Marcellus, to
    Scipio, to Marius, and to other great generals, not only on account of their valour, but also on
    account of their good fortune. For there has been, in truth, in the case of some most
    illustrious men, good fortune added as some contribution of the gods to their honour and glory,
    and as a means of performing mighty achievements. But concerning the good fortune of this man of
    whom we are now speaking, I will use so much moderation as not to say that good fortune was
    actually placed in his power, but I will so speak as to appear to remember what is past, to have
    good hope of what is to come; so that my speech may, on the one hand, not appear to the immortal

    them,—the enemy obeyed them, but how even the winds and weather have seconded them. I will only
    say this, most briefly,—that no one has ever been so impudent as to dare in silence to wish for
    so many and such great favours as the immortal gods have showered upon Cnaeus Pompeius. And that
    this favour may continue his, and be perpetual, you, O Romans, ought to wish and pray (as,

    knowledge of war, the most extraordinary valour, the most splendid personal influence, and the
    most eminent good fortune, can you hesitate, O Romans, to apply this wonderful advantage which

    exceeding advantages of the appointment, this opportunity is also added,—that he is in those
    very countries already,—that he has an army with him,—that there is another army there which can
    at once be made over to him by those who are in command of it,—why do we delay? or why do we

    genius, disagree to this proposal. And I admit that their authority has in many instances had
    the greatest weight with you, and that it ought to have the greatest weight; but in this cause,

    whether we do not seem by the authority of these men to give a sufficient answer to the speeches
    of those men who differ from us. </p></div>

   <milestone unit="para"/>And as this is the case, O Caius Manilius, in the first place, I exceedingly praise and
    approve of that law of yours, and of your purpose, and of your sentiments. And in the second
    place, I exhort you, having the approbation of the Roman people, to persevere in those
    sentiments, and not to fear the violence or threats of any one. And, first of all, I think you
    have the requisite courage and perseverance; and, secondly, when we see such a multitude present
    displaying such zeal in our cause as we now see displayed for the second time, in appointing the
    same man to the supreme command how can we doubt in the matter, or question our power of
    carrying our point? As for me, all the zeal, and wisdom, and industry, and ability of which I am
    possessed, all the influence which I have through the kindness shown for me by the Roman people,
    and through my power as praetor, as also, through my reputation for authority, good faith, and
    virtue, all of it I pledge to you and the Roman people, and devote to the object of carrying
    this resolution. </p></div>
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="70" resp="perseus"><p> And I call all the gods, to witness, and
    especially those who preside over this place and temple, who see into the minds of all those who
    apply themselves to affairs of state, that I am not doing this at the request of any one, nor
    because I think to conciliate the favour of Cnaeus Pompeius by taking this side, nor in order,
    through the greatness of any one else, to seek for myself protection against dangers, or aids in
    the acquirement of honours; because, as for dangers, we shall easily repel them, as a man ought
    to do, protected by our own innocence; and as for honours, we shall not gain them by the favour
    of any men, nor by anything that happens in this place, but by the same laborious course of life
    which I have hitherto adopted, if your favourable inclination assists me. </p></div>
   <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="71" resp="perseus"><p> Wherefore, whatever I have undertaken in this cause, O Romans, I assure you
    that I have undertaken wholly for the sake of the republic; and I am so far from thinking that I
    have gained by it the favour of any influential man, that I know, on the other hand, that I have
    brought on myself many enmities, some secret, some undisguised, which I never need have
    incurred, and which get will not be mischievous to you. But I have considered that I, invested
    with my present honours, and loaded with so many kindnesses from you, ought to prefer your
    inclination, and the dignity of the republic, and the safety of our provinces and allies, to all
    considerations of my own private interest.
