<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="intro"><head>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICE OF SALLUST.</head>
<p>SALLUST was born at <placeName key="perseus,Amiternum">Amiternum</placeName>, a town in the <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> territory, on the first of October,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Euseb. Chron.</note> in the year six hundred and sixty-six<note anchored="true" place="foot"><placeName key="tgn,1002284">Clinton</placeName>, Fast. Rom.</note> from the foundation of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, eighty-seven years before Christ, and in the seventh consulship of Marius.</p>
<p>The name of his father was Caius Sallustius;<note anchored="true" place="foot">De Brosses, Vie de Sall., § 2; Glandorp. Onomast.</note> that of his mother is unknown. His family was thought by Crinitus, and some others, to have been patrician, but by <placeName key="tgn,2083270">Gerlach</placeName>, and most of the later critics, is pronounced to have been plebeian, because he held the office of tribune of the people, because he makes observations unfavorable to the nobility in his writings, and because his grandson, according to Tacitus,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Ann., iii. 30.</note> was only of equestrian rank.</p>
<p>The ingenuity of criticism has been exercised in determining whether his name should be written with a double or single l. Jerome Wolfius,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Apud Voss.</note> and <placeName key="tgn,2083270">Gerlach</placeName>, are in favor of the single letter, depending chiefly on inscriptions, and on the presumption that the name is derived from <foreign xml:lang="lat">salus</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="lat">sal</foreign>. But inscriptions vary; the etymology of the word is uncertain, and to derive it from <foreign xml:lang="lat">sal</foreign> would authorize either mode of spelling. All the Latin authors, both in prose and poetry, have the name with the double letter, and it seems better, as Vossius<note anchored="true" place="foot">Vit. Sall.</note> remarks, to adhere to their practice. Among the Greeks, Dion and Eusebius have the single letter; in some other writers it is found doubled.</p>
<p>Another question raised respecting his name, is whether he <pb n="x"/>should be called <foreign xml:lang="lat">Sallustius Crispus</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="lat">Crispus Sallustius.</foreign> The latter mode is adopted by Le Clerc, Cortius, Havercamp, and some other critics; but De Brosses<note anchored="true" place="foot">Vie de Sall., § 1.</note> argues conclusively in favor of the former method; as Sallustius, from its termination, is evidently the name of the family or <foreign xml:lang="lat">gens;</foreign> and Crispus, which denotes <foreign xml:lang="lat">quelque habitude du corps,</foreign> only a surname to distinguish one of its branches. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Crispus Sallustius</foreign> is found, indeed, in manuscripts; and, according to Cortius, in the best; but on what reasonable grounds can it be justified? It was perhaps adopted by some copyist front the ode of <placeName key="tgn,2028398">Horace</placeName><note anchored="true" place="foot">Od., ii. 2, 3.</note> addressed to Sallist's nephew, and inconsiderately continued by his successors.</p>
<p>He was removed early in life to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, that he might be educated under Atteius Prætextatus, a celebrated grammarian of that age, who styled himself Philologus, and who was afterward tutor to Asinius Pollio.<note anchored="true" place="foot">Suet. de Ill. Gramm., c. 10.</note> Atteius treated Sallust with very great distinction.<note anchored="true" place="foot">Ibid.</note></p>
<p>He may be supposed to have soon grown conscious of his powers;<note anchored="true" place="foot">Pseudo-Sall. Ep. to Cæs., i. 10.</note> and appears at an early period of his life to have devoted himself to study, with an intention to distinguish himself in history.<note anchored="true" place="foot">Cat., c. 3.</note></p>
<p>His devotion to literature, however, was not so great as to detain him from indulgence in pleasure; for he became, if we allow any credit to the old declaimer, infamous, <foreign xml:lang="lat">ætatis tirocinio,</foreign> for debauchery and extravagance. He took possession of his father's house in his father's lifetime, and sold it; an act by which he brought his father to the grave; and he was twice, for some misconduct, arraigned before the magistrates, and escaped on both occasions only through the perjury of his judges.<note anchored="true" place="foot">Pseudo-Cic. in Sall., c. 5.</note></p>
<p>When we cite this rhetorician, we must not forget that we cite an anonymous reviler, yet we must suppose with <placeName key="tgn,2083270">Gerlach</placeName>, and with Meisner, the German translator of Sallust, that we quote a writer who grounded his invectives on reports and opinions current at the time in which he lived.</p>
<p>Sallust next thought of aspiring to political distinction;<note anchored="true" place="foot">Cat., c. 3.</note> but <pb n="xi"/>"the usual method of attaining notice," says De Brosses,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Vie de Sal., c. 3.</note> "which was to secure friends and clients by pleading the causes of individuals at the bar, he seems not to have adopted;" since, as is known, no orations spoken' by him are in existence, and, as is thought, no mention is made of such orations in any other author.</p>
<p>Mention, however, is made of orations of Sallust, at whatever time delivered, in the well-known passage of <placeName key="tgn,1002883">Seneca</placeName> the rhetorician.<note anchored="true" place="foot">Præf. in Controv., 1. iii., p. 231, ed. Par. <date when="1607">1607</date>.</note> When <placeName key="tgn,1002883">Seneca</placeName> inquired of Cassius Severus, why he, who was so eminent in pleading important causes, displayed so little talent in pronouncing fictitious declamations, the orator replied, <quote xml:lang="lat">Quod in me miraris, pene omnibus evenit, etc. Orationes Sallustii in honorem historiarum leguntur.</quote> "What you think extraordinary in me, is common to all men of ability. The greatest geniuses, to whom I am conscious of my great inferiority, have generally excelled only in one species of composition. The felicity of <placeName key="tgn,1015191">Virgil</placeName> in poetry deserted him in prose; the eloquence of <placeName key="tgn,2031372">Cicero</placeName>'s orations is not to be found in his verses; and the speeches of Sallust are read only as a foil to his histories." The speeches which are here meant, are not, as has been generally imagined, those inserted in the histories, but others, which Sallust had spoken. This view of the passage was first taken by Antonius Augustinus, and communicated by him to Schottus, who mentioned it in his annotations on <placeName key="tgn,1002883">Seneca</placeName>.<note anchored="true" place="foot">P. 234, ed. Par. <date when="1607">1607</date>.</note></p>
<p>But by whatever means he secured support, he had at length sufficient interest to obtain a quæstorship;<note anchored="true" place="foot">Pseudo-Cic., in Sall., c. 5.</note> the tenure of which gave him admission into the senate. It would appear that he was about thirty-one years of age when he attained this honor.<note anchored="true" place="foot">Adam's Rom. antiquities, p. 4.</note></p>
<p>It must have been about this period that his adventure with Fausta, the daughter of Sylla and wife of <placeName key="tgn,1013243">Milo</placeName>, occurred, of which a short account is given by Aulus Gellius<note anchored="true" place="foot">xvii. 18.</note> in an extract from Varro. The English reader may take it in the version of Beloe : "Marcus Varro, a man of great authority and weight in his writings and life, in his publication entitled 'Pius,' or 'De Pace,' <pb n="xii"/>records that Caius Sallust, the author of that grave and serious composition (<foreign xml:lang="lat">seriæ illius et severæ orationis</foreign>), in which he has exercised the severity of the censorial office, in taking cognizance of crimes, being taken by Annæus <placeName key="tgn,1013243">Milo</placeName> in adultery, was well scourged, and, after paying a sum of money, dismissed." The same story is told, on the authority of Asconius Pedianus the biographer of Sallust, by Acro and Porphyrio, the scholiasts on Horace, who, they think, had it in his mind when he wrote the words, <quote xml:lang="lat">Ille flagellis ad mortem cæsus.</quote><note anchored="true" place="foot">Sat., i. 2, 41.</note> Servius, also, in his note on <foreign xml:lang="lat">Quique ob adulterium cæsi,</foreign> in the sixth book of the Æneid,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Ver. 612.</note> tells a like tale, adding that Sallust entered the house in the habit of a slave, and was caught in that disguise by <placeName key="tgn,1013243">Milo</placeName>.</p>
<p>Such being the case, it is not wonderful that when Sallust entered on his tribuneship of the people, to which lie was elected in the year of the city seven hundred, he seized an opportunity which occurred of being revenged on <placeName key="tgn,1013243">Milo</placeName>, who had shortly before killed Clodius. He joined with his colleagues, Pompeins Rufus and Plancus, in inflaming the populace, and charging Milo with premeditated hostility.<note anchored="true" place="foot">Ascon. Pedian. in Cic. Orat. pro Milo., c. 17; Cic. Mil., c. 5.</note> They intimidated <placeName key="tgn,2115507">Cicero</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,1013243">Milo</placeName>'s advocate, insinuating that he had planned the assassination;<note anchored="true" place="foot">Ascon. Pedian. in Cic. Mil., c. 18.</note> and the matter ended in <placeName key="tgn,1013243">Milo</placeName>'s banishment.<note anchored="true" place="foot">Dion. Cap., lib. xl.</note> During the progress of the trial, however, it is said that Sallust abated his hostility to <placeName key="tgn,1013243">Milo</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2115507">Cicero</placeName>, and even became friendly with them.<note anchored="true" place="foot">Ascon. Ped. <foreign xml:lang="lat">ubi supra.</foreign></note> How this reconciliation was effected, does not appear; but it seems certain that <placeName key="tgn,2115507">Cicero</placeName>, when he attacked Plancus, Sallust's colleague, for exciting the populace to turbulence, left Sallust himself unmolested.<note anchored="true" place="foot">Ascon. Ped. in Cic. Mil., c. 85.</note></p>
<p>Unmolested, however, lie did not long remain; for in the year of the city seven hundred and four, in the censorship of Appius Claudius Pulcher, and Lucius Calpurnius Piso, Appius, actuated by two motives, one of which was to serve Pompey, by excluding from the senate such as were hostile to him,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Dion. Cap., xl. 63.</note> and the other to throw into the shade his own private irregularities by <pb n="xiii"/>an ostentatious discharge of his public duties,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Cic. Ep. ad Fam., viii. 14.</note> expelled Sallust from the senate on pretence that he was a flagrantly immoral character.<note anchored="true" place="foot">Dion., ib.</note></p>
<p>But Appius, by this proceeding, instead of serving Pompey, served Cæsar; for many who had previously been favorable to Pompey, or had continued neutral, betook themselves immediately to Cæsar's camp; in the number of whom was Sallust.<note anchored="true" place="foot">Pseudo-Cic. in Sail., c. 6. <placeName key="tgn,2062904">Gerlach</placeName>, Vit. Sall., p. 7.</note></p>
<p>His attendance on Cæsar did not go unrewarded; for when Cæsar returned from <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, after his victory over Afranius and Petreius, he restored Sallust, with others under similar circumstances,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Suet. J. Cæs., c. 41.</note> to his seat in the senate; and as it was not usual for a senator, who had been degraded from his rank, to be reinstated in it without being at the same time elected to an office, he was again made quæstor,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Pseudo-Cic., c. 6, 8.</note> or, as <placeName key="perseus,Dion">Dion</placeName> thinks, prætor.</p>
<p>He was then intrusted with some military command, and sent into <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyria</placeName>, where, as Orosius<note anchored="true" place="foot">Lib., vi. 15. Gerlach, Vit. Sall., p. 7.</note> states, he was one of those that were defeated by the Pomnpeian leaders Octavius and Libo.</p>
<p>Afterward, when the war in <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> was finished, but while the remains of Pompey's army, headed by Scipio and Cato, were still menacing hostilities in <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, Sallust, with the title of prætor, was directed to conduct against them a body of troops from <placeName key="tgn,7003005">Campania</placeName>.<note anchored="true" place="foot"><placeName key="perseus,Dion">Dion</placeName>. <placeName key="tgn,2224859">Cass</placeName>., xlii. 52.</note> But Sallust was intrusted with more than he was able to perform. The soldiers mutinied on the coast, compelled him to flee, and hurried away to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, putting to death two senators in their way., It was on this occasion that Cæsar humbled them by addressing them as <foreign xml:lang="lat">Quirites</foreign> instead of <foreign xml:lang="lat">commilitones.</foreign><note anchored="true" place="foot"><placeName key="perseus,Dion">Dion</placeName>., ib. Appian. B. C., ii. 92. Plut. in Cæs. Suet. J. Cæs., c. 10.</note></p>
<p>Sallust was then reinstated in command, and was sent, during the African war, to the island of <placeName key="tgn,7006523">Cercina</placeName>, to bring off a quantity of corn that had been deposited there by the enemy; a commission which he successfully executed.<note anchored="true" place="foot">Hirt. B. A., c. 8, 24.</note></p>
<p>Whether he performed any other service for Cæsar in this <pb n="xiv"/>war, we have no account; but Cæsar, when it was ended, thought him a person of such consequence, that he gave him the government of <placeName key="tgn,7016752">Numidia</placeName>, with the title of pro-consul. "He received the province from Cæsar," says <placeName key="perseus,Dion">Dion</placeName>, "nominally to govern it, but in reality to ravage and plunder it." Whether such was Cæsar's intention or not, it is generally believed that he enriched himself by the spoil of it to the greatest possible extent.<note anchored="true" place="foot"><placeName key="perseus,Dion">Dion</placeName>., xliii. 9. Pseudo-Cic., c. 7.</note></p>
<p>When his term of office, which seems to have been only a year, was expired, he "appeared at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>," says the declaimer, "like a man enriched in a dream." But the Numidians followed him, and accused him of extortion; a charge front which he was only acquitted through the interposition of Cæsar,<note anchored="true" place="foot"><placeName key="perseus,Dion">Dion</placeName>., xliii. 9.</note> to whom he is said to have presented a bribe.<note anchored="true" place="foot">Pseudo-Cic., c. 7.</note></p>
<p>The trial had not been long concluded when Cæsar was assassinated, and Sallust, being thus deprived of his patron, seems to have withdrawn entirely from public life. He purchased a large tract of ground on the Quirinal hill, where he erected a splendid mansion, and laid out those magnificent gardens of which so much has been related. Their extent must have been vast, if De Brosses, who visited the spot in <date when="1739">1739</date>, obtained any just notion of it.<note anchored="true" place="foot">De Brosses, Œuv. de Sall., vol. iii., p. 363.</note> But some have thought them much smaller. He had also a country-house at <placeName key="perseus,Tibur">Tibur</placeName>, which had belonged to Julius Cæsar.<note anchored="true" place="foot">Pseudo-Cic., c. 7.</note></p>
<p>It was during this period of retirement, as is supposed, that he married Terentia, the divorced wife of Cicero, if, indeed, he married her at all; for their union rests on no very strong testimony.<note anchored="true" place="foot">Hieronym. adv. Jovin., i. 48. Gerlach, vol. ii., p. 8. De Brosses, tom. iii. p. 355. Le Clerc, Vit. Sall.</note></p>
<p>It was at this time, too, it would appear, that he commenced the composition of history, with a view to the perpetuation of his name; for he entered on it, lie says, when his mind was free from "hope, fear, or political partisanship;"<note anchored="true" place="foot">Cat., c. 4.</note> and to no other time of his life are such expressions applicable. <placeName key="perseus,Dion">Dion</placeName> seems to have supposed <pb n="xv"/>that he appeared as a historian before he went to <placeName key="tgn,7016752">Numidia</placeName>, but is in all probability mistaken.</p>
<p>Sallust died on the thirteenth of May, in the year of the city seven hundred and eighteen, in the fifty-second year of his age,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Euseb. Chron. <placeName key="tgn,2244545">Clinton</placeName>, Fasti.</note> leaving his grand-nephew, Gains Sallustius Crispus, whom want of children had induced him to adopt, heir to all his possessions. His gardens, some years after his death, became imperial property.<note anchored="true" place="foot">See De Brosses, tom. iii. p. 368.</note></p>
<p>Such were the events, as far as we learn, of the life of Sallust; and such is the notion which the voice of antiquity teaches us to form of his moral character. In modern times, some attempts have been made to prove that he was less vicious than he was anciently represented.</p>
<p>Among those who have attempted to clear him of the charges usually brought against hin, are Miller,<note anchored="true" place="foot">C. Sallustius Crispus, <placeName key="tgn,7012329">Leipzig</placeName>, <date when="1817">1817</date>.</note> Wieland,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Ad. Hor. Sat., i. 2, 48.</note> and Roos;<note anchored="true" place="foot">Einige Bemerk, ub. den Moral Char. des Sallust. <foreign xml:lang="de">Prog. Giessen.,</foreign> <date when="1788">1788</date>, 4to. See Frotscher's note on Le Clerc's Life of Sall., init.</note> who are strenuously opposed by Gerlach<note anchored="true" place="foot">Vit. Sall., p. 9, seq.</note> and Loebell.<note anchored="true" place="foot">Zur Beurtheilung des Sall., <placeName key="tgn,7007601">Breslau</placeName>, <date when="1818">1818</date>.</note> The points on which his champions chiefly endeavor to defend him, are the adventure with Fausta, and the spoliation of <placeName key="tgn,7016752">Numidia</placeName>. Of the three, Miller is the most enterprising. With regard to the affair of Fausta, he sets himself boldly to impugn the authority of Varro or Gellius, on which it chiefly rests; and his reasoning is as follows: That such writers as Gellius are not always to be trusted; that Gellius often quoted from memory; that he cites old authors on the testimony of later authors; that he speaks of Varro, <quote xml:lang="lat">fide homo multâ et gravis,</quote> as if he were a cotemporary that needed commendation, not the well-known Varro whose character was established; that the Varro of Gellius may therefore be a later Varro, whose book, "Pius," or "De Pace," may have been about Antoninus Pius, under whom Gellius lived, and who may have been utterly mistaken in what he said of Sallust; and that, consequently, the passage in Gellius is to be suspected. Respecting the plunder of <placeName key="tgn,7016752">Numidia</placeName>, his arguments are, that the <pb n="xvi"/>province was given to Sallust to spoil, not for himself, but for Cæsar; that of the money obtained from it, the chief part was given to Cæsar; and that, consequently, Cæsar, not Sallust, is to bear the blame for what was done.</p>
<p>But such conjectures produce no more impression on the mind of a reader than <placeName key="tgn,7000667">Walpole</placeName>'s " Historic Doubts" concerning Richard the Third. They suggest something that may have been, but bring no proof of what actually was; they may be allowed to be ingenious, but the general voice of history is still believed. To all Müller's suggestions Gerlach exclaims, <quote xml:lang="lat">Credat Judæus!</quote> Were there, in the pages of antiquity, a single record or remark favorable to the moral character of Sallust, there would then be a <foreign xml:lang="fre">point d'appui</foreign> from which to commence an attack on what is said against him; but the case, alas! is exactly the reverse; wherever Sallust is characterized as a man, he is characterized unfavorably.</p>
<p>His writings consisted of his narratives of the Conspiracy of Catiline and the War with Jugurtha, and of a History of <placeName key="tgn,7000874">Rome</placeName> in five books, extending from the death of Sylla to the beginning of the Mithridatic war. The Catiline and Jugurtha have reached us entire; but of the History there now remain only four speeches, two letters, and a number of smaller fragments preserved among the grammarians. That he was not the author of the Epistles to Cæsar, the reader will find satisfactorily shown in the remarks prefixed to the translation of them in the present volume.</p>
<p>Sallust is supposed to have formed his style on that of Thucydides;<note anchored="true" place="foot">Vell. Pat., i. 36.</note> but he has far excelled his model, if not in energy, certainly in conciseness and perspicuity, of expression. "The speeches of Thucydides," says Cicero,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Orat., c. 9.</note> "contain so many dark and intricate passages, that they are scarcely understood." No such complaint can be made of any part of the writings of Sallust. "From any sentence in Thucydides," says <placeName key="tgn,2652379">Seneca</placeName> the rhetorician,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Controvers., iv. 24.</note> "however remarkable for its conciseness, if a word or two be taken away, the sense will remain, if not equally ornate, yet equally entire; but from the periods of Sallust nothing can be <pb n="xvii"/>deducted without detriment to the meaning." <quote xml:lang="lat">Apud eruditas aures,</quote> says Quintilian,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Inst.

Beauzée. " It appears somewhat singular," says Sir Henry, "that none of the numerous translators of Sallust, whether among ourselves or among foreign nations--the Abbé Thyvon and M. Beauzée excepted--have thought of giving to the word <foreign xml:lang="lat">virtus,</foreign> in this place, what so obviously is the meaning intended by the historian; namely, 'genius, ability, distinguished talents.' Indeed, the whole tenor of the passage, as well as the scope of the context, leaves no room to doubt the fact. The main objects of comparison, throughout the three first sections of this Præmium, or introductory discourse, are not vice and virtue, but body and mind; a listless indolence, and a vigorous, honorable activity. On this account it is pretty evident, that by <foreign xml:lang="lat">virtus</foreign> Sallust could never mean the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)reth/,</foreign> virtue or moral worth,' but that he had in his eye the well-known interpretation of Varro, who considers it <foreign xml:lang="lat">ut viri vis</foreign> (De Ling. Lat. iv.), as denoting the useful energy which ennobles a man, and should chiefly distinguish him among his fellow-creatures. In order to be convinced of the justice of this rendering, we need only turn to another passage of our author, in the second section of the Præmium to the Jugarthine War, where the same train of thought is again pursued, although he gives it somewhat a different turn in the piece last mentioned. The object, notwithstanding, of both these Dissertations is to illustrate, in a striking manner, the pre-eminence of the mind over extrinsic advantages or bodily endowments, and to show that it is by genius alone that we may aspire to a reputation which shall never die. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Igitur præclara facies, magnæ divitiæ, adhuc vis corporis, et alia hujusmodi omnia, brevi dilabuntur: at ingenii egregia facinora, sicut anima, immortalia sunt."</foreign>

Nor did he, in the mean time remain inactive, but devised schemes, in every possible way, against Cicero, who, however, did not want skill or policy to guard against them. For, at the very beginning of his consulship, he had, by making many promises through Fulvia, prevailed on Quintus Curius, whom I have already mentioned, to give him secret information of Catiline's proceedings.

<p>Yet the unrelenting spirit of Catiline persisted in the same purposes, notwithstanding the precautions that were adopted against him, and though he himself was accused by Lucius Paullus under the Plautian law.<note anchored="true" place="foot">The Plautian law] <quote xml:lang="lat">Lege Plautiâ.</quote> "This law was that of M.

Antiquities, sub VIS.</note> At last, with a view to dissemble, and under pretense of clearing his character, as if he had been provoked by some attack, he went into the senatehouse. It was then that Marcus Tullius, the consul, whether alarmed at his presence, or fired with indignation against him, delivered that splendid speech, so beneficial to the republic, which he afterward wrote and published.<note anchored="true" place="foot">Which he afterward wrote and published] <quote xml:lang="lat">Quam posteà scriptam edidit.</quote> This was the first of Cicero's four Orations against Catiline.

And so say Kritzius, Bernouf, and Dietsch. Cortius, who is followed by Dahl, Langius, and Müller, makes the word equivalent merely to lucid, in the supposition that Sallust intended to bestow on the speech, as on other performances of Cicero, only very cool praise. Luculentus, however, seems certainly to mean something more than <foreign xml:lang="lat">lucidus.</foreign></note></p>
<p>When Cicero sat down, Catiline, being prepared to pretend ignorance of the whole matter, entreated, with downcast looks and suppliant voice, that "the Conscript Fathers would not too hastily believe any thing against him;" saying "that he was sprung from such a family, and had so ordered his life from his youth, as to have every happiness in prospect; and that they were not to suppose that he, a patrician, whose services to the Roman people, as well as those of his ancestors, had been so numerous, should want to ruin the state, when Marcus Tullius, a mere adopted citizen of Rome,<note anchored="true" place="foot">A mere adopted citizen of Rome] <quote xml:lang="lat">Inquilinus civis urbis Romæ.</quote> <foreign xml:lang="lat">"Inquilinus"</foreign> means properly a lodger, or tenant in the house of another. Cicero was born at Arpinum, and is therefore called by Catiline a citizen of Rome merely by adoption or by sufferance. Appian, in repeating this account (Bell. Civ., ii. 104), says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">)*igkoui/linon, w(=| r(h/mati kalou=si tou\z e)noikou=ntas e)n a/llotoi/aiz o)iki/aiz.</foreign></note> was eager to preserve it."

Cicero's speech was delivered on the 8th of November. Sallust is, therefore, in error on this point, as well as Florus and Valerius Maximus, who have followed him." Bernouf. From other accounts we may infer that no reply was made to Cicero by Catiline on this occasion. Plutarch, in his Life of Cicero, says that Catiline, before Cicero rose, seemed desirous to address the senate in defense of his proceedings, but that the senators refused to listen to him. Of any answer to Cicero's speech, on the part of Catiline, he makes no mention. Cicero himself, in his second Oration against Catiline, says that Catiline could not endure his voice, but, when he was ordered to go into exile, <foreign xml:lang="lat">"paruit, quievit,"</foreign> obeyed and submitted in silence. And in his Oration, c. 37, he says, " That most audacious of men, Catiline, when he was accused by me in the senate, was dumb."</note> "and driven to desperation, I will extinguish the flame kindled around me in a general ruin."</p></div>

<p> He then hurried from the senate to his own house; and then, after much reflection with himself, thinking that, as his plots against the consul had been unsuccessful, and as he knew the city to be secured from fire by the watch, his best course would be to augment his army, and make provision for the war before the legions could be raised, he set out in the dead of night, and with a few attendants, to the camp of Manlius. But he left in charge to Lentulus and Cethegus, and others of whose prompt determination he was assured, to strengthen the interests of their party in every possible way, to forward the plots against the consul, and to make arrangements for a massacre, for firing the city, and for other destructive operations of war; promising that he himself would shortly advance on the city with a large army.</p>

<p>Catiline, on his march, sent letters to most men of consular dignity, and to all the most respectable citizens, stating that "as he was beset by false accusations, and unable to resist the combination of his enemies, he was submitting to the will of fortune, and going into exile at Marseilles; not that he was guilty of the great wickedness laid to his charge, but that the state might be undisturbed, and that no insurrection might arise from his defense of himself."</p>
<p>Quintus Catulus, however, read in the senate a letter of a very different character, which, he said, was delivered to him in he name of Catiline, and of which the following is a copy:</p>
<p><note anchored="true" place="foot">XXXV. The commencement of this letter is different in different editions. In Havercamp it stands thus: <foreign xml:lang="lat">Egregiatua fides, re cognita grata mihi, magnis in meis periculis, fiduciam commendationi meæ tribuit.</foreign> Cortius corrected it as follows: <foreign xml:lang="lat">Egregia tua fides, re cognita, gratam in magnis periculis fiduciam commendationi meæ tribuit.</foreign> Cortius's reading has been adopted by Kritzius, Bernouf, and most other editors. Gerlach and Dietsch have recalled the old text. That Cortius's is the better, few will deny; for it can hardly be supposed that Sallust used <foreign xml:lang="lat">mihi, meis,</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="lat">meæ</foreign> in such close succession. Some, however, as Rupertus and Gerlach, defend Havercamp's text, by asserting, from the phrase <foreign xml:lang="lat">earum exemplam infra scriptum,</foreign> that this is a true copy of the letter, and that the style is, therefore, not Sallust's, but Catiline's. But such an opinion is sufficiently refuted by Cortius, whose remarks I will transcribe: "Rupertus," says he, <foreign xml:lang="lat">"quod in promptu erat, Catilinæ culpam tribuit, qui non eo, quo Crispus, stilo scripserit. Sed cur oratio ejus tam apta et composita suprà c. 20 refertur? At, inquis, hic ipsum litterarum exemplum exhibetur.

L. (v. 10, ed. Sprengel) mentions a certain Ælius who was of this opinion. Against this derivation there is the quantity of <foreign xml:lang="lat">fidius,</foreign> of which the first syllable is short: <foreign xml:lang="lat">Quærebam Nonas Sanco fidone referrem,</foreign> Ov.

But if we consider <foreign xml:lang="lat">dius</foreign> the same as <foreign xml:lang="lat">deus,</foreign> we may as well consider <foreign xml:lang="lat">dius fidius</foreign> to be the god Hercules as the god Jupiter, and may thus make <foreign xml:lang="lat">medius fidius</foreign> identical with <foreign xml:lang="lat">mehercules,</foreign> as it probably is. " Tertullian, de Idol. 20, says that <foreign xml:lang="lat">medius fidius</foreign> is a form of swearing by Hercules."

<p>When this was known at Rome, the senate declared Catiline and Manlius enemies to the state, and fixed a day as to the rest of their force, before which they might lay down their arms with impunity, except such as had been convicted of capital offenses.

In addition to this, the youth, who, in the country, had earned a scanty livelihood by manual labor, tempted by public and private largesses, had preferred idleness in the city to unwelcome toil in the field. To these, and all others of similar character, public disorders would furnish subsistence. It is not at all surprising, therefore, that men in distress, of dissolute principles and extravagant expectations, should have consulted the interest of the state no further than as it was subservient to their own.

For, to state the truth in few words, whatever parties, during that period, disturbed the republic under plausible pretexts, some, as if to defend the rights of the people, others, to make the authority of the senate as great as possible, all, though affecting concern for the public good, contended every one for his own interest. In such contests there was neither moderation nor limit; each party made a merciless use of its successes.</p></div>

<p> After Pompey, however, was sent to the maritime and Mithridatic wars, the power of the people was diminished, and the influence of the few increased.

But as soon as a prospect of change, in this dubious state of affairs, had presented itself, the old spirit of contention awakened their passions; and had Catiline, in his first battle, come off victorious, or left the struggle undecided, great distress and calamity must certainly have fallen upon the state, nor would those, who might at last have gained the ascendency, have been allowed to enjoy <pb n="44"/>it long, for some superior power would have wrested dominion and liberty from them when weary and exhausted.</p>
<p>There were some, however, unconnected with the conspiracy, who set out to join Catiline at an early period of his proceedings. Among these was Aulus Fulvius, the son of a senator, whom, being arrested on his journey, his father ordered to be put to death.<note anchored="true" place="foot">His father ordered to be put to death] <quote xml:lang="lat">Parens necari jussit.</quote> "His father put him to death, not by order of the consuls, but by his own private authority; nor was he the only one who, at the same period, exercised similar power."

The Roman laws allowed fathers absolute control over the lives of their children.</note> In Rome, at the same time, Lentulus, in pursuance of Catiline's directions, was endeavoring to gain over, by his own agency or that of others, all whom he thought adapted, either by principles or circumstances, to promote an insurrection; and not citizens only, but every description of men who could be of any service in war.</p></div>

<p> He accordingly commissioned one Publius Umbrenus to apply to certain deputies of the Allobroges,<note anchored="true" place="foot">XL.

Umbrenus, as he had traded in Gaul, was known to most of the chief men there, and personally acquainted with them; and consequently, without loss of time, as soon as he noticed the deputies in the Forum, he asked them, after making a few inquiries about the state of their country, and affecting to commiserate its fallen condition, " what termination they expected to such calamities?" When he found that they complained of the rapacity of the magistrates, inveighed against the senate for not affording them relief, and looked to death as the only remedy for their sufferings, "Yet I," said he, "if you will but act as men, will show you a method by which you may escape these pressing difficulties." When he had said this, the Allobroges, animated with the highest hopes, besought Umbrenus to take compassion on them; saying that there was nothing so disagreeable or difficult, <pb n="45"/>which they would not most gladly perform, if it would but free their country from debt. He then conducted them to the house of Decimus Brutus, which was close to the Forum, and, on account of Sempronia, not unsuitable to his purpose, as Brutus was then absent from Rome.<note anchored="true" place="foot">As Brutus was then absent from Rome] <quote xml:lang="lat">Nam tum Brutus ab Româ aberat.</quote> From this remark, say Zanchius and Omnibonus, it is evident that Brutus was not privy to the conspiracy.

G. vii., sub fin.), was then very young, it is probable that she had only an illicit connection with him, but had gained such an ascendency over his affections, by her arts of seduction, as to induce him to make her his mistress, and to allow her to reside in his house."</quote><bibl>Beauzée.</bibl></cit>
I have, however, followed those who think that Brutus was the husband of Sempronia. Sallust (c. 24), speaking of the woman, of whom Sempronia was one, says that Catiline <foreign xml:lang="lat">credebat posse--viros earum vel adjungere sibi, vel interficere.</foreign> The truth, on such a point, is of little importance.</note> In order, too, to give greater weight to his representations, he sent for Gabinius, and, in his presence, explained the objects of the conspiracy, and mentioned the names of the confederates, as well as those of many other persons, of every sort, who were guiltless of it, for the purpose of inspiring the embassadors with greater confidence.

<p> But at Rome, in the mean time, Lentulus, with the other leaders of the conspiracy, having secured what they thought a large force, had arranged, that as soon as Catiline should reach the neighborhood of Fæsulæ, Lucius Bestia, a tribune of the people, having called an assembly, should complain of the proceedings of Cicero, and lay the odium of this most oppressive war on the excellent consul ;<note anchored="true" place="foot">XLIII.

That it could be regarded only as frigid eulogy, is apparent from a passage in one of Cicero's letters to Atticus (xii. 21), in which he speaks of the same epithet having been applied to him by Brutus: " Brutus thinks that he pays me a great compliment when he calls me an excellent consul (<foreign xml:lang="lat">optimum consulem</foreign>); but what enemy could speak more coldly of me?"</note> and that the rest of the conspirators, taking this as a signal, should, on the following night, proceed to execute their respective parts.</p>

<p>While they were thus forming and settling their plans, Cethegus was incessantly complaining of the want of spirit in his associates; observing, that they wasted excellent opportunities through hesitation and delay;<note anchored="true" place="foot">Delay] <quote xml:lang="lat">Dies prolatando.</quote> By putting off from day to day.</note> that, in such an enterprise, there was need, not of deliberation, but of action; and that he himself, if a few would support him, would storm the senatehouse while the others remained inactive.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="44">
<p> The Allobroges, according to the directions of Cicero, procured interviews, by means of Gabinius, with the other conspirators; and from Lentulus, Cethegus, Statilius, and Cassius, they demanded an oath, which they might carry under seal to their countrymen, who otherwise would hardly join in so important an affair.

<p>In order that the Allobroges, before they reached home, might confirm their agreement with Catiline, by giving and receiving pledges of faith, Lentulus sent with them one Titus Volturcius, a native of Crotona, he himself giving Volturcius a letter for Catiline, of which the following is a copy:</p>
<p>"Who I am, you will learn from the person whom I have <pb n="48"/>sent to you.

In addition, he gave him this verbal message: "Since he was declared an enemy by the senate, for what reason should he reject the assistance of slaves ? That, in the city, every thing which he had directed was arranged; and that he should not delay to make nearer approaches to it."</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="45">
<p> Matters having proceeded thus far, and a night being appointed for the departure of the deputies, Cicero, being by them made acquainted with every thing, directed the prætors,<note anchored="true" place="foot">XLV.

Volturcius, at first, encouraging his companions, defended himself against numbers with his sword; but afterward, being unsupported by the Allobroges, he began earnestly to beg Pomtinus, to whom he was known, to save his life, and at last, terrified and despairing of safety, he surrendered himself to the prætors as unconditionally as to foreign enemies.</p></div>

<p> The affair being thus concluded, a full account of it was immediately transmitted to the consul by messengers. Great anxiety, and great joy, affected him at the same moment. He rejoiced that, by the discovery of the conspiracy, the state was freed from danger; but he was doubtful how he ought to act, when citizens of such eminence were detected in <pb n="49"/>treason so atrocious. He saw that their punishment would be a weight upon himself, and their escape the destruction of the Commonwealth. Having, however, formed his resolution, he ordered Lentulus, Cethegus, Statilius, Gabinius, and one Quintus Cæparius of Terracina, who was preparing to go to Apulia to raise the slaves, to be summoned before him. The others came without delay; but Cæparius, having left his house a little before, and heard of the discovery of the conspiracy, had fled from the city. The consul himself conducted Lentulus, as he was prætor, holding him by the hand, and ordered the others to be brought into the Temple of Concord, under a guard. Here he assembled the senate, and in a very full attendance of that body, introduced Volturcius with the deputies.

The Gauls made a similar confession, and charged Lentulus, who began to affect ignorance, not only with the letter to Catiline, but with <pb n="50"/>remarks which he was in the habit of making, "that the sovereignity of Rome, by the Sibylline books, was predestined to three Cornelii; that Cinna and Sylla had ruled already ;<note anchored="true" place="foot">That Cinna and Sylla had ruled already] <quote xml:lang="lat">Cinnam atque Syllam antea.</quote> "Had ruled," or something similar, must be supplied.

<p> The common people, meanwhile, who had at first, from a desire of change in the government, been too much inclined to war, having, on the discovery of the plot, altered their sentiments, began to execrate the projects of Catiline, to extol Cicero to the skies; and, as if rescued from slavery, to give proofs of joy and exultation. Other effects of war they expected as a gain rather than a loss; but the burning of the city they thought inhuman, outrageous, and fatal, especially to themselves, whose whole property consisted in their daily necessaries and the clothes which they wore.</p>
<p>On the following day, a certain Lucius Tarquinius was brought before the senate, who was said to have been arrested as he was setting out to join Catiline.

Cicero, accordingly, taking their opinions, a full senate decreed " that the testimony of Tarquinius appeared false; that he himself should be kept in prison; and that no further liberty of speaking<note anchored="true" place="foot">Liberty of speaking] <quote xml:lang="lat">Potestatem.</quote> <foreign xml:lang="lat">"'Potestatem loquendi."</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cyprianus Popma.</foreign> As it did not appear that he spoke the truth, the pledge which the senate had given him, on condition that he spoke the truth, went for nothing; he was not allowed to continue his evidence, and was sent to prison.</note> should be granted him, unless he should name the person at whose instigation he had fabricated so shameful a calumny."</p>
<p>There were some, at that time, who thought that this affair was contrived by Publius Autronius, in order that the interest of Crassus, if he were accused, might, from participation in the danger, more readily screen the rest.

<p> Yet, at the same time, neither by interest, nor by solicitation, nor by bribes, could Quintus Catulus, and Caius Piso, prevail upon Cicero to have Caius Cæsar falsely accused, either by means of the Allobroges, or any other evidence.

<p>The consul, when he heard that these things were in agitation, having distributed armed bodies of men, as the circumstances and occasion demanded, called a meeting of the senate, and desired to know " what they wished to be done concerning those who had been committed to custody."

We must suppose that Sallust had his thoughts on Cæsar's speech, which was to follow, and signifies that all this business had been done before Cæsar addressed the house. Kritzius thinks that the pluperfect was referred by Sallust, not to Cæsar's speech; but to the decree of the senate which was finally made; but this is surely a less satisfactory method of settling the matter. Sallust often uses the pluperfect, where his reader would expect the perfect; see, for instance, <foreign xml:lang="lat">concusserat,</foreign> at the beginning of c. 24.</note> that capital punishment should be inflicted, not only on those who were in confinement, but also on Lucius Cassius, Publius Furius, Publius Umbrenus, and Quintus Annius, if they should be apprehended; but afterward, being influenced by the speech of Caius Cæsar, he said that he would go over to the opinion of Tiberius Nero,<note anchored="true" place="foot">That he would go over to the opinion of Tiberius Nero] <quote xml:lang="lat">Pedibus in sententian Tib.

Cæsar, when it came to his turn, being asked his opinion by the consul, spoke to the following effect:</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="51">
<p> "It becomes all men,<note anchored="true" place="foot">LI. It becomes all men, etc.] The beginning of this speech, attributed to Cæsar, is imitated from Demosthenes, <foreign xml:lang="grc">*heri\ tw=n e)n *xersonh/sw| pragma/twn: )/*edei me\n, w)= u)/ndrez *aqhnai=oi, tou\z le/gontaz, u)/pantaz e)n u(mi=n mh/te pro\s e)/xqran poiei=sqai lo/gon mhde/na, mh/te pro\s xa/rin.</foreign> "It should be incumbent on all who speak before you, O Athenians, to advance no sentiment with any view either to enmity or to favor."</note> Conscript Fathers, who deliberate on dubious matters, to be influenced neither by hatred, affection, anger, nor pity. The mind, when such feelings obstruct its view, can not easily see what is right; nor has any human being consulted, at the same moment, his passion and his interest. When the mind is freely exerted, its reasoning is sound; but passion, if it gain possession of it, becomes its tyrant, and reason is powerless.</p>
<p>"I could easily mention, Conscript Fathers, numerous examples of kings and nations, who, swayed by resentment or compassion, have adopted injudicious courses of conduct; but I had rather speak of these instances in which our ancestors, in opposition to the impulse of passion, acted with wisdom and sound policy.</p>
<p>"In the Macedonian war, which we carried on against king Perses, the great and powerful state of Rhodes, which had risen by the aid of the Roman people, was faithless and hostile to us; yet, when the war was ended, and the conduct of the Rhodians was taken into consideration, our forefathers left them unmolested lest any should say that war was made upon them for the sake of seizing their wealth, rather than of punishing their faithlessness. Throughout the Punic war, too, though the Carthaginians, both during peace and in suspension of arms, were guilty of many acts of injustice, yet our ancestors never took occasion to retaliate, but considered rather what was worthy of themselves, than what might be justly inflicted on their enemies.</p>
<p>"Similar caution, Conscript Fathers, is to be observed by <pb n="55"/>yourselves, that the guilt of Lentulus, and the other conspirators, may not have greater weight with you than your own dignity, and that you may not regard your indignation more than your character. If, indeed, a punishment adequate to their crimes be discovered, I consent to extraordinary measures;<note anchored="true" place="foot">I consent to extraordinary measures] <quote xml:lang="lat">Novum consilium adprobo.</quote> <cit><quote>"That is, I consent that you depart from the usage of your ancestors, by which Roman citizens were protected from death."</quote><bibl>Bernouf.</bibl></cit></note> but if the enormity of their crime exceeds whatever can be devised,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Whatever can be devised] <quote xml:lang="lat">Omnium ingenia.</quote></note> I think that we should inflict only such penalties as the laws have provided.</p>
<p>"Most of those, who have given their opinions before me, have deplored, in studied and impressive language,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Studied and impressive language] <quote xml:lang="lat">Compositè. atque magnificè.</quote> <foreign xml:lang="lat">Compositè,</foreign> in language nicely put together; elegantly. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Magnificè,</foreign> in striking or imposing terms. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Compositè</foreign> is applied to the speech of Cæsar, by Cato, in the following chapter.</note> the sad fate that threatens the republic; they have recounted the barbarities of war, and the afflictions that would fallon the vanquished; they have told us that maidens would be dishonored, and youths abused; that children would be torn from the embraces of their parents; that matrons would be subjected to the pleasure of the conquerors; that temples and dwelling-houses would be plundered; that massacres and fires would follow; ane that every place would be filled with arms, corpses, blood, and lamentation. But to what end, in the name of the eternal gods! was such eloquence directed? Was it intended to render you indignant at the conspiracy? A speech, no doubt, will inflame him whom so frightful and monstrous a reality has not provoked! Far from it: for to no man does evil, directed against himself, appear a light matter; many, on the contrary, have felt it more seriously than was right.</p>
<p>"But to different persons, Conscript Fathers, different degrees of license are allowed. If those who pass a life sunk in obscurity, commit any error, through excessive angel, few become aware of it, for their fame is as limited as their fortune; but of those who live invested with extensive power, and in an exalted station, the whole world knows the proceedings. Thus in the highest position there is the least liberty of action; and it becomes us to indulge neither partiality nor aversion, but least of all animosity; for what in others is called resentment, is in the powerful termed violence and cruelty.
<pb n="56"/></p>
<p>"I am indeed of opinion, Conscript Fathers, that the utmost degree of torture is inadequate to punish their crime; but the generality of mankind dwell on that which happens last, and, in the case of malefactors, forget their guilt, and talk only of their punishment, should that punishment have been inordinately severe. I feel assured, too, that Decimus Silanus, a man of spirit and resolution, made the suggestions which he offered, from zeal for the state, and that he had no view, in so important a matter, to favor or to enmity; such I know to be his character, and such his discretion.<note anchored="true" place="foot">Such I know to be his character, such his discretion] <quote xml:lang="lat">Eos mores, earn modestiam viri cognovi.</quote> I have translated <foreign xml:lang="lat">modestiam,</foreign> discretion, which seems to be the proper meaning of the word. Beauzée renders it prudence, and adds a note upon it, which may be worth transcription. "I translate <foreign xml:lang="lat">modestia,</foreign>" says he, "by prudence, and think myself authorized to do so. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Sic definitur à Stoicis,</foreign> says Cicero (De Off. i. 40), <foreign xml:lang="lat">ut modestia sit sicentia earum rerum, quæ agentur, aut dicentur, loco suo collocandarum;</foreign> and shortly afterward, <foreign xml:lang="lat">Sic fit ut modestia scientia sit opportunitatis idoneorum ad agendum temporum.</foreign> And what is understood in French by prudence? It is, according to the Dictionary of the Academy, 'a virtue by which we discern and practice what is proper in the conduct of life.' This is almost a translation of the words of Cicero."</note> Yet his proposal appears to me, I will not say cruel (for what can be cruel that is directed against such characters?), but foreign to our policy. For assuredly, Silanus, either your fears, or their treason, must have induced you, a consul elect, to propose this new kind of punishment. Of fear it is unnecessary to speak, when by the prompt activity of that distinguished man our consul, such numerous forces are under arms; and as to the punishment, we may say, what is indeed the truth, that in trouble and distress, death is a relief from suffering, and not a torment;<note anchored="true" place="foot">That--death is a relief from suffering, not a torment, etc.] This Epicurean doctrine prevailed very much at Rome in Cæsar's time, and afterward. We may very well suppose Cæsar to have been a sincere convert to it. Cato alludes to this passage in the speech which follows; as also Cicero, in his fourth Oration against Catiline, c. 4. See, for opinions on this point, the first book of Cicero's Tusculan Questions.</note> that it puts an end to all human woes; and that, beyond it, there is no place either for sorrow or joy.</p>
<p>"But why, in the name of the immortal gods, did you not add to your proposal, Silanus, that, before they were put to death, they should be punished with the scourge? Was it because the Porcian law<note anchored="true" place="foot">The Porcian law] <quote xml:lang="lat">Lex Portia.</quote> A law proposed by P. Porcius Læca, one of the tribunes, A. U. C. 454, which enacted that no one should bind, scourge, or kill a Roman citizen. See Liv., x. 9; Cic. pro. Rabir., 3, 4; Verr., v. 63; de Rep., ii, 31.</note> forbids it? But other <pb n="57"/>laws<note anchored="true" place="foot">Other laws] <quote xml:lang="lat">Aliæ leges.</quote> So Cæsar says below, <foreign xml:lang="lat">"Tum lex Porcia aliæque paratæ, quibus legibus auxilium damnatis permissum;"</foreign> what other laws these were is uncertain. One of them, however, was the Sempronian law, proposed by Caius Gracchus, which ordained that sentence should not be passed on the life of a Roman citizen without the order of the people. See Cic. pro Rabir. 4. So <foreign xml:lang="lat">"O lex Porcia legesque Semproniæ!"</foreign> Cic. in Verr., v. 63.</note> forbid condemned citizens to be deprived of life, and allow them to go into exile. Or was it because scourging is a severer penalty than death? Yet what can be too severe, or too harsh, toward men convicted of such an offense? But if scourging be a milder punishment than death, how is it consistent to observe the law as to the smaller point, when you disregard it as to the greater?</p>
<p>"But who it may be asked, will blame any severity that shall be decreed against these parricides<note anchored="true" place="foot">Parricides] See c. 14, 32.</note> of their country? I answer that time, the course of events,<note anchored="true" place="foot">The course of events] <quote xml:lang="lat">Dies.</quote> <cit><quote><foreign xml:lang="lat">"Id est, temporis momentum (<foreign xml:lang="de">der verän derte Zeitpunkt</foreign>)."</foreign></quote><bibl>Dietsch.</bibl></cit> Things change, and that which is approved at one period, is blamed at another. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Tempus</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="lat">dies</foreign> are sometimes joined (Liv., xxii. 39, ii. 45), as if not only time in general, but particular periods, as from day to day, were intended.</note> and fortune, whose caprice governs nations, may blame it. Whatever shall fall on the traitors, will fall on them justly; but it is for you, Conscript Fathers, to consider well what you resolve to inflict on others. All precedents productive of evil effects,<note anchored="true" place="foot">All precedents productive of evil effects] <quote xml:lang="lat">Omnia mala exempla.</quote> Examples of severe punishments are meant.</note> have had their origin from what was good; but when a government passes into the hands of the ignorant or unprincipled, any new example of severity,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Any new example of severity, etc.] <quote xml:lang="lat">Novum illud exemplum ab dignis et idoneis ad indignos et non idoneos transferetur.</quote> Gerlach, Kritzius, Dietsch, and Bernouf, agree to giving to this passage the sense which is given in the translation. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Digni</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="lat">idonei</foreign> are here used in a bad sense, for <foreign xml:lang="lat">digni et idonei qui pænâ afficiantur,</foreign> deserving and fit objects for punishment.</note> inflicted on deserving and suitable objects, is extended to those that are improper and undeserving of it. The Lacedæmonians, when they had conquered the Athenians,<note anchored="true" place="foot">When they had conquered the Athenians] At the conclusion of the Peloponnesian war.</note> appointed thirty men to govern their state. These thirty began their administration by putting to death, even without a trial, all who were notoriously wicked, or publicly detestable; acts at which the people rejoiced, and extolled their justice. But afterward, when their lawless power gradually increased, they proceeded, at their pleasure, to kill the good and the bad indiscriminately, <pb n="58"/>and to strike terror into all; and thus the state, overpowered and enslaved, paid a heavy penalty for its imprudent exultation.</p>
<p>"Within our own memory, too, when the victorious Sylla ordered Damasippus,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Damasippus] "He, in the consulship of Caius Marius, the younger, and Cneius Carbo, was city prætor, and put to death some of the most eminent senators, a short time before the victory of Sylla. See Veil. Paterc. ii. 26." <bibl>Bernouf.</bibl></note> and others of similar character, who had risen by distressing their country, to be put to death, who did not commend the proceeding? All exclaimed that wicked and factious men, who had troubled the state with their seditious practices, had justly forfeited their lives. Yet this proceeding was the commencement of great bloodshed. For whenever any one coveted the mansion or villa, or even the plate or apparel of another, he exerted his influence to have him numbered among the proscribed. Thus they, to whom the death of Damasippus had been a subject of joy, were soon after dragged to death themselves; nor was there any cessation of slaughter, until Sylla had glutted all his partisans with riches.</p>
<p>"Such excesses, indeed, I do not fear from Marcus Tullius, or in these times. But in a large state there arise many men of various dispositions. At some other period, and under another consul, who, like the present, may have an army at his command, some false accusation may be credited as true; and when, with our example for a precedent, the consul shall have drawn the sword on the authority of the senate, who shall stay its progress, or moderate its fury?</p>
<p>"Our ancestors, Conscript Fathers, were never deficient in conduct or courage; nor did pride prevent them from imitating the customs of other nations, if they appeared deserving of regard. Their armor, and weapons of war, they borrowed from the Samnites; their ensigns of authority,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Ensigns of authority] <quote xml:lang="lat">Insignia magistratum.</quote> "The fasces and axes of the twelve lictors, the robe adorned with purple, the curule chair, and the ivory scepter. For the Etrurians, as Dionysius Halicarnassensis relates, having been subdued, in a nine years' war, by Tarquinius Priscus, and having obtained peace on condition of submitting to him as their sovereign, presented him with the <foreign xml:lang="lat">insignia</foreign> of their own monarchs. See Strabo, lib. v.; Florus, i. 5." <bibl>Kuhnhardt.</bibl></note> for the most part, from the Etrurians; and, in short, whatever appeared eligible to them, whether among allies or among enemies, they adopted at home with the greatest readiness, being more inclined to <pb n="59"/>emulate merit than to be jealous of it. But at the same time, adopting a practice from Greece, they punished their citizens with the scourge, and inflicted capital punishment on such as were condemned. When the republic, however, became powerful, and faction grew strong from the vast number of citizens, men began to involve the innocent in condemnation, and other like abuses were practiced; and it was then that the Porcian and other laws were provided, by which condemned citizens were allowed to go into exile. This lenity of our ancestors, Conscript Fathers, I regard as a very strong reason why we should not adopt any new measures of severity. For assuredly there was greater merit and wisdom in those, who raised so mighty an empire from humble means, than in us, who can scarcely preserve what they so honorably acquired. Am I of opinion, then, you will ask, that the conspirators should be set free, and that the army of Catiline should thus be increased? Far from it; my recommendation is, that their property be confiscated, and that they themselves be kept in custody in such of the municipal towns as are best able to bear the expense;<note anchored="true" place="foot">Best able to bear the expense] <quote xml:lang="lat">Maximè opibus valent.</quote> Are possessed of most resources.</note> that no one hereafter bring their case before the senate, or speak on it to the people; and that the senate now give their opinion, that he who shall act contrary to this, will act against the republic and the general safety."</p></div>

He accordingly proposed that the property of the conspirators should be confiscated, and themselves kept in custody in the municipal towns; fearing, it seems, that, if they remain at Rome, they may be rescued either by their accomplices in the conspiracy, or by a hired mob; as if, forsooth, the mischievous and profligate were to be found only in the city, and not through the whole of Italy, or as if desperate attempts would not be more likely to succeed where there is less power to resist them.

I advise you to have mercy upon them<note anchored="true" place="foot">I advise you to have mercy upon them] <quote xml:lang="lat">Misereamini censeo,</quote> i.e., <foreign xml:lang="lat">censeo ut misereamini</foreign>, spoken ironically. Most translators have taken the words in the sense of "You would take pity on them, I suppose," or something similar.</note> they are young men who have been led astray by ambition; send them away, even with arms in their hands. But such mercy, and such clemency, if they turn those arms against you, will end in misery to yourselves. The case is, assuredly, dangerous, but you do not fear it; yes, you fear it greatly, but you hesitate how to act, through weakness and want of spirit, waiting one for another, and trusting to the immortal gods, who have so often preserved your country in the greatest dangers. But the protection of the gods is not obtained by vows and effeminate supplications; it is by vigilance, activity, and prudent measures, that general welfare is secured. When you are once resigned to sloth and indolence, it is in vain that you implore the gods; for they are then indignant and threaten vengeance.</p>
<p>"In the days of our forefathers, Titus Manlius Torquatus, during a war with the Gauls, ordered his own son to be put to death, because he had fought with an enemy contrary to orders. That noble youth suffered for excess of bravery; and do you hesitate what sentence to pass on the most inhuman of traitors? Perhaps their former life is at variance with their present crime. Spare, then, the dignity of Lentulus, if he has ever spared his own honor or character, or had any regard for gods or for men. Pardon the youth of Cethegus, unless this be the second time that he has made war upon his country.<note anchored="true" place="foot">Unless this be the second time that he has made war upon his country] <cit><quote>"Cethegus first made war ou his country in conjunction with Marius."</quote><bibl>Bernouf.</bibl></cit> Whether Sallust alludes to this, or intimates (as Gerlach thinks) that he was engaged in the first conspiracy, is doubtful.</note> As to Gabinius, Statilius, Cæparius, why should I make any remark upon them? Had they ever possessed the smallest share of discretion, they would never have engaged in such a plot against their country.</p>
<p>"In conclusion, Conscript Fathers, if there were time to <pb n="64"/>amend an error, I might easily suffer you, since you disregard words, to be corrected by experience of consequences.

The more necessary is it, therefore, to act with promptitude. What I advise, then, is this: that since the state, by a treasonable combination of abandoned citizens, has been brought into the greatest peril; and since the conspirators have been convicted on the evidence of Titus Volturcius, and the deputies of the Allobroges, and on their own confession, of having concerted massacres, conflagrations, and other horrible and cruel outrages, against their fellow-citizens and their country, punishment be inflicted, according to the usage of our ancestors, on the prisoners who have confessed their guilt, as on men convicted of capital crimes."</p></div>

<p>After reading and hearing of the many glorious achievements which the Roman people had performed at home and in the field, by sea as well as by land, I happened to be led to consider what had been the great foundation of such illustrious deeds. I knew that the Romans had frequently, with small bodies of men, encountered vast armies of the enemy; I was aware that they had carried on wars<note anchored="true" place="foot">That they had carried on wars] <quote xml:lang="lat">Bella gesta.</quote> That wars had been carried on by them.</note> with limited forces <pb n="65"/>against powerful sovereigns; that they had often sustained, too, the violence of adverse fortune; yet that, while the Greeks excelled them in eloquence, the Gauls surpassed them in military glory. After much reflection, I felt convinced that the eminent virtue of a few citizens had been the cause of all these successes; and hence it had happened that poverty had triumphed over riches, and a few over a multitude. And even in later times, when the state had become corrupted by luxury and indolence, the republic still supported itself, by its own strength, under the misconduct of its generals and magistrates; when, as if the parent stock were exhausted,<note anchored="true" place="foot">As if the parent stock were exhausted] <quote xml:lang="lat">Sicuti effæta parentum.</quote> This is the reading of Cortius, which he endeavors to explain thus: <foreign xml:lang="lat">"Ac sicuti effæta parens, inter parentes, sese habere solet, ut nullos amplius liberas proferat, sic Roma sese habuit, ubi multis tempestatibus nemo virtute magnus fuit."</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="lat">"Est,"</foreign> he adds, "or <foreign xml:lang="lat">solet esse,</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="lat">sese habere solet,</foreign> may very well be understood from the <foreign xml:lang="lat">fuit</foreign> which follows." But all this only serves to show what a critic may find to say in defense of a reading to which he is determined to adhere. All the MSS., indeed, have <foreign xml:lang="lat">parentum</foreign>, except one, which has <foreign xml:lang="lat">parente.</foreign> Dietsch thinks that some word has been lost between <foreign xml:lang="lat">effæta</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="lat">parentum,</foreign> and proposes to read <foreign xml:lang="lat">sicuti effæta ætate parentum,</foreign> with the sense, as if the age of the parents were too much exhausted to produce strong children. Kritzius, from a suggestion of Cortius (or rather of his predecessor, Rupertus), reads <foreign xml:lang="lat">effætæ parentum</foreign> (the <foreign xml:lang="lat">effætæ</foreign> agreeing with <foreign xml:lang="lat">Romæ</foreign> which follows), considering the sense to be the same as <foreign xml:lang="lat">effætæ parentis</foreign>--as <foreign xml:lang="lat">divina dearum</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="lat">divina dea,</foreign> etc. Gerlach retains the reading of Cortius, and adopts his explanation (4to. ed., 1827), but says that the <foreign xml:lang="lat">explicatio</foreign> may seem <foreign xml:lang="lat">durior,</foreign> and that it is doubtful whether we ought not to have recourse to the <foreign xml:lang="lat">effæta parente</foreign> of the old critics. Assuredly if we retain <foreign xml:lang="lat">parentum, effætæ</foreign> is the only reading that we can well put with it. We may compare with it <foreign xml:lang="lat">loca nuda gignentium,</foreign> (Jug. c. 79), i.e. "places bare of objects producing anything." Gronovius knew not what to do with the passage, called it <foreign xml:lang="lat">locus intellectus nemini,</foreign> and at last decided on understanding <foreign xml:lang="lat">virtute</foreign> with <foreign xml:lang="lat">effætæ parentum,</foreign> which, <foreign xml:lang="lat">pace tanti viri,</foreign> and although Allen has followed him, is little better than folly. The concurrence of the majority of manuscripts in giving <foreign xml:lang="lat">parentum</foreign> makes the scholar unwilling to set it aside. However, as no one has explained it satisfactorily even to himself, I have thought it better, with Dietsch, to regard it a <foreign xml:lang="lat">scriptura non ferenda,</foreign> and to acquiesce, with Glareanus, Rivius, Burnouf, and the Bipont edition, in the reading <foreign xml:lang="lat">effætâ parente.</foreign></note> there was certainly not produced at Rome, for many years, a single citizen of eminent ability. Within my recollection, however, there arose two men of remarkable powers, though of very different character, Marcus Cato and Caius Cæsar, whom, since the subject has brought them before me, it is not my intention to pass in silence, but to describe, to the best of my ability, the disposition and manners of each.</p></div>

<p>LVII When it was reported in his camp, however, that the conspiracy had been discovered at Rome, and that Lentulus, Cethegus, and the rest whom I have named, had been put to death, most of those whom the hope of plunder, or the love of change, had led to join in the war, fell away. The remainder Catiline conducted, over rugged mountains, and by forced marches, into the neighborhood of Pistoria, with a view to escape covertly, by cross roads, into Gaul.</p>
<p>But Quintus Metellus Celer, with a force of three legions, had at that time, his station in Picenum, who suspected that Catiline, from the difficulties of his position, would adopt precisely the course which we have just described. When, therefore, he had learned his route from some deserters, he immediately broke up his camp, and took his post at the very foot of the hills, at the point where Catiline's descent would be, in his hurried march into Gaul.<note anchored="true" place="foot">LVII.

I have translated <foreign xml:lang="lat">magno exercitu,</foreign> "though with a large army," although, according to Dietsch and some others, we need not consider a large army as a cause of slowness, but may rather regard it as a cause of speed; since the more numerous were Metellus's forces, the less he would care how many he might leave behind through fatigue, or to guard the baggage; so that he might be the more <foreign xml:lang="lat">expeditus,</foreign> unincumbered.

<p>Catiline, when he saw that he was surrounded by mountains and by hostile forces, that his schemes in the city had been unsuccessful, and that there was no hope either of escape or of succor, thinking it best, in such circumstances, to try the fortune of a battle, resolved upon engaging, as speedily as possible, with Antonius. Having, therefore, assembled his troops, he addressed them in the following manner:</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="58">
<p> "I am well aware, soldiers, that words can not inspire courage; and that a spiritless army can not be rendered active,<note anchored="true" place="foot">LVIII. That a spiritless army can not be rendered active, etc.] <quote xml:lang="lat">Neque ex ignavo strenuum, neque fortem ex timido exercitum oratione imperatoris fieri.</quote>  I have departed a little from the literal reading, for the sake of ease.</note> or a timid army valiant, by the speech of its commander. Whatever courage is in the heart of a man, whether from nature or from habit, so much will be shown by him in the field; and on him whom neither glory nor danger can move, exhortation is bestowed in vain; for the terror in his breast stops his ears.</p>
<p>"I have called you together, however, to give you a few instructions, and to explain to you, at the same time, my reasons for the course which I have adopted. You all know, soldiers, how severe a penalty the inactivity and cowardice of Lentulus has brought upon himself and us; and how, while waiting for reinforcements from the city, I was unable to march into Gaul. <pb n="70"/>In what situation our affairs now are, you all understand as well as myself. Two armies of the enemy, one on the side of Rome, and the other on that of Gaul, oppose our progress; while the want of corn, and of other necessaries, prevents us from remaining, however strongly we may desire to remain, in our present position. Whithersoever we would go, we must open a passage with our swords. I conjure you, therefore, to maintain a brave and resolute spirit; and to remember, when you advance to battle, that on your own right hands depend<note anchored="true" place="foot">That on your own right hands depend, etc.] <quote xml:lang="lat">In dextris portare.</quote> "That you carry in your right hands."</note> riches, honor, and glory, with the enjoyment of your liberty and of your country. If we conquer, all will be safe; we shall have provisions in abundance; and the colonies and corporate towns will open their gates to us. But if we lose the victory through want of courage, those same places<note anchored="true" place="foot">Those same places] <quote xml:lang="lat">Eadem illa.</quote> <cit><quote xml:lang="lat">"Coloniæ atque municipia portas claudent."</quote><bibl>Bernouf.</bibl></cit></note> will turn against us; for neither place nor friend will protect him whom his arms have not protected. Besides, soldiers, the same exigency does not press upon our adversaries, as presses upon us; we fight for our country, for our liberty, for our life; they contend for what but little concerns them,<note anchored="true" place="foot">They contend for what but little concerns them] <quote xml:lang="lat">Illis supervacaneum est pugnare.</quote> It is but of little concern to the great body of them personally: they may fight, but others will have the advantages of their efforts.</note> the power of a small party. Attack them, therefore, with so much the greater confidence, and call to mind your achievements of old.</p>
<p>"We might,<note anchored="true" place="foot">We might, etc.] <quote xml:lang="lat">Licit nobis.</quote> The editions vary between <foreign xml:lang="lat">nobis</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="lat">vobis;</foreign> but most, with Cortius, have <foreign xml:lang="lat">nobis.</foreign></note> with the utmost ignominy, have passed the rest of our days in exile. Some of you, after losing your property, might have waited at Rome for assistance from others. But because such a life, to men of spirit, was disgusting and unendurable, you resolved upon your present course. If you wish to quit it, you must exert all your resolution, for none but conquerors have exchanged war for peace. To hope for safety in flight, when you have turned away from the enemy the arms by which the body is defended, is indeed madness. In battle, those who are most afraid are always in most danger; but courage is equivalent to a rampart.</p>
<p>"When I contemplate you, soldiers, and when I consider your past exploits, a strong hope of victory animates me. Your <pb n="71"/>spirit, your age, your valor, give me confidence; to say nothing of necessity, which makes even cowards brave. To prevent the numbers of the enemy from surrounding us, our confined situation is sufficient. But should Fortune be unjust to your valor, take care not to lose your lives unavenged; take care not to be taken and butchered like cattle, rather than, fighting like men, to leave to your enemies a bloody and mournful victory."</p></div>

It was with this belief, I suppose, that the writer of a gloss on one of the manuscripts consulted by Cortius, interpreted the words, <foreign xml:lang="lat">ultroneam passus est podogram,</foreign> "he was affected with a voluntary gout."

Then, riding round among his troops, and addressing his men by name, he encouraged them, and bade them remember that they were to fight against unarmed marauders, in defense of their country, their children, their temples, and their homes.<note anchored="true" place="foot">Their temples and their homes] <quote xml:lang="lat">Aris atque focis suis.</quote> See c. 52.</note> Being a military man, and having served with great reputation, for more than thirty years, as tribune, præfect, lieutenant, or prætor, he knew most of the soldiers and their <pb n="73"/>honorable actions, and, by calling these to their remembrance, roused the spirits of the men.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="60">
<p> When he had made a complete survey, he gave the signal with the trumpet, and ordered the cohorts to advance slowly. The army of the enemy followed his example; and when they approached so near that the action could be commenced by the light-armed troops, both sides, with a loud shout, rushed together in a furious charge.<note anchored="true" place="foot">LX. In a furious charge] <quote xml:lang="lat">Infestis signis.</quote></note> They threw aside their missiles, and fought only with their swords. The veterans, calling to mind their deeds of old, engaged fiercely in the closest combat. The enemy made an obstinate resistance; and both sides contended with the utmost fury. Catiline, during this time, was exerting himself with his light troops in the front, sustaining such as were pressed, substituting fresh men for the wounded, attending to every exigency, charging in person, wounding many an enemy, and performing at once the duties of a valiant soldier and a skillful general.</p>
<p>When Petreius, contrary to his expectation, found Catiline attacking him with such impetuosity, he led his prætorian cohort against the centre of the enemy, among whom, being thus thrown into confusion, and offering but partial resistance,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Offering but partial resistance] <quote xml:lang="lat">Alios alibi resistentes.</quote> Not making a stand in a body, but only some in one place, and some in another.</note> he made great slaughter, and ordered, at the same time, an assault on both flanks.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="61">
<p> When the battle was over, it was plainly seen what boldness, and what energy of spirit, had prevailed throughout the army of Catiline; for, almost every where, every soldier, after yielding up his breath, covered with his corpse the spot which he had occupied when alive. A few, indeed, whom the prætorian cohort had dispersed, had fallen somewhat differently, but all with wounds in front. Catiline himself was found, far in advance of his men, among the dead bodies <pb n="74"/>of the enemy; he was not quite breathless, and still expressed in his countenance the fierceness of spirit which he had shown during his life. Of his whole army, neither in the battle, nor in flight, was any free-born citizen made prisoner, for they had spared their own lives no more than those of the enemy.</p>
<p>Nor did the army of the Roman people obtain a joyful or bloodless victory; for all their bravest men were either killed in the battle, or left the field severely wounded.</p>
<p>Of many who went from the camp to view the ground, or plunder the slain, some, in turning over the bodies of the enemy, discovered a friend, others an acquaintance, others a relative; some, too, recognized their enemies. Thus, gladness and sorrow, grief and joy, were variously felt throughout the whole army.

</p>
<p>The narrative of Sallust terminates with the account of the battle of Pistoria. There are a few other particulars connected with the history of the conspiracy, which, for the sake of the English reader, it may not be improper to add.</p>
<p>When the victory was gained, Antonius caused Catiline's head to be cut off, and sent it to Rome by the messengers who carried the news. Antonius himself was honored, by a public decree, with the title of <foreign xml:lang="lat">Imperator,</foreign> although he had done little to merit the distinction, and although the number of slain, which was three thousand, was less than that for which the title was generally given. See Dio Cass. xxxvii., 40, 41.</p>
<p>The remains of Catiline's army, after the death of their leader, continued to make efforts to raise another insurrection. In August, eight months after the battle, a party, under the command of Lucius Sergius, perhaps a relative or freedman of Catiline, still offered resistance to the forces of the government in Etruria. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Reliquiæ conjuratorum, cum L.</foreign> <pb n="77"/><foreign xml:lang="lat">Sergio, tumultuantur in Hetruriâ.</foreign> Fragm. Act. Diurn. The responsibility of watching these marauders was left to the proconsul Metellus Celer. After some petty encounters, in which the insurgents were generally worsted, Sergius, having collected his force at the foot of the Alps, attempted to penetrate into the country of the Allobroges, expecting to find them ready to take up arms; but Metellus, learning his intention, pre-occupied the passes, and then surrounded and destroyed him and his followers.</p>
<p>At Rome, in the mean time, great honors were paid to Cicero. A thanksgiving of thirty days was decreed in his name, an honor which had previously been granted to none but military men, and which was granted to him, to use his own words, because he had delivered the city from fire, the citizens from slaughter, and Italy from war. "If my thanks-giving," he also observes, "be compared with those of others, there will be found this difference, that theirs were granted them for having managed the interests of the republic successfully, but that mine was decreed to me for having preserved the republic from ruin." See Cic. Orat. iii., in Cat., c. 6. Pro, Syllâ, c. 30. In Pison. c. 3. Philipp. xiv., 8. Quintus Catulus, then <foreign xml:lang="lat">princeps senatûs,</foreign> and Marcus Cato styled him, several times, the father of his country.
<cit><quote xml:lang="lat"><l>Roma parentem,</l>
<l>Roma patrem patriæ Ciceronem libera dixit.</l></quote>
<bibl>Juv. Sat., viii. 244,</bibl></cit></p>
<p>Of the inferior conspirators, who did not follow Sergius, and who were apprehended at Rome, or in other parts of Italy, after the death of the leaders in the plot, some were put to death, chiefly on the testimony of Lucius Vettius, one of their number, who turned informer against the rest. But many whom he accused were acquitted; others, supposed to be guilty, were allowed to escape.</p></div>
