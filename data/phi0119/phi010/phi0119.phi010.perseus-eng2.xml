               <milestone unit="paragraph"/>MOSCHUS, a merchant of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, had two twin sons who exactly resembled each other. One of these, whose name was Menaechmus, when a child, accompanied his father to <placeName key="tgn,7004100">Tarentum</placeName>, at which place he was stolen and carried away to <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Epidamnus</placeName>, where in course of time he has married a wealthy wife. Disagreements, however, arising with her, he forms an acquaintance with the Courtesan Erotium, and is in the habit of presenting her with clothes and jewels which he pilfers from his wife. The original name of the other twin-brother was Sosicles, but on the loss of Menaechmus, the latter name has been substituted by their grandfather for Sosicles, in remembrance of the lost child. Menaechmus Sosicles, on growing to manhood, determines to seek his lost brother. Having wandered for six years, lie arrives at <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Epidamnus</placeName>, attended by his servant, Messenio. In consequence of his resemblance to his brother, many curious and laughable mistakes happen between him and the Courtesan Erotium, the wife of Menaechmus of <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Epidamnus</placeName>, the Cook Cylindrus, the Parasite Peniculus, the father-in-law of Menaechmus of <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Epidamnus</placeName>, and lastly Messenio himself. At length, through the agency of the latter, the brothers recognize each other; on which Messenio receives his liberty, and Menaechmus of <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Epidamnus</placeName> resolves to make sale of his possessions and to return to <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, his native place.</l>

   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi010.perseus-eng2" n="5">Now learn the argument, and give your attention; in as few words as possible will I be brief.</l>

   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi010.perseus-eng2" n="7">But in their Comedies the poets do this; they feign that all the business takes place at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> <note resp="editor"> <q rend="double">At <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> </q>: As the majority of the Greek Comic Poets were either natives of, or residents at, <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, they would naturally take that extensive, opulent, and bustling city as the scene of many of their Comedies. In the time of Plautus, Greek was yet the language of the Sicilians. In Cicero’s time the language of the Sicilians was a mixture, partly Greek and partly Latin. Apuleius informs us that in his day they spoke Greek, Latin, and a language peculiar to themselves, called the Sicilian.</note>, in order that it may appear the more Grecian to you.</l>

<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi010.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="17">There was a certain aged man, a merchant at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> <note resp="editor"> <q rend="double">At <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> </q>: <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> was the principal city of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> famed for its commerce and opulence.</note>; to him two sons were born, twins, children so like in appearance that their own foster-mother<note resp="editor"> <q rend="double">Foster-mother</q>: <q rend="double"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Mater</foreign>.</q> Literally, <q rend="double">mother.</q></note>,</l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi010.perseus-eng2" n="20">who gave the breast, was not able to distinguish them, nor even the mother herself who had given them birth; as a person, indeed, informed me who had seen the children; I never saw them, let no one of you fancy so. After the children were now seven years old, the father </l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi010.perseus-eng2" n="25">freighted a large ship with much merchandize. The father put one of the twins on board the ship, and took him away, together with himself, to traffic at <placeName key="tgn,7004100">Tarentum</placeName> <note resp="editor"> <q rend="double">At <placeName key="tgn,7004100">Tarentum</placeName> </q>: <placeName key="tgn,7004100">Tarentum</placeName> was a city of <placeName key="tgn,7007850">Calabria</placeName>, in the south of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. It was said to have been founded by the Lacedaemonians.</note>; the other one he left with his mother at home. By accident, there were games at <placeName key="tgn,7004100">Tarentum</placeName> when he came there: </l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi010.perseus-eng2" n="30">many persons, as generally happens at the games, had met together; the child strayed away there from his father among the people. A certain merchant of <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Epidamnus</placeName> was there; he picked up the child, and carried it away to <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Epidamnus</placeName> <note resp="editor"> <q rend="double">To <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Epidamnus</placeName> </q>: <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Epidamnus</placeName>, or Epidamnum, was a town of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, situate on the Adriatic Sea. It was much resorted to for the purpose of transit to the opposite shores of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. It received its original name from Epidamnus, one of its kings but on falling into the possession of the Romans, they changed its name, as we are informed by Pliny the Elder, into <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrachium</placeName>, from a superstitious notion that when hey were going to <q rend="double">Epidamnum,</q> they were going <q rend="double">to their loss,</q> as <q rend="double"><foreign xml:lang="lat">damnum</foreign></q> is the Latin for <q rend="double">loss</q> or <q rend="double">destruction,</q> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπί</foreign> is the Greek preposition signifying <q rend="double">to.</q> Cicero was banished to this place.</note>. But its father, after he had lost the child, </l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi010.perseus-eng2" n="35">took it heavily to heart, and through grief at it he died a few days after at <placeName key="tgn,7004100">Tarentum</placeName>. Now, after news reached the grandfather of the children at home about this matter, how that one of the children had been stolen,</l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi010.perseus-eng2" n="40">the grandfather changed the name of that other twin. So much did he love that one which had been stolen, that he gave his name to the one that was at home. That you may not mistake hereafter, I tell you then this beforehand; the name of both the twin-brothers is the same. He gave the same name of Menaechmus to this one as the other had; and by the same name the grandfather himself was called. </l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi010.perseus-eng2" n="45">I remember his name the more easily for the reason that I saw him cried with much noise<note resp="editor"> <q rend="double">Cried with much noise</q>: Probably the word <q rend="double"><foreign xml:lang="lat">flagitarier</foreign></q> means that the lost child was cried publicly by the <q rend="double"><foreign xml:lang="lat">praeco</foreign>,</q> or <q rend="double">crier.</q></note>.</l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi010.perseus-eng2" n="49">Now must I speed back on foot to <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Epidamnus</placeName>, </l>

But I have returned to that place whence I set forth, and yet I am standing in the self-same spot.

   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi010.perseus-eng2" n="60">He adopted as his son the child so carried off, and gave him a well-portioned wife, and made him his heir when he himself died.

   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi010.perseus-eng2" n="85">while thus fettered, they either wear away a link with a file, or else with a stone they knock out the nail; ’tis a mere trifle this. He whom you wish to keep securely that he may not run away, with meat and with drink ought he to be chained; do you bind down the mouth of a man to a full table. </l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi010.perseus-eng2" n="90">So long as you give him what to eat and what to drink at his own pleasure in abundance every day, i’ faith he’ll never run away, even if he has committed an offence that’s capital; easily will you secure him so long as you shall bind him with such chains.

But now I’m going directly to Menaechmus; whither for this long time I have been sentenced, thither of my own accord I am going, that he may enchain me. For, by my troth, this man does not nourish persons, but he quite rears and reinvigorates them; no one administers medicine more agreably. </l>

It is rendered doubly famous from the fact that Shakespeare borrowed the plot of his <title>Comedy of Errors</title> from it, through the medium of the old translation of the Play, published in the year 1595, which is in some parts a strict translation, though in others only an abridgment of the original work.
