               <milestone unit="paragraph"/>HEGIO, a wealthy native of Aetolia, had two sons, one of which was stolen by a slave when four years old, and being carried away to Elis, was sold there; the father being unable for many years to learn what has become of him. A war having commenced between the Eleans and the Aetolians, Phiiopolemus, the other son of Hegio, is taken prisoner by the Eleans. The Aetolians having taken many Elean prisoners, Hegio commences to traffic in captives, with the view of thereby redeeming his son from the Eleans, in exchange for some prisoner of rank. A this conjuncture the Play commences. Among the captives whom Hegio has purchased, Philocrates is one, having been taken prisoner, together with his servant, Tyndarus. With the object of deceiving Hegio, Philocrates and Tyndarus change their clothes, and having exchanged names as well, Philocrates pretends to be the servant of Tyndarus. Hegio being desirous to procure the exchange of his son, Philocrates (in the character of the servant of his fellowcaptive) is sent to Elis for that purpose. After his departure, Aristophontes, another captive, accidentally puts Hegio in the way of discovering the manner in which he has been deceived. On this, the old man, losing all hope of obtaining the liberation of his son, sends Tyndarus in chains to the stone-quarries. Shortly after, Philocrates returns, and brings with him Philopolemus, the son of Hegio, and Stalagmus, the runaway slave, that had stolen his other son. It is then discovered that Stalagmus had sold the child to the father of Philocrates, and that he is no other than Tyndarus, the slave; on which, Tyndarus is sent for, and is informed that he is the lost son of Hegio. Stalagmus is then condemned to the chains from which Tyndarus is liberated.</l>

<sp> <speaker>PROLOGUS</speaker> 
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi005.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="1">THESE two captives <stage>pointing to PHILOCRATES and TYNDARUS</stage>, whom you see standing here, are standing here because—they are both<note resp="editor"><emph rend="italic" n="mentioned">Because—they are both</emph>: This is apparently intended as a piece of humour, in catching or baulking the audience. He begins as though he was going to explain why the captives are standing there, and ends his explanation with saying that they are standing because they are not sitting. A similar truism is uttered by Pamphila, in the Stichus, l. 120.</note> standing, and are not sitting. That I am saying this truly, you are my witnesses. The old man, who lives here <stage>pointing to HEGIO’S house</stage>, is Hegio— his father <stage>pointing to TYNDARUS.</stage></l>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi005.perseus-eng2" n="5">But under what circumstances he is the slave of his own father, that I will here explain to you, if you give attention. This old man had two sons; a slave stole one child when four years old, and flying hence, he sold him in Elis<note resp="editor"><emph rend="italic" n="mentioned">In Elis</emph>: Elis, or, as it is called by Plautus, <q rend="double">Alis,</q> was a city of Achaia, in the north-western part of the Peloponnesus. Near it the Olympio games were celebrated</note>,</l>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi005.perseus-eng2" n="10">to the father of this captive  <stage>pointing to PHIILOCRATES.</stage> Now, do you understand this? Very good. I’ faith, that man at a distance<note resp="editor"><emph rend="italic" n="mentioned">That man at a distance</emph>: One of the audience, probably a plebeian who has no seat, but is standing in a remote part of the theatre, is supposed to exclaim in a rude manner that he cannot hear what the actor says. On this the speaker tells him that he had better come nearer; and if he cannot find a seat, there is room for him to walk away. Possibly the verb <q rend="double">ambulo</q> may be intended to signify in this case either <q rend="double">to walk</q> or <q rend="double">to stand,</q> in contradistinction to sitting. Rost, with some reason, suggests <q rend="double">abscedito,</q> <q rend="double">walk out,</q> in place of <q rend="double">accedito,</q> <q rend="double">come nearer.</q></note> there <stage>pointing</stage> says, no. Come nearer then. If there isn’t room for you to sit down, there is for you to walk; since you’d be compelling an actor to bawl like a beggar<note resp="editor"><emph rend="italic" n="mentioned">To bawl like a beggar</emph>: Commentators have differed as to the meaning of this passage. Some think that he means that with the view of pleasing the plebeian part of the audience, he shall not bawl out like a beggar asking alms; while others suppose that the meaning is, that he will not run the risk of cracking his voice, after which he will be hissed off the stage, and so be reduced to beggary.</note>. I’m not going to burst myself for your sake, so don’t you be mistaken.</l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi005.perseus-eng2" n="15">You who are enabled by your means to pay your taxes<note resp="editor"><emph rend="italic" n="mentioned">To pay your taxes</emph>: By this he shows that the party whom he is addressing, is either one of the lowest plebeians or a slave. In the assessment or census, which was made by the Censors, the slaves were not numbered at all, being supposed to have no <q rend="double">caput,</q> or <q rend="double">civil condition.</q> The lowest century were the <q rend="double">proletarii,</q> whose only qualification was the being heads of families, or fathers of children. In addressing those who are reckoned in the census <q rend="double">ope vestrâ,</q> <q rend="double">by your means</q> or <q rend="double">circumstances,</q> he seems to be rebuking the <q rend="double">proletarii,</q> who had no such standing, and who probably formed the most noisy part of the audience. As these paid no part of the taxes with which the theatres were in part supported, of course they would be placed at a greater distance from the stage, and probably were not accommodated with seats. It was just about this period that the elder Scipio assigned different places in the theatres to the various classes of the people.</note>, listen to the rest<note resp="editor"><emph rend="italic" n="mentioned">Listen to the rest</emph>: <q rend="double">Reliquum</q> was a term which either signified generally, <q rend="double">what is left,</q> or money borrowed and still unpaid. He plays upon these different meanings—<q rend="double">Accipite reliquum,</q> which may either signify <q rend="double">hear the rest</q> or <q rend="double">take what is due and owing,</q> and he then makes the observation, parenthetically, <q rend="double">alieno uti nil moror,</q> <q rend="double">I don’t care to be in debt.</q></note>; I care not to be in debt to another. This runaway slave, as I said before, sold his young master, whom, whom he fled, he had carried off, to this one’s father. He, after he bought him, gave him as his own </l>
 <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi005.perseus-eng2" n="20">private slave<note resp="editor"><emph rend="italic" n="mentioned">His own private slave</emph>: <q rend="double">Peculiaris</q> means <q rend="double">for his own private use</q> or <q rend="double">attached to his person;</q> being considered as though bought with his son’s <q rend="double">peculium,</q> or ut of his own private purse. The <q rend="double">peculium</q> was the sum of money which a son in his minority was allowed by his father to be in possession of. The word also signified the savings of the slave.</note> to his son of his, because they were of about the same age. He is now the slave at home of his own father, nor does his father know it. Verily, the Gods do treat us men just like footballs<note resp="editor"><emph rend="italic" n="mentioned">Just like footballs</emph>: <q rend="double">Pilas.</q> Among the ancients, games with the <q rend="double">pila</q> were those played with the <q rend="double">pila trigonalis,</q> so called, probably, from the players standing in a triangle, and those with the <q rend="double">follis,</q> which was a larger ball, inflated with air and struck with the hands, or used for a football. <q rend="double">Paganica</q> was a similar ball, but harder, being stuffed with feathers, and was used by the country-people. <q rend="double">Harpastum</q> was a small ball used by the Greeks, which was scrambled for as soon as it came to the ground, whence it received its name. The Greeks had a proverb similar to this expression, <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεῶν παίγνια ἀνθρωποὶ,</foreign> <q rend="double">men are the playthings of the Gods.</q> So Plato called mankind <foreign xml:lang="grc">θέων ἀθύπματα,</foreign> <q rend="double">the sport of the Gods.</q></note>. You hear the manner now how he lost one son. Afterwards, the Aetolians<note resp="editor"><emph rend="italic" n="mentioned">The Aetolians</emph>: Aetolia was a country of Greece, the southern portion of which was are bounded by the Corinthian Gulf; it was opposite to the Elean territory, from which it was divided by the gulf.</note> are waging war with the people of Elis, </l>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi005.perseus-eng2" n="25">and, as happens in warfare, the other son is taken prisoner. The physician Menarchus buys him there in Elis. On this, this Hegio begins to traffic in Elean captives, if, perchance, he may be able to find one to change for that captive son of his. He knows not that this one who is in his house is his own son.</l>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi005.perseus-eng2" n="30">And as he heard yesterday that an Elean knight of very high rank and very high family was taken prisoner, he has spared no expense to rescue his son<note resp="editor"><emph rend="italic" n="mentioned">To rescue his son</emph>: <q rend="double">Filio dum parceret.</q> Literally, <q rend="double">so long as he might spare his son.</q></note>. In order that he may more easily bring him back home, he buys both of these of the Quaestors<note resp="editor"><emph rend="italic" n="mentioned">Of the Quaestors</emph>: In speaking of these officers, Plautus, as usual, introduces Roman customs into a Play the scene of which is in Greece. It has been previously remarked that the Quaestors had the selling of the spoils taken in war.</note> out of the spoil.</l> 
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi005.perseus-eng2" n="35">Now they, between themselves, have contrived this plan, that, by means of it, the servant may send away hence his master home. And therefore among themselves they change their garments and their names. He, there <stage>pointing</stage>, is called Philocrates; this one <stage>pointing</stage>, Tyndarus; he this day assumes the character of this one, this one of him.</l>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi005.perseus-eng2" n="40">And this one to-day will cleverly carry out this plot, and cause his master to gain his liberty; and by the same means he will save his own brother, and without knowing it, will cause him to return back a free man to his own country to his father. Just as often now, on many occasions, </l>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi005.perseus-eng2" n="45">a person has done more good unknowingly than knowingly. But unconsciously, by their devices, they have so planned and devised their plot, and have so contrived it by their design, that this one is living in servitude with his own father. </l>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi005.perseus-eng2" n="50">And thus now, in ignorance, he is the slave of his own father. What poor creatures are men, when I reflect upon it! This plot will be performed by us—a play for your entertainment. But there is, besides, a thing which, in a few words, I would wish to inform you of. Really, it will be worth your while to give your attention to this play.</l>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi005.perseus-eng2" n="55">’Tis not composed in the hackneyed style, nor yet like other plays, nor are there in it any ribald lines<note resp="editor"><emph rend="italic" n="mentioned">Any ribald lines</emph>: See the address of the Company of actors to the Spectators at the end of the Play.</note> unfit for utterance: here is neither the perjured procurer, nor the artful courtesan, nor yet the braggart captain.

The word ‘invocatus’ means both ‘called upon’ and ‘not called upon.’ Ergasilus here quibbles upon it; for, though at entertainments he attends, as it is the common character of Parasites to do, without invitation, that is ‘not called upon;’ and as mistresses are ‘called upon’ that their names so invoked may make their lovers throw the dice with success; still, according to the double sense of the word, they may be compared to each other, as they are both, according to the Latin idiom, ‘invocati.’</q></note> I am wont to attend at the banquet.

We read in the first Book of Samuel, ch. xxi., ver. 12: <q rend="double">And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish, the King of Gath. And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down on his beard.</q> He probably pretended to be attacked with epileptic fits.

Hegio, to pacify him, and to show off his medical knowledge, tells him that it has proved beneficial in some diseases to be so treated; but he does not go so far as to say what those diseases were. One malady, called <q rend="double">herpes,</q> or <q rend="double">spreading ulcer,</q> was said to be highly contagious, but capable of being cured by applications of saliva. Some Commentators here quote the method which our Saviour adopted in curing the blind man at Bethsaida: <q rend="double">And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town: and when he had spat on his eyes and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw aught.</q> St. Mark, ch. viii., ver. 23. And again, the account given in the ninth chapter of St. John, ver. 6: <q rend="double">When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay.</q> It may be possible that our Saviour thought fit to adopt these forms, in imitation of some of the methods of treating diseases in those times; though, of course, his transcendant power did not require their agency Rost, in his Commentaries on Plautus, has a very learned disquisition on the meaning of the present passage.</note>? </l></sp>

This, however, although the coast of Elis was only about fifteen miles from that of Aetolia, is not at all consistent with probability; and the author has been much censured by some Commentators, especially by Lessing, on acccunt of his negligence. It must, however,be remembered, that Plautus was writing for a Roman audience, the greater part of whom did not know whether Elis was one mile or one hundred from the coast of Aetolia.

He first swears by Apollo, and then by Cora, which may mean either a city of Campania so called, or the Goddess Proserpine, who was called by the Greeks, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κορὴ,</foreign> <q rend="double">the maiden.</q> He then swears by four places in Campania—Praeneste, Signia, Phrysinone, and Alatrium. As the scene is in Greece, Hegio asks him why he swears by these foreign places; to which he gives answer merely because they are as disagreable as the unsavoury dinner of vegetables which he had some time since promised him. This is, probably, merely an excuse for obtruding a slighting remark upon these places, which would meet with a ready response from a Roman audience, as the Campanians had sided with Hannibal against Rome in the second Punic war. They were probably miserable places besides, on which the more refined Romans looked with supreme contempt.</note> </l></sp>
