               <milestone unit="paragraph"/>DEMIPHO, a merchant of <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName>, having ravished Phanostrata, a young woman of <placeName key="tgn,7011104">Sicyon</placeName>, she is brought to bed of a female child. This she gives to her servant Lampadiscus, to be exposed. On this being done, in the sight of Lampadiscus, a Procuress picks up the infant, and afterwards makes a present of it to her friend Melaenis, by whom it is brought up, under the name of Silenium. Alcesimarchus, a young man of <placeName key="tgn,7011104">Sicyon</placeName>, falls violently in love with her, and takes her under his protection. In the meantime, Demipho, who has married another wife, after her death marries Phanostrata, and comes to live at <placeName key="tgn,7011104">Sicyon</placeName>. He and his wife are then anxious, if possible, to regain their lost child. The daughter of Demipho by his first wife is destined by her father to become the wife of Alcesimarchus; on hearing which, Melaenis removes her foster-child from his protection. At this conjuncture Lampadiscus finds out the Procuress that had taken up the infant when exposed, and from her discovers that the child of his mistress is with Melaenis. He informs his mistress of this, while Melaenis is, unknown to them, standing by; upon which she determines to confess the truth, and to restore Silenium to her parents. While she is thinking upon this plan, Alcesimarchus lays hands on Silenium, and carries her off to his father’s house. In the confusion attendant on this, Halisca, the servant of Melaenis, drops a casket in the street, containing some trinkets which had been worn by Silenium at the time when she was exposed. Phanostrata and Lampadiscus find the casket, and on Halisca coming to search for it, they discover where Silenium is. They go into the house, and Phanostrata discovers her long-lost child.</l>

<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi007.perseus-eng2" n="160">He, as he knew that he was deserving of a heavy punishment, at once found shelter with his heels, and made off for <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName>, where he then lived.

Since she did not know the person guilty of this deed, who he was, </l>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi007.perseus-eng2" n="165">she made the servant<note resp="editor"> <q>The servant</q>: Lampadiscus.</note> of her father partaker of her counsels, and gave to that servant the child to be exposed to death.

<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi007.perseus-eng2" n="170">As you have heard her own self confess, she gave this child to the Courtesan Melaenis; and she brought her up as being her own daughter, honestly and virtuously.

<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi007.perseus-eng2" n="175">She departed this life; there she was compliant to her husband.

<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi007.perseus-eng2" n="185">is the servant always assiduously devoting his attention, if he can find out that Courtesan, whom formerly, when he himself exposed her, he from his hidingplace had seen take her up. Now, what remains unpaid, I wish to discharge, that my name may be struck out, so that I mayn’t remain a debtor. </l>
