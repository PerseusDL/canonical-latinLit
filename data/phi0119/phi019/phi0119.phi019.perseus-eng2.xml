 <milestone unit="paragraph"/>THE SUBJECT.
 <milestone unit="paragraph"/>CHARMIDES, a wealthy Athenian, his property having been much duninished by the reckless conduct of his son, goes abroad. His dissolute son, Lesbonicus, being left behind at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, consumes the little resources left him, and then puts up his father’s house for sale. At his departure, Charmides has entrusted his interests and the care of his son and daughter to his friend Callicles and has also informed him that in his house there is a treasure buried as a reserve against future contingencies. In order that this may not be lost, Cailicles buys the house of Lesbonicus for a small sum. Ignorant of his reason for doing so, his fellow-citizens censure him for his conduct, and accuse him of a breach of good faith in ministering to the extravagance of Lesbonicus by supplying him with money. For this reason Megaronides expostulates with his friend Callicles, and greatly censures him; on which, Callicles, in self-defence, entrusts him with the secret of the treasure. Charmides having left behind him a grown-up daughter in the care of Callicles, Lysiteles, a young man of rank and character, falls in love with her, and through his father, Philto, asks her in marriage. Her brother, Lesbonicus, is not averse to the match, but refuses to let her marry without giving her a portion; and he offers her to Lysiteles, on condition that he will receive as her marriage-portion a piece of land near the city, the sole remnant of his fortune. This, however, Lysiteles refuses to accept. In the mean time, Callicles, at the suggestion of Megaronides, determines to give the young woman a dowry out of the treasure buried in the house which he has bought; but that Lesbonicus may not suspect whence the money really comes, a Sharper is hired, with instructions to pretend that he brings letters from Charmides with a thousand gold pieces as a portion for his daughter when she should marry. It happens, that while the Sharper is on his way with his pretended errand to the abode of Callicles, Charmides, having unexpectedly returned to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, is going towards his house. He meets the Sharper, who discloses his errand and attempts to impose upon Charmides, who thereupon discovers himself Charmides then meets his servant Stasimus, who tells him of the purchase of his house by Callicles, whereon he conceives himself to have been betrayed by his friend. Afterwards, on discovering the truth, he praises the fidelity of Callicles, and bestows his daughter on Lysiteles, with a portion of a thousand gold pieces, and, at the intercession of Lysiteles, he forgives his son Lesbonicus, and informs him that he is to be married to the daughter of Callicles.</l>

<stage>Enter LUXURY and POVERTY.<note resp="editor"> <q rend="double">The Prologue</q>: This Prologue is one of the few figurative ones to be found in the Comedies of Plautus. He appropriately represents Luxury as introducing her daughter Poverty to the abode of the dissipated Lesbonicus. Claudian has a somewhat similar passage in his poem to Rufinus: <quote xml:lang="lat"> <l>Et Luxus, populator opum, cui, semper adhaerens,</l> <l>Infelix humili gressu comitatur Egestas.</l> </quote> <q rend="double">And Luxury, the waster of wealth, whom, ever attending, wretched Poverty accompanies with humble step.</q> It has been justly observed, that Plautus here avoids a fault which he often falls into, of acquainting the audience with too much of the plot.</note> </stage>

But this thing is not clear to me, nor has it been enough studied by me, which pursuit of these two I should rather follow for myself; which of the two I should think of the greater stability for passing my life therein:</l>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi019.perseus-eng2" n="230">whether it were preferable for me to devote myself to love or to aggrandisement; in which alternative there is more enjoyment of life in passing one’s days. On this point I am not fully satisfied. But this I think I’ll do, that I may weigh both the points together, I must be both judge and culprit in this trial: </l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi019.perseus-eng2" n="235">I’ll do so—I like it much. First of all, I will enlarge upon the pursuits of love, how they conduce to one’s welfare.

He is a fawning flatterer, a rapacious grappler<note resp="editor"> <q rend="double">A rapacious grappler</q>: — <q rend="double">Harpago</q> means either a <q rend="double">grappling-iron</q> or a <q rend="double">flesh-hook.</q> It was often made in the form of a hand, with the fingers bent inwards. The grappling-iron was used to throw at the enemy’s ship, where it seized the rigging and dragged the vessel within reach, so that it might be easily boarded and destroyed. Cupid is so called here, figuratively, from his insidious approaches, and the difficulty which his victims have in shaking him off</note>, a deceiver, </l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi019.perseus-eng2" n="240">a sweet-tooth, a spoiler, a corrupter of men who court retirement, a pryer into secrets.

   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi019.perseus-eng2" n="245">And then this gudgeon says: <q rend="double">O apple of my eye, be it so: both that shall be given you, and still more, if you wish it to be given.</q> Then does she strike while he is wavering<note resp="editor"> <q rend="double">While he is wavering</q>: Literally, <q rend="double">she strikes him as he hangs.</q> Lindemann seems to think that there is a play upon the word <q rend="double">pendentem,</q> which would apply either to the slave, who, according to the barbarous custom of the Romans, was lashed as he hung from the hook to which he was fastened by the hands, or to the lover who is hesitating between assent and refusal; on which she, by her artfulness—<q rend="double">ferit</q>—<q rend="double">strikes the decisive blow.</q> Terence has the expression <q rend="double">ferior munere,</q> <q rend="double">to strike with a present.</q></note>; and now she begs for more.

They were used both for the purpose of cooling the air and driving away flies and gnats.</note>, sandal-bearers<note resp="editor"> <q rend="double">Sandal-bearers</q>: The sandal was often one of the most costly articles of the female dress, being much adorned with embroidery and gold. Originally it was worn by both sexes and consisted of a wooden sole, fastened with thongs to the foot. In latter times, its use was confined to females, and a piece of leather covered the toes, while thongs, elegantly decorated, were attached to it. From the present passage it appears that it was the duty of a particular slave to take charge of sandals.</note>, singing-girls, casket-keepers<note resp="editor"> <q rend="double">Casket- keepers</q>: The <q rend="double">cistellatrix</q> probably had charge of the jewel casket of her mistress. The present passage shows in what affluence and splendour some of the courtesans lived in those days.</note>, messengers, news-carriers, so many wasters of his bread and substance.

Nor do men wish that he should be called their friend. In a thousand ways is Love to be held a stranger, to be kept at a distance, and to be wholly abstained from. </l>

So common was the practice among the Greeks, that Solon made a very wholesome law which forbade engravers to keep the form of a seal which they had sold. In some rings the seal was cut in the metal itself. The designs engraved on rings were various; sometimes portraits of ancestors or friends, and sometimes subjects connected with the mythology or the worship of the Gods. The onyx was the stone most frequently used in rings. The genuineness of a letter was tested, not by the signature, but by the seal appended to it; hence the anxiety of Callicles on the present occasion.</note>?</l></sp>
