              <milestone unit="paragraph"/>THERE were two cousins, citizens of Carthage; the daughters of one of them named Hanno, were stolen in their childhood, and being carried off to Calydon, were there purchased by Lycus, a Procurer. In the same place there is living Agorastocles, the son of the cousin of Hanno, who, having been stolen in his infancy, was sold to a wealthy old man, and finally adopted by him. Here, without knowing their relationship, Agorastocles falls in love with Adelphasium, the elder of the sisters, while Anthemonides, a military officer, entertains a passion for Anterastylis, the younger sister. The Procurer being at enmity with Agorastocles, the latter, with the assistance of his servant Milphio, devises a plan for outwitting him. Collybiscus, the bailiff of Agorastocles, is dressed up as a foreigner, and, a sum of money being given him for the purpose, pretends to take up his abode in the house of Lycus. On this being effected, by previous arrangement Agorastocles comes with witnesses, and accuses the Procurer of harbouring his slave, and encouraging him to rob his master. At this conjuncture, Hanno arrives at Calydon in search of his daughters. He discovers them, and finds that Agorastocles is the son of his deceased cousin. The play ends with the removal of the damsels from the house of Lycus, who is brought to task for his iniquities; and Adelphasium is promised by her father in marriage to Agorastocles.</l>

<sp><speaker>PROLOGUE</speaker> 
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi015.perseus-eng2" rend="align(indent)" n="1">I HAVE a mind <note resp="editor">Title <q rend="double">The young Carthaginian</q>: Cicero uses the word <q rend="double">Pœnulus,</q> as signifying merely <q rend="double">a Carthaginian.</q> It is difficult to say whether the Play is so styled in reference to Hanno, merely as a citizen of Carthage, or whether the word refers to the young man Agorastocles, in the sense of the <q rend="double">young Carthaginian.</q> From an expression used in the Fifth Act, <q rend="double">a man’s great toe,</q> it would appear that Hanno was represented on the stage as a person of diminutive stature; in consequence of which, it has been suggested that the meaning is <q rend="double">the little Carthaginian.</q> Lipsius thinks that this Prologue was not written by Plautus, and indeed some scholars suspect the whole Play to be spurious.</note> to imitate the Achilles of Aristarchus <note resp="editor"> <q rend="double">Achilles of Aristarchus</q>: Aristarchus was a Tragic Poet, the contemporary of Euripides, and flourished about 250 years before the time of Plautus. His Tragedy of Achilles no longer exists. We are informed by Festus that it was translated into Latin by the Poet Eunius.</note> from that Tragedy I’ll take for myself the opening: <q rend="double">Be silent, and hold your tongues, and give attention.</q> The head-manager it is who bids you listen, </l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi015.perseus-eng2" n="5">that with a good grace they may be seated on the benches, both those who have come hungry and those <emph rend="italic">who have come</emph> well filled. You who have eaten, by far the most wisely have you done: you who have not eaten, do you be filled with the Play. But he who has something ready for him to eat, ’tis <emph rend="italic">really</emph> great folly in him, for our sakes, to come here to sit fasting. </l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi015.perseus-eng2" n="11">Rise up, cryer! bespeak attention among the people: I’m now waiting <emph rend="italic">to see</emph> if you know your duty. Exercise your voice, by means of which you subsist and find your clothes; for unless you do cry out, in your silence starvation will be creeping upon you. </l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi015.perseus-eng2" n="15">Well, now sit down again, that you may earn double wages.

Those who have been sleeping too long at home in idleness, it’s right for them now to stand contentedly, or else let them master their drowsiness. Don’t let slaves be occupying the seats<note resp="editor"> <q rend="double">Occupying the seats</q>: It has been previously remarked that only standing room was provided in the theatres for the slaves.</note>, that there may be room for those who are free; or else let them pay down the money for their places<note resp="editor"> <q rend="double">The money for their places</q>: <q rend="double">Aes pro capite.</q> The meaning of this term, as here used, is not exactly known. Some think that it means, that if the slaves want seats, let them pay down money for their freedom, on which they will be entitled to them. It is not improbable that the phase means, <q rend="double">let them pay money for their seats;</q> and Muretus supposes that the right of letting out certain seats was reserved by the actors as their own perquisite.</note>; if that they cannot do, </l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi015.perseus-eng2" n="25">let them be off home, <emph rend="italic">and</emph> escape a double evil, lest they be variegated both here with scourges, and with thongs at home, if they’ve not got things in due order when their masters come home. Let nurses keep children, baby-bantlings, at home, and let no one bring them to see the Play; </l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi015.perseus-eng2" n="30">lest both they themselves may be athirst<note resp="editor"> <q rend="double">May be athirst</q>: This is not the only place where Plautus refers to the love which the Roman nurses had for the bottle.</note>, and the children may die with hunger; and that they mayn’t be squealing about here, in their hungry fits, just like kids. Let the matrons see the piece in silence, in silence laugh, <emph rend="italic">and</emph> let them refrain from screaming here with their shrill voices; their themes for gossip let them carry off home, </l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi015.perseus-eng2" n="35">so as not to be an annoyance to their husbands both here and at home. And, as regards the managers of the performance, let not the palm <emph rend="italic">of victory</emph> be given to any player wrongfully, nor by reason of favour let any be driven out of doors, in order that the inferior may be preferred to the good ones. </l>
   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi015.perseus-eng2" n="40">And this, too, besides, which I had almost forgotten: while the performance is going on, do you, lacqueys, make an onset on the cookshops; now, while there’s an opportunity, now, while the tarts<note resp="editor"> <q rend="double">While the tarts</q>: <q rend="double">Scriblitae.</q> These were a kind of tarts or cakes which had letters stamped upon them, and were probably so called from <foreign xml:lang="lat">scribo</foreign>, <q rend="double">to write.</q></note> are smoking hot, hasten there.

   <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi015.perseus-eng2" n="50">But, unless it’s troublesome, I wish to give you the name of this Comedy: but if it is an annoyance, I’ll tell you still, since I have leave from those who have the management.

The following is the meaning of them, as given by Plautus in the next eleven lines: <q rend="double">I worship the Gods and Goddesses who preside over this city, that I may have come hither with good omen as to this business of mine, on which I have come; and, <emph rend="italic">ye</emph> Gods, <emph rend="italic">lend</emph> me your aid, that you may permit me to find my daughters and the son of my cousin; <emph rend="italic">those</emph> who were stolen away from me, and his son from my cousin. But here lived formerly my guest Antidamas. They say that he has done that which he was doomed to do. They say that his son Agorastocles lives here. To him am I carrying with me this token of hospitality. He has been pointed as living in this neighbourhood. I’ll make enquiry of these who are coming hither out of doors.</q> The learned Bochart, in his Phaleg, considers that the first ten lines are Punic, and that the other eight are, possibly, Lybic, of which the sense had been previously given in Punic; and, in fact, he quite despaired of translating them. His translation of the first ten very nearly agrees with that given by Plautus himself. Samuel Petit, in his Miscellanea, considers the whole to be Hebrew, and translates his version (which consists of sixteen lines) as follows: 1. Give ear and attend, O Gods and Goddesses, under whose protection are the men of this city. 2. Receive as acceptable my prayers and my integrity. Two daughters did I beget, my strength. 3. Urged on by fate, I caused them on each feast-day of the Gods to go to the gardens. 4. With much rejoicing, and on the day of song, there was a void. 5. The girls, being stolen, forsook me. Whither shall I go, pacing all chambers? 6. Where is he who bore them away? that I may remove the helplessness of my sorrow which he produces for me like fruit, in being the father of, and rearing, children. 7. They have said that here, assuredly, Agorastocles lives. 8. I have a token of hospitality, the likeness of Saturn (I’m carrying it), 9. Between us. May there be some end for my journey, that rest at last may be afforded to my integrity. 10. So that alone and wretched and afflicted I may not wander to and fro but rather that I may meet with my children, and pay my vows and oblations 11. To the Gods and Goddesses whom I’ve invoked as my advisers and assistants, 12. To purify my house from the griefs with which I was affected when I praised them. But they heard not my words, and I am most afflicted and am despondent in mind. 13. O my hope, come hither, and whatever troubles await me, cause me to endure them. Take courage from the truth of oracles, and of the responses of the God <foreign xml:lang="grc">τᾶ</foreign> from divinations, and forewarnings, and prodigies. 14. Be thou speedily fulfilled; arouse thyself and pray. Would that they could hear: grief would depart from a devout parent, and I should recognize Aristocles, my brother’s son. 15. Attentively hear this lamentation, O God, my power, make haste to the truth of thy promise of my exaltation, O God, and my evil odours shall cease. 16. Lo! from henceforth will I to the best of my means show honor, sacrificing spelt to all the Gods, and singing praises!!!</note> vualonuth sicorathi si ma com sith, Chi mach chumyth mumys tyal mictibariim ischi, Lipho canet luth bynuthi ad aedin bynuthii.
