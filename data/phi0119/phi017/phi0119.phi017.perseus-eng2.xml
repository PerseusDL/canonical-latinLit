            <milestone unit="paragraph"/>DAEMONES, an aged Athenian, having lost his property, goes to live in retirement near the sea-shore of <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName>, in the vicinity of the Temple of Venus. It so happens that Labrax, a Procurer, makes purchase of two damsels, Palaestra and Ampelisca, and comes to reside at <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName>. Plesidippus, a young Athenian, sees Palaestra there, and falls in love with her; and making an arrangement with the Procurer, gives him a sum in part payment for her, on which occasion, Labrax invites him to a sacrifice in the Temple of Venus. A Sicilian guest of his, however, named Charmides, persuades him to carry the young women over to <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, where he is sure to make a greater profit by them. On this, the Procurer, accompanied by his guest, sets sail with them. A tempest arises, and they are shipwrecked. The young women escape in a boat, and arriving ashore, are hospitably received by the Priestess of Venus. Labrax and Charmides also escape, and on discovering where the women are, the former attempts to drag them by force from the Temple. On this they are protected by Daemones and Plesidippus, who, through Trachalio, finds out where they are. In the wreck a wallet has been lost, which belongs to Labrax, and in which is a casket enclosing some trinkets belonging to Palaestra. Gripus, a servant of Daemones, draws this up with the rope attached to his net; and by means of these trinkets it is discovered that Palaestra is the daughter of Daemones, whom he had lost in her infancy; on which she is given in marriage to Plesidippus by her father, who becomes reconciled to Labrax.</l>

Pliny mentions it as rising on the 12th, and Columella on the 5th of that month. We may here remark, that the Play is called <q rend="double">the Fisherman’s Rope</q> in consequence of the important part which, towards the close, the rope acts in bringing the wallet to shore in the net. The scenery of this Play must have been much more picturesque than that of those of Plautus in general. At the end of the stage is a prospect of the sea, interspersed with rocks in the distance, while others project upon the front of the stage. The City of <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName> is also seen in the distance; while nearer to the Audience is the Temple of Venus, with an altar in front of it; and adjoining the Temple is the cottage of Daemones. Some other cottages are also seen at a distance. If the comparison may be made, it bears some slight resemblance to the <title>Tempest</title> of Shakspeare.</note> WITH him who sways all nations, seas, and lands, I am a fellow-citizen in the realms of the Gods. I am, as you see<note resp="editor"> <q rend="double">As you see</q>: The actor is supposed here to point to a star placed on his forehead, or on the head-dress which he wears.</note>, a bright and shining star, a Constellation that ever in its season rises</l>

By night, I am glittering in the heavens and amid the Gods, passing among mortals in the day.

<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi017.perseus-eng2" n="10">he disperses us here in various directions among the nations, to observe the actions, manners, piety, and faith of men, just as the means of each avail him.

<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi017.perseus-eng2" n="20">and he fines them in a penalty much greater than the results of the judgment they have gained.

And still these wicked persons entertain a notion of theirs, that they are able to appease Jupiter with gifts, with sacrifice; both their labour and their cost they lose. This, for this reason, is so, </l>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi017.perseus-eng2" n="25">because no petition of the perjured is acceptable to Him. If any person that is supplicating the Deities is pious, he will more easily procure pardon for himself than he that is wicked. Therefore I do advise you this, you who are good and who pass your lives in piety and in virtue—</l>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi017.perseus-eng2" n="30">still persevere, that one day you may rejoice that so you did. Now, the reason for which I’ve come hither, I will disclose to you.

There <stage>(pointing to the cottage)</stage> dwells Daemones, in the country and in a cottage very close adjoining to the sea, </l>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi017.perseus-eng2" n="35">an old gentleman who has come hither in exile from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, no unworthy man. And still, not for his bad deserts has he left his country, but while he was aiding others, meanwhile himself he embarrassed: a property honorably acquired he lost by his kindly ways. Long since, his daughter, then a little child, was lost;</l>

This Procurer, just as befitted him, did not value at one straw his word, or what, on oath, he had said to the young man.

On this he began to persuade the Procurer to go together with himself to <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>; he said that there the men were given to pleasure;</l>
<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi017.perseus-eng2" n="55">that there he might be enabled to become a wealthy man; that there was the greatest profit from courtesans. He prevails.

<l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi017.perseus-eng2" n="65">how that the Procurer had departed. When the young man came to the harbour, their ship had got a great way out to sea. When I beheld how that the maiden was being carried off, I brought at the same instant both relief to her and destruction to the Procurer; the storm I rebuked, and the waves of the sea I aroused. </l>

At this moment the waves are bringing them from the rocks to land, to the cottage of this old man, who is living here in exile, whose roof and tiles the storm has stript off. And this is his servant who is coming out of doors. </l>
 <l xml:base="urn:cts:latinLit:phi0119.phi017.perseus-eng2" n="80">The youth will be here just now, and you shall see him, who purchased the maiden of the Procurer.

Madame Dacier observes, that it was not strange for Sceparnio to mention this, as he might often have seen it represented at <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName> upon the stage. This notion is somewhat far-fetched, as it is not likely that Plautns troubled himself about such a fine point, or that the Audience was gifted with any such nicety of perception as to note his accuracy, even if he had. It has been suggested, and not at all improbably, that Plautus borrowed the Scene of the thunder and lightning in his Amphitryon from this Play of Euripides.</note>; it has so knocked all the tiles from off the roof; more light has it given us, and has added to our windows.</l></sp> </div>

We are not told what becomes of Ampelisca, or of Trachalio, who aspires to the honor of her hand. The sturdy Sceparnio we lose sight of too early; and Daemones loses all claim to our estimation, by inviting such an infamous villain as Labrax to take a place at his table, who certainly, according to the usual rules of dramatic retribution, richly deserves to lose his wallet and its contents.</note> </l></sp> </div></div> </div>
