                                                generally included in any of the books of the
                                                correspondence. To my mind there are indications of
                                                its being a later composition, the exercise of some
                                                one who wished to shew the nature of canvassing at
                                                the time. Still, there are many arguments in favour
                                                of regarding it as the composition of Quintus, and
                                                at any rate it is a contribution to the picture of

                                <p>Although you have all the accomplishments within the reach of
                                        human genius, experience, or acuteness, yet I thought it
                                        only consistent with my affection to set down in writing
                                        what occurred to my mind while thinking, as I do, day and
                                        night on your canvass, not with the expectation that you
                                        would learn anything new from it, but that the
                                        considerations on a subject, which appeared to be
                                        disconnected and without system, might be brought under one
                                        view by a logical arrangement. </p>
                                <p>Consider what the state is : what it is you seek: who you are
                                        that seek it. Almost every day as you go down to the forum
                                        you should say to yourself, "I am a <foreign xml:lang="la"
                                                >novus homo</foreign>," "I am a candidate for the
                                        consulship," "This is Rome." For the "newness" of your name
                                        you will best compensate by the brilliancy of your oratory.
                                        That has ever carried with it very great political
                                        distinction. A man who is held worthy of defending consulars
                                        cannot be thought unworthy of the consulship. Wherefore,
                                        since your reputation in this is your starting-point, since
                                        whatever you are, you are from this, approach each
                                        individual case with the persuasion that on it depends as a
                                        whole your entire reputation. See that those aids to natural
                                        ability, which I know are your special gifts, are ready for
                                        use and always available; and remember what Demetrius wrote
                                        about the hard work and practice of Demosthenes; and,
                                        finally, take care that both the number and rank of your
                                        friends are unmistakable. For you have such as few <foreign
                                                xml:lang="la">novi homines</foreign> have had—all

                                        an obligation. It also seems possible that a "new man" may
                                        be much assisted by the fact that he has the good wishes of
                                        men of high rank, and especially of consulars. It is a point
                                        in your favour that you should be thought worthy of this
                                        position and rank by the very men to whose position and rank
                                        you are wishing to attain. All these men must be canvassed
                                        with care, agents must be sent to them, and they must be
                                        convinced that we have always been at one with the Optimates
                                        in our political sentiments, that we have never been
                                        demagogues in the very least : that if we seem ever to have
                                        said anything in the spirit of that party, we did so with
                                        the view of attracting Cn. Pompeius, that we might have the
                                        man of the greatest influence either actively on our side in
                                        our canvass, or at least not opposed to us. <note n="1"

                                <p>It is also a great set-off to your "newness," that the nobles who
                                        are your competitors are of a such a kind that no one can
                                        venture to say that their nobility ought to stand them in
                                        greater stead than your high character. For instance, who
                                        could think of P. Galba and L. Cassius, though by birth of
                                        the highest rank, as candidates for the consulship? You see,
                                        therefore, that there are men of the noblest families, who
                                        from defect of ability are not your equals. But, you will
                                        say, Catiline and Antonius are formidable. Rather I should
                                        say that a man of energy, industry, unimpeachable character,

                                        word on the importance of what you are trying for. You are
                                        seeking the consulship, an office of which no one thinks you
                                        unworthy, but of which there are many who will be jealous.
                                        For, while by birth of equestrian rank, <note n="2"
                                                anchored="true">Cicero, of course, was now a
                                                senator, but he was the first of his family who had
                                                been so. The others who came forward for the

                                        you are seeking the highest rank in the state, and yet one
                                        which, though the highest, <pb n="371"/> reflects much
                                        greater splendour on a man of courage eloquence and pure
                                        life than on others. Don't suppose that those who have
                                        already held that office are blind to the political position
                                        you will occupy, when once you have obtained the same. I
                                        suspect, however, that those who, though born of consular
                                        families, have not attained the position of their ancestors
                                        will unless they happen to he strongly attached to you feel
                                        'some' jealousy. Even "new men" who have been praetors I
                                        think, unless under great obligations to you, will not like
                                        to be surpassed by you in official rank. Lastly, in the
                                        populace itself, I am sure it will occur to you how many are
                                        envious, how many, from the precedents of recent years, are
                                        averse to "new men." It must also needs be that some are
                                        angry with you in consequence of the causes which you have
                                        pleaded. Nay, carefully consider this also, whether, seeing
                                        that you have devoted yourself with such fervour to the
                                        promotion of Pompey's glory you can suppose certain men to
                                        be your friends on that account. <note n="1" anchored="true"

                                        must positively employ every method and all your vigilance,
                                        labour, and attention to business. <milestone unit="section"

                                <p>Again, the canvass for office resolves itself into an activity of
                                        two kinds, of which one is concerned with the loyalty of
                                        friends, the other with the feelings of the people. The
                                        loyalty of friends must be secured by acts of kindness and
                                        attention by length of time, and by an easy and agreeable
                                        temper. But this word "friends" has a wider application
                                        during a canvass than in other times of our life. For
                                        whosoever gives any sign of an inclination to you, or
                                        habitually visits at your house must be put down in the
                                        category of friends. But yet the most advantageous thing is
                                        to be beloved and pleasant in the eyes of those who are
                                        friends on the more regular grounds of relationship by blood
                                        or marriage, of membership of the same club or of some close
                                        tie or other. Farther, you must take great pains that, in
                                        proportion as a man is most intimate and most closely
                                        connected with your household, he should love you and desire
                                        your highest honour—as, for instance, your tribesmen,
                                        neighbours, clients, and finally your freedmen and even your
                                        slaves for nearly all the talk which forms one's public
                                        reputation emanates from domestic sources. In a word, you
                                        must secure friends of every class : for show—men
                                        conspicuous for their office or name, who, even if they do
                                        not give any actual assistance in canvassing, yet add some
                                        dignity to the candidate; to maintain your just
                                        rights—magistrates, consuls first and then <pb n="372"/>
                                        tribunes to secure the votes of the centuries—men of eminent
                                        popularity. Those who either have gained or hope to gain the
                                        vote of a tribe or century, or any other advantage, through
                                        your influence, take all pains to collect and secure. For
                                        during recent years men of ambition have exerted themselves
                                        with all their might and main to become sure of getting from
                                        their tribesmen what they sought. Do you also do your very
                                        best, by every means in your power, to make such men
                                        attached to you from the bottom of their hearts and with the
                                        most complete devotion. If, indeed, men were as grateful as
                                        they ought to be, all this should be ready to your hand, as
                                        I trust in fact that it is. For within the last two years
                                        you have put under an obligation to you four clubs of men
                                        who have the very greatest influence in promoting an
                                        election, those of C. Fundanius, Q. Gallius, C. Cornelius,

                                        of these men to you, I am acquainted with what their

                                        at the interview. Wherefore you must insist at the present
                                        juncture on exacting from them your due by reminding them,
                                        appealing to them, solemnly assuring them, and taking care
                                        that they thoroughly understand that they will never have
                                        any other opportunity of shewing their gratitude. I cannot
                                        doubt that these men, from hope of your services in the
                                        future as well as from the benefits recently received, will
                                        be roused to active exertions. And speaking generally, since
                                        your candidature is most strongly supported by that class of
                                        friendships which you have gained as a counsel for the
                                        defence, take care that to all those, whom you have placed
                                        under this obligation to you, their duty should in every
                                        case be clearly defined and set forth. And as you have never
                                        been in any matter importunate with them, so be careful that
                                        they understand that you have reserved for this occasion all
                                        that you consider them to owe you. <milestone unit="section"

                                <p>But since men are principally induced to shew goodwill and zeal
                                        at the hustings by three considerations—kindness received,
                                        hope of more, personal affection and good feeling—we must
                                        take notice how best to take advantage of each of these. By
                                        very small favours men are induced to think that they have
                                        sufficient reason for giving support at the poll, and surely
                                        those you have saved (and their number is very large) cannot
                                        fail to understand that, if at this supreme crisis they fail
                                        to do what you <pb n="373"/> wish, they will never have
                                        anyone's confidence. And though this is so, nevertheless
                                        they must be appealed to, and must even be led to think it
                                        possible that they, who have hitherto been under an
                                        obligation to us, may now put us under an obligation to
                                        them. Those, again, who are influenced by hope (a class of
                                        people much more apt to be scrupulously attentive) you must
                                        take care to convince that your assistance is at their
                                        service at any moment, and to make them understand that you
                                        are carefully watching the manner in which they perform the
                                        duties they owe you, and to allow no mistake to exist as to
                                        your clearly perceiving and taking note of, the amount of
                                        support coming from each one of them. The third class which
                                        I mentioned is that of spontaneous and sincere friends, and
                                        this class you will have to make more secure by expressions
                                        of your gratitude; by making your words tally with the
                                        motives which it shall appear to you influenced them in
                                        taking up your cause ; by shewing that the affection is
                                        mutual ; and by suggesting that your friendship with them
                                        may ripen into intimacy and familiar intercourse. In all
                                        these classes alike consider and weigh carefully the amount
                                        of influence each possesses, in order to know both the kind
                                        of attention to pay to each, and what you are to expect and
                                        demand from each. For certain men are popular in their own
                                        neighbourhoods and towns ; there are others possessed of
                                        energy and wealth, who, even if they ,have not heretofore
                                        sought such popularity, can yet easily obtain it at the
                                        moment for the sake of one to whom they owe or wish to do a
                                        favour. Your attention to such classes of men must be such
                                        as to shew them that you clearly understand what is to be
                                        expected from each, that you appreciate what you are
                                        receiving, and remember what you have received. There are,
                                        again, others who either have no influence or are positively
                                        disliked by their tribesmen, and have neither the spirit nor
                                        the ability to exert themselves on the spur of the moment :
                                        be sure you distinguish between such men, that you may, not
                                        be disappointed in your expectation of support by placing
                                        over-much hope on some particular person. <milestone

                                <p>But although you ought to rely on and be fortified by,
                                        friendships already gained and firmly secured, yet in the
                                        course of the canvass itself very numerous and useful
                                        friendships are acquired. For among its annoyances a
                                        candidature has this advantage : you can without loss of
                                        dignity, as you cannot in other affairs of life, admit
                                        whomsoever you choose to your friendship to whom if you were
                                        at any other time to offer your society, you would be
                                        thought guilty of an eccentricity; whereas during a canvass,
                                        if you don't do so with many, and take pains about it
                                        besides, you would be thought to be no use as a candidate at
                                        all. Moreover, I can assure you of this, that there is no
                                        one unless he happens to be bound by some special tie to
                                        some one <pb n="374"/> of your rivals, whom you could not
                                        induce, if you took pains, to earn your affection by his
                                        good services, and to seize the opportunity of putting you
                                        under an obligation—let him but fully understand that you
                                        value him highly, that you really mean what you say, that he
                                        is making a good investment, and that there will accrue from
                                        it not only a brief and electioneering friendship, but a
                                        firm and lasting one. There will be no one, believe me, if
                                        he has anything in him at all, who will let slip this
                                        opportunity offered of establishing a friendship with you,
                                        especially when by good luck you have competitors whose
                                        friendship is one to be neglected or avoided, and who not
                                        only are unable to secure what I am urging you to secure,
                                        but cannot even make the first step towards it. For how
                                        should Antonius make the first step towards attaching people
                                        to himself, when he cannot even call them, unaided, by their
                                        proper names? I, for one, think that there can be no greater
                                        folly than to imagine a man solicitous to serve you whom you
                                        don't know by sight. Extraordinary indeed must be the fame,
                                        the political position and extent of the public services of
                                        that man whom entire strangers, without supporters to back
                                        him, would elect to office. That a man without principle or
                                        energy, without doing any good service, and without ability,
                                        lying under a cloud of discredit, and without friends,
                                        should beat a man fortified with the devotion of a numerous
                                        circle and by the good opinion of all, cannot possibly occur
                                        except from gross negligence. <milestone unit="section"

                                <p>Wherefore see that you have the votes of all the centuries
                                        secured to you by the number and variety of your friends.
                                        The first and most obvious thing is that you should embrace
                                        the Roman senators and knights, and the active and popular
                                        men of all the other orders. There are many city men of good
                                        business habits, there are many freedmen engaged in the
                                        forum who are popular and energetic: these men try with all
                                        your might both personally and by common friends, as far as
                                        you can, to make eager in your behalf; seek them out, send
                                        agents to them, shew them that they are putting you under
                                        the greatest obligation. After that review the entire city,
                                        all colleges, districts, neighbourhoods. If you attach to
                                        yourself the leading men of these, you will by their means
                                        easily keep a hold upon the multitude. When you have done
                                        that, take care to have in your mind a chart of all Italy
                                        laid out according to the tribe of each town, and ]earn it
                                        by heart, so that you may not allow any <foreign
                                                xml:lang="la">municipium</foreign>, colony,
                                        prefecture, or, in a word, any spot in Italy to exist, in
                                        which you have not a sufficient foothold. Inquire also for
                                        and trace out individuals in every region, inform yourself
                                        about them, seek them out, strengthen their resolution,
                                        secure that in their own neighbourhoods they shall canvass
                                        for you, and be as it were candidates in your interest. They
                                        will wish for you as a <pb n="375"/> friend, if they once
                                        see that their friendship is an object with you. Make sure
                                        that they <emph>do</emph> understand this by directing your
                                        speech specially to this point. Men of country towns, or
                                        from the country, think themselves in the position of
                                        friends if we of the city know them by name : if, however,
                                        they think that they are besides securing some protection
                                        for themselves, they do not let slip the opportunity of
                                        being obliging. Of such people others in town, and above all
                                        your rivals, don't so much as know the existence : you know
                                        about them and will easily recognize them, without which
                                        friendship is impossible. Nor is such recognition enough
                                        (though it is a great thing) unless some hope of material
                                        advantage and active friendship follows, for your object is
                                        not to be looked upon as a mere "nomenclator," but as a
                                        sincere friend also. So when you have both got the favour of
                                        these same men in the centuries, who from the means they
                                        have taken to secure their personal objects enjoy most
                                        popularity among their fellow tribesmen; and have made those
                                        all desirous of your success who have influence in any
                                        section of their tribe, owing to considerations attaching to
                                        their municipality or neighbourhood or college, then you may
                                        allow yourself to entertain the highest hopes. </p>
                                <p>Again, the centuries of the knights appear to me capable of being
                                        won over, if you are careful, with considerably more ease.
                                        Let your first care be to acquaint yourself with the knights
                                        ; for they are comparatively few : then make advances to
                                        them, for it is much easier to gain the friendship of young
                                        men at their time of life. Then again, you have on your side
                                        the best of the rising generation, and the most devoted to
                                        learning. Moreover, as the equestrian order is yours, they
                                        will follow the example of that order, if only you take the
                                        trouble to confirm the support of those centuries, not only
                                        by the general good affection of the order, but also by the
                                        friendships of individuals. Finally, the hearty zeal of the
                                        young in canvassing for votes, appearing at various places,
                                        bringing intelligence, and being in attendance on you in
                                        public are surprisingly important as well as creditable.

                                <p>And since I have mentioned "attendance," I may add that you
                                        should be careful to see large companies every day of every
                                        class and order; for from the mere number of these a guess
                                        may well be made as to the amount of support you are likely
                                        to have in the <foreign xml:lang="la">campus</foreign>
                                        itself. Such visitors are of three kinds: one consists of
                                        morning callers who come to your house, a second of those
                                        who escort you to the forum, a third of those who attend you
                                        on your canvass. In the case of the morning callers, who are
                                        less select and, according to the prevailing fashion, come
                                        in greater numbers, you must contrive to make them think
                                        that you value even this slight attention very highly. Let
                                        those who shall come to your house see that you <pb n="376"
                                        /> notice it; shew your gratification to such of their
                                        friends as will repeat it to them ; frequently mention it to
                                        the persons themselves. It often happens that people, when
                                        they visit a number of candidates, and observe that there is
                                        one who above the rest notices these attentions, devote
                                        themselves to him ; leave off visiting the others ; little
                                        by little become devoted to one instead of being neutral,
                                        and from sham turn out real supporters. Furthermore,
                                        carefully remember this, if you have been told or have
                                        discovered that a man who has given you his promise is
                                        "dressing for the occasion," as the phrase goes, make as
                                        though you had neither heard it nor knew it ; if any offers
                                        to clear himself to you, because he thinks himself
                                        suspected, assert roundly that you have never doubted his
                                        sincerity and have no right to doubt it. For the man who
                                        thinks that he is not giving satisfaction can never be a
                                        friend. You ought, however, to know each man's real feeling,
                                        in order to settle how much confidence to place in him. </p>
                                <p>Secondly, of those who escort you to the forum: since this is a
                                        greater attention than a morning call, indicate and make
                                        clear that it is still more gratifying to you, and as far as
                                        it shall lie in your power go down to the forum at fixed
                                        times. The daily escort by its numbers produces a great
                                        impression and confers great personal distinction. The third
                                        class is that of numbers perpetually attending you on your
                                        canvass. See that those who do so spontaneously understand
                                        that you regard yourself as for ever obliged by their
                                        extreme kindness : from those, on the other hand, who owe
                                        you this attention, frankly demand that, as far as their age
                                        and business allow, they should constantly be in personal
                                        attendance, and that those who are unable to accompany you
                                        in person should find relations to take their place in
                                        performing this duty. I am very anxious, and think it
                                        extremely important, that you should always be surrounded by
                                        large numbers. Besides, it confers a great reputation and
                                        great distinction to be accompanied by those who by your
                                        exertions have been defended, preserved, and acquitted in
                                        the law courts. Put this demand fairly before them, that,
                                        since by your means and without any payment some have
                                        retained their property, others their honour, others their
                                        civil existence and entire fortunes, and since there will
                                        never be any other time at which they can shew their
                                        gratitude, they should remunerate you by this service.

                                <p>And since the point now in discussion is entirely a question of
                                        the loyalty of friends, I must not, I think, pass over one
                                        caution. Deception, intrigue, and treachery are everywhere.
                                        This is not the time for a formal disquisition on the
                                        indications by which a true friend may be distinguished from
                                        a false: al that is in place now is to give you a hint. Your
                                        exalted <pb n="377"/> character has compelled many to
                                        pretend to be your friends while really jealous of you.
                                        Wherefore remember the saying of Epicharmus, "the muscle and
                                        bone of wisdom is to believe nothing rashly." Again, when
                                        you have got the feelings of your friends in a sound state,
                                        you must then acquaint yourself with the attitude and
                                        varieties of your detractors and opponents. There are three
                                        : first, those whom you have attacked second, those who
                                        dislike you without definite reason ; third, those who are
                                        warm friends of your competitors. As to those attacked by
                                        you while pleading a friend's cause against them, frankly
                                        excuse yourself; remind them of the ties constraining you;
                                        give them reason to hope that you will act with equal zeal
                                        and loyalty in their cases, if they become your friends. As
                                        for those who dislike you without reason, do your best to
                                        remove that prejudice either by some actual service, or by
                                        holding out hopes of it, or by indicating your kindly
                                        feeling towards them. As for those whose wishes are against
                                        you owing to friendship for your competitors, gratify them
                                        also by the same means as the former, and, if you can get
                                        them to believe it, shew that you are kindly disposed to the
                                        very men who are standing against you. <milestone

                                <p>Having said enough about securing friendships, I must now speak
                                        on another department of a candidate's task, which is
                                        concerned with the conciliation of the people. This demands
                                        a knack of remembering names, insinuating manners, constant
                                        attendance, liberality, the power of setting a report afloat
                                        and creating a hopeful feeling in the state. First of all,
                                        make the faculty you possess of recognizing people
                                        conspicuous, and go on increasing and improving it every
                                        day. I don't think there is anything so popular or so
                                        conciliatory. Next, if nature has denied you some quality,
                                        resolve to assume it, so as to appear to be acting
                                        naturally. Although nature has great force, yet in a
                                        business lasting only a few months it seems probable that
                                        the artificial may be the more effective. For though you are
                                        not lacking in the courtesy which good and polite men should
                                        have, yet there is great need of a flattering manner which,
                                        however faulty and discreditable in other transactions of
                                        life, is yet necessary during a candidateship. For when it
                                        makes a man worse by truckling, it is wrong; but when only
                                        more friendly, it does not deserve so harsh a term ; while
                                        it is absolutely necessary to a candidate, whose face and
                                        expression and style of conversation have to be varied and
                                        accommodated to the feelings and tastes of everyone he
                                        meets. As for "constant attendance," there is no need of
                                        laying down any rule, the phrase speaks for itself. It is,
                                        of course, of very great consequence not to go away
                                        anywhere; but the real advantage of such constant attendance
                                        is not only the being at Rome and in <pb n="378"/> the
                                        forum, but the pushing one's Canvass assiduously, the
                                        addressing oneself again and again to the same persons, the
                                        making it impossible (as far as your power goes) for anyone
                                        to say that he has not been asked by you, and earnestly and
                                        carefully asked. Liberality is, again, of wide application ;
                                        it is shewn in regard to the management of your private
                                        property, which, even if it does not actually reach the
                                        multitude, yet, if spoken of with praise by friends, earns
                                        the favour of the multitude. It may also be displayed in
                                        banquets, which you must take care to attend yourself and to
                                        cause your friends to attend, whether open ones or those
                                        confined to particular tribes. It may, again, be displayed
                                        in giving practical assistance, which I would have you
                                        render available far and wide : and be careful therein to be
                                        accessible to all by day and night, and not only by the
                                        doors of your house, but by your face and countenance, which
                                        is the door of the mind for, if that shews your feelings to
                                        be those of reserve and concealment, it is of little good to
                                        have your house doors open. For men desire not only to have
                                        promises made them, especially in their applications to a
                                        candidate, but to have them made in a liberal and
                                        complimentary manner. Accordingly, it is an easy rule to
                                        make, that you should indicate that whatever you are going
                                        to do you will do with heartiness and pleasure; it is
                                        somewhat more difficult, and rather a concession to the
                                        necessities of the moment than to your inclination, that
                                        when you cannot do a thing you should [either promise] or
                                        put your refusal pleasantly : the latter is the conduct of a
                                        good man, the former of a good candidate. For when a request
                                        is made which we cannot grant with honour or without loss to
                                        ourselves, for instance, if a man were to ask us to appear
                                        in a suit against a friend, a refusal must be given in a
                                        gentlemanly way: you must point out to him that your hands
                                        are tied, must shew that you are exceedingly sorry, must
                                        convince him that you will make up for it in other ways.

                                <p>I have heard a man say about certain orators, to whom he had
                                        offered his case, "that he had been better pleased with the
                                        words of the one who declined, than of the one who
                                        accepted." So true it is that men are more taken by look and
                                        words than by actual services. [This latter course, however,
                                        you will readily approve : the former it is somewhat
                                        difficult to recommend to a Platonist like you, but yet I
                                        will have regard for your present circumstances.] For even
                                        those to whom you are forced by any other tie to refuse your
                                        advocacy may yet quit you mollified and with friendly
                                        feelings. But those to whom you only excuse a refusal by
                                        saying that you are hindered by the affairs of closer
                                        friends, or by cases more important or previously
                                        undertaken, quit you with hostile feelings, and are one and
                                        all disposed to prefer an insincere promise to a direct <pb
                                                n="379"/> negative from you. C. Cotta, a master in
                                        the art of electioneering, used to say that, "so long as the
                                        request was not directly contrary to moral duty, he used to
                                        promise his assistance to all to bestow it on those with
                                        whom he thought it would be most advantageously invested: he
                                        did not refuse anyone, because something often turned up to
                                        prevent the person whom he promised from availing himself of
                                        it, and it often also occurred that he himself was less
                                        engaged than he had thought at the time nor could anyone's
                                        house be full of suitors who only undertook what he saw his
                                        way to perform: by some accident or other the unexpected
                                        often happens, while business, which you have believed to be
                                        actually in hand, from some cause or other does not come
                                        off: moreover, the worst that can happen is that the man to
                                        whom you have made a false promise is angry." This last
                                        risk, supposing you to make the promise, is uncertain, is
                                        prospective, and only affects a few; but, if you refuse, the
                                        offence given is certain, immediate, and more widely
                                        diffused. For many more ask to be allowed to avail
                                        themselves of the help of another than actually do so.
                                        Wherefore it is better that some of them should at times be
                                        angry with you in the forum than all of them perpetually at
                                        your own house : especially as they are more inclined to be
                                        angry with those who refuse, than with a man whom they
                                        perceive to be prevented by so grave a cause as to be
                                        Compatible with the desire to fulfil his promise if he
                                        possibly could. But that I may not appear to have abandoned
                                        my own classification, since the department of a candidate's
                                        work on which I am now dilating is that which refers to the
                                        populace, I insist on this, that all these observations have
                                        reference not so much to the feelings of friends as to
                                        popular rumour. Though there is something in what I say
                                        which comes under the former head—such as answering with
                                        kindness, and giving zealous assistance in the business and
                                        the dangers of friends—yet in this part of my argument I am
                                        speaking of the things which enable you to win over the
                                        populace: for instance, the having your house full of
                                        visitors before daybreak, the securing the affection of many
                                        by giving them hope of your support the contriving that men
                                        should leave you with more friendly feelings than they came,
                                        the filling the ears of as many as possible with the most
                                        telling words. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/></p>
                                <p>For my next theme must be popular report, to which very great
                                        attention must be paid. But what I have said throughout the
                                        foregoing discourse applies also to the diffusion of a
                                        favourable report: the reputation for eloquence; the favour
                                        of the <foreign xml:lang="la">publicani</foreign> and
                                        equestrian order; the goodwill of men of rank; the crowd of
                                        young men; the constant attendance of those whom you have
                                        defended; the number of those from municipal towns who have
                                        notoriously come to Rome on your <pb n="380"/> account the
                                        observations which men make in your favour—that you
                                        recognize them, address them politely, are assiduous and
                                        earnest in canvassing; that they speak and think of you as
                                        kind and liberal; the having your house full of callers long
                                        before daybreak ; the presence of large numbers of every
                                        class ; that your look and speech give satisfaction to all,
                                        your acts and deeds to many; that everything is done which
                                        can be done by hard work, skill, and attention, not to cause
                                        the fame arising from all these displays of feeling to reach
                                        the people, but to bring the people itself to share them.
                                        You have already won the city populace and the affections of
                                        those who control the public meetings by your panegyric of
                                        Pompey, by undertaking the cause of Manilius, by your
                                        defence of Cornelius. <note n="1" anchored="true">Manilius,
                                                tr. p1. B.C. 66, proposed the law for appointing
                                                Pompey to supersede Lucullus in the East. After his
                                                year of office he was accused of <foreign

                                                apparently neither case came on. C. Cornelius, tr.

                                                Cicero. He had become alienated from the senate by
                                                its opposition to his legislation against usury in
                                                the provinces, and the case made a great sensation.
                                        </note> We must not let those advantages be forgotten, which
                                        hitherto no one has had without possessing at the same time
                                        the favour of the great. We must also take care that
                                        everyone knows that Cn. Pompeius is strongly in your favour,
                                        and that it emphatically suits his purpose that you should
                                        win your election. Lastly, take care that your whole
                                        candidature is full of <foreign xml:lang="fr"
                                                >éclat</foreign>, brilliant, splendid, suited to the
                                        popular taste, presenting a spectacle of the utmost dignity
                                        and magnificence. See also, if possible, that some new
                                        scandal is started against your competitors for crime or
                                        looseness of life or corruption, such as is in harmony with
                                        their characters. </p>
                                <p>Above all in this election you must see that the Republic
                                        entertains a good hope and an honourable opinion of you. And
                                        yet you must not enter upon political measures in
                                        senate-house and public meeting while a candidate: you must
                                        hold such things in abeyance, in order that from your
                                        lifelong conduct the senate may judge you likely to be the
                                        supporter of their authority; the Roman knights, along with
                                        the loyalists and wealthy, judge you from your past to be
                                        eager for peace and quiet times; and the people think of you
                                        as not likely to be hostile to their interests from the fact
                                        that in your style of speaking in public meetings, and in
                                        your declared convictions, you have been on the popular
                                        side. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/></p>
                                <p>This is what occurred to me to say on the subject of these two
                                        morning reflexions, which I said you ought to turn over in
                                        your mind every day as you went down to the forum: "I am a
                                                <foreign xml:lang="la">novus homo</foreign>," "I am
                                        a candidate for the consulship." There remains the third,
                                        "This is Rome," a city made up of a <pb n="381"/>
                                        combination of nations, in which many snares, much
                                        deception, many vices enter into every department of life:
                                        in which you have to put up with the arrogant pretensions,
                                        the wrong-headedness, the ill-will, the hauteur, the
                                        disagreeable temper and offensive manners of many. I well
                                        understand that it requires great prudence and skill for a
                                        man, living among social vices of every sort, so many and so
                                        serious, to avoid giving offence, causing scandal, or
                                        falling into traps, and in his single person to adapt
                                        himself to such a vast variety of character, speech, and
                                        feeling. Wherefore, I say again and again, go on
                                        persistently in the path you have begun: put yourself above
                                        rivalry in eloquence; it is by this that people at Rome are
                                        charmed and attracted, as well as deterred from obstructing
                                        a man's career or inflicting an injury upon him. And since
                                        the chief plague spot of our state is that it allows the
                                        prospect of a bribe to blind it to virtue and worth, be sure
                                        that you are fully aware of your own strength, that is,
                                        understand that you are the man capable of producing in the
                                        minds of your rivals the strongest fear of legal proceeding
                                        and legal peril. Let them know that they are watched and
                                        scrutinized by you : they will be in terror of your energy,
                                        as well as of your influence and power of speech, and above
                                        all of the affection of the equestrian order towards you.
                                        But though I wish you to hold out this before them, I do not
                                        wish you to make it appear that you are already meditating
                                        an action, but to use this terror so as to facilitate the
                                        gaining of your object: and, in a word, in this contest
                                        strain every nerve and use every faculty in such a way as to
                                        secure what we seek. I notice that there are no elections so
                                        deeply tainted with corruption, but that some centuries
                                        return men closely connected with them without receiving
                                        money. Therefore, if we are as vigilant as the greatness of
                                        our object demands, and rouse our well-wishers to put forth
                                        all their energies; and if we allot to men of influence and
                                        zeal in our service their several tasks; if we put before
                                        our rivals the threat of legal proceedings ; if we inspire
                                        their agents with fear, and by some means check the
                                        distributors, it is possible to secure either that there
                                        shall be no bribery or that it shall be ineffectual. </p>
                                <p>These are the points that I thought, not that I knew better than
                                        you, but that I could more easily than you—in the pressing
                                        state of your present engagements—collect together and send
                                        you written out. And although they are written in such terms
                                        as not to apply to all candidates for office, but to your
                                        special case and to your particular election, yet I should
                                        be glad if you would tell me of anything that should be
                                        corrected or entirely struck out, or that has been omitted.
                                        For I wish this little essay "on the duties of a candidate"
                                        to be regarded as complete in every respect.</p>
