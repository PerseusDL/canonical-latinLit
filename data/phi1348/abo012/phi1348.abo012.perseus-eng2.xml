						to <placeName key="tgn,7004474">Naples</placeName>.</note> is rendered
					evident by many circumstances. For in the most frequented part of the town,
					there was, not long since, a street named the Octavian; and an altar was to be
					seen, consecrated to one Octavius, who being chosen general in a war with some
					neighbouring people, the enemy making a sudden attack, while he was sacrificing
					to Mars, he immediately snatched the entrails of the victim from off the fire,
					and offered them half raw upon the altar; after which, marching out to battle,
					he returned victorious. This incident gave rise to a law, by which it was
					enacted, that in all future times the entrails should be offered to Mars in the
					same manner; and the rest of the victim be carried to the Octavii.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="2" subtype="chapter">
				<p>This family, as well as several in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, was admitted into the senate by Tarquinius Priscus, and soon
					afterwards placed by Servius Tullius among the patricians; but in process of
					time it transferred itself to the plebeian order, and, after the lapse of a long
					interval, was restored by Julius Caesar to the rank of patricians. The first
					person of the family raised by the suffrages of the people to the magistracy,
					was Caius Rufus. He obtained the quaestorship, and had two sons, Cneius and
					Caius; from whom are descended the two branches of the Octavian family, which
					have had very different fortunes. For Cneius, and his descendants in
					uninterrupted succession, held all the highest offices of the state; whilst
					Caius and his posterity, whether from their circumstances or their choice,
					remained in the equestrian order until the father of Augustus. The
					greatgrandfather of Augustus served as a military tribune in the second Punic
					war in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, under the command of
					/Emilius Pappus. His grandfather contented himself with bearing the public
					offices of his own municipality, and grew old in the tranquil enjoyment of an
					ample patrimony. Such is the account given by different authors. Augustus
					himself, however, tells us nothing more than that he was descended of an
					equestrian family, both ancient and rich, of which his father was the first who
					obtained the rank of senator. Mark Antony upbraidingly tells him that his
					great-grandfather was a freedman of the territory of <placeName key="tgn,6005942">Thurium</placeName>,<note anchored="true">Thorium was a
						territory in Magna Greaca, on the coast, near <placeName key="tgn,7004100">Tarentum</placeName>.</note> and a rope-maker, and his grandfather a
					usurer. This is all the information I have any where met with, respecting the
					ancestors of Augustus, by the father's side.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="3" subtype="chapter">
				<p>His father Caius Octavius was, from his earliest years, a person both of opulence
					and distinction: for which reason I am surprised at those who say that he was a
					money-dealer, <note anchored="true">

						exchanging money, as well as lent his own funds at interest to borrowers. As

					and was employed in scattering bribes, and canvassing for the candidates at
					elections, in the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName>. For
					being bred up in all the affluence of a great estate, he attained with ease to
					honourable posts, and discharged the duties of them with much distinction. After
					his praetorship, he obtained by lot the province of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>; in his way to which he cut off some banditti, the
					relics of the armies of Spartacus and Catiline, who had possessed themselves of
					the territory of <placeName key="tgn,6005942">Thurium</placeName>; having
					received from the senate an extraordinary commission for that purpose. In his
					government of the province, he conducted himself with equal justice and
					resolution; for he defeated the Bessians and Thracians in a great battle, and
					treated the allies of the republic in such a manner, that there are extant
					letters from M. Tullius Cicero, in which he advises and exhorts his brother
					Quintus, who then held the proconsulship of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> with no great reputation, to imitate the example of his
					neighbour Octavius, in gaining the affections of the allies of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</p>

				<p>After quitting <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, before he
					could declare himself a candidate for the consulship, he died suddenly, leaving
					behind him a daughter, the elder Octavia, by Ancharia; and another daughter,
					Octavia the younger, as well as Augustus, by Atia, who was the daughter of
					Marcus Atius Balbus, and Julia, sister to Caius Julius Caesar. Balbus was, by
					the father's side, of a family who were natives of <placeName key="perseus,Aricia">Aricia</placeName>,<note anchored="true">Now Laricia,

					borne the office of praetor, was one of the twenty commissioners appointed by
					the Julian law to divide the land in <placeName key="tgn,7003005">Campania</placeName> among the people. But Mark Antony, treating with
					contempt Augustus's descent even by the mother's side, says that his great
					grand-father was of African descent, and at one time kept a perfumer's shop, and
					at another, a bake-house, in <placeName key="perseus,Aricia">Aricia</placeName>.
					And Cassius of <placeName key="tgn,7004942">Parma</placeName>, in a letter,
					taxes Augustus with being the son not only of a baker, but a usurer. These are
					his words: "Thou art a lump of thy mother's meal, which a money-changer of
					Nerulum taking from the newest bake-house of <placeName key="perseus,Aricia">Aricia</placeName>, kneaded into some shape, with his hands all discoloured

						Gaetani family over the gate. </note> where now stands a chapel dedicated to
					him, and built a little after his death. For, as it is recorded in the
					proceedings of the senate, when Caius Laetorius, a young man of a patrician
					family, in pleading before the senators for a lighter sentence, upon his being
					convicted of adultery, alleged, besides his youth and quality, that he was the
					possessor, and as it were the guardian, of the ground which the Divine Augustus
					first touched upon his coming into the world; and entreated that he might find
					favour, for the sake of that deity, who was in a peculiar manner his; an act of
					the senate was passed, for the consecration of that part of his house in which
					Augustus was born.</p>

			<div type="textpart" n="6" subtype="chapter">
				<p>His nursery is shewn to this day, in a villa belonging to the family, in the
					suburbs of <placeName key="perseus,Velitrae">Velitrae</placeName>; being a very
					small place, and much like a pantry. An opinion prevails in the neighbourhood,
					that he was also born there. Into this place no person presumes to enter, unless
					upon necessity, and with great devotion, from a belief, for a long time
					prevalent, that such as rashly enter it are seized with great horror and
					consternation, which a short while since was confirmed by a remarkable incident.
					For when a new inhabitant of the house had, either by mere chance, or to try the
					truth of the report, taken up his lodging in that apartment, in the course of
					the night, a few hours afterwards, he was thrown out by some sudden violence, he
					knew not how, and was found in a state of stupefaction, with the coverlid of his
					bed, before the door of the chamber.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="7" subtype="chapter">
				<p>While he was yet an infant, the surname of Thurinus was given him, in memory of
					the birth-place of his family, or because, soon after he was born, his father
					Octavius had been successful against the fugitive slaves, in the country near
						<placeName key="tgn,6005942">Thurium</placeName>. That he was surnamed
					Thurinus, I can affirm upon good foundation, for when a boy, I had a small
					bronze statue of him, with that name upon it in iron letters, nearly effaced by
					age, which I presented to the emperor,<note anchored="true">Adrian, to whom
						Suetonius was secretary.</note> by whom it is now revered amongst the other
					tutelary deities in his chamber. He is also often called Thurinus
					contemptuously, by Mark Antony in his letters; to which he makes only this
					reply: "I am surprised that my former name should be made a subject of
					reproach." He afterwards assumed the name of Caius Caesar, and then of Augustus;
					the former in compliance with the will of his great-uncle, and the latter upon a
					motion of Munatius Plancus in the senate. For when some proposed to confer upon
					him the name of Romulus, as being, in a manner, a second founder of the city, it
					was resolved that he should rather be called Augustus, a surname not only new,
					but of more dignity, because places devoted to religion, and those in which
					anything is consecrated by augury, are denominated august, either from the word
						<foreign xml:lang="lat">auctus</foreign>, signifying augmentation, or
						<foreign xml:lang="lat">ab avium gestu, gustuve</foreign>, from the flight
					and feeding of birds; as appears from this verse of Ennius: <quote xml:lang="eng"><l>When glorious <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> by

				<p>He lost his father when he was only four years of age; and, in his twelfth year,
					pronounced a funeral oration in praise of his grand-mother Julia. Four years
					afterwards, having assumed the robe of manhood, he was honoured with several
					military rewards by Caesar in his African triumph, although he took no part in
					the war, on account of his youth. Upon his uncle's expedition to <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> against the sons of Pompey, he was
					followed by his nephew, although he was scarcely recovered from a dangerous
					sickness; and after being shipwrecked at sea, and travelling with very few
					attendants through roads that were infested with the enemy, he at last came up
					with him. This activity gave great satisfaction to his uncle, who soon conceived
					an increasing affection for him, on account of such indications of character.
					After the subjugation of <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, while
					Caesar was meditating an expedition against the Dacians and Parthians, he was
					sent before him to <placeName key="perseus,Apollonia">Apollonia</placeName>,
					where he applied himself to his studies; until receiving intelligence that his
					uncle was murdered, and that he was appointed his heir, he hesitated for some
					time whether he should call to his aid the legions stationed in the
					neighbourhood; but he abandoned the design as rash and premature. However,
					returning to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, he took possession
					of his inheritance, although his mother was apprehensive that such a measure
					might be attended with danger, and his step-father, Marcius Philippus, a man of
					consular-rank, very earnestly dissuaded him from it. From this time, collecting
					together a strong military force, he first held the government in conjunction
					with Mark Antony and Marcus Lepidus, then with Antony only, for nearly twelve
					years, and at last in his own hands during a period of four and forty.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="9" subtype="chapter">
				<p>Having thus given a very short summary of his life, I shall prosecute the several
					parts of it, not in order of time, but arranging his acts into distinct classes,
					for the sake of perspicuity. He was engaged in five civil wars, namely, those of
						<placeName key="tgn,7009565">Modena</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Philippi">Philippi</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7000526">Perugia</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, and
						<placeName key="tgn,7010713">Actium</placeName>: the first and last of which
					were against Antony, and the second against Brutus and Cassius; the third
					against Lucius Antonius, the triumvir's brother, and the fourth against Sextus
					Pompeius, the son of Cneius Pompeius.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="10" subtype="chapter">
				<p>The motive which gave rise to all these wars was the opinion he entertained that
					both his honour and interest were concerned in revenging the murder of his
					uncle, and maintaining the state of affairs he had established. Immediately
					after his return from <placeName key="perseus,Apollonia">Apollonia</placeName>,
					he formed the design of taking forcible and unexpected measures against Brutus
					and Cassius; but they having foreseen the danger and made their escape, he
					resolved to proceed against them by an appeal to the laws in their absence, and
					impeach them for the murder. In the mean time, those whose province it was to
					prepare the sports in honour of Caesar's last victory in the civil war, not
					daring to do it, he undertook it himself. And that he might carry into effect
					his other designs with greater authority, he declared himself a candidate in the
					room of a tribune of the people who happened to die at that time, although he
					was of a patrician family, and had not yet been in the senate. But the consul,
					Mark Antony, from whom he had expected the greatest assistance, opposing him in
					his suit, and even refusing to do him so much as common justice, unless
					gratified with a large bribe, he went over to the party of the nobles, to whom
					he perceived Sylla to be odious, chiefly for endeavouring to drive Decius
					Brutus, whom he besieged in the town of <placeName key="tgn,7009565">Modena</placeName>, out of the province, which had been given him by
					Caesar, and confirmed to him by the senate. At the instigation of persons about
					him, he engaged some ruffians to murder his antagonist; but the plot being
					discovered, and dreading a similar attempt upon himself, he gained over Caesar's
					veteran soldiers, by distributing among them all the money he could collect.
					Being now commissioned by the senate to command the troops he had gathered, with
					the rank of praetor, and in conjunction with Hirtius and Pansa, who had accepted
					the consulship, to carry assistance to Decius Brutus, he put an end to the war
					by two battles in three months. Antony writes, that in the former of these he
					ran away, and in two days afterwards made his appearance without his general's
					cloak and his horse. In the last battle, however, it is certain that he
					performed the part not only of a general, but a soldier; for, in the heat of the
					battle, when the standard-bearer of his legion was severely wounded, he took the
					eagle upon his shoulders, and carried it a long time.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="11" subtype="chapter">
				<p>In this war,<note anchored="true">A. U. C. 711.</note> Hirtius being slain in
					battle, and Pansa dying a short time afterwards of a wound, a report was
					circulated that they both were killed through his means, in order that, when
					Antony fled, the republic having lost its consuls, he might have the victorious
					armies entirely at his own command. The death of Pansa was so fully believed to
					have been caused by undue means, that Glyco, his surgeon, was placed in custody,
					on a suspicion of having poisoned his wound. And to this, Aquilius Niger adds,
					that he killed Hirtius, the other consul. in the confusion of the battle, with
					his own hands.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="12" subtype="chapter">
				<p>But upon intelligence that Antony, after his defeat, had been received by Marcus
					Lepidus, and that the rest of the generals and armies had all declared for the
					senate, he, without any hesitation, deserted from the party of the nobles;
					alleging as an excuse for his conduct, the actions and sayings of several
					amongst them; for some said, "he was a mere boy," and others threw out, "that he
					ought to be promoted to honours, and cut off," to avoid the making any suitable
					acknowledgment either to him or the veteran legions. And the more to testify his
					regret for having before attached himself to the other faction, he fined the
					Nursini in a large sum of money, which they were unable to pay, and then
					expelled them from the town, for having inscribed upon a monument, erected at
					the public charge to their countrymen who were slain in the battle of <placeName key="tgn,7009565">Modena</placeName>, "That they fell in the cause of
					liberty."</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="13" subtype="chapter">
				<p>Having entered into a confederacy with Antony and Lepidus, he brought the war at
						<placeName key="perseus,Philippi">Philippi</placeName> to an end in two
					battles, although he was at that time weak, and suffering from sickness. <note anchored="true">A. U. C. 712. </note> In the first battle he was driven from
					his camp, and with some difficulty made his escape to the wing of the army
					commanded by Antony. And now intoxicated with success, he sent the head of
						Brutus<note anchored="true">After being defeated in the second engagement,
						Brutus retired to a hill, and slew himself in the night.</note> to be cast
					at the foot of Caesar's statue, and treated the most illustrious of the
					prisoners not only with cruelty, but with abusive language; insomuch that he is
					said to have answered one of them who humbly intreated that at least he might
					not remain unburied, "That will be in the power of the birds." Two others,
					father and son, who begged for their lives, he ordered to cast lots which of
					them should live, or settle it between themselves by the sword; and was a
					spectator of both their deaths: for the father offering his life to save his
					son, and being accordingly executed, the son likewise killed himself upon the
					spot. On this account, the rest of the prisoners, and amongst them Marcus
					Favonius, Cato's rival, being led up in fetters, after they had saluted Antony,
					the general, with much respect, reviled Octavius in the foulest language. After
					this victory, dividing between them the offices of the state, Mark Antony<note anchored="true">The triumvir. There were three distinguished brothers of the
						name of Antony; Mark, the consul; Caius, who was praetor; and Lucius, a
						tribune of the people.</note> undertook to restore order in the east, while
					Caesar conducted the veteran soldiers back to <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, and settled them in colonies on lands belonging to the
					municipalities. But he had the misfortune to please neither the soldiers nor the
					owners of the lands; one party complaining of the injustice done them, in being
					violently ejected from their possessions, and the other, that they were not
					rewarded according to their merit.<note anchored="true">Virgil was one of the

			<div type="textpart" n="14" subtype="chapter">
				<p>At this time he obliged Lucius Antony, who, presuming upon his own authority as

						<placeName key="tgn,7000526">Perugia</placeName>, and forced him, by famine,
					to surrender at last, although not without having been exposed to great hazards,
					both before the war and during its continuance. For a common soldier having got
					into the seats of the equestrian order in the theatre, at the public spectacles,
					Caesar ordered him to be removed by an officer; and a rumour being thence spread
					by his enemies, that he had put the man to death by torture, the soldiers
					flocked together so much enraged, that he narrowly escaped with his life. The
					only thing that saved him, was the sudden appearance of the man, safe and sound,
					no violence having been offered him. And whilst he was sacrificing under the

					Pompey betwixt <placeName key="tgn,7003904">Mylae</placeName> and Naulochus;
					although just as the engagement commenced, he suddenly fell into such a profound
					sleep, that his friends were obliged to wake him to give the signal. This, I
					suppose, gave occasion for Antony's reproach: " You were not able to take a
					clear view of the fleet, when drawn up in line of battle, but lay stupidly upon
					your back, gazing at the sky; nor did you get up and let your men see you, until
					Marcus Agrippa had forced the enemies' ships to sheer off." Others imputed to
					him both a saying and an action which were indefensible; for, upon the loss of
					his fleets by storm, he is reported to have said: "I will conquer in spite of
					Neptune;" and at the next Circensian games, he would not suffer the statue of

				<p>After the conclusion of the civil wars, he never, in any of his military

					but as "Soldiers" only. Nor would he suffer them to be otherwise called by his
					sons or step-sons, when they were in command; judging the former epithet to
					convey the idea of a degree of condescension inconsistent with military
					discipline, the maintenance of order, and his own majesty, and that of his
					house. Unless at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, in case of

					yet he kept them together under their own standard, unmixed with soldiers who
					were better born, and armed likewise after different fashion. Military rewards,
					such as trappings, collars, and other decorations of gold and silver, he
					distributed more readily than camp or mural crowns, which were reckoned more
					honourable than the former. These he bestowed sparingly, without partiality, and
					frequently even on common soldiers. He presented M. Agrippa, after the naval
					engagement in the Sicilian war, with a sea-green banner. Those who shared in the
					honours of a triumph, although they had attended him in his expeditions, and
					taken part in his victories, he judged it improper to distinguish by the usual
					rewards for service, because they had a right themselves to grant such rewards
					to whom they pleased. He thought nothing more derogatory to the character of an
					accomplished general than precipitancy and rashness; on which account he had
					frequently in his mouth those proverbs: <quote xml:lang="grc">σπεῦδε</quote>, <gloss>hasten slowly</gloss>; and <quote xml:lang="grc">ἀσφαλὴσ γὰρ ἐστ' ἀμείνων, ἡ θράσυσ στρατηλάτησ</quote>, <gloss>The
						cautious captain's better than the bold.</gloss>. And "That is done fast
					enough, which is done well enough."</p>
				<p>He was wont to say also, that "a battle or a war ought never to be undertaken,
					unless the prospect of gain over balanced the fear of loss. For," said he, "men

					roads, the aqueducts, and the bed of the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>; for the distribution of corn to the people; the
					prefecture of the city; a triumvirate for the election of the senators; and
					another for inspecting the several troops of the equestrian order, as often as
					it was necessary. He revived the office of censor,<note anchored="true">A. U. C.
						312, two magistrates were created, under the name of Censors, whose office,
						at first, was to take an account of the number of the people, and the value
						of their estates. Power was afterwards granted them to inspect the morals of
						the people; and from this period the office became of great importance.
						After Sylla, the election of censors was intermitted for seventeen years.
						Under the emperors, the office of censor was abolished; but the chief
						functions of it were exercised by the emperors themselves, and frequently
						both with caprice and severity.</note> which had been long disused, and
					increased the number of praetors. He likewise required that whenever the
					consulship was conferred on him he should have two colleagues instead of one;
					but his proposal was rejected, all the senators declaring by acclamation that he
					abated his high majesty quite enough in not filling the office alone, and
					consenting to share it with another.</p>

				<p>He was unsparing in the reward of military merit, having granted to above thirty
					generals the honour of the greater triumph; besides which, he took care to have
					triumphal decorations voted by the senate for more than that number. That the
					sons of senators might become early acquainted with the administration of
					affairs, he permitted them, at the age when they took the garb of manhood, <note anchored="true">Young men until they were seventeen years of age, and young
						women until they were married, wore a white robe bordered with purple,
						called <placeName key="tgn,2114627">Toga</placeName> Pratexta. The former,
						when they had completed this period, laid aside the dress of minority, and
						assumed the Toga Virilis, or manly habit. The ceremony of changing the Toga
						was performed with great solemnity before the images of the <placeName key="tgn,1018972">Lares</placeName>, to whom the Bulla was consecrated.
						On this occasion, they went either to the Capitol, or to some temple, to pay
						their devotions to the Gods.</note> to assume also the distinction of the
					senatorian robe, with its broad border, and to be present at the debates in the
					senate-house. When they entered the military service, he not only gave them the
					rank of military tribunes in the legions, but likewise the command of the
					auxiliary horse. And that all might have an opportunity of acquiring military
					experience, he commonly joined two sons of senators in command of each troop of
					horse. He frequently reviewed the troops of the equestrian order, reviving the
					ancient custom of a cavalcade,<note anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Transvectio</foreign>: a procession of the equestrian order, which they
						made with great splendour through the city, every year, on the fifteenth of
						July. They rode on horseback from the temple of Honour, or of <placeName key="tgn,2090583">Mars</placeName>, without the city, to the Capitol,
						with wreaths of olive on their heads, dressed in robes of scarlet, and
						bearing in their hands the military ornaments which they had received from
						their general, as a reward of their valour. The knights rode up to the
						censor, seated on his curule chair in front of the Capitol, and dismounting,
						led their horses in review before him. If any of the knights was corrupt in
						his morals, had diminished his fortune below the legal standard, or even had
						not taken proper care of his horse, the censor ordered him to sell his
						horse, by which he was considered as degraded from the equestrian
						order.</note> which had been long laid aside. But he did not suffer any one
					to be obliged by an accuser to dismount while he passed in review, as had
					formerly been the practice. As for such as were infirm with age, or any way
					deformed, he allowed them to send their horses before them, coming on foot to
					answer to their names, when the muster roll was called over soon afterwards. He
					permitted those who had attained the age of thirty-five years, and desired not
					to keep their horse any longer, to have the privilege of giving it up.</p>

				<p>With the assistance of ten senators, he obliged each of the Roman knights to give

				<p>In the election of tribunes of the people, if there was not a sufficient number
					of senatorian candidates, he nominated others from the equestrian order;
					granting them the liberty, after the expiration of their office, to continue in
					whichsoever of the two orders they pleased. As most of the knights had been much
					reduced in their estates by the civil wars, and therefore durst not sit to see
					the public games in the theatre in the seats allotted to their order, for fear
					of the penalty provided by the law in that case, he enacted, that none were
					liable to it, who had themselves, or whose parents had ever, possessed a
					knight's estate. He took the census of the Roman people street by street: and
					that the people might not be too often taken from their business to receive the
					distribution of corn, it was his intention to deliver tickets three times a year
					for four months respectively; but at their request, he continued the former
					regulation, that they should receive their share monthly. He revived the former
					law of elections, endeavouring, by various penalties, to suppress the practice
					of bribery. Upon the day of election, he distributed to the freedmen of the
					Fabian and Scaptian tribes, in which he himself was enrolled, a thousand
					sesterces each, that they might, look for nothing from any of the candidates.
					Considering it of extreme importance to preserve the Roman people pure, and
					untainted with a mixture of foreign or servile blood, he not only bestowed the
					freedom of the city with a sparing hand, but laid some restriction upon the
					practice of manumitting slaves. When Tiberius interceded with him for the
					freedom of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> in behalf of a Greek
					client of his, he wrote to him for answer, "I shall not grant it, unless he
					comes himself, and satisfies me that he has just grounds for the application."
					And when <placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName> begged the freedom of
					the city for a tributary <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, he
					refused it, but offered to release him from payment of taxes, saying, " I shall
					sooner suffer some loss in my exchequer, than that the citizenship of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> be rendered too common." Not content with
					interposing many obstacles to either the partial or complete emancipation of
					slaves, by quibbles respecting the number, condition and difference of those who
					were to be manumitted; he likewise enacted that none who had been put in chains
					or tortured, should ever obtain the freedom of the city in any degree. He
					endeavoured also to restore the old habit and dress of the Romans; and upon
					seeing once, in an assembly of the people, a crowd in grey cloaks,<note anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Pullatorum</foreign>; dusky, either
						from their dark colour, or their being soiled. The toga was white, and was
						the distinguishing costume of the sovereign people of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, without which, they were not to
						appear in public; as members of a university are forbidden to do so, without

				<p>He displayed his munificence to all ranks of the people on various occasions.
					Moreover, upon his bringing the treasure belonging to the kings of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> into the city, in his Alexandrian
					triumph, he made money so plentiful, that interest fell, and the price of land
					rose considerably. And afterwards, as often as large sums of money came into his
					possession by means of confiscations, he would lend it free of interest, for a
					fixed term, to such as could give security for the double of what was borrowed.
					The estate necessary to qualify a senator, instead of eight hundred thousand
					sesterces, the former standard, he ordered, for the future, to be twelve hundred
					thousand; and to those who had not so much, he made good the deficiency. He
					often made donations to the people, but generally of different sums; sometimes
					four hundred, sometimes three hundred, or two hundred and fifty sesterces: upon
					which occasions, he extended his bounty even to young boys, who before were not
					used to receive anything, until they arrived at eleven years of age. In a

					none at all; and doubled the number of the money tickets.</p>

				<p>But to show that he was a prince who regarded more the good of his people than
					their applause, he reprimanded them very severely, upon their complaining of the
					scarcity and dearness of wine. "My son-in-law, Agrippa," he said, "has
					sufficiently provided for quenching your thirst, by the great plenty of water
					with which he has supplied the town." Upon their demanding a gift which he had
					promised them, he said, "I am a man of my word." But upon their importuning him
					for one which he had not promised, he issued a proclamation upbraiding them for
					their scandalous impudence; at the same time telling them, "I shall now give you
					nothing, whatever I may have intended to do." With the same strict firmness,
					when, upon a promise he had made of a donative, he found many slaves had been
					emancipated and enrolled amongst the citizens, he declared that no one should
					receive anything who was not included in the promise, and he gave the rest less
					than he had promised them, in order that the amount he had set apart might hold
					out. On one occasion, in a season of great scarcity, which it was difficult to
					remedy, he ordered out of the city the troops of slaves brought for sale, the
					gladiators belonging to the masters of defence, and all foreigners, excepting
					physicians and the teachers of the liberal sciences. Part of the domestic slaves
					were likewise ordered to be dismissed. When, at last, plenty was restored, he
					writes thus: "I was much inclined to abolish for ever the practice of allowing
					the people corn at the public expense, because they trust so much to it, that
					they are too lazy to till their lands; but I did not persevere in my design, as
					I felt sure that the practice would some time or other be revived by some one
					ambitious of popular favour." However, he so managed the affair ever afterwards,
					that as much account was taken of husbandmen and traders, as of the idle
						populace.<note anchored="true">It is hardly necessary to direct the careful

				<p>In the number, variety, and magnificence of his public spectacles, he surpassed
					all former example. Four and-twenty times, he says, he treated the people with
					games upon his own account, and three-and-twenty times for such magistrates as
					were either absent, or not able to afford the expense. The performances took
					place sometimes in the different streets of the city, and upon several stages,
					by players in all languages. The same he did not only in the forum and
					amphitheatre, but in the circus likewise, and in the septa: <note anchored="true">
						<foreign xml:lang="lat">Septa</foreign> were enclosures made with boards,
						commonly for the purpose of distributing the people into distinct classes,
						and erected occasionally, like our hustings. </note> and sometimes he
					exhibited only the hunting of wild beasts. He entertained the people with
					wrestlers in the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName>, where
					wooden seats were erected for the purpose; and also with a naval fight, for
					which he excavated the ground near the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>, where there is now the grove of the Caesars. During
					these two entertainments he stationed guards in the city lest, by robbers taking
					advantage of the small number of people left at home, it might be exposed to
					depredations. In the circus he exhibited chariot and foot races, and combats
					with wild beasts, in which the performers were often youths of the highest rank.
					His favorite spectacle was the Trojan game, acted by a select number of boys, in
					parties differing in age and station; thinking that it was a practice both
					excellent in itself, and sanctioned by ancient usage, that the spirit of the
					young nobles should be displayed in such exercises. Caius Nonius Asprenas, who
					was lamed by a fall in this diversion, he presented with a gold collar, and
					allowed him and his posterity to bear the surname of Torquati. But soon
					afterwards he gave up the exhibition of this game, in consequence of a severe
					and bitter speech made in the senate by Asinius Pollio, the orator, in which he
					complained bitterly of the misfortune of /Eserninus, his grandson, who likewise
					broke his leg in the same diversion.</p>
				<p>Sometimes he engaged Roman knights to act upon the stage, or to fight as
					gladiators; but only before the practice was prohibited by a decree of the
					senate, Thenceforth, the only exhibition he made of that kind, was that of a
					young man named Lucius, of a good family, who was not quite two feet in height,
					and weighed only seventeen pounds, but had a stentorian voice. In one of his
					public spectacles, he brought the hostages of the Parthians, the first ever sent
					to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> from that nation, through the
					middle of the amphitheatre, and placed them in the second tier of seats above
					him. He used likewise, at times when there were no public entertainments, if any
					thing was brought to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> which was
					uncommon, and might gratify curiosity, to expose it to public view, in any place
					whatever; as he did a rhinoceros in the Septa, a tiger upon a stage, and a snake
					fifty cubits long in the Comitium. It happened in the Circensian games, which he
					performed in consequence of a vow, that he was taken ill, and obliged to attend
					the Thensae, <note anchored="true">The <foreign xml:lang="lat">Thensa</foreign>
						was a splendid carriage with four wheels, and four horses, adorned with
						ivory and silver, in which, at the Circensian games, the images of the gods
						were drawn in solemn procession from their shrines, to a place in the
						circus, called the <foreign xml:lang="lat">Pulvinar</foreign>, where couches
						were prepared for their reception. It received its name from thongs
							(<foreign xml:lang="lat">lora tensa</foreign>) stretched before it; and
						was attended in the procession by persons of the first rank, in their most
						magnificent apparel. The attendants took delight in putting their hands to
						the traces: and if a boy happened to let go the thong which he held, it was
						an indispensable rule that the procession should be renewed. </note>
					reclining on a litter. Another time, in the games celebrated for the opening of
					the theatre of Marcellus, the joints of his curule chair happening to give way,
					he fell on his back. And in the games exhibited by his grandsons, when the
					people were in such consternation, by an alarm raised that the theatre was
					falling, that all his efforts to re-assure them and keep them quiet, failed, he
					moved from his place, and seated himself in that part of the theatre which was
					thought to be exposed to most danger.</p>

			<div type="textpart" n="44" subtype="chapter">
				<p>He corrected the confusion and disorder with which the spectators took their
					seats at the public games, after an affront which was offered to a senator at
						<placeName key="perseus,Puteoli">Puteoli</placeName>, for whom, in a crowded
					theatre, no one would make room. He therefore procured a decree of the senate,
					that in all public spectacles of any sort, and in any place whatever, the first

					not even permit the ambassadors of free nations, nor of those which were allies
					of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, to sit in the orchestra;
					having found that some manumitted slaves had been sent under that character. He
					separated the soldiery from the rest of the people, and assigned to married
					plebeians their particular rows of seats. To the boys he assigned their own
					benches, and to their tutors the seats which were nearest it; ordering that none
					clothed in black should sit in the centre of the circle.<note anchored="true">The <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cavea</foreign> was the name of the whole of
						that part of the theatre where the spectators sat. The foremost rows were
						called <foreign xml:lang="lat">cavea prima</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="lat">ima</foreign>; the last, <foreign xml:lang="lat">cavea

					allow any women to witness the combats of the gladiators, except from the upper
					part of the theatre, although they formerly used to take their places
					promiscuously with the rest of the spectators. To the vestal virgins he granted
					seats in the theatre, reserved for them only, opposite the praetor's bench. He
					excluded however, the whole female sex from seeing the wrestlers: so that in the
					games which he exhibited upon his accession to the office of high-priest, he
					deferred producing a pair of combatants which the people called for, until the
					next morning; and intimated by proclamation, "his pleasure that no woman should
					appear in the theatre before five o'clock."</p>

				<p>He generally viewed the Circensian games himself from the upper rooms of the
					houses of his friends or freedmen; sometimes from the place appointed for the
					statues of the gods, and sitting in company with his wife and children. He
					occasionally absented himself from the spectacles for several hours, and
					sometimes for whole days; but not without first making an apology, and
					appointing substitutes to preside in his stead. When present, he never attended
					to anything else; either to avoid the reflections which he used to say were
					commonly made upon his father, Caesar, for perusing letters and memorials, and
					making rescripts during the spectacles; or from the real pleasure he took in
					attending those exhibitions; of which he made no secret, he often candidly
					owning it This he manifested frequently by presenting honorary crowns and
					handsome rewards to the best performers, in the games exhibited by others; and
					he never was present at any performance of the Greeks, without rewarding the
					most deserving, according to their merit. He took particular pleasure in
					witnessing pugilistic contests, especially those of the Latins, not only between
					combatants who had been trained scientifically, whom he used often to match with
					the Greek champions; but even between mobs of the lower classes fighting in
					streets, and tilting at random, without any knowledge of the art In short, he
					honoured with his patronage all sorts of people who contributed in any way to
					the success of the public entertainments. He not only maintained, but enlarged,
					the privileges of the wrestlers. He prohibited combats of gladiators where no
					quarter was given. He deprived the magistrates of the power of correcting the
					stage-players, which by an ancient law was allowed them at all times, and in all
					places; restricting their jurisdiction entirely to the time of performance and
					misdemeanours in the theatres. He would, however, admit of no abatement, and
					exacted with the utmost rigour the greatest exertions of the wrestlers and
					gladiators in their several encounters. He went so far in restraining the
					licentiousness of stageplayers, that upon discovering that Stephanio, a
					performer of the highest class, had a married woman with her hair cropped, and
					dressed in boy's clothes, to wait upon him at table, he ordered him to be
					whipped through all the three theatres, and then banished him. Hylas, an actor
					of pantomimes, upon a complaint against him by the praetor, he commanded to be
					scourged in the court of his own house, which, however, was open to the public.
					And Pylades he not only banished from the city, but from <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> also, for pointing with his finger at a
					spectator by whom he was hissed, and turning the eyes of the audience upon
					him.</p>

					than twenty-eight colonies,<note anchored="true">A.U.C. 726</note> and greatly
					improved it by public works, and a beneficial application of the revenues. In
					rights and privileges, he rendered it in a measure equal to the city itself, by
					inventing a new kind of suffrage, which the principal officers and magistrates
					of the colonies might take at home, and forward under seal to the city, against
					the time of the elections. To increase the number of persons of condition, and
					of children among the lower ranks, he granted the petitions of all those who
					requested the honour of doing military service on horseback as knights, provided
					their demands were seconded by the recommendation of the town in which they
					lived; and when he visited the several districts of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, he distributed a thousand sesterces a head to such of

					might not be tempted by age or necessities to join the agitators for a
					revolution. For the purpose of providing a fund always ready to meet their pay

					that object. In order to obtain the earliest intelligence of what was passing in
					the provinces, he established posts, consisting at first of young men stationed
					at moderate distances along the military roads, and afterwards of regular
					couriers with fast vehicles; which appeared to him the most commodious, because

				<p>Of his clemency and moderation there are abundant and signal instances. For, not

					were both plebeians, one of them with a fine, and the other with an easy
					banishment; although the former had published, in the name of young Agrippa, a
					very scurrilous letter against him, and the other declared openly, at an
					entertainment where there was a great deal of company, " that he neither wanted

					that I have a tongue too, and shall speak sharper of him than he ever did of
					me." Nor did he, either then or afterwards, make any farther inquiry into the

					earnestness, he returned him an answer in the following terms: "Do not, my dear

					gracious lord," and the whole company, with joyful acclamations, testified their
					approbation of them, as applied to him, he instantly put a stop to their
					indecent flattery, by waving his hand, and frowning sternly, and next day
					publicly declared his displeasure, in a proclamation. He never afterwards would
					suffer himself to be addressed in that manner, even by his own children or
					grand-children, either in jest or earnest, and forbad them the use of all such
					complimentary expressions to one another. He rarely entered any city or town, or
					departed from it, except in the evening or the night, to avoid giving any person
					the trouble of complimenting him. During his consulships, he commonly walked the
					streets on foot; but at other times, rode in a close carriage. He admitted to
					court even plebeians, in common with people of the higher ranks: receiving the
					petitions of those who approached him with so much affability, that he once
					jocosely rebuked a man, by telling him, "You present your memorial with as much
					hesitation as if you were offering money to an elephant." On senate days, he
					used to pay his respects to the Conscript Fathers only in the house, addressing
					them each by name as they sat, without any prompter; and on his departure, he
					bade each of them farewell, while they retained their seats. In the same manner,
					he maintained with many of them a constant intercourse of mutual civilities,
					giving them his company upon occasions of any particular festivity in their
					families; until he became advanced in years, and was incommoded by the crowd at
					a wedding. Being informed that Gallus Terrinius, a senator, with whom he had
					only a slight acquaintance, had suddenly lost his sight, and under that
					privation had resolved to starve himself to death, he paid him a visit, and by
					his consolatory admonitions diverted him from his purpose.</p>

			<div type="textpart" n="54" subtype="chapter">
				<p>On his speaking in the senate, he has been told by one of the members, "I did not
					understand you," and by another, "I would contradict you, could I do it with
					safety." And sometimes, upon his being so much offended at the heat with which
					the debates were conducted in the senate, as to quit the house in anger, some of
					the mem- bers have repeatedly exclaimed: "Surely, the senators ought to have
					liberty of speech on matters of govern- ment." Antistius Labeo, in the election
					of a new senate, when each, as he was named, chose another, nominated Marcus
					Lepidus, who had formerly been Augustus's ene- my, and was then in banishment;
					and being asked by the latter, "Is there no other person more deserving?" he
					replied, "Every man has his own opinion." Nor was any one ever molested for his
					freedom of speech, although it was carried to the extent of insolence.</p>

			<div type="textpart" n="55" subtype="chapter">
				<p>Even when some infamous libels against him were dispersed in the senate-house, he
					was neither disturbed, nor did he give himself much trouble to refute them. He

					borrowed name, against any person, should be called to account.</p>

				<p>Being provoked by some petulant jests, which were designed to render him odious,
					he answered them by a proclamation; and yet he prevented the senate from passing
					an act, to restrain the liberties which were taken with others in people's
					wills. Whenever he attended at the election of magistrates, he went round the
					tribes, with the candidates of his nomination, and begged the votes of the
					people in the usual manner. He likewise gave his own vote in his tribe, as one
					of the people. He suffered himself to be summoned as a witness upon trials, and
					not only to be questioned, but to be cross-examined, with the utmost patience.
					In building his Forum, he restricted himself in the site, not presuming to
					compel the owners of the neighbouring houses to give up their property. He never
					recommended his sons to the people, without adding these words. "If they deserve
					it." And upon the audience rising on their entering the theatre, while they were
					yet minors, and giving them applause in a standing position, he made it a matter
					of serious complaint.</p>
				<p>He was desirous that his friends should be great and powerful in the state, but
					have no exclusive privileges, or be exempt from the laws which governed others.
					When Asprenas Nonius, an intimate friend of his, was tried upon a charge of
					administering poison at the instance of Cassius Severus, he consulted the senate
					for their opinion what was his duty under the circumstances; "For," said he, "I
					am afraid lest, if I should stand by him in the cause, I may be supposed to
					screen a guilty man; and if I do not, to desert and prejudge a friend." With the
					unanimous concurrence, therefore, of the senate, he took his seat amongst his
					advocates for several hours, but without giving him the benefit of speaking to
					character, as was usual. He likewise appeared for his clients; as on behalf of
					Scutarius, an old soldier of his, who brought an action for slander. He never
					relieved any one from prosecution but in a single instance, in the case of a man
					who had given information of the conspiracy of Muraena; and that he did only by
					prevailing upon the accuser, in open court, to drop his prosecution.</p>

			<div type="textpart" n="57" subtype="chapter">
				<p>How much he was beloved for his worthy conduct in all these respects, it is easy
					to imagine. I say nothing of the decrees of the senate in his honour, which may
					seem to have resulted from compulsion or deference. The Roman knights
					voluntarily, and with one accord, always celebrated his birth for two days
					together; and all ranks of the people yearly, in performance of a vow they had
					made, threw a piece of money into the Curtian lake, <note anchored="true">An
						inclosure in the middle of the Forum, marking the spot where Curtius leapt

					for his welfare. They likewise, on the calends [first] of January, presented for
					his acceptance new-year's gifts in the capitol, though he was not present: with
					which donations he purchased some costly images of the Gods, which he erected in
					several streets of the city: as that of Apollo Sandaliarius, Jupiter Tragoedus,
						<note anchored="true">Sandalarium, Tragrxdum; names of streets, in which
						temples of these gods stood; as we now say St. Peter, <placeName key="tgn,1050542">Cornhill</placeName>, etc. </note> and others. When
					his house on the <placeName key="tgn,3000935">Palatine</placeName> hill was
					accidentally destroyed by fire, the veteran soldiers, the judges, the tribes,
					and even the people, individually, contributed, according to the ability of
					each, for rebuilding it; but he would accept only of some small portion out of
					the several sums collected, and refused to take from any one person more than a
					single denarius. Upon his return home from any of the provinces, they attended
					him not only with joyful acclamations, but with songs. It is also remarked, that

					" With hearty wishes for the happiness and prosperity of yourself and family,
					Caesar Augustus, (for we think we thus most effectually pray for the lasting
					welfare of the state), the senate, in agreement with the Roman people, salute
					you by the title of FATHER OF YOUR COUNTRY." To this compliment Augustus
					replied, with tears in his eyes, in these words (for I give them exactly as I

					Conscript Fathers, what else have I to beg of the Immortal Gods, but the

					from all converse with strangers, that he once wrote a letter to Lucius

					not behaved very modestly, in making a visit to my daughter at <placeName key="tgn,7004516">Baiae</placeName>." He usually instructed his grandsons

					them by the quaestor, not having the heart to be present himself; indeed, he was
					so much ashamed of her infamous conduct, that for some time he avoided all
					company, and had thoughts of putting her to death. It is certain that when one
					Phoebe, a freed-woman and confidant of hers, hanged herself about the same time,
					he said, "I had rather be the father of Phoebe than of Julia." In her banishment
					he would not allow her the use of wine, nor any luxury in dress; nor would he
					suffer her to be waited upon by any male servant, either freeman or slave,
					without his permission, and having received an exact account of his age,

				<p>He was cautious in forming friendships, but clung to them with great constancy;
					not only rewarding the virtues and merits of his friends according to their

					were of a venial kind, For amongst all his friends, we scarcely find any who
					fell into disgrace with him, except Salvidienus Rufus, whom he raised to the
					consulship, and Cornelius Gallus, whom he made prefect in <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>; both of them men of the lowest
					extraction. One of these, being engaged in plotting a rebellion, he delivered
					over to the senate, for condemnation; and the other, on account of his
					ungrateful and malicious temper, he forbad his house, and his living in any of
					the provinces. When, however, Gallus, being denounced by his accusers, and
					sentenced by the senate, was driven to the desperate extremity of laying violent
					hands upon himself, he commended, indeed, the attachment to his person of those
					who manifested so much indignation, but he shed tears, and lamented his unhappy
					condition, "That I alone," said he, " cannot be allowed to resent the misconduct
					of my friends in such a way only as I would wish." The rest of his friends of
					all orders flourished during their whole lives, both in power and wealth, in the

					coveting their property, and indeed would never accept of any legacy left him by
					a stranger, yet he pondered in a melancholy mood over their last words; not
					being able to conceal his chagrin, if in their wills they made but a slight, or
					no very honourable mention of him, nor his joy, on the other hand, if they
					expressed a grateful sense of his favours, and a hearty affection for him. And
					whatever legacies or shares of their property were left for him by such as were
					parents, he used to restore to their children, either immediately, or if they
					were under age, upon the day of their assuming the manly dress, or of their
					marriage; with interest.</p>

				<p>As a patron and master, his behaviour in general was mild and conciliating; but

					when his slave, Cosmus, had reflected bitterly upon him, he resented the injury
					no further than by putting him in fetters. When his steward, Diomedes, left him
					to the mercy of a wild boar, which suddenly attacked them while they were
					talking together, he considered it rather a cowardice than a breach of duty; and
					turned an occurrence of no small hazard into a jest, because there was no

					favourite freedmen, for maintaining a criminal commerce with other men's wives.

					denarii to discover the contents of one of his letters. And the tutor and other

				<p>With respect to the charge or imputation of loathsome impurity before-mentioned,

					the royal treasures but a porcelain cup, and soon afterwards melted down all the

					propensities never left him, and, as he grew older, as is reported, he was in

					quarters, even by his own wife. To the observations on his gaming, he paid not
					the smallest regard; but played in public, but purely for his diversion, even
					when he was advanced in years; and not only in the month of December, <note anchored="true">See c. xxxii. and note.</note> but at other times, and upon
					all days, whether festivals or not. This evidently appears from a letter under
					his own hand, in which he says, "I supped, my dear Tiberius, with the same

					sesterces for my part; but then I was profusely generous in my play, as I
					commonly am; for had I insisted upon the stakes which I declined, or kept what I
					gave away, I should have won about fifty thousand. But this I like better: for
					it will raise my character for generosity to the skies." In a letter to his
					daughter, he writes thus . "I have sent you two hundred and fifty denarii, which

				<p>His frugality in the furniture of his house appears even at this day, from some
					beds and tables still remaining, most of which are scarcely elegant enough for a
					private family. It is reported that he never lay upon a bed, but such as was
					low, and meanly furnished. He seldom wore any garment but what was made by the
					hands of his wife, sister, daughter, and grand-daughters. His togas <note anchored="true">The <placeName key="tgn,2114627">Toga</placeName> was a
						loose woollen robe, which covered the whole body, close at the bottom, but

						up, and thrown back over the left shoulder; forming what is called the
						Sinus, a fold or cavity upon the breast, in which things might be carried,
						and with which the face or head might be occasionally covered. When a person
						did any work, he tucked up his toga, and girt it round him. The toga of the
						rich and noble was finer and larger than that of others; and a new toga was
						called Pexa. None but Roman citizens were permitted to wear the toga; and

				<p>At his table which was always plentiful and elegant, he constantly entertained

					character. Valerius Messala informs us, that he never admitted any freedmen to
					his table, except Menas, when rewarded with the privilege of citizenship, for
					betraying Pompey's fleet. He writes, himself, that he invited to his table a
					person in whose villa he lodged, and who had formerly been employed by him as a
					spy. He often came late to table, and withdrew early; so that the company began
					supper before his arrival, and continued at table after his departure. His
					entertainments consisted of three entries, or at most of only six. But if his
					fare was moderate, his courtesy was extreme. For those who were silent, or
					talked in whispers, he encouraged to join in the general conversation; and
					introduced buffoons and stage players, or even low performers from the circus,
					and very often itinerant humourists, to enliven the company.</p>

			<div type="textpart" n="73" subtype="chapter">
				<p>Festivals and holidays he usually celebrated very expensively, but sometimes only

						fasting for seven days in the deserts of <placeName key="tgn,1012700">Arabia</placeName>, xxxvi. 2. 14. But we find that there was a weekly

					</note> as I have to-day; for while in the bath, and after the first hour of the
					night, I only ate two biscuits, before I began to be rubbed with oil." From this

					for some one to read or tell stories to him, until he became drowsy, and then

					awake in the dark, without somebody to sit by him. Very early rising was apt to
					disagree with him. On which account, if he was obliged to rise betimes, for any
					civil or religious functions, in order to guard as much as possible against the

				<p>Since we are upon this subject, it may not be improper to give an account of the

					the wall of <placeName key="tgn,7009108">Velletri</placeName> having in former
					times been struck with thunder, the response of the soothsayers was, that a
					native of that town would some time or other arrive at supreme power; relying on
					which prediction, the Velletrians both then, and several times afterwards, made
					war upon the Roman people, to their own ruin. At last it appeared by the event,
					that the omen had portended the elevation of Augustus.</p>
				<p>Julius Marathus informs us, that a few months before his birth, there happened at
						<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> a prodigy, by which was
					signified that Nature was in travail with a king for the Roman people; and that

					be brought up; but that those amongst them, whose wives were pregnant, to secure
					to themselves a chance of that dignity, took care that the decree of the senate
					should not be registered in the treasury.</p>
				<p>I find in the theological books of Asclepiades the Mendesian,<note anchored="true">Strabo tells us that Mendes was a city of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> near <placeName key="tgn,7001111">Lycopolis</placeName>. Asclepias wrote a book in Greek with the idea of

					asleep on her couch in the temple, and that a serpent immediately crept to her,
					and soon after withdrew. She awaking upon it, purified herself, as usual after
					the embraces of her husband; and instantly there appeared upon her body a mark
					in the form of a serpent, which she never after could efface, and which obliged
					her, during the subsequent part of her life, to decline the use of the public
					baths. Augustus, it was added, was born in the tenth month after, and for that
					reason was thought to be the son of Apollo. The same Atia, before her delivery,
					dreamed that her bowels stretched to the stars, and expanded through the whole
					circuit of heaven and earth. His father Octavius, likewise, dreamt that a
					sun-beam issued from his wife's womb.</p>
				<p>Upon the day he was born, the senate being engaged in a debate on Catiline's
					conspiracy, and Octavius, in consequence of his wife's being in childbirth,
					coming late into the house, it is a well-known fact, that Publius Nigidius, upon
					hearing the occasion of his coming so late, and the hour of his wife's delivery,
					declared that the world had got a master. Afterwards, when Octavius, upon
					marching with his army through the deserts of <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, consulted the oracle in the grove of father Bacchus,
					with barbarous rites, concerning his son, he received from the priests an answer
					to the same purpose; because, when they loured wine upon the altar, there burst
					out so prodigious a flame, that it ascended above the roof of the temple, and
					reached up to the heavens; a circumstance which had never happened to any one
					but Alexander the Great, upon his sacrificing at the same altars. And the next
					night he dreamt that he saw his son under more than human appearance, with
					thunder and a sceptre, and the other insignia of <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>, Optimus, Maximus, having on his head a radiant crown,
					mounted upon a chariot decked with laurel, and drawn by six pair of milk-white
					horses.</p>
				<p>Whilst he was yet an infant, as Caius Drusus relates, being laid in his cradle by
					his nurse, and in a low place, the next day he was not to be found, and after he
					had been sought for a long time, he was at last'discovered upon a lofty tower,
					lying with his face towards the rising sun.<note anchored="true"><placeName key="tgn,7009108">Velletri</placeName> stands on very high ground,

					As he was dining in a grove at the fourth mile-stone on the Campanian road, an

				<p>Quintus Catulus had a dream, for two nights successively after his dedication of
					the Capitol. The first night he dreamt that <placeName key="tgn,2019952">Jupiter</placeName>, out of several boys of the order of the nobility, who
					were playing about his altar, selected one, into whose bosom he put the public
					seal of the commonwealth, which he held in his hand; but in his vision the next
					night, he saw in the bosom of <placeName key="tgn,2019952">Jupiter</placeName>
					Capitolinus, the same boy; whom he ordered to be removed, but it was forbidden
					by the God, who declared that it must be brought up to become the guardian of
					the state. The next day, meeting Augustus, with whom till that hour he had not.
					the least acquaintance, and looking at him with admiration, he said he was
					extremely like the boy he had seen in his dream. Some give a different account
					of Catulus's first dream, namely, that <placeName key="tgn,2019952">Jupiter</placeName>, upon several noble lads requesting of him that they
					might have a guardian, had pointed to one amongst them, to whom they were to
					prefer their requests; and putting his fingers to the boy's mouth to kiss, he
					afterwards applied them to his own.</p>
				<p>Marcus Cicero, as he was attending Caius Caesar to the Capitol, happened to be
					telling some of his friends a dream which he had the preceding night, in which
					he saw a comely youth, let down from heaven by a golden chain, who stood at the
					door of the Capitol, and had a whip put into his hands by Jupiter. And
					immediately upon sight of Augustus, who had been sent for by his uncle Caesar to
					the sacrifice, and was as yet perfectly unknown to most of the company, he
					affirmed that it was the very boy he had seen in his dream. When he assumed the
					manly toga, his senatorian tunic becoming loose in the seam on each side, fell
					at his feet. Some would have this to forbode, that the order, of which that was
					the badge of distinction, would some time or other be subject to him.</p>
				<p>Julius Caesar, in cutting down a wood to make room for his camp near <placeName key="tgn,2552514">Munda</placeName>,<note anchored="true"><placeName key="tgn,2552514">Munda</placeName> was a city in the Hispania Boetica,

					upon a palm-tree, and ordered it to be preserved as an omen of victory. From the
					root of this tree there put out immediately a sucker, which, in a few days, grew
					to such a height as not only to equal, but overshadow it, and afford room for
					many nests of wild pigeons which built in it, though that species of bird
					particularly avoids a hard and rough leaf. It is likewise reported, that Caesar
					was chiefly influenced by this prodigy, to prefer his sister's grandson before
					all others for his successor.</p>
				<p>In his retirement at <placeName key="tgn,7016987">Apollonia</placeName>, he went
					with his friend Agrippa to visit Theogenes, the astrologer, in his gallery on
					the roof. Agrippa, who first consulted the fates, having great and almost
					incredible fortunes predicted of him, Augustus did not choose to make known his
					nativity, and persisted for some time in the refusal, from a mixture of shame
					and fear, lest his fortunes should be predicted as inferior to those of Agrippa.
					Being persuaded, however, after much importunity, to declare it, Theogenes
					started up from his seat, and paid him adoration. Not long afterwards, Augustus
					was so confident of the greatness of his destiny, that he published his
					horoscope, and struck a silver coin, bearing upon it the sign of Capricorn,
					under the influence of which he was born.</p>

				<p>He certainly had a presentiment of the issue of all his wars. When the troops of

					the view of the whole army; who thence inferred that discord would arise between
					the three colleagues, which would be attended with the like event: and it
					accordingly happened. At <placeName key="tgn,7010789">Philippi</placeName>, he
					was assured of success by a Thessalian, upon the authority, as he pretended, of

					presenting any favourable intimations, but the contrary, he ordered fresh
					victims; the enemy, however, carrying off the sacred things in a sudden sally,
					it was agreed amongst the augurs, that all the dangers and misfortunes which had
					threatened the sacrificer, would fall upon the heads of those who had got
					possession of the entrails. And, accordingly, so it happened. The day before the
					sea-fight near <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, as he was
					walking upon the shore, a fish leaped out of the sea, and laid itself at his
					feet. At <placeName key="tgn,7010713">Actium</placeName>, while he was going
					down to his fleet to engage the enemy, he was met by an ass with a fellow
					driving it. The name of the man was Eutychus, and that of the animal, Nichon.
						<note anchored="true">The good omen, in this instance, was founded upon the
						etymology of the names of the ass and its driver; the former of which, in

					directed its course to a neighbouring temple, where it settled upon the name of

					Tiberius to put up the vows, which it is usual to make on such occasions, for
					the succeeding Lustrum. For he declared he would not meddle with what it was
					probable he should never accomplish, though the tables were ready drawn for it.
					About the same time, the first letter of his name, in an inscription upon one of
					his statues, was struck out by lightning; which was interpreted as a presage

				<head>Remarks on Augustus</head>
				<p>OCTAVIUS Caesar, afterwards Augustus, had now attained to the same position in
					the state which had formerly been occupied by <placeName key="tgn,2008628">Julius</placeName> Caesar; and though he entered upon it by violence, he
					continued to enjoy it through life with almost uninterrupted tranquillity. By
					the long duration of the late civil war, with its concomitant train of public
					calami- ties, the minds of men were become less averse to the prospect of an
					absolute government; at the same time that the new emperor, naturally prudent
					and politic, had learned from the fate of Julius the art of preserving supreme
					power, without arrogating to himself any invidious mark of distinction. He
					affected to decline public honours, disclaimed every idea of personal
					superiority, and in all his behaviour displayed a degree of moderation which
					prognosticated the most happy effects, in restoring peace and prosperity to the
					harassed empire. The tenor of his future conduct was suitable to this auspicious
					commencement. While he endeavoured to conciliate the affections of the people by
					lending money to those who stood in need of it, at low interest, or without any
					at all, and by the exhibition of public shows, of which the Romans were
					remarkably fond; he was attentive to the preservation of a becoming dignity in
					the government, and to the correction of morals. The senate, which, in the time
					of Sylla, had increased to upwards of four hundred, and, during the civil war,
					to a thousand, members, by the admission of improper persons, he reduced to six
					hundred; and being invested with the ancient office of censor, which had for
					some time been disused, he exercised an arbitrary but legal authority over the
					conduct of every rank in the state; by which he could degrade senators and
					knights, and inflict upon all citizens an ignominious sentence for any immoral
					or indecent behaviour. But nothing contributed more to render the new form of
					government acceptable to the people, than the frequent distribution of corn, and
					sometimes largesses, amongst the commonalty: for an occasional scarcity of
					provisions had always been the chief cause of discontents and tumults in the
					capital. To the interests of the army he likewise paid particular attention. It
					was by the assistance of the legions that he had risen to power; and they were
					the men who, in the last resort, if such an emergency should ever occur, could
					alone enable him to preserve it.</p>
				<p>History relates, that after the overthrow of Antony, Augustus held a consultation
					with Agrippa and Maecenas about restoring the republican form of government;
					when Agrippa gave his opinion in favour of that measure, and Maecenas opposed
					it. The object of this consultation, in respect to its future consequences on
					society, is perhaps the most important ever agitated in any cabinet, and
					required, for the mature discussion of it, the whole collective wisdom of the
					ablest men in the empire. But this was a resource which could scarcely be
					adopted, either with security to the public quiet, or with unbiassed judgment in
					the determination of the question. The bare agitation of such a point would have
					excited immediate and strong anxiety for its final result; while the friends of
					a republican government, who were still far more numerous than those of the
					other party, would have strained every nerve to procure a determination in their
					own favour; and the pretorian guards, the surest protection of Augustus, finding
					their situation rendered precarious by such an unexpected occurrence, would have
					readily listened to the secret propositions and intrigues of the republi cans
					for securing their acquiescence to the decision on the popular side. If, when
					the subject came into debate, Augustus should be sincere in the declaration to
					abide by the resolution of the council, it is beyond all doubt, that the
					restoration of a republican governmeni would have been voted by a great majority
					of the assembly. If, on the contrary, he should not be sincere, which is the
					more probable supposition, and should incur the suspicion of practising secretly
					with members for a decision according to his wish, he would have rendered
					himself obnoxious to the public odium, and given rise to discontents which might
					have endangered his future security.</p>
				<p>But to submit this important question to the free and unbiassed docision of a
					numerous assembly, it is probable, neither suited the inclination of Augustus,
					nor perhaps, in his opinion, consisted with his personal safety. With a view to
					the attainment of unconstitutional power, he had formerly deserted the cause of
					the republic when its affairs were in a prosperous situation; and now, when his
					end was accomplished, there could be little ground to expect, that he should
					voluntarily relinquish the prize for which he had spilt the best blood of
						<placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, and contended for so many
					years. Ever since the final defeat of Antony in the battle of <placeName key="tgn,7010713">Actium</placeName>, he had governed the Roman state with
					uncontrolled authority; and though there is in the nature of unlimited power an
					intoxicating quality, injurious both to public and private virtue, yet all
					history contradicts the supposition of its being endued with any which is
					unpalatable to the general taste of mankind.</p>
				<p>There were two chief motives by which Augustus would naturally be influenced in a
					deliberation on this important subject; namely, the love of power, and the
					personal danger which he might incur from relinquishing it. Either of these
					motives might have been a sufficient in ducement for retaining his authority;
					but when they both concurred, as they seem to have done upon this occasion,
					their united force was irresistible. The argument, so far as relates to the love
					of power, rests upon a ground, concerning the solidity of which, little doubt
					can be entertained: but it may be proper to inquire, in a few words, into the
					foundation of that personal danger which he dreaded to incur, on returning to
					the station of a private citizen.</p>
				<p>Augustus, as has been already observed, had formerly sided with the party which
					had attempted to restore public liberty after the death of Julius Caesar: but he
					afterwards abandoned the popular cause, and joined in the ambitious plans of
					Antony and Lepidus to usurp amongst themselves the entire dominion of the state.
					By this change of conduct, he turned his arms against the supporters of a form
					of government which he had virtually recognized as the legal constitution of
						<placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>; and it involved a direct
					implication of treason against the sacred representatives of that government,
					the consuls, formally and duly elected. Upon such a charge he might be amenable
					to the capital laws of his country. This, however, was a danger which might be
					fully obviated, by procuring from the senate and people an act of oblivion,
					previously to his abdication of the supreme power; and this was a preliminary
					which doubtless they would have admitted and ratified with unanimous
					approbation. It therefore appears that he could be exposed to no inevitable
					danger on this account: but there was another quarter where his person was
					vulnerable, and where even the laws might not be sufficient to protect him
					against the efforts of private resentment. The bloody proscription of the
					Triumvirate no act of amnesty could ever erase from the minds of those who had
					been deprived by it of their nearest and dearest relations; and amidst the
					numerous connections of the illustrious men sacrificed on that horrible
					occasion, there might arise some desperate avenger, whose indelible resentment
					nothing less would satisfy than the blood of the surviving delinquent. Though
					Augustus, therefore, might not, like his great predecessor, be stabbed in the
					senate-house, he nmight perish by the sword or the poniard in a less conspicuous
					situation. After all, there seems to have been little danger from this quarter
					likewise; for Sylla, who in the preceding age had been guilty of equal
					enormities, was permitted, on relinquishing the place of perpetual dictator, to
					end his days in quiet retirement; and the undisturbed security which Augustus
					ever afterwards enjoyed, affords sufficient proof, that all apprehension of
					danger to his person was merely chimerical.</p>
				<p>We have hitherto considered this grand consultation as it might be influenced by
					the passions or prejudices of the emperor: we shall now take a short view of the
					subject in the light in which it is connected with considerations of a political
					nature, and with public utility. The arguments handed down by history respecting
					this consultation are few, and imperfectly delivered; but they may be extended
					upon the general principles maintained on each side of the question.</p>
				<p>For the restoration of the republican government, it might be contended, that
					from the expulsion of the kings to the dictatorship of Julius Caesar, through a
					period of upwards of four hundred and sixty years, the Roman state, with the
					exception only of a short interval, had flourished and increased with a degree
					of prosperity unexampled in the annals of human kind: that the republican form
					of government was not only best adapted to the improvement of national grandeur,
					but to the security of general freedom, the great object of all political
					association: that public virtue, by which alone nations could subsist in vigour,
					was cherished and protected by no mode of administration so much as by that
					which connected, in the strongest bonds of union, the private interest of
					individuals with those of the community: that the habits and prejudices of the
					Roman people were unalterably attached to the form of government established by
					so long a prescription, and they would never submit, for any length of time, to
					the rule of one person, without making every possible effort to recover their
					liberty: that though despotism, under a mild and wise prince, might in some
					respects be regarded as preferable to a constitution which was occasionally
					exposed to the inconvenience of faction and popular tumults, yet it was a
					dangerous experiment to abandon the government of the nation to the contingency
					of such a variety of characters as usually occurs in the succession of princes;
					and, upon the whole, that the interests of the people were more safely entrusted
					in the hands of annual magistrates elected by themselves, than in those of any
					individual whose power was permanent, and subject to no legal control.</p>
				<p>In favour of despotic government it might be urged, that though <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> had subsisted long and gloriously under a
					republican form of government, yet she had often experienced such violent shocks
					from popular tumults or the factions of the great, as had threatened her with
					imminent destruction: that a republican government was only accommodated to a
					people amongst whom the division of property gave to no class of citizens such a
					degree of preeminence as might prove dangerous to public freedom: that there was
					required in that form of political constitution, a simplicity of life and
					strictness of manners which are never observed to accompany a high degree of
					public prosperity: that in respect of all these considerations, such a form of
					government was utterly incompatible with the present circumstances of the
					Romans: that by the conquest of so many foreign nations, by the lucrative
					governments of provinces, the spoils of the enemy in war, and the rapine too
					often practised in time of peace, so great had been the aggrandizement of
					particular families in the preceding age, that though the form of the ancient
					constitution should still remain inviolate, the people would no longer live
					under a free republic, but an aristocratical usurpation, which was always
					productive of tyranny: that nothing could preserve the commonwealth from
					becoming a prey to some daring confederacy, but the firm and vigorous
					administration of one person, invested with the whole executive power of the
					state, unlimited and uncontrolled: in fine, that as <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> had been nursed to maturity by the government of six
					princes successively, so it was only by a similar form of political constitution
					that she could now be saved from aristocratical tyranny on one hand, or, on the
					other, from absolute anarchy.</p>
				<p>On whichever side of the question the force of argument may be thought to
					preponderate, there is reason to believe that Augustus was guided in his
					resolution more by inclination and prejudice than by reason. It is related,
					however, that hesitating between the opposite opinions of his two counsellors,
					he had recourse to that of Virgil, who joined with Maecenas in advising him to
					retain the imperial power, as being the form of government most suitable to the
					circumstances of the times. </p>
