				<p>The patrician family of the Claudii (for there was a plebeian family of the same
					name, no way inferior to the other either in power or dignity) came originally
					from Regilli, a town of the Sabines. They removed thence to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> soon after the building of the city, with
					a great body of their dependants, under Titus Tatius, who reigned jointly with
						<placeName key="tgn,2072021">Romulus</placeName> in the kingdom; or,
					perhaps, what is related upon better authority, under Atta Claudius, the head of
					the family, who was admitted by the senate into the patrician order six years
					after the expulsion of the Tarquins. They likewise received from the state,
					lands beyond the Anio for their followers, and a burying place for themselves
					near the capitol. <note anchored="true">Intramural interments were prohibited at
							<placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> by the laws of the Twelve
						Tables, notwithstanding the practice of reducing to ashes the bodies of the
						dead. It was only by special privilege that individuals who had deserved
						well of the state, and certain distinguished families were permitted to have
						tombs within the city. </note> After this period, in process of time, the
					family had the honour of twenty-eight consulships, five dictatorships, seven
					censorships, seven triumphs, and two ovations. Their descendants were
					distinguished by various <foreign xml:lang="lat">praenomina</foreign> and
						<foreign xml:lang="lat">cognomina</foreign>, <note anchored="true"><p>Among
							the Romans, all the descendants from one common stock were called
							Geniles, being of the same race or kindred, however remote. The Gens, as
							they termed this general relation or clanship, was subdivided into
							families. in Famias velStirpes; and those of the same family were called
							Agnat. Relations by the father's side were also called Agnai, to
							distinguish them from Cognat, relations only on the mother's side. An
							Agnatus might also be called Cognatus, but not the contrary.</p>
						<p>To mark the different genies and familiae, and to distinguish the
							individuals of the same family, the Romans had commonly three names, the
							Praenomen, Nomren, and Cognomen. The prasnomen was put first, and marked
							the individual. It was usually written with one letter; as A. for Aulus;
							C. Caius; D. Decimus; sometimes with two letters; as Ap. for Appius; Cn.
							Cneius; and sometimes with three; as Mam. for Mamercus.</p>
						<p>The Nomen was put after the Pranomen, and marked the gens. It commonly
							ended in ius; as <placeName key="tgn,2008628">Julius</placeName>,
							Tullius, <placeName key="tgn,2074227">Cornelius</placeName>. The
							Cognomen was put last, and marked the familia; as Cicero, <placeName key="tgn,2073974">Casar</placeName>, etc.</p>
						<p>Some gentes appear to have had no surname, as the <placeName key="tgn,2492449">Marian</placeName>; and gens and familia seem
							sometimes to be put one for the other; as the Fabia gens, or
							FabiafamiKa.</p>
						<p>Sometimes there was a fourth name, properly called the Agnommn, but
							sometimes likewise Cognomen, which was added on account of some
							illustrious action or remarkable event. Thus <placeName key="tgn,2648579">Scipio</placeName> was named Publius Cornelius
							Scipio Aficanus, from the conquest of <placeName key="tgn,7016143">Carthage</placeName>. In the same manner, his brother was called
							Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus. Thus also Quintus Fabius Maximus
							received the Agnomen of Cunctator, from his checking the victorious
							career of <placeName key="tgn,2069580">Hannibal</placeName> by avoiding
							a battle.</p></note> but rejected by common consent the praenomen of
						<placeName key="tgn,2023439">Lucius</placeName>, when, of the two races who
					bore it, one individual had been convicted of robbery, and another of murder.
					Amongst other cognomina, they assumed that of <placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName>, which in the <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> language signifies strong and valiant.</p>

				<p>It appears from record, that many of the Claudii have performed signal services
					to the state, as well as committed acts of delinquency. To mention the most
					remarkable only, Appius Caecus dissuaded the senate from agreeing to an alliance
					with Pyrrhus, as prejudicial to the republic.<note anchored="true">A.U.C.
						474</note> Claudius Candex first passed the straits of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> with a fleet, and drove the

					Nero cut off Hasdrubal with a vast army upon his arrival in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> from <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, before he could form a junction with his brother
						Annibal.<note anchored="true">A.U.C. 574</note> On the other hand, Claudius
					Appius Regillanus, one of the Decemvirs, made a violent attempt to have a free
					virgin, of whom he was enamoured, adjudged a slave; which caused the people to
					secede a second time from the senate.<note anchored="true">A.U.C. 304</note>
					Claudius Drusus erected a statue of himself wearing a crown at Appii Forum,<note anchored="true"> An ancient Latin town on the <placeName key="tgn,6006324">Via Appia</placeName>, the present road to <placeName key="tgn,7004474">Naples</placeName>, mentioned by <placeName key="tgn,1129393">St.
							Paul</placeName>, Acts xxviii. 15, and Horace, Sat. i. 5., in giving an
						account of their travels.</note> and endeavoured, by means of his
					dependants, to make himself master of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. Claudius Pulcher, when, off the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>,<note anchored="true">A.U.C. 505</note>
					the pullets used for taking augury would not eat, in contempt of the omen threw
					them overboard, as if they should drink at least, if they would not eat; and
					then engaging the enemy, was routed. After his defeat, when he was ordered by
					the senate to name a dictator, making a sort of jest of the public disaster, he
					named Glycias, his apparitor.</p>
				<p>The women of this family, likewise, exhibited characters equally opposite to each
					other. For both the Claudias belonged to it; she, who, when the ship freighted
					with things sacred to the Idaean Mother of the Gods,<note anchored="true">Cybele; first worshipped in <placeName key="tgn,7002613">Phrygia</placeName>, about <placeName key="tgn,1105013">Mount
							Ida</placeName>, from whence a sacred stone, the symbol of her divinity,
						probably an aerolite, was transported to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, in consequence of the panic occasioned by Hannibal's
						invasion, A.U.C. 508. </note> stuck fast in the shallows of the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>, got it off, by praying to the Goddess
					with a loud voice, "Follow me, if I am chaste;" and she also, who, contrary to
					the usual practice in the case of women, was brought to trial by the people for
					treason; because, when her litter was stopped by a great crowd in the streets,
					she openly exclaimed, "I wish my brother Pulcher was alive now, to lose another
					fleet, that <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> might be less
					thronged." Besides, it is well known, that all the Claudii, except Publius
					Claudius, who, to effect the banishment of Cicero, procured himself to be
					adopted by a plebeian,<note anchored="true">A.U.C. 695</note> and one younger
					than himself, were always of the patrician party, as well as great sticklers for
					the honour and power of that order; and so violent and obstinate in their
					opposition to the plebeians, that not one of them, even in the case of a trial
					for life by the people, would ever condescend to put on mourning, according to
					custom, or make any supplication to them for favour; and some of them in their
					contests, have even proceeded to lay hands on the tribunes of the people. A
					Vestal Virgin likewise of the family, when her brother was resolved to have the
					honour of a triumph contrary to the will of the people, mounted the chariot with
					him, and attended him into the capitol, that it might not be lawful for any of
					the tribunes to interfere and forbid it.<note anchored="true">A.U.C.

				<p>From this family Tiberius Caesar is descended; indeed both by the father and
					mother's side; by the former from Tiberius Nero, and by the latter from Appius
					Pulcher, who were both sons of Appius Caecus. He likewise belonged to the family
					of the Livii, by the adoption of his mother's grandfather into it; which family
					although plebeian, made a distinguished figure, having had the honour of eight
					consulships, two censorships, three triumphs, one dictatorship, and the office
					of master of the horse; and was famous for eminent men, particularly, Salinator
					and the Drusi. Salinator, in his censorship,<note anchored="true">A.U.C.
						550</note> branded all the tribes, for their inconstancy in having made him
					consul a second time, as well as censor, although they had condemned him to a
					heavy fine after his first consulship. Drusus procured for himself and his
					posterity a new surname, by killing in single combat Drausus, the enemy's chief.
					He is likewise said to have recovered, when pro-praetor in the province of
						<placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, the gold which was formerly
					given to the <placeName key="tgn,1035697">Senones</placeName>, at the siege of
					the capitol, and had not, as is reported, been forced from them by Camillus. His
					great-great-grandson, who, for his extraordinary services against the Gracchi,
					was styled the "Patron of the Senate," left a son, who, while plotting in a
					sedition of the same description, was treacherously murdered by the opposite
						party.<note anchored="true">A.U.C. 663</note></p>

				<p>But the father of Tiberius Caesar, being quaestor to Caius Caesar, and commander
					of his fleet in the war of <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>, contributed greatly to its success. He was
					therefore made one of the high-priests in the room of Publius Scipio;<note anchored="true">A.U.C. 707</note> and was sent to settle some colonies in
						<placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, and amongst the rest, those
					of <placeName key="tgn,7008368">Narbonne</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7008775">Arles</placeName>. <note anchored="true">These, and other

						Roman civilization among the Gauls; which is marked by the magnificent
						remains of ancient art still to be seen. <placeName key="tgn,1121365">Aries</placeName>, in particular, is a place of great interest. </note>
					After the assassination of Caesar, however, when the rest of the senators, for
					fear of public disturbances, were for having the affair buried in oblivion, he
					proposed a resolution for rewarding those who had killed the tyrant. Having
					filled the office of praetor,<note anchored="true">A.U.C. 710</note> and at the
					end of the year a disturbance breaking out amongst the triumviri, he kept the
					badges of his office beyond the legal time; and following Lucius Antonius the
					consul, brother of the triumvir, to <placeName key="perseus,Perusia">Perusia</placeName>,<note anchored="true">A.U.C. 713</note> though the rest
					submitted, yet he himself continued firm to the party, and escaped first to
						<placeName key="perseus,Praeneste">Praeneste</placeName>, and then to
						<placeName key="tgn,7004474">Naples</placeName>; whence, having in vain
					invited the slaves to liberty, he fled over to <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. But resenting his not being immediately admitted into
					the presence of Sextus Pompey, and being also prohibited the use of the fasces,
					he went over into Achaia to Mark Antony; with whom, upon a reconciliation soon
					after brought about amongst the several contending parties, he returned to
						<placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>; and, at the request of
					Augustus, gave up to him his wife Livia Drusilla, although she was then big with
					child, and had before borne him a son. He died not long after; leaving behind
					him two sons, Tiberius and Drusus Nero.</p>

			<div type="textpart" n="5" subtype="chapter">
				<p>Some have imagined that Tiberius was born at <placeName key="tgn,7006712">Fundi</placeName>, but there is only this trifling foundation for the
					conjecture, that his mother's grandmother was of <placeName key="tgn,7006712">Fundi</placeName>, and that the image of Good Fortune was, by a decree of
					the senate, erected in a public place in that town. But according to the
					greatest number of writers, and those too of the best authority, he was born at
						<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, in the <placeName key="tgn,3000935">Palatine</placeName> quarter, upon the sixteenth of the
					calends of December [16th Nov.], when Marcus AEmilius Lepidus was second time
					consul, with Lucius Munatius Plancus,<note anchored="true">A.U.C. 712. Before
						Christ about 39.</note> after the battle of <placeName key="perseus,Philippi">Philippi</placeName>; for so it is registered in the
					calendar, and the public acts. According to some, however, he was born in the
					preceding year, in the consulship of Hirtius and Pansa; and others say, in the
					year following, during the consulship of Servilius Isauricus and Antony.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="6" subtype="chapter">
				<p>His infancy and childhood were spent in the midst of danger and trouble; for he
					accompanied his parents everywhere in their flight, and twice at <placeName key="tgn,7004474">Naples</placeName> nearly betrayed them by his crying,
					when they were privately hastening to a ship, as the enemy rushed into the town;
					once, when he was snatched from his nurse's breast, and again, from his mother's
					bosom, by some of the company, who on the sudden emergency wished to relieve the
					women of their burden. Being carried through <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>, and
					entrusted for some time to the care of the Lacedaemonians, who were under the
					protection of the Claudian family, upon his departure thence when travelling by
					night, he ran the hazard of his life, by a fire which, suddenly bursting out of
					a wood on all sides, surrounded the whole party so closely, that part of Livia's
					dress and hair was burnt. The presents which were made him by Pompeia, sister to
					Sextus Pompey, in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, namely, a
					cloak, with a clasp, and bullae of gold, are still in existence, and shewn at
						<placeName key="perseus,Baiae">Baiae</placeName> to this day. After his
					return to the city, being adopted by Marcus Gallius, a senator, in his will, he
					took possession of the estate; but soon afterwards declined the use of his name,
					because Gallius had been of the party opposed to Augustus. When only nine years
					of age, he pronounced a funeral oration in praise of his father upon the rostra;
					and afterwards, when he had nearly attained the age of manhood, he attended the
					chariot of Augustus, in his triumph for the victory at <placeName key="tgn,7010713">Actium</placeName>, riding on the left-hand horse, whilst
					Marcellus, Octavia's son, rode that on the right. He likewise presided at the
					games celebrated on account of that victory; and in the Trojan games intermixed
					with the Circensian, he commanded a troop of the biggest boys.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="7" subtype="chapter">
				<p>After assuming the manly habit, he spent his youth, and the rest of his life
					until he succeeded to the government, in the following manner: he gave the
					people an entertainment of gladiators, in memory of his father, and another for
					his grandfather Drusus, at different times and in different places: the first in
					the forum, the second in the amphitheatre; some gladiators who had been
					honourably discharged, being induced to engage again, by a reward of a hundred
					thousand sesterces. He likewise exhibited public sports, at which he was not
					present himself. All these he performed with great magnificence, at the expense
					of his mother and father-in-law. He married Agrippina, the daughter of Marcus
					Agrippa, and granddaughter of Caecilius Atticus, a Roman knight, the same person
					to whom Cicero has addressed so many epistles. After having by her his son
					Drusus, he was obliged to part with her,<note anchored="true">A.U.C. 744</note>
					though she retained his affection, and was again pregnant, to make way for
					marrying Augustus's daughter Julia. But this he did with extreme reluctance;
					for, besides having the warmest attachment to Agrippina, he was disgusted with
					the conduct of Julia, who had made indecent advances to him during the lifetime
					of her former husband; and that she was a woman of loose character, was the
					general opinion. At divorcing Agrippina he felt the deepest regret; and upon
					meeting her afterwards, he looked after her with eyes so passionately expressive
					of affection, that care was taken she should never again come in his sight. At
					first, however, he lived quietly and happily with Julia; but a rupture soon
					ensued, which became so violent, that after the loss of their son, the pledge of
					their union, who was born at <placeName key="tgn,7005553">Aquileia</placeName>
					and died in infancy,<note anchored="true">A.U.C. 735</note> he never would sleep
					with her more. He lost his brother Drusus in <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, and brought his body to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, travelling all the way on foot before it.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="8" subtype="chapter">
				<p>When he first applied himself to civil affairs, he defended the several causes of
					king Archelaus, the Trallians, and the Thessalians, before Augustus, who sat as
					judge at the trials. He addressed the senate on behalf of the Laodiceans, the
					Thyatireans, and Chians, who had suffered greatly by an earthquake, and implored
					relief from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. He prosecuted
					Fannius Caepio, who had been engaged in a conspiracy with Varro Mursena against
					Augustus, and procured sentence of condemnation against him. Amidst all this, he
					had besides to superintend two departments of the administration, that of
					supplying the city with corn, which was then very scarce, and that of clearing
					the houses of correction<note anchored="true">See before, in the reign of
						Augustus, c. xxxii.</note> throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, the masters of which had fallen under the odious

					the fear of being obliged to serve in the army had driven to seek refuge in such
					places.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="9" subtype="chapter">
				<p>He made his first campaign, as a military tribune, in the Cantabrian war.<note anchored="true">A. U. C. 728.</note> Afterwards he led an army into the
						East,<note anchored="true">A.U.C. 734</note> where he restored the kingdom
					of <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName> to Tigranes; and seated on a
					tribunal, put a crown upon his head. He likewise recovered from the Parthians
					the standards which they had taken from Crassus. He next governed, for nearly a
					year, the province of Gallia Comata, which was then in great disorder, on
					account of the incursions of the barbarians, and the feuds of the chiefs. He
					afterwards commanded in the several wars against the Rhaetians, Vindelicians,
					Pannonians, and Germans. In the Rhaetian and Vindelician wars, he subdued the
					nations in the <placeName key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName>; and in the
					Pannonian wars the Bruci, and the Dalmatians. In the German war, he transplanted
					into <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> forty thousand of the enemy
					who had submitted, and assigned them lands near the banks of the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName>. For these actions, he entered the city
					with an ovation, but riding in a chariot, and is said by some to have been the
					first that ever was honoured with this distinction. He filled early the
					principal offices of state; and passed through the quaestorship,<note anchored="true">A.U.C. 737</note> praetorship,<note anchored="true">A.U.C.
						741</note> and consulates<note anchored="true">A.U.C. 747</note> almost
					successively. After some interval, he was chosen consul a second time, and held
					the tribunitian authority during five years.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="10" subtype="chapter">
				<p>Surrounded by all this prosperity, in the prime of life and in excellent health,
					he suddenly formed the resolution of withdrawing to a greater distance from
						<placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>.<note anchored="true">A.U.C.
						748</note> It is uncertain whether this was the result of disgust for his
					wife, whom he neither durst accuse nor divorce, and the connection with whom
					became every day more intolerable; or to prevent that indifference towards him,
					which his constant residence in the city might produce; or in the hope of
					supporting and improving by absence his authority in the state, if the public
					should have occasion for his service. Some are of opinion, that as Augustus's
					sons were now grown up to years of maturity, he voluntarily relinquished the
					possession he had long enjoyed of the second place in the government, as Agrippa
					had done before him; who, when M. Marcellus was advanced to public offices,
					retired to <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Mitylene</placeName>, that he might not
					seem to stand in the way of his promotion, or in any respect lessen him by his
					presence. The same reason likewise Tiberius gave afterwards for his retirement;
					but his pretext at this time was, that he was satiated with honours, and
					desirous of being relieved from the fatigue of business; requesting therefore
					that he might have leave to withdraw. And neither the earnest entreaties of his
					mother, nor the complaint of his father-in-law made even in the senate, that he
					was deserted by him, could prevail upon him to alter his resolution. Upon their
					persisting in the design of detaining him, he refused to take any sustenance for
					four days together. At last, having obtained permission, leaving his wife and
					son at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, he proceeded to

						been filled up with the depositions of the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>, it became deserted, and is now abandoned to misery

						name from the Greek word signifying naked, because the contending parties
						wore nothing but drawers. </note> without any lictor or other attendant, and
					returning the civilities of the Greeks with almost as much complaisance as if he
					had been upon a level with them. One morning, in settling the course of his
					daily excursion, he happened to say, that he should visit all the sick people in
					the town. This being not rightly understood by those about him, the sick were
					brought into a public portico, and ranged in order, according to their several
					distempers. Being extremely embarrassed by this unexpected occurrence, he was
					for some time irresolute how he should act; but at last he determined to go
					round them all, and make an apology for the mistake, even to the meanest amongst
					them, and such as were entirely unknown to him. One instance only is mentioned,
					in which he appeared to exercise his tribunitian authority. Being a constant
					attendant upon the schools and lecture-rooms of the professors of the liberal
					arts, on occasion of a quarrel amongst the wrangling sophists, in which he
					interposed to reconcile them, some person took the liberty to abuse him as an
					intruder, and partial in the affair. Upon this, withdrawing privately home, he
					suddenly returned attended by his officers, and summoning his accuser before his
					tribunal, by a public crier, ordered him to be taken to prison. Afterwards he
					received tidings that his wife Julia had been condemned for her lewdness and
					adultery, and that a bill of divorce had been sent to her in his name, by the
					authority of Augustus. Though he secretly rejoiced at this intelligence, he
					thought it incumbent upon him, in point of decency, to interpose in her behalf
					by frequent letters to Augustus, and to allow her to retain the presents which
					he had made her, notwithstanding the little regard she merited from him. When
					the period of his tribunitian authority expired,<note anchored="true">A.U.C.
						752</note> declaring at last that he had no other object in his retirement
					than to avoid all suspicion of rivalship with Caius and Lucius, he petitioned
					that, since he was now secure in that respect, as they were come to the age of
					manhood, and would easily maintain themselves in possession of the second place
					in the state, he might be permitted to visit his friends, whom he was very
					desirous of seeing. But his request was denied; and he was advised to lay aside
					all concern for his friends, whom he had been so eager to quit.</p>

				<p>He therefore continued at <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName> much
					against his will, obtaining, with difficulty, thrqugh his mother, the title of
					Augustus's lieutenant, to cover his disgrace. He thenceforth lived, however, not
					only as a private person, but as one suspected and under apprehension, retiring
					into the interior of the country, and avoiding the visits of those who sailed
					that way, which were very frequent; for no one passed to take command of an
					army, or the government of a province, without touching at <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>. But there were fresh reasons for
					increased anxiety. For crossing over to <placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName>, on a visit to his step-son Caius, who had been appointed
					governor of the East, ihe found him prepossessed against him, by the
					insinuations of Marcus Lollius, his companion and director. He likewise fell
					under suspicion of sending by some centurions who had been promoted by himself,
					upon their return to the camp after a furlough, mysterious messages to several
					persons there, intended, apparently, to tamper with them for a revolt. This
					jealousy respecting his designs being intimated to him by Augustus, he begged
					repeatedly that some person of any of the three Orders might be placed as a spy
					upon him in every thing he either said or did.</p>

					town; and upon mention being made of him at table, one of the company said to
					Caius, "I will sail over to <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>
					immediately, if you desire me, and bring you the head of the exile;" for that
					was the appellation now given him. Thus alarmed not only by apprehensions, but
					real danger, he renewed his solicitations for leave to return; and, seconded by
					the most urgent supplications of his mother, he at last obtained his request; to
					which an accident somewhat contributed. Augustus had resolved to determine
					nothing in the affair, but with the consent of his eldest son. The latter was at
					that time out of humour with Marcus Lollius, and -therefore easily disposed to
					be favourable to his father-in-law. Caius thus acquiescing, he was recalled, but

					youth, in consequence of various prodigies and predictions. For Livia, when
					pregnant with him, being anxious to discover, by different modes of divination,
					whether her offspring would be a son, amongst others, took an egg from a hen
					that was sitting, and kept it warm with her own hands, and those of her maids,
					by turns, until a fine cock-chicken, with a large comb, was hatched. Scribonius,
					the astrologer, predicted great things of him when he was a mere child. " He
					will come in time," said the prophet, "to be even a king, but without the usual
					badge of royal dignity;" the rule of the Caesars being as yet unknown. When he
					was making his first expedition, and leading his army through <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> into <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, the altars which had been formerly consecrated at
						<placeName key="perseus,Philippi">Philippi</placeName> by the victorious

					very tali are still to be seen at the bottom of the fountain. A few days before
					his leaving <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>, an eagle, a bird
					never before seen in that island, perched on the top of his house. And the day
					before he received the intelligence of the permission granted him to return, as

					likewise had a remarkable proof of the skill of Thrasyllus, the astrologer,
					whom, for his proficiency in philosophical researches, he had taken into his
					family. For, upon sight of the ship which brought the intelligence, he said good
					news was coming: whereas every thing going wrong before, and quite contrary to

			<div type="textpart" n="16" subtype="chapter">
				<p>The tribunitian authority was again conferred upon him for five years,<note anchored="true">A.U.C. 575</note> and a commission given him to settle the

					of that new war, which proved the most serious of all the foreign wars since the
					Carthaginian. This he conducted during three years, with fifteen legions and an
					equal number of auxiliary forces, under great difficulties, and an extreme
					scarcity of corn. And though he was several times recalled, he nevertheless
					persisted; fearing lest an enemy so powerful, and so near, should fall upon the
					army in their retreat. This resolution was attended with good success; for he at
					last reduced to complete subjection all <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName>, lying between <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> and the kingdom of Noricum, <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, the

				<p>The glory he acquired by these successes received an increase from the

					legions in <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>; and it was
					generally believed that the victorious Germans would have joined the Pannonians,
					had not the war of <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName> been
					previously concluded. A triumph, therefore, besides many other great honours,
					was decreed him. Some proposed that the surname of "Pannonicus," others that of
					"Invincible," and others, of "Pius," should be conferred on him; but Augustus
					interposed, engaging for him that he would be satisfied with that to which he
					would succeed at his death. He postponed his triumph, because the state was at
					that time under great affliction for the disaster of Varus and his army.
					Nevertheless, he entered the city in a triumphal robe, crowned with laurel, and
					mounting a tribunal in the Septa, sat with Augustus between the two consuls,
					whilst the senate gave their attendance standing; whence, after he had saluted
					the people, he was attended by them in procession to the several temples.</p>

			<div type="textpart" n="18" subtype="chapter">
				<p>Next year he went again to <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>,

					dictates of his own judgment, and considered himself alone as sufficiently
					qualified for the direction of affairs. He likewise used more cautions than
					usual. Having to pass the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName>, he
					restricted the whole convoy within certain limits, and stationing himself on the

					his desire to leave as little as possible in the power of fortune or accident,
					yet he always engaged the enemy with more confidence when, in his night-watches,
					the lamp failed and went out of itself; trusting, as he said, in an omen which

					I ignorant of its being reported by some, that Augustus so openly and
					undisguisedly condemned the sourness of his temper, that sometimes, upon his
					coming in, he would break off any jocular conversation in which he was engaged;
					and that he was only prevailed upon by the importunity of his wife to adopt him;
					or actuated by the ambitious view of recommending his own memory from a
					comparison with such a successor. Yet I must hold to this opinion, that a prince
					so extremely circumspect and prudent as he was, did nothing rashly, especially
					in an affair of so great importance; but that, upon weighing the vices and
					virtues of <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName> with each other, he
					judged the latter to preponderate; and this the rather since he swore publicly,
					in an assembly of the people, that "he adopted him for the public good."
					Besides, in several of his letters, he extols him as a consummate general, and
					the only security of the Roman people. Of such declarations I subjoin the
					following instances: "Farewell, my dear <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, and may success attend you, whilst you are warring
					for me and the Muses.<note anchored="true">Augustus interlards this epistle, and

					during the confusion, "Either let him accept it, or decline it at once;" and a
					second told him to his face, "Others are slow to perform what they promise, but
					you are slow to promise what you actually perform." At last, as if forced to it,
					and complaining of the miserable and burdensome service imposed upon him, he

					together a considerable force to revenge his master's death; Lucius Scribonius

					and the troops both in <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName> and
						<placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> were mutinous. Both armies
					insisted upon high demands, particularly that their pay should be made equal to
					that of the pretorian guards. The army in <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> absolutely refused to acknowledge a prince who was not
					their own choice; and urged, with all possible importunity, Germanicus,<note anchored="true"><placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName> had
						adopted Germanicus. See before, c. xv. See also CALIGULA, c. i.</note> who

					senate to assign him some part only in the administration, such as they should
					judge proper, since no man could be sufficient for the whole, without one or
					more to assist him. He pretended likewise to be in a bad state of health, that
					Germanicus might the more patiently wait in hopes of speedily succeeding him, or
					at least of being admitted to be a colleague of the government. When the
					mutinies in the armies were suppressed, he got Clemens into his hands by
					stratagem. That he might not begin his reign by an act of severity, he did not
					call Libo to an account before the senate until his second year, being content,
					in the mean time, with taking proper precautions for his own security. For upon
					Libo's attending a sacrifice amongst the high-priests, instead of the usual
					knife, he ordered one of lead to be given him; and when he desired a private
					conference with him, he would not grant his request, but on condition that his

				<p>He remained unmoved at all the aspersions, scandalous reports, and lampoons,
					which were spread against him or his relations; declaring, "In a free state,
					both the tongue and the mind ought to be free." Upon the senate's desiring that
					some notice might be taken of those offences, and the persons charged with them,
					he replied, "We have not so much time upon our hands, that we ought to involve

						that window, equivalent to our phrase "if you open the door."</note> for
					such proceedings, you will soon have nothing else to do. All private quarrels
					will be brought before you under that pretence." There is also on record another
					sentence used by him in the senate, which is far from assuming: "If he speaks
					otherwise of me, I shall take care to behave in such a manner, as to be able to
					give a good account both of my words and actions; and if he persists, I shall
					hate him in my turn."</p>

				<p>These things were so much the more remarkable in him, because, in the respect he

					Upon his differing with Quintus Haterius in the senate-house, "Pardon me, sir,"
					he said, "I beseech you, if I shall, as a senator, speak my mind very freely in
					opposition to you." Afterwards, addressing the senate in general, he said:
					"Conscript Fathers, I have often said it both now and at other times, that a
					good and useful prince, whom you have invested with so great and absolute power,
					ought to be a slave to the senate, to the whole body of the people, and often to

				<p>He likewise introduced a certain show of liberty, by preserving to the senate and
					magistrates their former majesty and power. All affairs, whether of great or

					monopolies, the erecting or repairing edifices, levying and disbanding soldiers,
					the disposal of the legions and auxiliary forces in the provinces, the
					appointment of generals for the management of extraordinary wars, and the
					answers to letters from foreign princes, were all submitted to the senate. He
					compelled the commander of a troop of horse, who was accused of robbery attended
					with violence, to plead his cause before the senate. He never entered the
					senate-house but unattended; and being once brought thither in a litter, because
					he was indisposed, he dismissed his attendants at the door.</p>

				<p>When some decrees were made contrary to his opinion, he did not even make any
					complaint. And though he thought that no magistrates after their nomination
					should be allowed to absent themselves from the city, but reside in it
					constantly, to receive their honours in person, a praetor-elect obtained liberty
					to depart under the honorary title of a legate at large. Again, when he proposed
					to the senate, that the Trebians might have leave granted them to divert some
					money which had been left them by will for the purpose of building a new
					theatre, to that of making a road, he could not prevail to have the will of the
					testator set aside. And when, upon a division of the house, he went over to the
					minority, nobody followed him. All other things of a public nature were likewise
					transacted by the magistrates, and in the usual forms; the authority of the
					consuls remaining so great, that some ambassadors from <placeName key="tgn,2434870">Africa</placeName> applied to them, and complained, that
					they could not have their business dispatched by Caesar, to whom they had been

			<div type="textpart" n="32" subtype="chapter">
				<p>He reprimanded some persons of consular rank in command of armies, for not
					writing to the senate an account of their proceedings, anc for consulting him
					about the distribution of military rewards; as if they themselves had not a
					right to bestow them as they judged proper. He commended a praetor, who, on
					entering office, revived an old custom of celebrating the memory of his
					ancestors, in a speech to the people. He attended the corpses of some persons of
					distinction to the funeral pile. He displayed the same moderation with regard to
					persons and things of inferior consideration. The magistrates of <placeName key="tgn,2616125">Rhodes</placeName>, having dispatched to him a letter on
					public business, which was not subscribed, he sent for them, and without giving
					them so much as one harsh word, desired them to subscribe it, and so dismissed
					them. Diogenes, the grammarian, who used to hold public disquisitions at
						<placeName key="tgn,2616125">Rhodes</placeName> every sabbath-day, once
					refused him admittance upon his coming to hear him out of course, and sent him a

					taking his place promiscuously amongst them, or seating himself in a corner of

					So far was he from performing any office of kindness or humanity to his wife,
					when she was banished, and, by her father's order, confined to one town, that he
					forbad her to stir out of the house, or converse with any men. He even wronged

					of law, because Augustus had made no provision for them on her behalf in his

					conferences with her, lest it should be thought that he was governed by her
					counsels, which, notwithstanding, he sometimes sought, and was in the habit of
					adopting. He was much offended at the senate, when they proposed to add to his
					other titles that of the Son of Livia, as well as Augustus. He, therefore, would
					not suffer her to be called " the Mother of her country," nor to receive any

				<p>Soon afterwards, he abandoned himself to every species of cruelty, never wanting
					occasions of one kind or another, to serve as a pretext. He first fell upon the
					friends and acquaintances of his mother, then those of his grandsons, and his
					daughter-in-law, and lastly those of Sejanus; after whose death he became cruel
					in the extreme. From this it appeared, that he had not been so much instigated
					by Sejanus, as supplied with occasions of gratifying his savage temper, when he
					wanted them. Though in a short memoir which he composed of his own life, he had
					the effrontery to write, "I have punished Sejanus, because I found him bent upon
					the destruction of the children of my son Germanicus," one of these he put to
					death, when he began to suspect Sejanus; and another, after he was taken off. It
					would be tedious to relate all the numerous instances of his cruelty: suffice it
					to give a few examples, in their different kinds. Not a day passed without the
					punishment of some person or other, not excepting holidays, or those
					appropriated to the worship of the gods. Some were tried even on NewYear's-Day.
					Of many who were condemned, their wives and children shared the same fate; and
					for those who Were sentenced to death, the relations were forbid to put on
					mourning. Considerable rewards were voted for the prosecutors, and sometimes for
					the witnesses also. The information of any person, without exception, was taken;
					and all offences were capital, even speaking a few words, though without any ill
					intention. A poet was charged with abusing Agamemnon; and a historian,<note anchored="true">A. U. C. 778. Tacit. Annal. iv. The historian's name was A.
						Cremutius Cordo. Dio has preserved the passage, xlvii. p. 6I9. <placeName key="tgn,2200724">Brutus</placeName> had already called Cassius "The
						last of the Romans," in his lamentation over his dead body. </note> for
					calling Brutus and Cassius " the last of the Romans." The two authors were
					immediately called to account, and their writings suppressed; though they had
					been well received some years before, and read in the hearing of Augustus. Some,
					who were thrown into prison, were not only denied the solace of study, but
					debarred from all company and conversation. Many persons, when summoned to
					trial, stabbed themselves at home, to avoid the distress and ignominy of a
					public condemnation, which they were certain would ensue. Others took poison in
					the senate-house. The wounds were bound up, and all who had not expired, were
					carried, half-dead, and panting for life, to prison. Those who were put to
					death, were thrown down the Gemonian stairs, and then dragged into the
						<placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>. In one day, twenty were
					treated in this manner; and amongst them women and boys. Because, according to
					an ancient custom, it was not lawful to strangle virgins, the young girls were
					first deflowered by the executioner, and afterwards strangled. Those who were
					desirous to die, were forced to live. For he thought death so slight a
					punishment, that upon hearing that Carnulius, one of the accused, who was under
					prosecution, had killed himself," he exclaimed, "Carnulius has escaped me." In
					calling over his prisoners, when one of them requested the favour of a speedy
					death, he replied, " You are not yet restored to favour." A man of consular rank
					writes in his annals, that at table, where he himself was present with a large
					company, he was suddenly asked aloud by a dwarf who stood by amongst the
					buffoons, why Paconius, who was under prosecution for treason, lived so long.

				<p>Exasperated by information he received respect ing the death of his son Drusus,

						Germanicus, and Tacitus calls her <placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName>; but Suetonius is in the habit of giving a fondling

					imperial power, that he accomplished his death. In the first place, to remove
					him from about his person, under the pretext of doing him honour, he made him
					his colleague in his fifth consulship; which, although then absent from the

					These produced different effects: sometimes he wished, out of shame, to have all

				<p>At last, being quite weary with himself, he acknowledged his extreme misery, in a
					letter to the senate, which begun thus: "What to write to you, Conscript
					Fathers, or how to write, or what not to write at this time, may all the gods
					and goddesses pour upon my head a more terrible vengeance than that under which
					I feel myself daily sinking, if I can tell." Some are of opinion that he had a
					foreknowledge of those things, from his skill in the science of divination, and
					perceived long before what misery and infamy would at last come upon him; and
					that for this reason, at the beginning of his reign, he had absolutely refused
					the title of the " Father of his Country," and the proposal of the senate to
					swear to his acts; lest he should afterwards, to his greater shame, be found
					unequal to such extraordinary honours. This, indeed, may be justly inferred from
					the speeches which he made upon both those occasions; as when he says, " I shall
					ever be the same, and shall never change my conduct, so long as I retain my
					senses; but to avoid giving a bad precedent to posterity, the senate ought to
					beware of binding themselves to the acts of any person whatever, who might by
					some accident or other be induced to alter them." And again: " If ye should at
					any time entertain a jealousy of my conduct, and my entire affection for you,
					which heaven prevent by putting a period to my days, rather than I should live
					to see such an alteration in your opinion of me, the title of Father will add no
					honour to me, but be a reproach to you, for your rashness in conferring it upon
					me, or inconsistency in altering your opinion of me."</p>

				<p>In person he was large and robust; of a stature somewhat above the common size;
					broad in the shoulders and chest, and proportionable in the rest of his frame.
					He used his left hand more readily and with more force than his right; and his
					joints were so strong, that he could bore a fresh, sound apple through with his
					finger, and wound the head of a boy, or even a young man, with a fillip. He was
					of a fair complexion, and wore his hair so long behind, that it covered his
					neck, which was observed to be a mark of distinction affected by the family. He
					had a handsome face, but it was often full of pimples. His eyes, which were
					large, had a wonderful faculty of seeing in the night-time, and in the dark, for
					a short time only, and immediately after awaking from sleep; but they soon grew
					dim again. He walked with his neck stiff and upright; generally with a frowning
					countenance, being for the most part silent: when he spoke to those about him,
					it was very slowly, and usually accompanied with a slight gesticulation of his
					fingers. All which, being repulsive habits and signs of arrogance, were remarked
					by Augustus, who often endeavoured to excuse them to the senate and people,
					declaring that "they were natural defects, which proceeded from no viciousness
					of mind." He enjoyed a good state of health, without interruption, almost during
					the whole period of his rule; though, from the thirtieth year of his age, he

				<p>He applied himself with great diligence to the liberal arts, both Greek and

					had paid much respect in his own early years. But he rendered his style obscure

					ode, under the title of " A Lamentation upon the Death of Lucius Caesar; " and
					also some Greek poems, in imitation of Euphorion, Rhianus, and Parthenius.<note anchored="true">Obscure Greek poets, whose writings were either full of

					time vied with each other in publishing observations upon them, which they
					addressed to him. His principal study, however, was the history of the fabulous
					ages, inquiring even into its trifling details in a ridiculous manner; for he
					used to try the grammarians, a class of men which, as I have already observed,
					he much affected, with such questions as these: "Who was Hecuba's mother? What
					name did Achilles assume among the virgins? What was it that the Sirens used to
					sing?" And the first day that he entered the senate-house, after the death of

				<head>Remarks on <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName></head>
				<p>At the death of Augustus, there had elapsed so long a period from the overthrow
					of the republic by Julius Caesar, that few were now living who had been born
					under the ancient constitution of the Romans; and the mild and prosperous
					administration of Augustus, during forty-four years, had by this time reconciled
					the minds of the people to a despotic government. <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, the adopted son of the former sovereign, was of
					mature age; and though he had hitherto lived, for the most part, abstracted from
					any concern with public affairs, yet, having been brought up in the family of
					Augustus, he was acquainted with his method of government, which, there was
					reason to expect, he would render the model of his own. <placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName>, too, his mother, and the relict of the
					late emperor, was still living, a woman venerable by years, who had long been
					familiar with the councils of Augustus, and from her high rank, as well as
					uncommon affability, possessed an extensive influence amongst all classes of the
					people.</p>
				<p>Such were the circumstances in favour of <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>'s succession at the demise of Augustus; but there were
					others of a tendency disadvantageous to his views. His temper was haughty and
					reserved: Augustus had often apologised for the ungraciousness of his manners.
					He was disobedient to his mother; and though he had not openly discovered any
					propensity to vice, he enjoyed none of those qualities which usually conciliate
					popularity. To these considerations it is to be added, that Postumus Agrippa,
					the grandson of Augustus by <placeName key="tgn,2428630">Julia</placeName>, was
					living; and if consanguinity was to be the rule of succession, his right was
					indisputably preferable to that of an adopted son. Augustus had sent this youth
					into exile a few years before; but, towards the close of his life, had expressed
					a design of recalling him, with the view, as was supposed, of appointing him his
					successor. The father of young Agrippa had been greatly beloved by the Romans;
					and the fate of his mother, <placeName key="tgn,2428630">Julia</placeName>,
					though she was notorious for her profligacy, had ever been regarded by them with
					peculiar sympathy and tenderness. Many, therefore, attached to the son the
					partiality entertained for his parents; which was increased not only by a strong
					suspicion, but a general surmise, that his elder brothers, Caius and <placeName key="tgn,2023439">Lucius</placeName>, had been violently taken off, to make
					way for the succession of <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>.
					That an obstruction was apprehended to <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>'s succession from this quarter, is put beyond all
					doubt, when we find that the death of Augustus was industriously kept secret,
					until young Agrippa should be removed; who, it is generally agreed, was
					dispatched by an order from <placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName> and
						<placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName> conjointly, or at least
					from the former. Though, by this act, there reilained no rival to <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, yet the consciousness of his own
					want of pretensions to the Roman throne, seems to have still rendered him
					distrustful of the succession; and that he should have quietly obtained it,
					without the voice of the people, the real inclination of the senate, or the
					support of the army, can be imputed only to the influence of his mother, and his
					own dissimulation. Ardently solicitous to attain the object, yet affecting a
					total indifference; artfully prompting the senate to give him the charge of the
					government, at the time that he intimated an invincible reluctance to accept it;
					his absolutely declining it in perpetuity, but fixing no time for an abdication;
					his deceitful insinuation of bodily infirmities, with hints likewise of
					approaching old age, that he might allay in the senate all apprehensions of any
					great duration of nis power, and repress in his adopted son, Germanicus, the
					emotions of ambition to displace him; form altogether a scene of the most
					insidious policy, inconsistency, and dissimulation.</p>
				<p>In this period died, in the eighty-sixth year of her age, Livia Drusilla, mother
					of the emperor, and the relict of Augustus, whom she survived fifteen years. She
					was the daughter of I Drusus Calidianus and married <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName> Claudius Nero, by whom she had two sons, Tiberius and
					Drusus. The conduct of this lady seems to justify the remark of Caligula, that "
					she was an <placeName key="tgn,2446724">Ulysses</placeName> in a woman's dress."
					Octavius first saw her as she fled from the danger which threatened her husband,
					who had espoused the cause of Antony; and though she was then pregnant, he
					resolved to marry her; whether with her own inclination or not, is left by
					Tacitus undetermined. To pave the way for this union, he divorced his wife
					Scribonia, and with the approbation of the Augurs, which he could have no
					difficulty in obtaining, celebrated his nuptials with <placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName>. There ensued from this marriage no
					issue, though much desired by both parties; but <placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName> retained, without interruption, an unbounded ascendancy
					over the emperor, whose confidence she abused, while the uxorious husband little
					suspected that he was cherishing in his bosom a viper who was to prove the
					destruction of his house. She appears to have entertained a predominant ambition
					of giving an heir to the Roman empire; and since it could not be done by any
					fruit of her marriage with Augustus, she resolved on accomplishing that end in
					the person of <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, the eldest son
					by her former husband. The plan which she devised for this purpose, was to
					exterminate all the male offspring of Augustus by his daughter Julia, who was
					married to Agrippa; a stratagem which, when executed,.would procure for
						<placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, through the means of
					adoption, the eventual succession to the empire. The cool yet sanguinary policy,
					and the patient perseverance of resolution, with which she prosecuted her
					design, have seldom been equalled. While the sons of <placeName key="tgn,2428630">Julia</placeName> were yet young, and while there was
					still a possibility that she herself might have issue by Augustus, she suspended
					her project, in the hope, perhaps, that accident or disease might operate in its
					favour; but when the natural term of her constitution had put a period to her
					hopes of progeny, and when the grandsons of the emperor were risen to the years
					of manhood, and had been adopted by him, she began to carry into execution what
					she long had meditated. The first object devoted to destruction was C. Caesar
					Agrippa, the eldest of Augustus's grandsons. This promising youth was sent to
						<placeName key="tgn,1023711">Armenia</placeName>, upon an expedition against
					the Persians; and Lollius, who had been his governor, either accompanied him
					thither from <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, or met him in the
					East, where he had obtained some appointment. From the hand of this traitor,
					perhaps under the pretext of exercising the authority of a preceptor, but in
					reality instigated by <placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName>, the young
					prince received a fatal blow, of which he died some time after.</p>
				<p>The manner of Caius's death seems to have been carefully kept from the knowledge
					of Augustus, who promoted Lollius to the consulship, and made him governor of a
					province; but, by his rapacity in this station, he afterwards incurred the
					emperor's displeasure. The true character of this person had escaped the keen
					discernment of <placeName key="tgn,2399199">Horace</placeName>, as well as the
					sagacity of the emperor; for in two epistles addressed to Lollius, he mentions
					him as great and accomplished in the superlative degree; <foreign xml:lang="lat">maxime Lolli, liberrime Lolli</foreign>; so imposing had been the manners
					and address of this deceitfnl courtier.</p>
				<p><placeName key="tgn,2023439">Lucius</placeName>, the second son of <placeName key="tgn,2024572">Julia</placeName>, was banished into <placeName key="tgn,7003005">Campania</placeName>, for using, as it is said, seditious
					language against his grandfather. In the seventh year of his exile, Augustus
					proposed to recall him; but <placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName> and
						<placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, dreading the consequences
					of his being restored to the emperor's favour, put in practice the expedient of
					having him immediately assassinated. Postumus Agrippa, the third son, incurred
					the displeasure of his grandfather in the same way as <placeName key="tgn,2023439">Lucius</placeName>, and was confined at <placeName key="tgn,7004648">Surrentum</placeName>, where he remained a prisoner until
					he was put to death by the order either of <placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName> alone, or in conjunction with <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, as was before observed.</p>
				<p>Such was the catastrophe, through the means of <placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName>, of all the grandsons of Augustus; and reason justifies
					the inference, that she who scrupled not to lay violent hands upon those young
					men, had formerly practised every artifice that could operate towards rendering
					them obnoxious to the emperor. We may even ascribe to her dark intrigues the
					dissolute conduct of <placeName key="tgn,2024572">Julia</placeName>: for the
					woman who could secretly act as procuress to her own husband, would feel little
					restraint upon her mind against corrupting his daughter, when such an effect
					might contribute to answer the purpose which she had in view. But in the
					ingratitude of <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, however
					undutiful and reprehensible in a son towards a parent, she at last experienced a
					just retribution for the crimes in which she had trained him to procure the
					succession to the empire. To the disgrace of her sex, she introduced amongst the
					Romans the horrible practice of domestic murder, little known before the times
					when the thirst or intoxication of unlimited power had vitiated the social
					affections; and she transmitted to succeeding ages a pernicious example, by
					which immoderate ambition might be gratified, at the expense of every moral
					obligation, as well as of humanity.</p>
				<p>One of the first victims in the sanguinary reign of the present emperor, was
					Germanicus, the son of Drusus, <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>'s own brother, and who had been adopted by his uncle
					himself. Under any sovereign, of a temper different from that of <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, this amiable and meritorious prince
					would have been held in the highest esteem. At the death of his grandfather
					Augustus, he was employed in a war in <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, where he greatly distinguished himself by his military
					achievements; and as soon as intelligence of that event arrived, the soldiers,
					by whom he was extremely beloved, unanimously saluted him emperor. Refusing,
					however, to accept this mark of their partiality, he persevered in allegiance to
					the government of his uncle, and prosecuted the war with success. Upon the
					conclusion of this expedition, he was sent, with the title of emperor in the
					East, to repress the seditions of the Armenians, in which he was equally
					successful. But the fame which he acquired, served only to render him an object
					of jealousy to <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, by whose order
					he was secretly poisoned at <placeName key="tgn,2275537">Daphne</placeName>,
					near <placeName key="tgn,2073463">Antioch</placeName>, in the thirtyfourth year
					of his age. The news of Germanicus's death was received at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> with universal lamentation; and all ranks
					of the people entertained an opinion, that, had he survived <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, he would have restored the freedom
					of the republic. The love and grditude of the Romans decreed many honours to his
					memory. It was ordered, that his name should be sung in a solemn procession of
					the Salii; that crowns of oak, in allusion to his victories, should be placed
					upon curule chairs in the hall pertaining to the priests of Augustus; and that
					an effigy of him in ivory should be drawn upon a chariot, preceding the
					ceremonies of the Circensian games. Triumphal arches were erected, one at
						<placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, another on the banks of the
						<placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName>, and a third upon Mount
					Amanus in <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, with inscriptions of
					his achievements, and that he died for his services to the republic.<note anchored="true">Tacit. Annal. lib. ii.</note></p>
				<p>His obsequies were celebrated, not with the display of images and funeral pomp,
					but with the recital of his praises and the virtues which rendered him
					illustrious. From a resemblance in his personal accomplishments, his age, the
					manner of his death, and the vicinity of <placeName key="tgn,7010768">Daphne</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName>,
					many compared his fate to that of Alexander the Great. He was celebrated for
					humanity and benevolence, as well as military talents, and amidst the toils of
					war, found leisure to cultivate the arts of literary genius. He composed two
					comedies in Greek, some epigrams, and a translation of Aratus into Latin verse.
					He married Agrippina, the daughter of M. Agrippa, by whom he had nine children.
					This lady, who had accompanied her husband into the east, carried his ashes to
						<placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, and accused his murderer,
					Piso; who, unable to bear up against the public odium incurred by that
					transaction, laid violent hands upon himself. Agrippina was now nearly in the
					same predicament with regard to Tiberius, that Ovid had formerly been in respect
					of Augustus. He was sensible, that when she accused Piso, she was not ignorant
					of the person by whom the perpetrator of the murder had been instigated; and her
					presence, therefore, seeming continually to reproach him with his guilt, he
					resolved to rid himself of a person become so obnoxious to his sight, and
					banished her to the island of Pandataria, where she died some time afterwards
					with famine.</p>
				<p>But it was not sufficient to gratify this sanguinary tyrant, that he had, without
					any cause, cut off both Germanicus and his wife Agrippina: the distinguished
					merits and popularity of that prince were yet to be revenged upon his children;
					and accordingly he set himself to invent a pretext for their destruction. After
					endeavouring in vain, by various artifices, to provoke the resentment of
						<placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName> and Drusus against him, he had
					recourse to false accusation, and not only charged them with seditious designs,
					to which their tender years were ill adapted, but with vices of a nature the
					most scandalous. By a sentence of the senate, which manifested the extreme
					servility of that assembly, he procured them both to be declared open enemies to
					their country. <placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName> he banished to the
					island'of Pontia, where, like his unfortunate mother, he miserably perished by
					famine; and Drusus was doomed to the same fate, in the lower part of the
					Palatium, after suffering for nine days the violence of hunger, and having, as
					is related, devoured part of his bed. The remaining son, Caius, on account of
					his vicious disposition, he resolved to appoint his successor on the throne,
					that, after his own death, a comparison might be made in favour of his own
					memory, when the Romans should be governed by a sovereign yet more vicious and
					more tyrannical, if possible, than himself.</p>
				<p>Sejanus, the minister in the present reign, imitated with success, for some time,
					the hypocrisy of his master; and, had his ambitious temper, impatient of
					attaining its object, allowed him to wear the mask for a longer period, he might
					have gained the imperial diadem; in the pursuit of which he was overtaken by
					that fate which he merited still more by his cruelties than his perfidy to
					Tiberms. This man was a native of Volsinium in <placeName key="tgn,7009760">Tuscany</placeName>, and the son of a Roman knight. He had first insinuated
					himself into the favour of Caius Caesar, the grandson of Augustus, after whose
					death he courted the friendship of Tiberius, and obtained m a short time his
					entire confidence, which he improved to the best advantage. The object which he
					next pursued, was to gain the attachment of the senate, and the officers of the
					army; besides whom, with a new kind of policy, he endeavoured to secure in his
					interest every lady of distinguished connections, by giving secretly to each of
					them a promise of marriage, as soon as he should arrive at the sovereignty. The
					chief obstacles in his way were the sons and grandsons of Tiberius; and these he
					soon sacrificed to his ambition, under various pretences. Drusus, the eldest of
					this progeny, having in a fit of passion struck the favourite, was destined by
					him to destruction. For this purpose, he had the presumption to seduce Livia,
					the wife of Drusus, to whom she had borne several children; and she consented to
					marry her adulterer upon the death of her husband, who was soon after poisoned,
					through the means of an eunuch named Lygdus, by order of her and Sejanus. Drusus
					was the son of Tiberius by Vipsania, one of Agrippa's daughters. He displayed
					great intrepidity during the war m the provinces of <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,4008442">Pannonia</placeName>, but appears to have been dissolute in his morals.
						<placeName key="tgn,2399199">Horace</placeName> is said to have written the
					Ode in praise of Drusus at the desire of Augustus; and while the poet celebrates
					the military courage of the prince, he insinuates indirectly a salutary
					admonition to the cultivation of the civil virtues: <cit>
						<quote xml:lang="lat"><l>Doctrina sed vim promovet insitam,</l>
							<l>Rectique cultus pectora roborant:</l>
							<l>Utcumque defecere mores,</l>

					</cit></p>
				<p>Upon the death of Drusus, Sejanus openly avowed a desire of marrying the widowed
					princess; but Tiberius opposing this measure, and at the same time recommending
					Germanicus to the senate as his successor in the empire, the mind of Sejanus was
					more than ever inflamed by the united, and now furious, passions of love and
					ambition. He therefore urged his demand with increased importunity; but the
					emperor still refusing his consent, and things being not yet ripe for an
					immediate revolt, Sejanus thought nothing so favourable for the prosecution of
					his designs as the absence of Tiberius from the capital. With this view, under
					the pretence of relieving his master from the cares of government, he persuaded
					him to retire to a distance from <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>.
					The emperor, indolent and luxurious, approved of the proposal, and retired into
						<placeName key="tgn,7003005">Campania</placeName>, leaving to his ambitious
					minister the whole direction of the empire. Had Sejanus now been governed by
					common prudence and moderation, he might have attained to the accomplishment of
					all his wishes; but a natural impetuosity of temper, and the intoxication of
					power, precipitated him into measures which soon effected his destruction. As if
					entirely emancipated from the control of a master, he publicly declared himself
					sovereign of the Roman empire, and that Tiberius, who had by this time retired
					to <placeName key="tgn,7006855">Capri</placeName>, was only the dependent prince
					of that tributary island. He even went so far in degrading the emperor, as to
					have him introduced in a ridiculous light upon the stage. Advice of Sejanus's
					proceedings was soon carried to the emperor at <placeName key="tgn,7006855">Capri</placeName>; his indignation was immediately excited; and with a
					confidence founded upon an authority exercised for several years, he sent orders
					for accusing Sejanus before the senate. This mandate no sooner arrived, than the
					audacious minister was deserted by his adherents; he was in a short time after
					seized without resistance, and strangled in prison the same day.</p>
				<p>Human nature recoils with horror at the cruelties of this execrable tyrant, who,
					having first imbrued his hands in the blood of his own relations, proceeded to
					exercise them upon the public with indiscriminate fury. Neither age nor sex
					afforded any exemption from his insatiable thirst for blood. Innocent children
					were condemned to death, and butchered in the presence of their parents;
					virgins, without any imputed guilt, were sacrificed to a similar destiny; but
					there being an ancient custom of not strangling females in that situation, they
					were first deflowered by the executioner, and afterwards strangled, as if an
					atrocious addition to cruelty could sanction the exercise of it. Fathers were
					constrained by violence to witness the death of their own children; and even the
					tears of a mother, at the execution of her child, were punished as a capital
					offence. Some extraordinary calamities, occasioned by accident, added to the
					horrors of the reign. A great number of houses on Mount Ccelius were destroyed
					by fire; and by the fall of a temporary building at Fidenae, erected for the
					purpose of exhibiting public shows, about twenty thousand persons were either
					greatly hurt, or crushed to death in the ruins.</p>
				<p>By another fire which afterwards broke out, a part of the Circus was destroyed,
					with the numerous buildings on Mgunt Aventine. The only act of munificence
					displayed by Tiberius during his reign, was upon the occasion of those fires,
					when, to qualify the severity of his government, he indemnified the most
					considerable sufferers for the loss they had sustained.</p>
				<p>Through the whole of his life, Tiberius seems to have conducted himself with a
					uniform repugnance to nature. Affable on a few occasions, but in general averse
					to society, he indulged, from his earliest years, a moroseness of disposition,
					which counterfeited the appearance of austere virtue; and in the decline of
					life, wRien it is common to reform from juvenile indiscretions, he launched
					forth into excesses, of a kind the most.unnatural and most detestable.
					Considering the vicious passions which had ever brooded in his heart, it may
					seem surprising that he restrained himself within the bounds of decency during
					so many years after his accession; but though utterly destitute of reverence or
					affection for his mother, he still felt, during her life, a filial awe upon his
					mind: and after her death, ie was actuated by a slavish fear of Sejanus, until
					at last political necessity absolved him likewise from this restraint. These
					checks being both removed, he rioted without any control, either from sentiment
					or authority.</p>
				<p><placeName key="tgn,2119609">Pliny</placeName> relates, that the art of making
					glass malleable was actually discovered under the reign of <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, and that the shop and tools of the
					artist were destroyed, lest, by the establishment of this invention, gold and
					silver should lose their value. Dion adds, that the author of the discovery was
					put to death.</p>
				<p>The gloom which darkened the Roman capital during this melancholy period, shed a
					baleful influence on the progress of science throughout the empire, and
					literature languished during the present reign, in the same proportion as it:had
					flourished in the preceding. It is doubtful' whether such a change might not
					have happened in some degree, even had the government of Tiberius been equally
					mild with that of his predecessor. The prodigious fame of the writers of the
					Augustan age, by repressing emulation, tended to a general diminution of the
					efforts of genius for some time; while the banishment of <placeName key="tgn,2016081">Ovid</placeName>, it is probable, and the capital
					punishment of a subsequent poet, for censuring the character of Agamemnon,
					operated towards the farther discouragement of poetical exertions. There now
					existed no circumstance to counterbalance these disadvantages. Genius no longer
					found a patron either in the emperor or his minister; and the gates of the
					palace were shut against all who cultivated the elegant pursuits of the Muses.
					Panders, catamites, assassins, wretches stained with every crime, were the
					constant attendants, as the only fit companions, of the tyrant who now occupied
					the throne. We are informed, however, that even this emperor had a taste for the
					liberal arts, and that he composed a lyric poem upon the death of Lucius Caesar,
					with some Greek poems in imitation of Euphorion, Rhianus, and Parthenius. But
					none of these has been transmitted to posterity: and if we should form an
					opinion of them upon the principle of Catullus, that to be a good poet one ought
					to be a good man, there is little reason to regret that they have perished. </p>
