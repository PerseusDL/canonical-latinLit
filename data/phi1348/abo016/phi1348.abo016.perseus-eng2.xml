			<div type="textpart" n="1" subtype="chapter">
				<p>Two celebrated families, the Calvini and Aenobarbi, sprung from the race of the
					Domitii. The AEnobarbi derive both their extraction and their cognomen from one
					Lucius Domitius, of whom we have this tradition:-As he was returning out of
					the country to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, he was met by two
					young men of a most august appearance, who desired him to announce to the senate
					and people a victory, of which no certain intelligence had yet reached the city.
					To prove that they were more than mortals, they stroked his cheeks, and thus
					changed his hair, which was black, to a bright colour, resembling that of brass;
					which mark of distinction descended to his posterity, for they had generally red
					beards. This family had the honour of seven consulships, one triumph, and two
					censorships; and being admitted into the patrician order, they continued the use
					of the same cognomen, with no other praenomina, than those of Cneius and
						Lucius. These, however, they
					assumed with singular irregularity; three persons in succession sometimes
					adhering to one of them, and then they were changed alternately. For the first,
					second, and third of the AEnobarbi had the praenomen of Lucius, and again the three following,
					successively, that of Cneius, while those who came after were called, by turns,
					one, Lucius, and the other, Cneius. It
					appears to me proper to give a short account of several of the family, to show
					that Nero so far degenerated from the
					noble qualities of his ancestors, that he retained only their vices; as if those
					alone had been transmitted to him by his descent.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="2" subtype="chapter">
				<p>To begin, therefore, at a remote period, his greatgrandfather's grandfather,
					Cneius Domitius, when he was tribune of the people, being offended with the high
					priests for electing another than himself in the room of his father, obtained
					the transfer of the right of election from the colleges of the priests to the
					people. In his consulship,<note anchored="true">A.U.C. 632</note> having
					conquered the Allobroges and the Arverni,<note anchored="true">The Allobroges
						were a tribe of Gauls, inhabiting Dauphiny and <placeName key="tgn,2050549">Savoy</placeName>; the Averni have left their name in <placeName key="tgn,7002871">Auvergne</placeName>.</note> he made a progress
					through the province, mounted upon an elephant, with a body of soldiers
					attending him, in a sort of triumphal pomp. Of this person the orator Licinius
					Crassus said, "It was no wonder he had a brazen beard, who had a face of iron,
					and a heart of lead." His son, during his praetorship,<note anchored="true">A.U.C. 695</note> proposed that Cneius Caesar, upon the expiration of his
					consulship, should be called to account before the senate for his administration
					of that office, which was supposed to be contrary both to the omens and the
					laws. Afterwards, when he was consul himself,<note anchored="true">A.U.C.
						700</note> he tried to deprive Cneius of the command of the army, and having
					been, by intrigue and cabal, appointed his successor, he was made prisoner at
					Corsinium, in the beginning of the civil war. Being set at liberty, he went to
						<placeName key="tgn,7008781">Marseilles</placeName>, which was then
					besieged; where having by his presence, animated the people to hold out, he
					suddenly deserted them, and at last was slain in the battle of Pharsalia. He was
					a man of little constancy, and of a sullen temper. In despair of his fortunes,
					he had recourse to poison, but was so terrified at the thoughts of death, that,
					immediately repenting, he took a vomit to throw it up again, and gave freedom to
					his physician for having, with great prudence and wisdom, given him only a
					gentle dose of the poison. When Cneius Pompey was consulting with his friends in
					what manner he should conduct himself towards those who were neuter and took no
					part in the contest, he was the only one who proposed that they should be
					treated as enemies.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="3" subtype="chapter">
				<p>He left a son, who was, without doubt, the best of the family. By the Pedian law,
					he was condemned, although innocent, amongst others who were concerned in the
					death of Caesar.<note anchored="true">A. U. C. 711.</note> Upon this, he went
					over to Brutus and Cassius, his near relations; and, after their death, not only
					kept together the fleet, the command of which had been given him some time
					before, but even increased it.</p>
				<p>At last, when the party had everywhere been defeated, he voluntarily surrendered
					it to Mark Antony; considering it as a piece of service for which the latter
					owed him no small obligations. Of all those who were condemned by the law
					above-mentioned, he was the only man who was restored to his country, and filled
					the highest offices. When the civil war again broke out, he was appointed
					lieutenant under the.same Antony, and offered the chief command by those who
					were ashamed of Cleopatra; but not daring, on account of a sudden indisposition
					with which he was seized, either to accept or refuse it, he went over to
						Augustus,<note anchored="true">A. U. C. 723.</note> and died a few days
					after, not without an aspersion cast upon his memory. For Antony gave out, that
					he was induced to change sides by his impatience to be with his mistress,
					Servilia Nais. <note anchored="true">Nais seems to have been a freedwoman, who
						had been allowed to adopt the family name of her master. </note></p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="4" subtype="chapter">
				<p>This Cneius had a son, named Domitius, who was afterwards well known as the
					nominal purchaser of the family property left by Augustus's will; <note anchored="true">By one of those fictions of law, which have abounded in all
						systems of jurisprudence, a nominal alienation of his property was made in
						the testator's life-time.</note> and no less famous in his youth for his
					dexterity in chariot-driving, than he was afterwards for the triumphal ornaments
					which he obtained in the German war. But he was a man of great arrogance,
					prodigality, and cruelty. When he was aedile, he obliged Lucius Plancus, the
					censor, to give him the way; and in his praetorship, and consulship, he made
					Roman knights and married women act on the stage. He gave hunts of wild beasts,
					both in the Circus and in all the wards of the city; as also a show of
					gladiators; but with such barbarity, that Augustus, after privately reprimanding
					him, to no purpose, was obliged to restrain him by a public edict.</p>

				<p>By the elder Antonia he had Nero's father, a man of execrable character in every
					part of his life. During his attendance upon Caius Caesar in the East, he killed
					a freedman of his own, for refusing to drink as much as he ordered him. Being
					dismissed for this from Caesar's society, he did not mend his habits, for, in a
					village upon the Appian road, he suddenly whipped his horses, and drove his
					chariot, on purpose, over a poor boy, crushing him to pieces. At <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, he struck out the eye of a Roman knight
					in the Forum, only for some free language in a dispute between them. He was
					likewise so fraudulent, that he not only cheated some silversmiths<note anchored="true">The suggestion offered (note, p. 138), that the Argentarii,
						like the goldsmiths of the middle ages, combined the business of bankers, or
						money changers, with dealings in gold and silver plate, is confirmed by this

					bought of them, but, during his praetorship, defrauded the owners of chariots in
					the Circensian games of the prizes due to them for their victory. His sister,
					jeering him for the complaints made by the leaders of the several parties, he
					agreed to sanction a law, " That, for the future, the prizes should be
					immediately paid." A little before the death of Tiberius, he was prosecuted for
					treason, adulteries, and incest with his sister T.picla, hut escaped in the
					timely change of affairs, and died of a dropsy, at <placeName key="tgn,7008308">Pyrgi</placeName>;<note anchored="true"><placeName key="tgn,7008308">Pyrgi</placeName> was a town of the ancient Etruria, near <placeName key="tgn,7015535">Antium</placeName>, on the sea coast, but it has long

					[15th December], just as the sun rose, so that its beams touched him before they
					could well reach the earth. While many fearful conjectures, in respect to his
					future fortune, were formed by different persons, from the circumstances of his
					nativity, a saying of his father, Domitius, was regarded as an ill presage, who
					told his friends who were congratulating him upon the occasion, "That nothing
					but what was detestable and pernicious to the public, could ever be produced of
					him and Agrippina." Another manifest prognostic of his future infelicity
					occurred upon his lustration day.<note anchored="true">The purification, and

						similar. See Matt. i. 59-63. Luke iii. 21, 22.</note> For Caius Caesar being
					requested by his sister to give the child what name he thought proper—looking
					at his uncle, Claudius, who afterwards, when emperor, adopted <placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName>, he gave his: and this not seriously, but
					only in jest; Agrippina treating it with contempt, because Claudius at that time
					was a mere laughing-stock at the palace. He lost his father when he was three
					years old, being left heir to a third part of his estate; of which he never got
					possession, the whole being seized by his co-heir, Caius. His mother being soon
					after banished, he lived with his aunt Lepida, in a very necessitous condition,
					under the care of two tutors, a dancing-master and a barber. After Claudius came
					to the empire, he not only recovered his father's estate, but was enriched with
					the additional inheritance of that of his step-father, Crispus Passienus. Upon
					his mother's recall from banishment, he ,vas advanced to such favour, through
						<placeName key="tgn,2538428">Nero</placeName>'s powerful /terest with the
					emperor, that it was reported, assassins were employed by Messalina, Claudius's
					wife, to strangle him, as Britannicus's rival, whilst he was taking his noon-day
					repose. In addition to the story, it was said that they were frightened by a
					serpent, which crept from under his cushion, and ran away. The tale was
					occasioned by finding on his couch, near the pillow, the skin of a snake, which,
					by his mother's order, he wore for some time upon his right arm, inclosed in a
					bracelet of gold. This amulet, at last, he laid aside, from aversion to her
					memory; but he sought for it again in vain, in the time of his extremity.</p>

				<p>When he was yet a mere boy, before he arrived at the age of puberty, during the
					celebration of the Circensian Games,<note anchored="true">A.U.C. 806</note> he
					performed his part in the Trojan play with a degree of firmness which gained him

					been made a senator. It is said, that <placeName key="tgn,2652379">Seneca</placeName> dreamt the night after, that he was giving a lesson to
					Caius Caesar.<note anchored="true">Caligula</note> Nero soon verified his dream,
					betraying the cruelty of his disposition in every way he could. For he attempted
					to persuade his father that his brother, Britannicus, was nothing but a
					changeling, because the latter had saluted him, notwithstanding his adoption, by
					the name of ,Enobarbus, as usual. When his aunt, Lepida, was brought to trial,
					he appeared in court as a witness against her, to gratify his mother, who
					persecuted the accused. On his introduction into the Forum, at the age of
					manhood, he gave a largess to the people and a donative to the soldiers; for the
					pretorian cohorts, he appointed a solemn procession under arms, and marched at
					the head of them with a shield in his hand; after which he went to return thanks
					to his father in the senate. Before Claudius, likewise, at the time he was
					consul, he made a speech for the Bolognese, in Latin, and for the Rhodians and
					people of <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName>, in Greek. He had the
					jurisdiction of praefect of the city, for the first time, during the Latin
					festival; during which the most celebrated advocates brought before him, not
					short and trifling causes, as is usual in that case, but trials of importance,
					notwithstanding they had instructions from Claudius himself to the contrary.
					Sooa afterwards, he married Octavia, and exhibited the Circensian games, and
					hunting of wild beasts, in honour of Claudius.</p>

				<p>He was seventeen years of age at the death of that prince,<note anchored="true">A. U. C. 809—<date when="0087">A. D. 87</date>.</note> and as soon as
					that event was made public, he went out to the cohort on guard between the hours
					of six and seven; for the omens were so disastrous, that no earlier time of the
					day was judged proper. On the steps before the palace gate, he was unanimously
					saluted by the soldiers as their emperor, and then carried in a litter to the
					camp; thence, after making a short speech to the troops, into the senate-house,
					where he continued until the evening; of all the immense honours which were
					heaped upon him, refusing but the title of FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY, on account of

				<p>He began his reign with an ostentation of dutiful regard to the memory of
					Claudius, whom he buried with the utmost pomp and magnificence, pronouncing the
					funeral oration himself, and then had him enrolled amongst the gods. He paid
					likewise the highest honours to the memory of his father Domitius. He left the
					management of affairs, both public and private, to his mother. The word which he
					gave the first day of his reign to the tribune on guard, was, "The Best of
					Mothers," and afterwards he frequently appeared with her in the streets of

				<p>To establish still further his character, he declared, "that he designed to
					govern according to the model of Augustus;" and omitted no opportunity of
					showing his generosity, clemency, and complaisance. The more burthensome taxes
					he either entirely took off, or diminished. The rewards appointed for informers
					by the Papian law, he reduced to a fourth part, and distributed to the people
					four hundred sesterces a man. To the noblest of the senators who were much
					reduced in their circumstances, he granted annual allowances, in some cases as
					much as five hundred thousand sesterces; and to the pretorian cohorts a monthly
					allowance of corn gratis. When called upon to subscribe the sentence, according
					to custom, of a criminal condemned to die, "I wish," said he, "I had never
					learnt to read and write." He continually saluted people of the several orders
					by name, without a prompter. When the senate returned him their thanks for his
					good government, he replied to them, " It will be time enough to do so when I
					shall have deserved it." He admitted the common people to see him perform his
					exercises in the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName>. He
					frequently declaimed in public, and recited verses of his own composing, not
					only at home, but in the theatre; so much to the joy of all the people,'that
					public prayers were appointed to be put to the gods upon that account; and the
					verses which had been publicly read, were, after being written in gold letters,
					consecrated to Jupiter Capitolinus.</p>

				<p>He presented the people with a great number and variety of spectacles, as the
					Juvenal and Circensian games, stage-plays, and an exhibition of gladiators. In
					the Juvenal, he even admitted senators and aged matrons to perform parts. In the
					Circensian games, he assigned the equestrian order seats apart from the rest of
					the people, and had races performed by chariots drawn each by four camels. In
					the games which he instituted for the eternal duration of the empire, and
					therefore ordered to be called Maximi, many of the senatorian and equestrian
					order, of both sexes performed. A distinguished Roman knight descended on the
					stage by a rope, mounted on an elephant. A Roman play, likewise, composed by
					Afranius, was brought upon the stage. It was entitled, "The Fire; " and in it
					the performers were allowed to carry off, and to keep to themselves, the
					furniture of the house, which, as the plot of the play required, was burnt down
					in the theatre. Every day during the solemnity, many thousand articles of all
					descriptions were thrown amongst the people to scramble f6r; such as fowls of
					different kinds, tickets for corn, clothes, gold. silver, gems. pearls,
					pictures, slaves, beasts of burden, wild beasts that had been tamed; at last,
					ships, lots of houses, and lands, were offered as prizes in a lottery.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="12" subtype="chapter">
				<p>These games he beheld from the front of the proscenium. In the show of

						Martius</placeName>,<note anchored="true">A.U.C. 810</note> he ordered that
					none should be slain, not even the condemned criminals employed in the combats.
					He secured four hundred senators, and six hundred Roman knights, amongst whom
					were some of unbroken fortunes and unblemished reputation, to act as gladiators.
					From the same orders, he engaged persons to encounter wild beasts, and for
					various other services in the theatre. He presented the public with the
					representation of a naval fight, upon sea-water, with huge fishes swimming in
					it; as also with the Pyrrhic dance, performed by certain youths, to each of

					Neronia. Upon the aedication of his bath<note anchored="true">The baths of Nero
						stood to the west of the Pantheon. They were, probably, incorporated with
						those afterwards constructed by Alexander Severus; but no vestige of them

					</note> and gymnasium, he furnished the senate and the equestrian order with
					oil. He appointed as judges of the trial men of consular rank, chosen by lot,
					who sat with the praetors. At this time he went down into the orchestra among
					the senators, and received the crown for the best performance in Latin prose and
					verse, for which several persons of the greatest merit contended, but they
					unanimously yielded to him. The crown for the best performer an the harp, being
					likewise awarded to him by the judges, he devoutly saluted it, and ordered it to
					be carried to the statue of Augustus. In the gymnastic exercises, which he
					presented in the Septa, while they were preparing the great sacrifice of an ox,
					he shaved his beard for the first time, <note anchored="true">Among the Romans,
						the time at which young men first shaved the beard was marked with
						particular ceremony. It was usually in their twenty-first year, but the
						period varied. Caligula (c. x.) first shaved at twenty; Augustus at
						twenty-five. </note> and putting it up in a casket of gold studded with
					pearls of great price, consecrated it to Jupiter Capitolinus. He invited the
					Vestal Virgins to see the wrestlers perform, because, at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>, the priestesses of <placeName key="tgn,7010621">Ceres</placeName> are allowed the privilege of witnessing

					prevented by very unfavourable weather from showing him to the people upon the
					day fixed by proclamation, he took the first opportunity which occurred; several
					cohorts being drawn up under arms, about the temples and in the forum, while he
					was seated on a curule chair on the rostra, in a triumphal dress, amidst the
					military standards and ensigns. Upon Tiridates advancing towards him, on a stage
					made shelving for the purpose, he permitted him to throw himself at his feet,
					but quickly raised him with his right hand, and kissed him. The emperor then, at
					the king's request, took the turban from his head, and replaced it by a crown,
					whilst a person of pretorian rank proclaimed in Latin the words in which the
					prince addressed the emperor as a suppliant. After this ceremony, the king was
					conducted to the theatre, where, after renewing his obeisance, Nero seated him

				<p>Among the other liberal arts which he was taught in his youth, he was instructed

					Terpnus, a performer upon the harp,<note anchored="true">Citharoedus: the word
						signifies a vocalist, who with his singing gave an accompaniment on the
						harp.</note> who flourished at that time with the highest reputation.
					Sitting with him for several days following, as he sang and played after supper,
					until late at night, he began by degrees to practise upon the instrument
					himself. Nor did he omit any of those expedients which artists in music adopt,
					for the preservation and improvement of their voices. He would lie upon his back
					with a sheet of lead upon his breast, clear his stomach and bowels by vomits and
					clysters, and forbear the eating of fruits, or food prejudicial to the voice.
					Encouraged by his proficiency, though his voice was neither loud nor clear, he
					was desirous of appearing upon the stage, frequently repeating amongst his
					friends a Greek proverb to this effect: " that no one had any regard for music
					which they never heard." Accordingly, he made his first public appearance at
						<placeName key="tgn,7004474">Naples</placeName>; and although the theatre
					quivered with the sudden shock of an earthquake, he did not desist, until he had
					finished the piece of music he had begun. He played and sung in the same place
					several times, and for several days together; taking only now and then a little
					respite to refresh his voice. Impatient of retirement, it was his custom to go
					from the bath to the theatre; and after dining in the orchestra, amidst a

				<p>At <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> also, being extremely proud of

					gardens." But the soldiers then on guard seconding the voice of the people, he
					promised to comply with their request immediately, and with all his heart. He
					instantly ordered his name to be entered upon the list of musicians who proposed
					to contend, and having thrown his lot into the urn among the rest, took his

					harp, and followed by the military tbunes, and several of his intimate friends.
					After he had taken his station, and made the usual prelude, he commanded Cluvius

					sing the story of Niobe. This he accordingly did, and continued it until nearly
					ten o'clock, but deferred the disposal of the crown, and the remaining part of
					the solemnity, until the next year; that he might have more frequent
					opportunities of performing. But that being too long, he could not refrain from
					often appearing as a public performer during the interval. He made no scruple of
					exhibiting on the stage, even in the spectacles presented to the people by
					private persons, and was offered by one of the praetors, no less than a million
					of sesterces for his services. He likewise sang tragedies in a mask; the visors

				<p>He had from his childhood an extravagant passion for horses; and his constant
					talk was of the Circensian races, notwithstanding it was prohibited him.
					Lamenting once, among his fellow-pupils, the case of a charioteer of the green
					party, who was dragged round the circus at the tail of his chariot, and being
					reprimanded by his tutor for it, he pretended that he was talking of Hector. In
					the beginning of his reign, he used to amuse himself daily with chariots drawn
					by four horses, made of ivory, upon a table. He attended at all the lesser
					exhibitions in the circus, at first privately, but at last openly; so that
					nobody ever doubted of his presence on any particular day. Nor did he conceal
					his desire to have the number of the prizes doubled; so that the races being
					increased accordingly, the diversion continued until a late hour; the leaders of
					parties refusing now to bring out their companies for any time less than the
					whole day. Upon this, he took a fancy for driving the chariot himself, and that
					even publicly. Having made his first experiment in the gardens, amidst crowds of
					slaves and other rabble, he at length performed in the view of all the people,
					in the Circus Maximus, whilst one of his freedmen dropped the napkin in the
					place where the magistrates used to give the signal. Not satisfied with

					who bore away the prize. These he accepted so graciously, that he not only gave
					the deputies who brought them an immediate audience, but even invited them to
					his table. Being requested by some of them to sing at supper, and prodigiously
					applauded, he said, " the Greeks were the only people who had an ear for music,
					and were the only good judges of him and his attainments." Without delay he

					adversaries had been on a level with himself he would watch them narrowly,
					defame them privately, and sometimes, upon meeting them, rail at them in very
					scurrilous language; or bribe them, if they were better performers than himself,
					He always addressed the judges with the most profound reverence before he began,
					telling them, " he had done all things that were necessary, by way of
					preparation, but that the issue of the approaching trial was in the hand of
					fortune; and that they, as wise and skilful men, ought to exclude from their
					judgment things merely accidental." Upon their encouraging him to have a good
					heart, he went off with more assurance, but not entirely free from anxiety;

					ill-nature, and saying that he was suspicious of them.</p>

					miscarriage, and could not regain his assurance, until an actor who stood by
					swore he was certain it had not been observed in the midst of the acclamations
					and exultations of the people. When the prize was adjudged to him, he always
					proclaimed it himself; and even entered the list with the heralds. That no
					memory or the least monument might remain of any other victor in the sacred
					Grecian games, he ordered all their statues and pictures to be pulled down,
					dragged away with hooks, and thrown into the common sewers. He drove the chariot
					with various numbers of horses, and at the Olympic games with no fewer than ten;
					though, in a poem of his, he had reflected upon Mithridates for that innovation.
					Being thrown out of his chariot, he was again replaced, but could not retain his
					seat, and was obliged to give it up, before he reached the goal, but was crowned
					notwithstanding. On his departure he declared the whole province a free counry,

					thus much: the porch was so high that there stood in it a colossal statue of
					himself a hundred and twenty feet in height; and the space included in it was so
					ample, that it had triple porticos a mile in length, and a lake like a sea,
					surrounded with buildings which had the appearance of a city. Within its area
					were corn fields, vineyards, pastures, and woods, containing a vast number of
					animals of various kinds, both wild and tame. In other parts it was entirely
					over-laid with gold, and adorned with jewels and mother of pearl. The supper
					rooms were vaulted, and compartments of the ceilings, inlaid with ivory, were
					made to revolve, and scatter flowers; while they contained pipes which shed
					unguents upon the guests. The chief banqueting room was circular, and revolved
					perpetually, night and day, in imitation of the motion of the celestial bodies.
					The baths were supplied with water from the sea and the Albula. Upon the
					dedication of this magnificent house after it was finished, all he said in
					approval of it was, "that he had now a dwelling fit for a man." He commenced
					making a pond for the reception of all the hot springs from <placeName key="tgn,7004516">Baiae</placeName>, which he designed to have continued

				<p>His mother being used to make strict inquiry into what he said or did, and to

					endeavoured to expose her to public resentment, by frequently pretending a
					resolution to quit the government, and retire to <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>. Soon afterwards, he deprived her of all honour and

					receiving information that everything had fallen out contrary to his wish, and
					that she had saved herself by swimming, not knowing what course to take, upon
					her freedman, Lucius Agerinus, bringing word, with great joy, that she was safe
					and well, he privately dropped a poniard by him. He then commanded the freedman

					his mother to assassinate him; at the same time ordering her to be put to death,
					and giving out, that, to avoid punishment for her intended crime, she had laid
					violent hands upon herself. Other circumstances, still more horrible, are
					related on good authority; as that he went to view her corpse, and handling her
					limbs, pointed out some blemishes, and commended other points; and that, growing
					thirsty during the survey, he called for drink. Yet he was never afterwards able
					to bear the stings of his own conscience for this atrocious act, although
					encouraged by the congratulatory addresses of the army, the senate, and people.
					He frequently affirmed that he was haunted by his mother's ghost, and persecuted
					with the whips and burning torches of the Furies. Nay, he attempted by magical
					rites to bring up her ghost from below, and soften her rage against him. When he
					was in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, he durst not attend the

				<p>The world, after tolerating such an emperor for little less than fourteen years,
					at length forsook him; the Gauls, headed by Julius Vindex, who at that time
					governed the province as pro-praetor, being the first to revolt. Nero had been
					formerly told by astrologers, that it would be his fortune to be at last
					deserted by all the world; and this occasioned that celebrated saying of his,
					"An artist can live in any country;" by which he meant to offer as an excuse for
					his practice of music, that it was not only his amusement as a prince, but might
					be his support when reduced to a private station. Yet some of the astrologers
					promised him, in his forlorn state, the rule of the East, and in express words
					the kingdom of <placeName key="tgn,7001371">Jerusalem</placeName>. But the
					greater part of them flattered him with assurances o fhis being restored to his

					things of great value by shipwreck, he scrupled not to say amongst his friends,
					that "the fishes would bring them back to him." At Naples he heard of the
					insurrection in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, on the
					anniversary of the day on which he killed his mother, and bore it with so much
					unconcern, as to excite a suspicion that he was really glad of it, since he had
					now a fair opportunity of plundering those wealthy provinces by the right of
					war. Immediately going to the gymnasium, he witnessed the exercise of the
					wrestlers, with the greatest delight. Being interrupted at supper with letters
					which brought yet worse news, he expressed no greater resentment, than only to
					threaten the rebels. For eight days together, he never attempted to answer any
					letters, nor give any orders, but buried the whole affair in profound
					silence.</p>

				<p>Being roused at last by numerous proclamations of Vindex, treating him with

					to find himself railed at as a pitiful harper, and, instead of Nero, styled
					Aenobarbus: which being his family name, since he was upbraided with it, he
					declared he would resume it, and lay aside the name he had taken by adoption.
					Passing by the other accusations as wholly groundless, he earnestly refuted that
					of his want of skill in an art upon which he had bestowed so much pains, and in
					which he had arrived at such perfection; asking frequently those about him, "if

					either to the senate or people, but calling together some of the leading men at
					his own house, he held a hasty consultation upon the present state of affairs,

				<p>Soon afterwards, he received intelligence that Galba and the Spaniards had
					declared against him; upon which, he faiited, and losing his reason, lay a long

					things had happened to other princes before him, he replied, " I am beyond all
					example wretched, for I have lost an empire whilst I am still living." He,
					nevertheless, abated nothing of his usual luxury and inattention to business.
					Nay, on the arrival of good news from the provinces, he, at a sumptuous
					entertainment, sung with an air of merriment some jovial verses upon the leaders
					of the revolt, which were made public; and accompanied them with suitable

				<p>At the first breaking out of these troubles, it is believed that he had formed
					many designs of a monstrous nature, although conformable enough to his natural

					and the armies, and employ assassins to butcher all the former governors and
					commanders, as men unanimously engaged in a conspiracy against him; to massacre
					the exiles in every quarter, and all the Gaulish population in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; the former lest they should join the
					insurrection; the latter as privy to the designs of their countrymen, and ready
					to support them; to abandon <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>
					itself, to be wasted and plundered by his armies; to poison the whole senate at
					a feast; to fire the city, and then let loose the wild beasts upon the people,
					in order to impede their stopping the progress of the flames. But being deterred
					from the execution of these designs, not so much by remorse of conscience, as by
					despair of being able to effect them; and judging an expedition into <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> necessary, he removed the consuls from
					their office, before the time of its expiration was arrived; and in their room
					assumed the consulship himself without a colleague, as if the fates had decreed
					that <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> should not be conquered, but
					by a consul. Upon assuming the fasces, after an entertainment at the palace, as
					he walked out of the room leaning on the arms of some of his friends, he
					declared, that as soon as he arrived in the province, he would make his
					appearance amongst the troops, unarmed, and do nothing but weep: and that, after
					he had brought the mutineers to repentance, he would, the next day, in the
					public rejoicings, sing songs of triumph, which he must now, without loss of

					enlist; but no qualified persons appearing, he ordered all masters to send a
					certain number of slaves, the best they had, not excepting their stewards and
					secretaries. He commanded the several orders of the people to bring in a fixed
					proportion of their estates, as they stood in the censor's books; all tenants of
					houses and mansions to pay one year's rent forthwith into the exchequer; and
					with unheard-of strictness, would receive only new coin of the purest silver and

				<p>He was also terrified with manifest warnings, both old and new, arising from
					dreams, auspices, and omens. He had never been used to dream before the murder
					of his mother. After that event, he fancied in his sleep that he was steering a
					ship, and that the rudder was forced from him: that he was dragged by his wife
					Octavia into a prodigiously dark place; and was at one time covered over with a
					vast swarm of winged ants, and at another, surrounded by the national images
					which were set up near Pompey's theatre, and hindered from advancing farther;

					the shouts of the soldiers, wishing his destruction, and prosperity to Galba. He

					was recognized and saluted by an old soldier who had been discharged from the

					their horses, and with much difficulty he wound among bushes and briars, and
					along a track through a bed of rushes, over which they spread their cloaks for
					him to walk on. Having reached a wall at the back of the villa, .Phaon advised
					him to hide himself awhile in a sand-pit; when he replied, "I will not go
					under-ground alive." Staying there some little time, while preparations were

					made any alteration in his usual diet. In his dress, and the care of his person
					he was so careless, that he had his hair cut in rings, one above another; and
					when in <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>, he let it grow long
					behind; and he generally appeared in public in the loose dress which he used at

				<p>He was instructed, when a boy, in the rudiments of almost all the liberal

					ancient orators, that he might longer secure his devotion to himself. Therefore,
					having a turn for poetry, he composed verses both with pleasure and ease; nor
					did he, as some think, publish those of other writers as his own. Several little
					pocketbooks and loose sheets have come into my possession, which contain some
					well-known verses in his own hand, and written in such a manner, that it was
					very evident, from the blotting and interlining, that they had not been
					transcribed from a copy, nor dictated by another, but were written by the

					he did. It was the general belief, that, after the crowns he won by his
					performances on the stage, he would the next lustrum have taken his place among
					the wrestlers at the Olympic games. For he was continually practising that art;
					nor did he witness the gymnastic games in any part of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> otherwise than sitting upon the ground
					in the stadium, as the umpires do. And if a pair of wrestlers happened to break
					the bounds, he would with his own hands drag them back into the centre of the
					circle. Because he was thought to equal Apollo in music, and the sun in
					chariot-driving, he resolved also to imitate the achievements of Hercules. And

				<head>Remarks on <placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName></head>
				<p>THOUGH no law had ever passed for regulating the transmission of the imperial
					power, yet the design of conveying it by lineal descent was implied in the
					practice of adoption. By the rule of hereditary succession, Britannicus, the son
					of Claudius, was the natural heir to the throne; but he was supplanted by the
					artifices of his stepmother, who had the address to procure it for her own son,
					Nero. From the time of Augustus it had been the custom of each of the new
					sovereigns to commence his reign in such a manner as tended to acquire
					popularity, however much they all afterwards degenerated from those specious
					beginnings. Whether this proceeded entirely from policy, or that nature was not
					yet vitiated by the intoxication of uncontrolled power, is uncertain; but such
					were the excesses into which they afterwards plunged, that we can scarcely
					exempt any of them, except, perhaps, Claudius, from the imputation of great
					original depravity. The vicious temper of Tiberius was known to his own mother,
					Livia; that of Caligula had been obvious to those about him from his infancy;
					Claudius seems to have had naturally a stronger tendency to weakness than to
					vice; but the inherent wickedness of Nero was discovered at an early period by
					his preceptor Seneca. Yet even this
					emperor commenced his reign in a manner which procured him approbation. Of all
					the Roman emperors who had hitherto reigned, he seems to have been most
					corrupted by profligate favourites, who flattered his follies and vices, to
					promote their own aggrandisement. In the number of these was Tigellinus, who met
					at last with the fate which he had so amply merited.</p>
				<p>The several reigns from the death of Augustus present us with uncommon scenes of
					cruelty and horror; but it was reserved for that of Nero to exhibit to the world the atrocious act of an emperor
					deliberately procuring the death of his mother.</p>
				<p>Julia Agrippina was the daughter of Germanicus, and married Domitius Enobarbus,
					by whom she had Nero. At the death of Messalina she was a widow; and Claudius,
					her uncle, entertaining a design of entering again into the married state, she
					aspired to an incestuous alliance with him, in competition with Lollia Paulina,
					a woman of beauty and intrigue, who had been married to C. Caesar. The two
					rivals were strongly supported by their respective parties; but Agrip pina, by
					her superior interest with the emperor's favourites, and the familiarity to
					which her near relations gave her a claim, obtained the preference; and the
					portentous nuptials of the emperor and his niece were publicly solemnized in the
					palace. Whether she was prompted to this flagrant indecency by personal ambition
					alone, or by the desire of procuring the succession to the empire for her son,
					is uncertain; but there remains no doubt of her having removed Claudius by
					poison, with a view to the object now mentioned. Besides Claudius, she projected
					the death of L. Silanus, and she accomplished that of his brother Junius
					Silanus, by means likewise of poison. She appears to have been richly endowed
					with the gifts of nature, but in her disposition intriguing, violent, imperious,
					and ready to sacrifice every principle of virtue, in the pursuit of supreme
					power or sensual gratification As she resembled Livia in the ambition of a
					mother, and the means by which she indulged it, so she more than equalled her in
					the ingratitude of an unnatural son and a parricide. She is said to have left
					behind her some memoirs, of which Tacitus availed .himself in the composition of
					his Annals.</p>
				<p>In this reign, the conquest of the Britons still continued to be the principal
					object of military enterprise, and Suetonius Paulinus was invested with the
					command of the Roman army employed in the reduction of that people. The island
					of <placeName key="tgn,7005258">Mona</placeName>, now <placeName key="tgn,7008532">Anglesey</placeName>, being the chief seat of the Druids,
					he resolved to commence his operations with attacking a place which was the
					centre of superstition, and to which the vanquished Britons retreated as the
					last asylum of liberty. The inhabitants, endeavoured, both by force of arms and
					the terrors of religion, to obstruct his landing on this sacred island. The
					women and Druids assembled promiscuously with the soldiers upon the shore, where
					running about in wild disorder, with flaming torches in their hands, and pouring
					forth the most hideous exclamations, they struck the Romans with consternation.
					But Suetoniusanimating his troops, they boldly attacked the inhabitants, routed
					them in the field, and burned the Druids in the same fires which had been
					prepared by those priests for the catastrophe of thle invaders, destroying at
					the same time all the consecrated groves and altars in the island. Suetonius
					having thus triumphed over the religion of the Britons, flattered himself with
					the hopes of soon effecting the reduction of the people. But they, encouraged by
					his absence, had taken arms, and under the conduct of Boadicea, queen of the
					Iceni, who had been treated in the most ignominious manner by the Roman
					tribunes, had already driven the haughty invaders from their several
					settlements, Suetonius hastened to the protection of <placeName key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, which was by this time a flourishing
					Roman colony; but he found upon his arrival, that any attempt to preserve it
					would be attended with the utmost danger to the army. <placeName key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> therefore was reduced to ashes; and the
					Romans, and all strangers, to the number of seventy thousand, were put to the
					sword without distinction, the Britons seeming determined to convince the enemy
					that they would acquiesce in no other terms than a total evacuation of the
					island. This massacre, however, was revenged by Suetonius in a decisive
					engagement, where eighty thousand of the Britons are said to have been killed;
					after which, Boadicea, to avoid falling into the hands of the insolent
					conquerors, put a period to her own life by means of poison. It being judged
					unadvisable that Suetonius should any longer conduct the war against a people
					whom he had exasperated by his severity, he was recalled, and Petronius
					Turpilianus appointed in his room. The command was afterwards given successively
					to Trebellius Maximus and Vettius Bolanus; but the plan pursued by these
					generals was only to retain, by a conciliatory administration, the parts of the
					island which had already submitted to the Roman arms.</p>
				<p>During these transactions in <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>,
					Nero himself was exhibiting, in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>
					or some of the provinces, such scenes of extravagance as almost exceed
					credibility. In one place, entering the lists amongst the competitors in a
					chariot race; in another contending for victory with the common musicians on the
					stage; revelling in open day in the company of the most abandoned prostitutes
					and the vilest of men; in the night, committing depredations on the peaceful
					inhabitants of the capital; polluting with detestable lust, or drenching with
					human blood, the streets, the palaces, and the habitations of private families;
					and, to crown his enormities, setting fire to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, while he sung with delight in beholding the dreadful
					conflagration. In vain would history be ransacked for a parallel to this
					emperor, who united the most shameful vices to the most extravagant vanity, the
					most abject meanness to the strongest but most preposterous ambition; and the
					whole of whose life was one continued scene of lewdness, sensuality, rapine,
					cruelty, and folly. It is emphatically observed by Tacitus, " that Nero, after
					the murder of many illustrious personages, manifested a desire of extirpating
					virtue itself."</p>
				<p>Among other excesses of Nero's reign, are to be mentioned the horrible cruelties
					exercised against the Christians in various parts of the empire, in which
					inhuman transactions the natural barbarity of the emperor was inflamed by the
					prejudices and interested policy of the pagan priesthood.</p>
				<p>The tyrant scrupled not to charge them with the act of burning <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>; and he satiated his fury against them by
					such outrages as are unexampled in history. They were covered with the skins of
					wild beasts, and torn by dogs; were crucified, and set on fire, that they might
					serve for lights in the night-time. Nero offered his garden for this spectacle, and exhibited the
					games of the Circus by this dreadful illumination. Sometimes they were covered
					with wax and other combustible materials, after which a sharp stake was put
					under their chin, to make them stand upright, and they were burnt alive, to give
					light to the spectators.</p>
				<p>In the person of Nero, it is observed by
					Suetonius, the race of the Casars became extinct; a race rendered illustrious by
					the first and second emperors, but which their successors no less disgraced. The
					despotism of Julius Caesar, though haughty and imperious, was liberal and
					humane: that of Augustus, if we exclude a few instances of vindictive severity
					towards individuals, was mild and conciliating; but the reigns of Tiberius, Caligula, and Nero (for we except Claudius from part of the
					censure), while discriminated from each other by some peculiar circumstances,
					exhibited the most flagrant acts of licentiousness and perverted authority. The
					most abominable lust, the most extravagant luxury, the most shameful
					rapaciousness, and the most inhuman cruelty, constitute the general
					characteristics of those capricious and detestable tyrants. Repeated experience
					now clearly refuted the opinion of Augustus, that he had introduced amongst the
					Romans the best form of government: but while we make this observation, it is
					proper to remark, that, had he even restored the republic, there is reason to
					believe that the nation would again have been soon distracted with internal
					divisions, and a perpetual succession of civil wars. The manners of the people
					were become too dissolute to be restrained by the authority of elective and
					temporary magistrates; and the Romans were hastening to that fatal period when
					general and great corruption, with its attendant debility, would render them an
					easy prey to any foreign invaders. </p>
