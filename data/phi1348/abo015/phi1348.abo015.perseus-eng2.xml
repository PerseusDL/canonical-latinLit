				<p>LIVIA having married Augustus when she
					was pregnant was, within three months afterwards, delivered. of Drusus, the
					father of Claudius Caesar, who had at first the praenomen of Decimus, but
					afterwards that of Nero; and it was
					suspected that he was begotten in adultery by his father-in-law. The following
					verse, however, was immediately in every one's mouth: <quote xml:lang="grc"><l>τοῖσ εὐτυχοῦσι καὶ τρὶμηνα παιδία.</l></quote>
					<quote xml:lang="eng"><l>Nine months for common births the fates decree;</l>
						<l>But, for the great, reduce the term to three.</l></quote> This Drusus,
					during the time of his being quaestor and praetor, commanded in the Rhaetian and
					German wars, and was the first of all the Roman generals who navigated the
					Northern Ocean.<note anchored="true">Pliny describes Drusus as having in this voyage
						circumnavigated <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, and
						reached the Cimbrian Chersonese and the Scythian shores, reeking with
						constant fogs.</note> He made likewise some prodigious trenches beyond the
						<placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName>,<note anchored="true">Tacitus, Ann. xi. 8. 1, mentions this fosse, and says that Drusus sailed up
						the <placeName key="tgn,7006865">Meuse</placeName> and the <placeName key="tgn,1131562">Waal</placeName>. Cluverius places it between the
						village of Iselvort and the town of Doesborg.</note> which to this day are
					called by his name. He overthrew the enemy in several battles and drove them far
					back into the depths of the desert. Nor did he desist from pursuing them, until
					an apparition, in the form of a barbarian woman, of more than human size,
					appeared to him, and, in the Latin tongue, forbad him to proceed any further.
					For these achievements he had the honour of an ovation and the triumphal
					ornaments. After his praetorship, he immediately entered on the office of
					consul, and returning to <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, died
					of disease, in the summer encampment, which thence obtained the name of "The
					Unlucky Camp." His corpse was carried to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> by the principal persons of the several municipalities and
					colonies upon the road, being met and received by the recorders of each place,
					and buried in the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName>. In
					honour of his memory, the army erected a monument, round which the soldiers
					used, annually, upon a certain day, to march in solemn procession, and persons
					deputed from the several cities of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>
					performed religious rites. The senate likewise, among various other honours,
					decreed for him a triumphal arch of marble, with trophies, in the <placeName key="tgn,6006324">Appian Way</placeName>, and gave the cognomen of
					Germanicus to him and his posterity. In him the civil and military virtues were
					equally displayed; for, besides his victories, he gained from the enemy the
					Spolia Opima,<note anchored="true">The <foreign xml:lang="lat">Spolia
							Opima</foreign> were the spoils taken from the enemy's king, or chief,
						when slain in single combat by a Roman general. They were always hung up in
						the Temple of Jupiter Feretrius. Those spoils had been obtained only thrice
						since the foundation of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>: the
						first by Romulus, who slew Acron, king of the Caeninenses; the next by A.
						Cornelius Cossus, who slew Tolumnius, king of the Veientes, A.U.C. 318; and
						the third by M. Claudius Marcelluls, who sles Viridomarus, king of the
						Gauls, A.U.C. 330.</note> and frequently marked out the German chiefs in the
					midst of their army, and encountered them in single combat at the utmost hazard
					of his life. He likewise often declared that he would, some time or other, if
					possible, restore the ancient government, On this account, I suppose, some have
					ventured to affirm that Augustus was jealous of him and recalled him; and
					because he made no haste to com ply with the order, took him off by poison. This
					I mention, that I may not be guilty of any omission, more than because I think
					it either true or probable, since AugustuS loved him so much when living that he
					always, in his wills made him joint-heir with his sons, as he once declared in
					the senate; and upon his decease extolled him in a speech to the people, to that
					degree, that he prayed the gods "to make his Caesars like him, and to grant
					himself as honourable an exit out of this world as they had given him." And not
					satisfied with inscribing upon his tomb an epitaph in verse composed by himself,
					he wrote likewise the history of his life in prose. He had by the younger
					Antonia several children, but left behind him only three, namely, Germanicus,
					Livilla and Claudius.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="2" subtype="chapter">
				<p>Claudius was born at <placeName key="tgn,7008772">Lyons</placeName>, in the
					consulship of Julius Antonius and Fabius Africanus, upon the first of
						August,<note anchored="true">A.U.C. 744</note> the very day upon which an
					altar was first dedicated there to Augustus. He was named Tiberius Claudius
					Drusus, but soon afterwards, upon the adoption of his elder brother into the
						Julian family, he assumed the
					cognomen of Germanicus. He was left an infant by his father, and during almost
					the whole of his minority, and for some time after he attained the age of
					manhood, was afflicted with a variety of obstinate disorders, insomuch that his
					mind and body being greatly impaired, he was, even after his arrival at years of
					maturity, never thought sufficiently qualified for any public or private
					employment. He was, therefore, during a long time, and even after the expiration
					of his minority, under the direction of a pedagogue, who, he complains in a
					certain memoir, " was a barbarous wretch, and formerly superintendent of the
					mule-drivers, who was selected for his governor on purpose to correct him
					severely on every trifling occasion. On account of this crazy constitution of
					body and mind, at the spectacle of gladiators, which he gave the people, jointly
					with his brother, in honour of his father's memory, he presided, muffled up in a
					pallium-a new fashion. When he assumed the manly habit, he was carried in a
					litter, at midnight, to the Capitol, without the usual ceremony.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="3" subtype="chapter">
				<p>He applied himself, however, from an early age, with great assiduity to the study
					of the liberal sciences, and frequently published specimens of his skill in each
					of them. But never, with all his endeavours, could he attain to any public post
					in the government, or afford any hope of arriving at distinction thereafter. His
					mother, Antonia, frequently called him
					"an abortion of a man, that had been only begun, but never finished, by nature."
					And when she would upbraid any one with dulness, she said, "He was a greater
					fool than her son, Claudius." His grandmother, Augusta, always treated him with the utmost contempt, very
					rarely spoke to him, and when she did admonish him upon any occasion, it was in
					writing, very briefly and severely, or by messengers. His sister, Livilla, upon
					hearing that he was about to be created emperor, openly and loudly expressed her
					indignation that the Roman people should experience a fate so severe and so much
					below their grandeur. To exhibit the opinion, both favourable and otherwise,
					entertained concerning him by Augustus, his great-uncle, I have here subjoined
					some extracts from the letters of that emperor.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="4" subtype="chapter">
				<p>"I have had some conversation with Tiberius, according to your desire, my dear Livia, as to what must be done with your
					grandson, Tiberius, at the games of Mars. We are both agreed in this, that, once for all, we ought
					to determine what course to take with him. For if he be really sound and, so to
					speak, quite right in his intellects,<note anchored="true">This epistle, as it
						was the habit of Augustus, is interspersed with Greek phrases. </note> why
					should we hesitate to promote him by the same steps and degrees we did his
					brother? But if we find him below par, and deficient both in body and mind, we
					must beware of giving occasion for him and ourselves to be laughed at by the
					world, which is ready enough to make such things the subject of mirth and
					derision. For we shall be never easy, if we are always to be debating upon every
					occasion of this kind, without settling, in the first instance, whether he be
					really capable of public offices or not. With regard to what you consult me
					about at the present moment, I am not against his superintending the feast of
					the priests, in the games of Mars, if
					he will suffer himself to be governed by his kinsman, Silanus's son, that he may
					do nothing to make the people stare and laugh at him. But I do not approve of
					his witnessing the Circensian games from the Pulvinar. He will be there exposed
					to view in the very front of the theatre. Nor do I like that he should go to the
					Alban Mount,<note anchored="true">The Alban Mount is the most interesting
						feature of the scenery of the Campagna about <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, Monti Cavo, the summit, rising above an amphitheatre
						of magnificent woods, to an elevation of 2965 French feet. The view is very
						extensive: below is the lake of <placeName key="tgn,2127958">Albano</placeName>, the finest of the volcanic lakes in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, and the modern town of the same
						name. Few traces remain of <placeName key="tgn,5004326">Alba
							Longa</placeName>, the ancient capital of <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName>. </note> or be at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> during the Latin festival.<note anchored="true">On the
						summit of the Alban Mount, on the site of the present convent, stood the
						temple of Jupiter Latialis, where the Latin tribes assembled annually, and
						renewed their league, during the Feriae Latinae, instituted by Tarquinus
						Superbus. It was here, also, that Roman generals, who were refused the
						honours of a full triumph, performed the ovation, and sacrificed to Jupiter
						Latialis. Part of the triumphal way by which the mountain was ascended,
						formed of vast blocks of lava, is still in good preservation, leading
						through groves of chestnut trees of vast size and age. Spanning them with
						extended arms-none of the shortest-the operation was repeated five times in
						compassing their girth.</note> For if he be capable of attending his brother
					to the mount, why is he not made prefect of the city? Thus, my dear Livia, you have my thoughts upon the matter.
					In my opinion, we ought to settle this affair once for all, that we may not be
					always in suspense between hope and fear. You may, if you think proper, give
					your kinsman Antonia this part of my
					letter to read." In another letter, he writes as follows: "I shall invite the
					youth, Tiberius, every day during your
					absence, to supper, that he may not sup alone with his friends Sulpicius and
					Athenodorus. I wish the poor creature was more cautious and attentive in the
					choice of some one, whose manners, air, and gait might be proper for his
					imitation: <quote xml:lang="grc"><l>ἀτυχεῖ πάνυ ἐν τοῖσ σπουδαίοις</l></quote>
					<quote xml:lang="eng"><l>In things of consequence he sadly fails.</l></quote>
					Where his mind does not run astray, he discovers a noble disposition." In a
					third letter, he says, " Let me die, my dear Livia, if I am not astonished, that the declamation of your
					grandson, Tiberius, should please me;
					for how he who talks so ill, should be able to declaim so clearly and properly,
					I cannot imagine." There is no doubt but Augustus, after this, came to a
					resolution upon the subject, and, accordingly, left him invested with no other
					honour than that of the Augural priesthood; naming him amongst the heirs of the
					third degree, who were but distantly allied to his family, for a sixth part of
					his estate only, with a legacy of no more than eight hundred thousand
					sesterces.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="5" subtype="chapter">
				<p>Upon his requesting some office in the state, Tiberius granted him the honorary appendages of the consulship,
					and when he pressed for a legitimate appointment, the emperor wrote word back,
					that "he sent him forty gold pieces for his expenses, during the festivals of
					the Saturnalia and Sigillaria." Upon this, laying aside all hope of advancement,
					he resigned himself entirely to an indolent life; living in great privacy, one
					while in his gardens, or a villa which he had near the city; another while in
						<placeName key="tgn,7003005">Campania</placeName>, where he passed his time
					in the lowest society; by which means, besides his former character of a dull,
					heavy fellow, he acquired that of a drunkard and gamester.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="6" subtype="chapter">
				<p>Notwithstanding this sort of life, much respect was shown him both in public and
					private. The equestrian order twice made choice of him to intercede on their
					behalf; once to obtain from the consuls the favour of bearing on their shoulders
					the corpse of Augustus to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, and a
					second time to congratulate him upon the death of Sejanus. When he entered the
					theatre, they used to rise, and put Off their cloaks. The senate likewise
					decreed, that he should be added to the number of the Augustal college of
					priests, who were chosen by lot; and soon afterwards, when his house was burnt
					down, that it should be rebuilt at the public charge; and that he should have
					the privilege of giving his vote amongst the men of consular rank. This decree
					was, however, repealed; Tiberius
					insisting to have him excused on account of his imbecility, and promising to
					make good his loss at his own expense. But at his death, he named him in his
					will, amongst his third heirs, for a third part of his estate; leaving him
					besides a legacy of two millions of sesterces, and expressly recommending him to
					the armies, the senate and people of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, amongst his other relations.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="7" subtype="chapter">
				<p>At last Caius, his brother's son, upon his advancement to the empire,
					endeavouring to gain the affections of the public by all the arts of popularity,
					Claudius also was admitted to public offices, and held the consulship jointly
					with his nephew for two months. As he was entering the Forum for the first time
					with the fasces, an eagle which was flying that way, alighted upon his right
					shoulder. A second consulship was also allotted him, to commence at the
					expiration of the fourth year. He sometimes presided at the public spectacles,
					as the representative of Caius; being always, on those occasions, complimented
					with the acclamations of the people, wishing him all happiness, sometimes under
					the title of the emperor's uncle, and sometimes under that of Germanicus's
					brother.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="8" subtype="chapter">
				<p>Still he was subjected to many slights. If at any time he came in late to supper,
					he was obliged to walk round the room some time before he could get a place at
					table. When he indulged himself with sleep after eating, which was a common
					practice with him, the company used to throw olive-stones and dates at him. And
					the buffoons who attended would wake him, as if it were only in jest, with a
					cane or a whip. Sometimes they would put slippers upon his hands, as he lay
					snoring, that he might, upon awaking, rub his face with them.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="9" subtype="chapter">
				<p>He was not only exposed to contempt, but sometimes likewise to considerable
					danger: first, in his consulship; for, having been too remiss in providing and
					erecting the statues of Caius's brothers, Nero and Drusus, he was very near being deprived of his office;
					and afterwards he was continually harassed with informations against him by one
					or other, sometimes even by his own domestics. When the conspiracy of Lepidus
					and Gaetulicus was discovered, being sent with some other deputies into
						<placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>,<note anchored="true">A. U.
						C. 793. Life of CALIGULA, CC. xliv., xlv., c. </note> to congratulate the
					emperor upon the occasion, he was in danger of his life; Caius being greatly
					enraged, and loudly complaining, that his uncle was sent to him, as if he was a
					boy who wanted a governor. Some even say, that he was thrown into a river, in
					his travelling dress. From this period, he voted in the senate always the last
					of the members of consular rank; being called upon after the rest, on purpose to
					disgrace him. A charge for the forgery of a will was also allowed to be
					prosecuted, though he had only signed it as a witness. At last, being obliged to
					pay eight millions of sesterces on entering upon a new office of priesthood, he
					was reduced to such straits in his private affairs, that in order to discharge
					his bond to the treasury, he was under the necessity of exposing to sale his
					whole estate, by an order of the prefects.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="10" subtype="chapter">
				<p>Having spent the greater part of his life under these and the like circumstances,
					he came at last to the empire in the fiftieth year of his age,<note anchored="true">A.U.C. 794</note> by a very surprising turn of fortune.
					Being, as well as the rest, prevented from approaching Caius by the
					conspirators, who dispersed the crowd, under the pretext of his desiring to be
					private, he retired into an apartment called the Hermaeum;<note anchored="true">The chanber of Mercury, the names of deities being given to different
						apartments, as those "of Isis," "of the Muses," etc.</note> and soon
					afterwards, terrified by the report of Caius being slain, he crept into an
					adjoining balcony, where he hid himself behind the hangings of the door. A
					common soldier, who happened to pass that way, spying his feet, and desirous to
					discover who he was, pulled him out; when immediately recognizing him, he threw
					himself in a great fright at his feet, and saluted him by the title of emperor.
					He then conducted him to his fellow-soldiers, who were all in a great rage, and
					irresolute what they should do. They put him into a litter, and as the slaves of
					the palace had all fled, took their turns in carrying him on their shoulders,
					and brought him into the camp, sad and trembling; the people who met him
					lamenting his situation, as if the poor innocent was being carried to execution.
					Being received within the ramparts,<note anchored="true">See the note, page 259.
					</note> he continued all night with the sentries on guard, recovered somewhat
					from his fright, but in no great hopes of the succession. For the consuls, with
					the senate and civic troops, had possessed themselves of the Forum and Capitol,
					with the determination to assert the public liberty; and he being sent for
					likewise, by a tribune of the people, to the senate-house, to give his advice
					upon the present juncture of affairs, returned answer, "I am under constraint,
					and cannot possibly come." The day afterwards, the senate being dilatory in
					their proceedings, and worn out by divisions amongst themselves, while the
					people who surrounded the senate-house shouted that they would have one master,
					naming Claudius, he suffered the soldiers assembled under arms to swear
					allegiance to him, promising them fifteen thousand sesterces a man; he being the
					first of the Caesars who purchased the submission of the soldiers with
						money.<note anchored="true">The attentive reader will have marked the
						gradual growth of the power of the pretorian guard, who now, and on so many
						future occasions, ruled the destinies of the empire.</note></p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="11" subtype="chapter">
				<p>Having thus established himself in power, his first obect was to abolish all
					remembrance of the two preceding days, in which a revolution in the state had
					been canvassed. Accordingly, he passed an act of perpetual oblivion and pardon
					for everything said or done during that time; and this he faithfully observed,
					with the exception only of putting to death a few tribunes and centurions
					concerned in the conspiracy against Caius, both as an example, and because he
					understood that they had also planned his own death. He now turned his own
					thoughts towards paying respect to the memory of his relations. His most solemn
					and unusual oath was "By Augustus." He prevailed upon the senate to decree
					divine honours to his grandmother Livia, with a chariot in the Circensian procession drawn by
					elephants, as had been appointed for Augustus, <note anchored="true">See
						AUGUSTUS, cc. xliii., xlv. </note> and public offerings to the shades of his
					parents. Besides which, he instituted Circensian games for his father, to be
					celebrated every year, upon his birthday, and, for his mother, a chariot to be
					drawn through the circus; with the title of Augusta, which had been refused by his grandmother. <note anchored="true">Ib. c. xcix. </note> To the memory of his brother, <note anchored="true">Germanicus. </note> to which, upon all occasions, he showed
					a great regard, he gave a Greek comedy, to be exhibited in the public diversions
					at <placeName key="tgn,7004474">Naples</placeName>, <note anchored="true"><placeName key="tgn,7004474">Naples</placeName> and other cities on
						that coast were Greek colonies. </note> and awarded the crown for it,
					according to the sentence of the judges in that solemnity. Nor did he omit to
					make honourable and grateful mention of Mark Antony; declaring by a
					proclamation, "That he the more earnestly insisted upon the observation of his
					father Drusus's birth-day, because it was likewise that of his grandfather
					Antony." He completed the marble arch near Pompey's theatre, which had formerly
					been decreed by the senate in honour of Tiberius, but which had been
						neglected.<note anchored="true">This arch was erected in memory of the
						standards (the eagles) lost by Varus, in <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, having been recovered by Germanicus under the
						auspices of Tiberius. See his Life, c. xlvii.; and Tacit. Annal. ii. 41. It
						seems to have stood at the foot of the Capitol, on the side of the Forum,
						near the temple of Concord; but there are no remains of it.</note> And
					though he cancelled all the acts of Caius, yet he forbad the day of his
					assassination, notwithstanding it was that of his own accession to the empire,
					to be reckoned amongst the festivals.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="12" subtype="chapter">
				<p>But with regard to his own aggrandisement, he was sparing and modest, declining
					the title of emperor, an irefusing all excessive honours. He celebrated the
					marriage of his daughter and the birth-day of a grandson with great privacy, at
					home. He recalled none of those who had been banished, without a decree of the
					senate: and requested of them permission for the prefect of the military
					tribunes and pretorian guards to attend him in the senate-house;<note anchored="true">Tacitus informs us that the same application had been made
						by Tiberius. Annal. iii. The prefect of the pretorian guards, high and
						important as his office had now become, was not allowed to enter the
						senate-house, unless he belonged to the equestrian order.</note> and also
					that they would be pleased to bestow upon his procurators judicial authority in
					the provinces.<note anchored="true">The procurators had the administration of
						some of the less important provinces, with rank and authority inferior to
						that of the pro-consuls and prefects. Frequent mention of these officers is
						made by Josephus; and Pontius Pilate, who sentenced our Lord to crucifixion,
						held that office in <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Judaea</placeName>, under
						Tiberius.</note> He asked of the consuls likewise the privilege of holding
					fairs upon his private estate. He frequently assisted the magistrates in the
					trial of causes, as one of their assessors. And when they gave public
					spectacles, he would rise up with the rest of the spectators, and salute them
					both by words and gestures. When the tribunes of the people came to him while he
					was on the tribunal, he excused himself, because, on account of the crowd, he
					could not hear them unless they stood. In a short time, by this conduct, he
					wrought himself so much into the favour and affection of the public, that when,
					upon his going to <placeName key="tgn,7007018">Ostia</placeName>, a report was
					spread in the city that he had been waylaid and slain, the people never ceased
					cursing the soldiers for traitors, and the senate as parricides, until one or
					two persons, and presently after several others, were brought by the magistrates
					upon the rostra, who assured them that he was alive, and not far from the city,
					on his way home.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="13" subtype="chapter">
				<p>Conspiracies, however, were formed against him, not only by individuals
					separately, but by a faction; and at last his government was disturbed with a
					civil war. A low fellow was found with a poniard about him, near his chamber, at
					midnight. Two men of the equestrian order were discovered waiting for him in the
					streets, armed with a tuck and a huntsman's dagger; one of them intending to
					attack him as he came out of the theatre, and the other as he was sacrificing in
					the temple of Mars. Gallus Asinius and Statilius Corvinus, grandsons of the two
					orators, Pollio and Messala, <note anchored="true">Pollio and Messala were
						distinguished orators, who flourished under the Caesars Julius and Augustus.

					reduced in the space of five days; the legions which he had seduced from their
					oath of fidelity relinquishing their purpose, upon an alarm occasioned by ill
					omens. For when orders were given them to march, to meet their new emperor, the
					eagles could not be decorated, nor the standards pulled out of the ground,

				<p>But in hearing and determining causes, he exhibited a strange inconsistency of

					and rash, and sometimes frivolous and like one out of his mind. In correcting
					the roll of judges, he struck off the name of one who, concealing the privilege
					his children gave him to be excused from serving, had answered to his name, as
					too eager for the office. Another who was summoned before him in a cause of his
					own, but alleged that the affair did not properly come under the emperor's
					cognizance, but that of the ordinary judges, he ordered to plead the cause
					himself immediately before him, and show in a case of his own, how equitable a
					judge he would prove in that of other persons. A woman refusing to acknowledge
					her own son, and there being no clear proof on either side, he obliged her to
					confess the truth, by ordering her to marry the young man. <note anchored="true">This reminds us of the decision of Solomon in the case of the two mothers,

					much inclined to determine causes in favour of the parties who appeared, against
					those who did not, without inquiring whether their absence was occasioned by
					their own fault, or by real necessity. On proclamation of a man's being

					that an executioner should be immediately sent for, with a Spanish sword and a
					block. A person being prosecuted for falsely assuming the freedom of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and a frivolous dispute arising between
					the advocates in the cause, whether he ought to make his appearance in the Roman
					or Grecian dress, to show his impartiality, he commanded him to change his
					clothes several times according to the character he assumed in the accusation or
					defence. An anecdote is related of him, and believed to be true, that, in a
					particular cause, he delivered his sentence in writing thus: "I am in favour of
					those who have spoken the truth."<note anchored="true">A most absurd judicial
						conclusion, the business of the judge or court being to decide, on weighing
						the evidence, on which side the truth preponderated. </note> By this he so
					much forfeited the good opinion of the world, that he was everywhere and openly
					despised. A person making an excuse for the non-appearance of a witness whom he
					had sent for from the provinces, declared it was impossible for him to appear,
					concealing the reason for some time: at last, after several interrogatories were
					put to him on the subject, he answered, "The man is dead;" to which Claudius
					replied, "I think that is a sufficient excuse." Another thanking him for
					suffering a person who was prosecuted to make his defence by counsel, added,
					"And yet it is no more than what is usual." I have likewise heard some old men
					say, <note anchored="true">See the note in CALIGULA, c. xix., as to Suetonius's
						sources of information from persons cotemporary with the occurrences he

					that they would not only call him back, as he was quitting the tribunal, but
					would seize him by the lap of his coat, and sometimes catch him by the heels, to
					make him stay. That such behaviour, however strange, is not incredible, will
					appear from this anecdote. Some obscure Greek, who was a litigant, had an

					who came off conquerors. He would earnestly invite the company to be merry;
					sometimes calling them his "masters," with a mixture of insipid, far-fetched
					jests. Thus when the people called for Palumbus,<note anchored="true">Palumbus
						was a gladiator: and Claudius condescended to pun upon his name, which

					great applause, spared a gladiator, on the intercession of his four sons, he
					sent a billet immediately round the theatre, to remind the people, " how much it
					behooved them to get children, since they had before them an example how useful

					refused to fight, as if by that response he had meant to excuse them. Upon this,
					he hesitated for a time, whether he should not destroy them all with fire and

					with tottering steps, the result of his foul excesses, he, partly by fair words,

				<p>He was trice married at a very early age, first to Aemilia Lepida, the

					displeasure of Augustus; and he lost the latter by sickness on the day fixed for
					their nuptials. He next married Plautia Urgulanilla, whose father had enjoyed
					the honour of a triumph; and soon afterwards, Aelia Paetina, the daughter of a
					man of consular rank. But he divorced them both; Paetina, upon some trifling
					cause of disgust; and Urgulanilla, for scandalous lewdness, and the suspicion of
					murder. After them he took in marriage Valeria Messalina,the daughter of
					Barbatus Messala, his cousin. But finding that, besides her other shameful
					debaucheries, she had even gone so far as to marry in his own absence Caius
					Silius, the settlement of her dowry being formally signed, in the presence of
					the augurs, he put her to death. When summoning his pretorians to his presence,

				<p>He was, however, unable to persist in this resolution; for he began immediately

					divorced: he thought also of Lollia Paulina, who had been married to Caius
					Caesar. But being ensnared by the arts of Agrippina, the daughter of his brother
					Germanicus, who took advantage of the kisses and endearments which their near
					relationship admitted, to inflame his desires, he got some one to propose at the
					next meeting of the senate, that they should oblige the emperor to marry
					Agrippina, as a measure highly conducive to the public interest; and that in
					future liberty should be given for such marriages, which until that time had
					been considered incestuous. In less than twenty-four hours after this, he

					usually awoke before midnight; but he would sometimes sleep in the daytime, and
					that, even, when he was upon the tribunal; so that the advocates often found it
					difficult to wake him, though they raised their voices for that purpose. He set

					agonies of death. Two gladiators happening to kill each other, he immediately
					ordered some little knives to be made of their swords for his own use. He took
					great pleasure in seeing men engage with wild beasts, and the combatants who
					appeared on the stage at noon. He woul I therefore come to the theatre by break
					of day, and at noon, dismissing the people to dinner, continued sitting himself;
					and besides those who were devoted to that sanguinary fate, he would match

					wait upon him at table instead of servants. He never visited a sick person,

					strictly searched by officers appointed for that purpose; nor was it until after

					women, boys, and girls from such rude handling, or suffer their attendants or
					writing-masters to retain their cases for pens and styles. When <placeName key="tgn,2068320">Camillus</placeName> formed his plot against him, not

					not so much on account of her infamous conduct, as from apprehension of danger;
					believing that she aspired to share with Silius, her partner in adultery, the
					imperial dignity. Upon this occasion he ran in a great fright, and a very
					shameful manner, to the camp, asking all the way he went, "if the empire were
					indeed safely his."</p>

					to adopt Nero, as if there was little cause for censure in his adopting a

					breaking of several benches from the weight of a very fat man; and even when
					order was restored, he could not forbear bursting out into violent fits of
					laughter, at the remembrance of the accident. After he became emperor, likewise,
					he wrote several things which he was careful to have recited to his friends by a

					afterwards he took a later period, and began at the conclusion of the civil
					wars; because he found he could not speak with freedom, and a due regard to
					truth, concerning the former period, having been often taken to task both by his

					frequently quoted the verses of Homer. When at any time he had taken vengeance

					remains in uncertainty. Some authors say that it was given him as he was

				<head>Remarks on Claudius</head>
				<p>It has been already observed, that Claudius was entirely governed by his
					freedmen; a class of retainers which enjoyed a great share of favour and
					confidence with their patrons in those times. They had before been the slaves of
					their masters, and had obtained their freedom as a reward for their faithful and
					attentive services. Of the esteem in which they were often held, we meet with an
					instance in <placeName key="tgn,2082201">Tiro</placeName>, the freedman of
					Cicero, to whom that illustrious Roman addresses several epistles, written in
					the most familiar and affectionate strain of friendship. As it was common for
					them to be taught the more useful parts of education in the families of their
					masters, they were usually well qualified for the management of domestic
					concerns, and might even be competent to the superior departments of the state,
					especially in those times when negotiations and treaties with foreign princes
					seldom or never occurred; and in arbitrary governments, where public affairs
					were directed more by the will of the sovereign or his ministers, than by
					refined suggestions of policy.</p>
				<p>From the character generally given of Claudius before his elevation to the
					throne, we should not readily imagine that he was endowed with any taste for
					literary composition; yet he seems to have exclusively enjoyed this distinction
					during his own reign, in which learning was at a low ebb. Besides history,
					Suetonius informs us that he wrote a Defence of Cicero against the Charges of
					Asinius Gallus. This appears to be the only tribute of esteem or approbation
					paid to the character of Cicero, from the time of Livy the historian, to the
					extinction of the race of the Caesars. </p>
