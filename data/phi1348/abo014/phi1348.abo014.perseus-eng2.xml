				<p>GERMANICUS, the father of Caius Caesar, and son of Drusus and the younger
						Antonia, was, after his adoption by
						Tiberius, his uncle, preferred to
					the quaestorship<note anchored="true">A.U.C. 757</note> five years before he had
					attained the legal age, and immediately upon the expiration of that office, to
					the consulship.<note anchored="true">A.U.C. 765</note> Having been sent to the
					army in <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, he restored order
					among the legions, who, upon the news of Augustus's death, obstinately refused
					to acknowledge Tiberius as emperor,<note anchored="true">A.U.C. 770</note> and
					offered to place him at the head of the state. In which affair it is difficult
					to say, whether his regard to filial duty, or the firmness of his resolution,
					was most conspicuous. Soon afterwards he defeated the enemy, and obtained the
					honours of a triumph. Being then made consul for the second time,<note anchored="true">A.U.C. 767</note> before he could enter upon his office he
					was obliged to set out suddenly for the east, where, after he had conquered the
					king of <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName>, and reduced <placeName key="tgn,6003016">Cappadocia</placeName> into the form of a province, he
					died at <placeName key="tgn,7002351">Antioch</placeName>, of a lingering
					distemper, in the thirty-fourth year of his age,<note anchored="true">A.U.C.
						771</note> not without the suspicion of being poisoned. For besides the
					livid spots which appeared all over his body, and a foaming at the mouth; when
					his corpse was burnt, the heart was found entire among the bones; its nature
					being such, as it is supposed, that when tainted by poison, it is indestructible
					by fire.<note anchored="true">This opinion, like some others which occur in
						Suetonius, may justly be considered as a vulgar error; and if the heart was
						found entire, it must have been owing to the weakness of the fire, rather
						than to any quality communicated to the organ, of resisting the power of
						that element.</note></p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="2" subtype="chapter">
				<p>It was a prevailing opinion that he was taken off by the contrivance of Tiberius
					and through the means of Cneius Piso. This person, who was about the same time
					prefect of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, and made no secret of
					his position being such, that he must either offend the fathe ror the son,
					loaded Germanicus, even during his sickness, with the most unbounded and
					scurrilous abuse, both by word and deed; for which, upon his return to
						<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, he narrowly escaped being
					torn to pieces by the people, and was condemned to death by the senate.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="3" subtype="chapter">
				<p>It is generally agreed, that Germanicus possessed all the noblest endowments of
					body and mind in a higher degree than had ever before fallen to the lot of any
					man; a handsome person, extraordinary courage, great proficiency in eloquence
					and other branches of learning, both Greek and Roman; besides a singular
					humanity, and a behaviour so engaging, as to captivate the affections of all
					about him. The slenderness of his legs did not correspond with the symmetry and
					beauty of his person in other respects; but this defect was at length corrected
					by his habit of riding after meals. In battle, he often engaged and slew an
					enemy in single combat. He pleaded causes, even after he had the honour of a
					triumph. Among other fruits of his studies, he left behind him some Greek
					comedies. Both at home and abroad he always conducted himself in a manner the
					most unassuming. On entering any free and confederate town, he never would be
					attended by any of his lictors. Whenever he heard, in his travels, of the tombs
					of illustrious men, he made offerings over them to the infernal deities. He gave
					a common grave, under a mound of earth, to the scattered relics of the
					legionaries slain under Varus, and was the first to put his hand to the work of
					collecting and bringing them to the place of burial. He was so extremely mild
					and gentle to his enemies, whoever they were, or on what account soever they
					bore him enmity, that, although Piso rescinded his decrees, and for a long time
					severely harassed his dependents, he never showed the smallest resentment, until
					he found himself attacked by magical charms and imprecations; and even then the
					only steps he took was to renounce all friendship with him, according to ancient
					custom, and to exhort his servants to avenge his death, if any thing untoward
					should befal him.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="4" subtype="chapter">
				<p>He reaped the fruit of his noble qualities in abundance, being so much esteemed
					and beloved by his friends, that Augustus (to say nothing of his other
					relations) being a long time in doubt, whether he should not appoint him his
					successor, at last ordered Tiberius to adopt him. He was so extremely popular,
					that many authors tell us, the crowds of those who went to meet him upon his
					coming to any place, or to attend him at his departure, were so prodigious, that
					he was sometimes in danger of his life; and that upon his return from <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, after he had quelled the mutiny in
					the army there, all the cohorts of the pretorian guards marched out to meet him,
					notwithstanding the order that only two should go; and that all the people of
						<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, both men and women, of every
					age, sex, and rank, flocked as far as the twentieth mile-stone to attend his
					entrance.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="5" subtype="chapter">
				<p>At the time of his death, however, and afterwards, they displayed still greater
					and stronger proofs of their extraordinary attachment to him. The day on which
					he died, stones were thrown at the temples, the altars of the gods demolished,
					the household gods, in some cases, thrown into the streets, and new-born infants
					exposed. It is even said that barbarous nations, both those engaged in intestine
					wars, and those in hostilities against us, all agreed to a cessation of arms, as
					if they had been mourning for some very near and common friend; that some petty
					kings shaved their beards and their wives heads, in token of their extreme
					sorrow; and that the king of kings<note anchored="true">The magnificent title of
						King of Kings has been assumed, at different times, by various potentates.
						The person to whom it is here applied, is the king of <placeName key="tgn,7016768">Parthia</placeName>. Under the kings of <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>, and even under the Syro-Macedonian
						kings, this country was of no consideration, and reckoned a part of
						Hyrcania. But upon the revolt of the East from the Syro-Macedonians, at the
						instigation of Arsaces, the Parthians are said to have conquered eighteen
						kingdoms. </note> forbore his exercise of hunting and feasting with; his
					nobles, which, amongst the Parthians, is equivaleii to a cessation of all
					business in a time of public mourning with us.</p>

			<div type="textpart" n="6" subtype="chapter">
				<p>At <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, upon the first news of his
					sickness, the city was thrown into great consternation and grief, waiting
					impatiently for farther intelligence; when suddenly, in the evening, a report,
					without any certain author, was spread, that he was recovered; upon which the
					people flocked with torches and victims to the Capitol, and were in such haste
					to pay the vows they had made for his recovery, that they almost broke open the
					doors. Tiberius was roused from out of his sleep with the noise of the people
					congratulating one another, and singing about the streets, <quote xml:lang="lat"><l>Salva Roma, salva patria, salvus est Germanicus,</l></quote>
					<quote xml:lang="eng"><l><placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> is safe,
							our country safe, for our Germanicus is safe.</l></quote> But when
					certain intelligence of his death arrived, the mourning of the people could
					neither be assuaged by consolation, nor restrained by edicts, and it continued
					during the holidays in the month of December. The atrocities of the subsequent
					times contributed much to the glory of Germanicus, and the endearment of his
					memory; all people supposing, and with reason, that the fear and awe of him had
					laid a restraint upon the cruelty of Tiberius, which broke out soon
					afterwards.</p>

			<div type="textpart" n="7" subtype="chapter">
				<p>Germanicus married Agrippina, the daughter of Marcus Agrippa and <placeName key="tgn,2118772">Julia</placeName>, by whom he had nine children, two of

					whose effigy, in the character of a Cupid, <placeName key="tgn,2039991">Livia</placeName> set up in the temple of <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName> in the Capitol. Augustus also placed 'another statue of

						<placeName key="perseus,Tibur">Tibur</placeName>; Pliny the younger, in the

						The German tribe here mentioned occupied the country between the <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName> and the <placeName key="tgn,7006865">Meuse</placeName>, and gave their name to <placeName key="tgn,7004447">Treves</placeName> (<placeName key="tgn,7004447">Treviri</placeName>),
						its chief town. Coblentz had its ancient name of Confluentes, from its

						which Caligula was born is not known. Cliverius conjectures that it may be
						Cafelle.</note> and he alleges, as a proof of it, that altars are there
					shown with this inscription: "For Agrippina's child-birth." Some verses which
					were published in his reign, intimate that he was born in the winter quarters of
					the legions, <quote xml:lang="lat"><l>In castris natus, patriis nutritius in
							armis,</l>
						<l>Jam designati principis omen erat.</l></quote>
					<quote xml:lang="eng"><l>Born in the camp, and trained in every toil</l>
						<l>Which taught his sire the haughtiest foes to foil;</l>
						<l>Destin'd he seem'd by fate to raise his name,</l>
						<l>And rule the empire with Augustan fame.</l></quote> I find in the public
					registers that he was born at <placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName>. Pliny charges Gaetulicus as guilty of an arrant forgery,
					merely to soothe the vanity of a conceited young prince, by giving him the
					lustre of being born in a city sacred to Hercules; and says that he advanced
					this false assertion with the more assurance, because, the year before the birth
					of Caius, Germanicus had a son of the same name born at <placeName key="perseus,Tibur">Tibur</placeName>; concerning whose amiable childhood
					and premature death I have already spoken.<note anchored="true">Chap.
						vii.</note> Dates clearly prove that Pliny is mistaken; for the writers of
					Augustus's history all agree, that Germanicus, at the expiration of his
					consulship, was sent into <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, after
					the birth of Caius. Nor will the inscription upon the altar serve to establish
					Pliny's opinion; because Agrippina was delivered of two daughters in that
					country, and any child-birth, without regard to sex, is called puerperium, as
					the ancients used to call girs puerat, and boys puelli. There is also extant a
					letter written by Augustus, a few months before his death, to his granddaughter
					Agrippina, about the same Caius (for there was then no other child of hers
					living under that name). He writes as follows: "I gave orders yesterday for
					Talarius and Asellius to set out on their journey towards you, if the gods
					permit, with your child Caius, upon the fifteenth of the calends of June [I8th
					May]. I also send with him a physician of mine, and I wrote to Germanicus that
					he may retain him if he pleases. Farewell, my dear Agrippina, and take what care
					you can to come safe and well to your Germanicus." I imagine it is sufficiently
					evident that Caius could not be born at a place to which he was carried from The
					City when almost two years 'old. The same considerations must likewise
					invalidate the evidence of the verses, and the rather, because the author is
					unknown. The only authority, therefore, upon which we can depend in this matter,
					is that of the acts, and the public register; especially as he always preferred
						<placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName> to every other place of
					retirement, and entertained for it all that fondness which is commonly attached
					to one's native soil. It is said, too, that, upon his growing weary of the city,
					he designed to have transferred thither the seat of empire.</p>

				<p>It was to the jokes of the soldiers in the camp that he owed the name of
						Caligula,<note anchored="true">The name was derived from Caliga, a kind of

						army.</note> he having been brought up among them in the dress of a common
					soldier. How much his education amongst them recommended him to their favour and
					affection, was sufficiently apparent in the mutiny upon the death of Augustus,
					when the mere sight of him appeased their fury, though it had risen to a great
					height. For they persisted in it, until they observed that he was sent away to a
					neighbouring city, <note anchored="true">According to Tacitus, who gives an
						interesting account of these occurrences, <placeName key="tgn,7004447">Treves</placeName> was the place of refuge to which the young Caius was
						conveyed.-Annal. i. </note> to secure him against all danger. Then, at last,
					they began to relent, and, stopping the chariot in which he was conveyed,
					earnestly deprecated the odium to which such a proceeding would expose them.</p>

			<div type="textpart" n="10" subtype="chapter">
				<p>He likewise attended his father in his expedition to <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>. After his return, he lived first with his mother, and,
					when she was banished, with his great-granrmother, Livia Augusta, in praise of
					whom, after her decease, though then only a boy, he pronounced a funeral oration
					in the Rostra. He was then transferred to the family of his grandmother Antonia,
					and afterwards, in the twentieth year of his age, being called by Tiberius to
						<placeName key="tgn,7006855">Capri</placeName>, he in one and the same day
					assumed the manly habit, and shaved his beard, but without receiving any of the
					honours which had been paid to his brothers on a similar oeeasien. While he
					remained in that island, many insidious artifices were practised, to extort from
					him complaints against Tiberius, but by his circumspection he avoided falling
					into the snare. <note anchored="true">In c. liv. of TIBERIUS, we have seen that
						his brothers Drusus and <placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName> fell a
						sacrifice to these artifices. </note> He affected to take no more notice of
					the ill-treatment of his relations, than if nothing had befallen them. With
					regard to his own sufferings, he seemed utterly insensible of them, and behaved
					with such obsequiousness to his grandfather<note anchored="true">Tiberius, who
						was the adopted father of Germanicus.</note> and all about him, that it was
					justly said of him, "There never was a better servant, nor a worse master."</p>

				<p>But he could not even then conceal his natural disposition to cruelty and
					lewdness. He delighted in witnessing the inflictions of punishments, and
					frequented tavernsand bawdy-houses in the night-time, disguised in a periwig
					-and a long coat; and was passionately addicted to the theatrical arts of
					singing and dancing. All these levities Tiberius readily connived at, in hopes
					that they might perhaps correct the roughness of his temper, which the sagacious
					old man so well understood, that he often said, "That Caius was destined to be
					the ruin of himself and all mankind; and that he was rearing a hydra<note anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Natriceus</foreign>, a water-snake,

				<p>Not long afterwards, he married Junia Claudilla, the daughter of Marcus Silanus,
					a man of the highest rank. Being then chosen augur in the room of his brother
					Drusus, before he could be inaugurated he was advanced to the pontificate, with
					no small commendation of his dutiful behaviour, and great capacity. The
					situation of the court likewise was at this time favourable to his fortunes, as
					it was now left destitute of support, Sejanus being suspected, and soon
					afterwards taken off; and he was by degrees flattered with the hope of
					succeeding Tiberius in the empire. In order more effectually to secure this
					object, upon Junia's dying in child-bed, he engaged in a criminal commerce with
					Ennia Naevia, the wife of <placeName key="tgn,2032740">Marco</placeName>, at
					that time prefect of the pretorian cohorts; promising to marry her if he became
					emperor, to which he bound himself, not only by an oath, but by a written
					obligation under his hand. Having by her means insinuated himself into
						<placeName key="tgn,2032740">Marco</placeName>'s favour, some are of opinion
					that he attempted to poison <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>,
					and ordered his ring to be taken from him, before tihe breath was out of his
					body; and that, because he seemed to hold it fast, he caused a pillow to be
					thrown upon him,<note anchored="true">See the Life of <placeName key="tgn,2720789">TIBERIUS</placeName>, c. lxxiii. </note> squeezing him
					by the throat, at the same time, with his own hand. One of his freedmen crying
					out at this horrid barbarity, he was immediately crucified. These circumstances
					are far from being improbable, as some authors relate that, afterwards, though
					he did not acknowledge his having a hand in the death of <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, yet he frankly declared that he had
					formerly entertained such a design; and as a proof of his affection for his
					relations, he would frequently boast, "That, to revenge the death of his mother
					and brothers, he had entered the chamber of <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, when he was asleep, with a poniard, but being seized
					with a fit of compassion, threw it away, and retired; and that <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>, though aware of his intention, durst
					not make any inquiries, or attempt revenge."</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="13" subtype="chapter">
				<p>Having thus secured the imperial power, he fulfilled by his elevation the wish of
					the Roman people, I may venture to say, of all mankind; for he long been the

				<p>Immediately pn his entering the city, by the joint acclamations of the senate,

					in public handbills, to risk their lives in the combats of the amphitheatre, and
					others to lay them down, for his recovery. To this extraordinary love
					entertained for him by his countrymen, was added an uncommon regard by foreign
					nations. Even Artabanus, king of the Parthians, who had always manifested hatred
					and contempt for Tiberius, solicited his friendship; came to hold a conference
					with his consular lieutenant, and passing the <placeName key="tgn,1123842">Euphrates</placeName>, paid the highest honours to the eagles, the Roman

					fortunate and happy to Caius Caesar and his sisters." With the like popularity
					he restored all those who had been condemned and banished and granted an act of
					indemnity against all impeachments and past offenses. To relieve the informers
					and witnesses against his mother and brothers from all apprehension, he brought
					the records of their trials into the forum, and there burnt them, calling loudly
					on the gods to witness that he had not read or handled them. A memorial which

				<p>Thus far we have spoken of him as a prince. What remains to be said of him,

					"The Greatest and Best Caesar." Upon hearing some kings, who came to the city to
					pay him court, conversing together at supper, about their illustrious descent,

					<gloss>Let there be but one prince, one king.</gloss> He was strongly inclined

					to arrogate to himself a divine majesty. He ordered all the images of the gods,
					which were famous either for their beauty, or the veneration paid them, among
					which was that of Jupiter Olympius, to be brought from <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, that he might take the heads off, and
					put on his own. Having continued part of the Palatium as far as the Forum, and
					the temple of Castor and Pollux being converted into a kind of vestibule to his
					house, he often stationed himself between the twin brothers, and so presented
					himself to be worshipped by all votaries; some of whom saluted him by the name
					of yupiter Latialis. He also instituted a temple and priests, with choicest
					victims, in honour of his own divinity. In his temple stood a statue of gold,
					the exact image of himself, which was daily dressed in garments corresponding
					with those he wore himself. The most opulent persons in the city offered
					themselves as candidates for the honour of being his priests, and purchased it
					successively at an immense price. The victims were flamingos, peacocks,
					bustards, guinea-fowls, turkey and pheasant hens, each sacrificed on their
					respective days. On nights when the moon was full, he was in the constant habit
					of inviting her to his embraces and his bed. In the day-time he talked in
					private to Jupiter Capitolinus; one while whispering to him, and another turning
					his ear to him; sometimes he spoke aloud, and in railing language. For he was

					of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, to be celebrated, as usual;

					called his grandmother Livia Augusta " Ulysses in a woman's dress," and had the

					descended, by the mother's side, from a grandfather who was only one of the

				<p>He evinced the savage barbarity of his temper chiefly by the following

					middle of the portico, without troubling himself to examine their cases he

					delivered, adorned as a victim, with garlands and fillets, to boys, who were to
					drive him through the streets, calling on him to fulfil his vow, until he was
					thrown headlong from the ramparts. After disfiguring many persons of honorable

					inflicted for crimes of great enormity, but for making remarks on his public
					games, or for not having sworn by the Genius of the emperor. He compelled
					parents to be present at the execution of their sons; and to one who excused
					himself on account of indisposition he sent his own litter. Another he invited
					to his table immediately after he had witnessed the spectacle, and coolly
					challenged him to jest and be merry. He ordered the overseer of the spectacles
					and wild beasts to be scourged in fetters, during several days successively, in
					his own presence and did not put him to death until he was disgusted with the
					stench of his putrefied brain. He burned alive, in the centre of the arena of
					the amphitheatre, the writer of a farce, for some witty verse, which had a

					of the census, had by any means whatever increased their property. He annulled
					the wills of all who had been centurions of the first rank, as testimonies of
					their base ingratitude, if from the beginning of <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>'s reign they had not left either that prince or
					himself their heir. He also set aside the wills of all others, if any person
					only pretended to say, that they designed at their death to leave Caesar their

					such a will, he said, were only making game of him; and accordingly he sent many
					of them poisoned cakes. He used to try such causes himself; fixing previously
					the sum he proposed to raise during the sitting, and, after he had secured it,
					quitting the tribunal. Impatient of the least delay, he condemned by a single
					sentence forty persons, against whom there were different charges; boasting to
					Caesonia when she awoke, "how much business he had dispatched while she was
					taking her mid-day sleep." He exposed to sale by auction, the remains of the
					apparatus used in the public spectacles; and exacted such biddings, and raised
					the prices so high, that some of the purchasers were ruined, and bled themselves
					to death. There is a well-known story told of Aponius Saturninae, who happening
					to fall asleep as he sat on a bench at the sale, Caius called out to the

			<div type="textpart" n="41" subtype="chapter">
				<p>These taxes being imposed, but the act by which they were levied never submitted

					posted up in a corner, so that no one could make a copy of it. To leave no sort

					as well as the young; to his brothel, to come and satisfy their lusts: and he
					was ready to lend his customers money upon interest; clerks attending to take
					down their names in public, as persons who contributed to the emperor's revenue.
					Another method of raising money, which he thought not below his notice, was
					gaming, which, by the help of lying and perjury, he turned to considerable

					legions, and auxiliary forces from all quarters, and made every where new levies
					with the utmost rigour. Collecting supplies of all kinds, such as never had been
					assembled upon the like occasion, he set forward on his march, and pursued it
					sometimes with so much haste and precipitation, that the pretorian cohorts were
					obliged, contrary to custom, to pack their standards on horses or mules, and so
					follow him. At other times, he would march so slow and luxuriously, that he was
					carried in a litter by eight men; ordering the roads to be swept by the people
					of the neighbouring towns, and sprinkled with water to lay the dust.</p>

				<p>On arriving at the camp, in order to show himself an active general, and severe

					alleging against them their age and infirmity; and railing at the covetous

					served out their time to the sum of six thousand sesterces. Though he only

					after dinner, that an enemy was advancing with great impetuosity. This being

					the pretorian knights, into the adjoining wood, where lopping branches from the
					trees, and forming trophies of them, he returned by torch-light, upbraiding
					those who did not follow him, with timorousness and cowardice: but he presented
					the companions and sharers of his victory with crowns of a new form, and under a
					new name, having the sun, moon, and stars represented on them, which he called

					privately sent off; upon notice of which he immediately rose from table, pursued
					them with the cavalry, as if they had run away, and coming up with them, brought
					them back in fetters; proceeding to an extravagant pitch of ostentation likewise
					in his military comedy. Upon his again sitting down to table, it being reported

				<p>Before he left the province he formed a design of the most horrid cruelty-to
					massacre the legions which had mutinied upon the death of Augustus, for seizing

					rash attempt, yet neither the most urgent entreaties nor representations could
					prevent him from persisting in the design of decimating these legions.
					Accordingly, he ordered them to assemble unarmed, without so much as their
					swords, and then surrounded them with armed horse. But finding that many of
					them, suspecting that violence was intended, were making off to arm in their own
					defence, he quitted the assembly as fast as he could, and immediately marched
					for <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, bending now all his fury
					against the senate, whom he publicly threatened, to divert the general attention
					from the clamour excited by his disgraceful conduct. Amongst other pretexts of
					offence, he complained that he was defrauded of a triumph which was justly his
					due, though he had just before forbidden, upon pain of death, any honour to be
					decreed him.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="textpart" n="49" subtype="chapter">
				<p>In his march he was waited upon by deputies from the senatorian order, entreating
					him to hasten his return. He replied to them, "I will come, I will come, and
					this with me," striking at the same time the hilt of his sword. He issued
					likewise this proclamation: "I am coming, but for those only who wish for me,
					the equestrian order and the people; for I shall no longer treat the senate as
					their fellow-citizen or prince." He forbad any of the senators to come to meet
					him; and either abandoning or deferring his triumph, he entered the city in
					ovation on his'birth-day. Within four months from this period he was slain,
					after he had perpetrated enormous crimes, and while he was meditating the
					execution, if possible, of still greater. He had entertained a design of
					removing to <placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName>, and afterwards
					to <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>, having first cut
					off the flower of the equestrian and senatorian orders. This is placed beyond

					contained private marks, and the names of those who were devoted to death. There
					was also found a large chest, filled with a variety of poisons, which being
					afterwards thrown into the sea by order of Claudius, are said to have so
					infected the waters that the fish were poisoned and cast dead by the tide upon

				<p>He was tall, of a pale complexion, ill-shaped, his neck and legs very slender,

					On this account it was reckoned a capital crime for any person to look down from
					above as he was passing by, or so much as to name a goat. His countenance, which
					was naturally hideous and frightful, he purposely rendered more so, forming it
					before a mirror into the most horrible contortions. He was crazy both in body
					and mind, being subject, when a boy, to the falling sickness, When he arrived at
					the age of man hood he endured fatigue tolerably well; but still, occasionally,
					he was liable to a faintness, during which he remained incapable of any effort.

					retiring to clear his brain.<note anchored="true">Probably to Anticyra. See

					administered to him a love potion which threw him into a frenzy. What most of

					hours rest in a night; and even then his sleep was not sound, but disturbed by
					strange dreams, fancying, among other things, that a form representing the ocean
					spoke to him. Being, therefore, often weary with lying awake so long, sometimes
					he sat up in his bed, at others, walked in the longest porticos about the house,

				<p>To this crazy constitution of his mind may, I think, very justly be ascribed two

					excessive confidence and the most abject timidity. For he, who affected so much
					to despise the gods, was ready to shut his eyes and wrap up his head in his
					cloak at the slightest storm of thunder and lightning; and if it was violent he
					got up and hid himself under his bed. In his visit to <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, after ridiculing many strange objects
					which that country affords, he ran away suddenly in the night from <placeName key="tgn,7010924">Messini</placeName>, terrified by the smoke and rumbling
					at the summit of Mount AEtna. And though in words he was very valiant against
					the barbarians, yet upon passing a narrow defile in <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> in his light car, surrounded by a strong body of his
					troops, some one happening to say, "There would be no small consternation
					amongst us if an enemy were to appear," he immediately mounted his horse and
					rode towards the bridge in great haste; but finding them blocked up with
					camp-followers and baggage-wagons, he was in such a hurry that he caused himself
					to be carried in men's hands over the heads of the crowd. Soon afterwards, upon
					hearing that the Germans were again in rebellion, he prepared to quit <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and equipped a fleet, comforting himself

				<p>In the fashion of his clothes, shoes, and all the rest of his dress, he did not

					sleeves, and with bracelets upon his arms; sometimes all in silks and habited
					like a woman; at other times in the crepide or buskins; sometimes in the sort of

				<p>With regard to the liberal sciences, he was little conversant in philology, but

					Seneca, who was then much admired, "wrote only detached essays," and that "his
					language was nothing but sand without lime." He often wrote answers to the
					speeches of successful orators; and employed himself in composing accusations or

				<p>He also zealously applied himself to the practice of several other arts of

					dancing, that he could not refrain in the theatre from singing with the
					tragedians, and imitating the gestures of the actors, either by way of applause
					or correction. A night exhibition which he had ordered the day he was slain, was
					thought to be intended for no other reason, than to take the opportunity
					afforded by the licentiousness of the season, to make his first appearance upon
					the stage. Sometimes, also, he danced in the night. Summoning once to the

			<div type="textpart" n="55" subtype="chapter">
				<p>Those for whom he once conceived a regard, he favoured even to madness. He used
					to kiss Mnester, the pantomimic actor, publicly in the theatre; and if any
					person made the least noise while he was dancing, he would order him to be
					dragged from his seat, and scourged him with his own hand. A Roman knight once

					neither good nor harm to the bearer." He made some gladiators captains of his
					German guards. He deprived the gladiators called Mirmillones of some of their
					arms. One <placeName key="tgn,7013645">Columbus</placeName> coming off with
					victory in a combat, but being slightly wounded, he ordered some poison to be

				<p>In this frantic and savage career, numbers had formed designs for cutting him

					amongst his freedmen, and the prefects of the pretorian guards; because, having
					been nante, though falsely, as concerned in one conspiracy against hipi, they
					perceived that they were suspected and become objects of his hatred. For he had
					immediately endeavoured to render them obnoxious to the soldiery, drawing his

					setting them all mutually at variance. The conspirators having resolved to fall
					upon him as he returned at noon from the <placeName key="tgn,2118187">Palatine</placeName> garies, Cassius Charea, tribune of the pretorian
					guards, claimed the part of making the onset. This Chaerea was now an elderly
					man, and had been often reproached by Caius for effeminacy. When he came for the
					watchword, the latter would give "Priapus," or "<placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName>;" and if on any occasion he returned thanks, would offer

				<p>His approaching fate was indicated by many prodigies. The statue of <placeName key="tgn,2075298">Jupiter</placeName> at <placeName key="tgn,7013967">Olympia</placeName>, which he had ordered to be taken down and brought to
						<placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, suddenly burst out into such
					a violent fit of laughter, that, the machines employed in the work giving way,
					the workmen took to their heels. When this accident happened, there came up a
					man named Cassius, who said that he was commanded in a dream to sacrifice a bull
					to <placeName key="tgn,2075298">Jupiter</placeName>. The Capitol at <placeName key="tgn,7004529">Capua</placeName> was struck with lightning upon the ides
					of March [i th March]; as was also, at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, the apartment of the chief porter of the Palatiun. Some
					construed the latter into a presage that the master of the palace was in danger
					from his own guards; and the other they regarded as a sign, that an illustrious
					person would be cut off, as had happened before on that day. Sylla, the
					astrologer, being consulted by him respecting his nativity, assured him, "That
					death would unavoidably and speedily befall him." The oracle of Fortune at
						<placeName key="tgn,7015535">Antium</placeName> likewise forewarned him of
					Cassius; on which account he had given orders for putting to death Cassius Longi
					nus, at that time proconsul of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>,
					not considering that Chaerea bore also that name. The day preceding his death he
					dreamt that he was standing in heaven near the throne of Jupiter, who giving him
					a push with the great toe of his right foot, he fell headlong upon the earth.
					Some things which happened the very day of his death, and only a little before
					it, were likewise considered as ominous presages of that event. Whilst he was at
					sacrifice, he was bespattered with the blood of a flamingo. And Mnester, the
					pantomimic actor, performed in a play, which the tragedian Neoptolemus had
					formerly acted at the games in which Philip, the king of <placeName key="tgn,7002715">Macedon</placeName>, was slain. And in the piece called
					Laureolus, in which the principal actor, running out in a hurry, and falling,
					vomited blood, several of the inferior actors vying with each other to give the
					best specimen of their art, made the whole stage flow with blood. A spectacle
					had been purposed to be performed that night, in which the fables of the
					infernal regions were to be represented by Egyptians and Ethiopians.</p>

				<p>On the ninth of the calends of February [24th January], and about the seventh

					advice of his friends, he came forth. In the vaulted passage through which he
					had to pass, were some boys of noble extraction, who had been brought from
						<placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> to act upon the stage, waiting

					they stood affected towards him. Nor had the conspirators fixed upon any one to
					succeed him. The senators were so unanimous in their resolution to assert the
					liberty of their country, that the consuls assembled them at first not in the

					Capitol. Some proposed to abolish the memory of the Caesars, and level their

				<head>Remarks on Caligula</head>
				<p>Unfortunately, a great chasm in the annals of Tacitus, at this period, precludes
					all information from that historian respecting the reign of Caligula; but from
					what he mentions towards the close of the preceding chapter, it is evident that
					Caligula was forward to seize the reins of government upon the death of
					Tiberius, whom, though he rivalled him in his vices, he was far from imitating
					in his dissimulation. Amongst the people, the remembrance of Germanicus' virtues
					cherished for his family an attachment which was probably increased by its
					misfortunes; and they were anxious to see revived in the son the popularity of
					the father. Considering, however, that Caligula's vicious disposition was
					already known, and that it had even been an inducement with Tiberius to procure
					his succession, in order that it might prove a foil to his own memory, it is
					surprising that no effort was made at this juncture to shake off the despotism
					which had been so intolerable in the last reign, and restore the ancient liberty
					of the republic. Since the commencement of the imperial dominion, there never
					had been any period so favourable for a counter-revolution as the present
					crisis. There existed now no Livia to
					influence the minds of the senate and people in respect of the government; nor
					was there any other person allied to the family of Germanicus, whose countenance
					or intrigues could promote the views of Caligula. He himself was now only in the
					twenty-fifth year of his age, was totally inexperienced in the administration of
					public affairs, had never performed even the smallest service to his country,
					and was generally known to be of a character which disgraced his illustrious
					descent. Yet, in spite of all these circumstances, such was the destiny of
						<placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, that his accession afforded
					joy to the soldiers, who had known him in his childhood, and to the populace in
					the capital, as well as the people in the provinces, who were flattered with the
					delusive expectation of receiving a prince who should adorn the throne with the
					amiable virtues of Germanicus.</p>
				<p>It is difficult to say, whether weakness of understanding, or corruption of
					morals, were more conspicuous in the character of Caligula. He seems to have
					discovered from his earliest years an innate depravity of mind, which was
					undoubtedly much increased by defect of education. He had lost both his parents
					at an early period of life; and from Tiberius's own character, as well as his views in training the
					person who should succeed him on the throne, there is reason to think, that if
					any attention whatever was paid to the education of Caligula, it was directed to
					vitiate all his faculties and passions, rather than to correct and improve them.
					If such was really the object, it was indeed prosecuted with success.</p>
				<p>The commencement, however, of his reign was such as by no means prognosticated
					its subsequent transition. The sudden change of his conduct, the astonishing
					mixture of imbecility and presumption, of moral turpitude and frantic
					extravagance, which he afterwards evinced; such as rolling himself over heaps of
					gold, his treatment of his horse Incitatus, and his design of making him consul,
					seem to justify a suspicion that his brain had actually been affected, either by
					the potion, said to have been given him by his wife Caesonia, or otherwise.
					Philtres, orlopyejotions, as they were called, were frequent in those times, and
					the people believed that they operated upon the mind by a mysterious and
					sympathetic power. It is, however, beyond a doubt, that their effects were
					produced entirely by the action of their physical the satyrion, which, according
					to Pliny, was a provocative. They were
					generally given by women to their husbands at bed-time; and it was necessary
					towards their successful operation, that the parties should sleep together. This
					circumstance explains the whole mystery. The philtres were nothing more than
					medicines of a stimulating quality, which, after exciting violent, but temporary
					effects, enfeebled the constitution, and occaioned nervous disorders, by which
					the mental faculties, as well as the corporeal, might be injured. That this was
					really the case with Caligula, seems probable, not only from the falling
					sickness, to which he was subject, but from the habitual wakefulness of which he
					complained.</p>
				<p>The profusion of this emperor, during his short reign of three years and ten
					months, is unexampled in history. In the midst of profound peace, without any
					extraordinary charges either civil or military, he expended, in less than one
					year, besides the current revenue of the empire, the sum of $108,796,875, which
					had been left by Tiberius at his death.
					To supply the extravagance of future years, new and exorbitant taxes were
					imposed upon the people, and those too on the necessaries of life. There existed
					now among the Romans every motive that could excite a general indignation
					against the government; yet such was still the dread of imperial power, though
					vested in the hands of so weak and despicable a sovereign, that no insurrection
					was attempted, nor any extensive conspiracy formed; but the obnoxious emperor
					fell at last a sacrifice to a few centurions of his own guard.</p>
				<p>This reign was of too short duration to afford any new productions in literature;
					but, had it been extended to a much longer period, the effects would probably
					have been the same. Polite learning never could flourish under an emperor who
					entertained a design of destroying the writings of Virgil and Livy. It is fortunate that these, and other valuable
					productions of antiquity, were too widely diffused over the world, and too
					carefully preserved, to be in danger of perishing through the frenzy of this
					capricious barbarian. </p>
