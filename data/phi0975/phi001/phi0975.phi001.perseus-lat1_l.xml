<head>Prologue.</head>
<l n="1">WHAT from the founder <placeName key="tgn,2318967">Esop</placeName> fell,</l>
<l n="2">In neat familiar verse I tell:</l>
<l n="3">Twofold's the genius of the page,</l>
<l n="4">To make you smile and make you sage.</l>
<l n="5">But if the critics we displease,</l>
<l n="6">By wrangling brutes and talking trees,</l>
<l n="7">Let them remember, ere they blame,</l>
<l n="8">We're working neither sin nor shame;</l>
<l n="9">'Tis but a play to form the youth</l>
<l n="10">By fiction, in the cause of truth.

<head>The Wolf and the Lamb</head>

<l n="1">BY thirst incited; to the brook</l>
<l n="2">The Wolf and Lamb themselves betook.</l>
<l n="3">The Wolf high up the current drank,</l>
<l n="4">The Lamb far lower down the bank.</l>
<l n="5">Then, bent his ravenous maw to cram,</l>
<l n="6">The Wolf took umbrage at the Lamb.</l>
<l n="7">"How dare you trouble all the flood,</l>
<l n="8">And mingle my good drink with mud?"</l>
<l n="9">"Sir," says the Lambkin, sore afraid,</l>
<l n="10">"How should I act, as you upbraid?</l>
<l n="11">The thing you mention cannot be,</l>
<l n="12">The stream descends from you to me."</l>
<l n="13">Abash'd by facts, says he, " I know</l>
<l n="14">'Tis now exact six months ago</l>
<l n="15">You strove my honest fame to blot"-</l>
<l n="16">"Six months ago, sir, I was not."</l>
<l n="17">"Then 'twas th' old ram thy sire," he cried,</l>
<l n="18">And so he tore him, till he died.</l>
<l n="19">To those this fable I address</l>
<l n="20">Who are determined to oppress,</l>
<l n="21">And trump up any false pretence,</l>
<l n="22">But they will injure innocence.

<head>The Frogs Desiring a King</head>

<l n="1">With equal laws when <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName> throve,</l>
<l n="2">The petulance of freedom drove</l>
<l n="3">Their state to license, which overthrew</l>
<l n="4">Those just restraints of old they knew.</l>
<l n="5">Hence, as a factious discontent</l>
<l n="6">Through every rank and order went,</l>
<l n="7">Pisistratus the tyrant form'd</l>
<l n="8">A party, and the fort he storm'd:</l>
<l n="9">Which yoke, while all bemoaned in grief</l>
<l n="10">(Not that he was a cruel chief,</l>
<l n="11">But they unused to be controlled)</l>
<l n="12">Then <placeName key="tgn,2318967">Esop</placeName> thus his fable told:</l>
<l n="13">The Frogs, a freeborn people made,</l>
<l n="14">From out their marsh with clamor pray'd</l>
<l n="15">That Jove a monarch would assign</l>
<l n="16">With power their manners to refine.</l>
<l n="17">The sovereign smiled, and on their bog</l>
<l n="18">Bent his petitioners a log,</l>
<l n="19">Which, as it dash'd upon the place,</l>
<l n="20">At first alarm'd the tim'rous race.</l>
<l n="21">But ere it long had lain to cool,</l>
<l n="22">One slily peep'd out of the pool,</l>
<l n="23">And finding it a king in jest,</l>
<l n="24">He boldly summoned all the rest.</l>
<l n="25">Now, void of fear, the tribe advance,</l>
<l n="26">And on the timber leap'd and danced,</l>
<l n="27">And having let their fury loose,</l>
<l n="28">In gross affronts and rank abuse,</l>
<l n="29">Of Jove they sought another king,</l>
<l n="30">For useless was this wooden thing.</l>
<l n="31">Then he a water-snake empower'd,</l>
<l n="32">Who one by one their race devoured.</l>
<l n="33">They try to make escape in vain,</l>
<l n="34">Nor, dumb through fear, can they complain.</l>
<l n="35">By stealth they Mercury depute,</l>
<l n="36">That Jove would once more hear their suit,</l>
<l n="37">And send their sinking state to save;</l>
<l n="38">But he in wrath this answer gave:</l>
<l n="39">"You scorn'd the good king that you had,</l>
<l n="40">And therefore you shall bear the bad."</l>
<l n="41">Ye likewise, 0 Athenian friends,</l>
<l n="42">Convinced to what impatience tends,</l>
<l n="43">Though slavery be no common curse,</l>
<l n="44">Be still, for fear of worse and worse.

<head>The Vain Jackdaw</head>

<l n="1">Lest any one himself should plume,</l>
<l n="2">And on his neighbour's worth presume;</l>
<l n="3">But still let Nature's garb prevail-</l>
<l n="4"><placeName key="tgn,2318967">Esop</placeName> has left this little tale:</l>
<l n="5">A Daw, ambitious and absurd,</l>
<l n="6">Pick'd up the quills of Juno's bird;</l>
<l n="7">And, with the gorgeous spoil adorn'd,</l>
<l n="8">All his own sable brethren scorn'd,</l>
<l n="9">And join'd the peacocks-who in scoff</l>
<l n="10">Stripp'd the bold thief; and drove him off</l>
<l n="11">The Daw, thus roughly handled, went</l>
<l n="12">To his own kind in discontent:</l>
<l n="13">But they in turn contemn the spark,</l>
<l n="14">And brand with many a shameful mark.</l>
<l n="15">Then one he formerly disdain'd,</l>
<l n="16">"Had you," said he, "at home remain'd--</l>
<l n="17">Content with Nature's ways and will,</l>
<l n="18">You had not felt the peacock's bill;</l>
<l n="19">Nor 'mongst the birds of your own dress</l>
<l n="20">Had been deserted in distress."

<head>The Dog in the River.</head>
<l n="1">The churl that wants another's fare</l>
<l n="2">Deserves at least to lose his share.</l>
<l n="3">As through the stream a Dog convey'd</l>
<l n="4">A piece of meat, he spied his shade</l>
<l n="5">In the clear mirror of the flood,</l>
<l n="6">And thinking it was flesh and blood,</l>
<l n="7">Snapp'd to deprive him of the treat:-</l>
<l n="8">But mark the glutton's self-defeat,</l>
<l n="9">Miss'd both another's and his own,</l>
<l n="10">Both shade and substance, beef and bone.
</l></div>
<div type="textpart" n="5" subtype="poem">
<head>The Heifer, Goat, Sheep, and Lion.</head>
<l n="1">A partnership with men in power</l>
<l n="2">We cannot build upon an hour.</l>
<l n="3">This Fable proves the fact too true:</l>
<l n="4">An Heifer, Goat, and harmless Ewe,</l>
<l n="5">Were with the Lion as allies,</l>
<l n="6">To raise in desert woods supplies.</l>
<l n="7">There, when they jointly had the luck</l>
<l n="8">To take a most enormous buck,</l>
<l n="9">The Lion first the parts disposed,</l>
<l n="10">And then his royal will disclosed.</l>
<l n="11">" The first, as Lion hight, I crave;</l>
<l n="12">The next you yield to me, as brave;</l>
<l n="13">The third is my peculiar due,</l>
<l n="14">As being stronger far than you;</l>
<l n="15">The fourth you likewise will renounce,</l>
<l n="16">For him that touches, I shall trounce."</l>
<l n="17">Thus rank unrighteousness and force</l>
<l n="18">Seized all the prey without remorse.

<head>The Frogs and Sun</head>

<l n="1">When <placeName key="tgn,2318967">Esop</placeName> saw, with inward grief,</l>
<l n="2">The nuptials of a neighboring thief,</l>
<l n="3">He thus his narrative begun:</l>
<l n="4">Of old 'twas rumor'd that the Sun</l>
<l n="5">Would take a wife: with hideous cries</l>
<l n="6">The quer'lous Frogs alarm'd the skies.</l>
<l n="7">Moved at their murmurs, Jove inquired</l>
<l n="8">What was the thing that they desired?</l>
<l n="9">When thus a tenant of the lake,</l>
<l n="10">In terror, for his brethren spake:</l>
<l n="11">"Ev'n now one Sun too much is found,</l>
<l n="12">And dries up all the pools around,</l>
<l n="13">Till we thy creatures perish here;</l>
<l n="14">But oh, how dreadfully severe,</l>

<head>The Wolf and Crane</head>

<l n="1">Who for his merit seeks a price</l>
<l n="2">From men of violence and vice,</l>
<l n="3">Is twice a fool-first so declared,</l>
<l n="4">As for the worthless he has cared;</l>
<l n="5">Then after all, his honest aim</l>
<l n="6">Must end in punishment and shame.</l>
<l n="7">A bone the Wolf devoured in haste,</l>
<l n="8">Stuck in his greedy throat so fast,</l>
<l n="9">That, tortured with the pain, he roar'd,</l>
<l n="10">And ev'ry beast around implored,</l>
<l n="11">That who a remedy could find</l>
<l n="12">Should have a premium to his mind.</l>
<l n="13">A Crane was wrought upon to trust</l>
<l n="14">His oath at length-and down she thrust</l>
<l n="15">Her neck into his throat impure,</l>
<l n="16">And so perform'd a desp'rate cure.</l>
<l n="17">At which, when she desired her fee,</l>
<l n="18">"You base, ungrateful minx," says he,</l>
<l n="19">"Whom I so kind forbore to kill,</l>

<head>The Hare and the Sparrow</head>
<l n="1">Still to give cautions, as a friend,</l>
<l n="2">And not one's own affairs attend,</l>
<l n="3">Is but impertinent and vain,</l>
<l n="4">As these few verses will explain.</l>
<l n="5">A Sparrow taunted at a Hare</l>
<l n="6">Caught by an eagle high in air,</l>
<l n="7">And screaming loud-- "Where now," says she,</l>
<l n="8">" Is your renown'd velocity ?</l>
<l n="9">Why loiter'd your much boasted speed?"</l>
<l n="10">Just as she spake, an hungry glede</l>
<l n="11">Did on th' injurious railer fall,</l>
<l n="12">Nor could her cries avail at all.</l>
<l n="13">The Hare, with its expiring breath,</l>
<l n="14">Thus said: " See comfort ev'n in death!</l>
<l n="15">She that derided my distress</l>
<l n="16">Must now deplore her own no less."

<head>The Wolf and Fox, with the Ape for Judge</head>
<l n="1">Whoe'er by practice indiscreet</l>

<l n="5">The Wolf the Fox for theft arraigned;</l>
<l n="6">The Fox her innocence maintained:</l>
<l n="7">The Ape, as umpire, takes his seat;</l>
<l n="8">Each pleads his cause with skill and heat.</l>
<l n="9">Then thus the Ape, with aspect grave,</l>
<l n="10">The sentence from the hustings gave:</l>

<head>The Ass and the Lion Hunting</head>

<l n="1">A coward, full of pompous speech,</l>

<l n="4">Who know how far his valor goes.</l>
<l n="5">Once on a time it came to pass,</l>
<l n="6">The Lion hunted with the Ass,</l>
<l n="7">Whom hiding in the thickest shade</l>
<l n="8">He there proposed should lend him aid,</l>
<l n="9">By trumpeting so strange a bray,</l>
<l n="10">That all the beasts he should dismay,</l>

<l n="12">Into the lurking Lion's teeth.</l>
<l n="13">Proud of the task, the long-ear'd loon</l>

<l n="15">That 'twas a miracle to hear-</l>
<l n="16">The beasts forsake their haunts with fear,</l>
<l n="17">And in the Lion's fangs expired:</l>
<l n="18">Who, being now with slaughter tired,</l>
<l n="19">Call'd out the Ass, whose noise he stops.</l>
<l n="20">The Ass, parading from the copse,</l>
<l n="21">Cried out with most conceited scoff,</l>
<l n="22">"How did my music-piece go off?</l>

<l n="6">His image in the silver flood,</l>
<l n="7">And there extols his branching horns,</l>
<l n="8">While his poor spindle-shanks he scorns-</l>
<l n="9">But, lo! he hears the hunter's cries,</l>
<l n="10">And, frightened, o'er the champaign flies--</l>
<l n="11">His swiftness baffles the pursuit:</l>
<l n="12">At length a wood receives the brute,</l>
<l n="13">And by his horns entangled there,</l>
<l n="14">The pack began his flesh to tear:</l>
<l n="15">Then dying thus he wail'd his fate:</l>

<l n="18">Or with your wife your leisure spend,</l>
<l n="19">Relax your mind, your limbs relieve,</l>
<l n="20">And for new toil new strength receive ?</l>
<l n="21">From wordly cares you must estrange</l>
<l n="22">Your thoughts, and feel a perfect change,</l>
<l n="23">If to <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName> you repair,</l>
<l n="24">And seek for your admission there,</l>

<l n="26">On Hill Pierian, where of yore</l>
<l n="27">Mnemosyne in love divine</l>
<l n="28">Brought forth to Jove the tuneful Nine.</l>
<l n="29">Though sprung where genius reign'd with art</l>
<l n="30">I grubb'd up av'rice from my heart,</l>
<l n="31">And rather for applause than pay,</l>
<l n="32">Embrace the literary way)</l>
<l n="33">Yet as a writer and a wit,</l>
<l n="34">With some abatements they admit.</l>
<l n="35">What is his case then, do you think,</l>
<l n="36">Who toils for wealth nor sleeps a wink.</l>

<l n="49">In a few words I now propose</l>
<l n="50">To point from whence the Fable rose.</l>
<l n="51">A servitude was all along</l>
<l n="52">Exposed to most oppressive wrong,</l>
<l n="53">The suff'rer therefore did not dare</l>
<l n="54">His heart's true dictates to declare;</l>
<l n="55">But couch'd his meaning in the veil</l>
<l n="56">Of many an allegoric tale,</l>
<l n="57">And jesting with a moral aim,</l>
<l n="58">Eluded all offence and blame.</l>
<l n="59">This is the path that I pursue,</l>
<l n="60">Inventing more than AEsop knew;</l>
<l n="61">And certain topics by-the-by,</l>
<l n="62">To my own hindrence did I try.</l>
<l n="63">But was there any of mankind,</l>
<l n="64">Besides Sejanus, so inclined,</l>
<l n="65">Who was alone to work my fall,</l>
<l n="66">Informer, witness, judge and all;</l>
<l n="67">I would confess the slander true,</l>
<l n="68">And own such hardships were my due;</l>
<l n="69">Nor would I fly, my grief to ease,</l>
<l n="70">To such poor lenitives as these.</l>
<l n="71">If any through suspicion errs,</l>
<l n="72">And to himself alone refers,</l>
<l n="73">What was design'd for thousands more</l>
<l n="74">He 'll show too plainly, where he's sore</l>
<l n="75">Yet ev'n from such I crave excuse,</l>
<l n="76">For (far from personal abuse)</l>
<l n="77">My verse in gen'ral would put down</l>
<l n="78">True life and manners of the town.</l>
<l n="79">But here, perhaps, some one will ask</l>
<l n="80">Why I, forsooth, embraced this task ?</l>
<l n="81">If <placeName key="tgn,2318967">Esop</placeName>, though a Phrygian, rose,</l>
<l n="82">And ev'n derived from Scythian snows;</l>
<l n="83">If Anacharsis could devise</l>
<l n="84">By wit to gain th' immortal prize;</l>
<l n="85">Shall I, who to learn'd <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> belong,</l>
<l n="86">Neglect her honour and her song,</l>
<l n="87">And by dull sloth myself disgrace ?</l>
<l n="88">Since we can reckon up in <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>,</l>
<l n="89">The authors that have sweetest sung,</l>
<l n="90">Where Linus from Apollo sprung;</l>
<l n="91">And he whose mother was a muse,</l>
<l n="92">Whose voice could tenderness infuse</l>
<l n="93">To solid rocks, strange monsters quell'd,</l>
<l n="94">And <placeName key="tgn,7002660">Hebrus</placeName> in his course withheld.</l>
<l n="95">Envy, stand clear, or thou shalt rue</l>
<l n="96">Th' attack, for glory is my due.</l>
<l n="97">Thus having wrought upon your ear,</l>
<l n="98">I beg that you would be sincere,</l>

<l n="78">Nor branch and root his house o'erthrown."</l>
<l n="79">Nor wholly scorn, nor yet attend</l>
<l n="80">Too much at what the tatlers vend,</l>
<l n="81">Because there's many a sad neglect.</l>
<l n="82">Where you have little to suspect;</l>

<l n="69">The lady soon will sell her farms,</l>

<l n="71">But she that loves the flocks and kine</l>
<l n="72">Will alienate her stores of wine,</l>

<l n="74">Thus none their portions shall enjoy,</l>
<l n="75">And from the money each has made</l>

<l n="8">We lately had a call to name,</l>
<l n="9">Agreed for such a sum to blaze</l>
<l n="10">A certain famous champion's praise.</l>
<l n="11">He therefore a retirement sought,</l>
<l n="12">But found the theme on which he wrote</l>
<l n="13">So scanty, he was forced to use</l>
<l n="14">Th' accustomed license of the muse,</l>
<l n="15">And introduced and praise bestow'd</l>
<l n="16">On Leda's sons to raise his ode;</l>
<l n="17">With these the rather making free,</l>
<l n="18">As heroes in the same degree.</l>
<l n="19">He warranted his work, and yet</l>
<l n="20">Could but one third of payment get.</l>
<l n="21">Upon demanding all the due,</l>
<l n="22">" Let them," says he, "pay t' other two,</l>
<l n="23">Who take two places in the song;</l>
<l n="24">But lest you think I do you wrong</l>
<l n="25">And part in dudgeon-I invite</l>
<l n="26">Your company to sup this night,</l>
<l n="27">For then my friends and kin I see,</l>
<l n="28">'Mongst which I choose to reckon thee."</l>
<l n="29">Choused and chagrined, yet shunning blame,</l>
<l n="30">He promised, set the hour, and came;</l>
<l n="31">As fearful lest a favour spurn'd</l>
<l n="32">Should to an open breach be turn'd.</l>
<l n="33">The splendid banquet shone with plate,</l>
<l n="34">And preparations full of state</l>
<l n="35">Made the glad house with clamors roar-</l>
<l n="36">When on a sudden at the door</l>
<l n="37">Two youths, with sweat and dust besmear'd,</l>
<l n="38">Above the human form appear'd,</l>
<l n="39">And charged forthwith a little scout</l>
<l n="40">To bid Simonides come out,</l>
<l n="41">That 'twas his interest not to stay.-</l>
<l n="42">The slave, in trouble and dismay,</l>
<l n="43">Roused from his seat the feasting bard,</l>
<l n="44">Who scarce had stirr'd a single yard</l>
<l n="45">Before the room at once fell in,</l>
<l n="46">And crushed the champion and his kin.</l>
<l n="47">No youths before the door are found.-</l>
<l n="48">The thing soon spread the country round;</l>
<l n="49">And when each circumstance was weighed,</l>
<l n="50">They knew the gods that visit made,</l>
<l n="51">And saved the poet's life in lieu</l>
<l n="52">Of those two-thirds which yet were due.

<head>Epilogue To Eutychus.</head>
<l n="1">I yet have stock in hand to spare,</l>
<l n="2">And could write on-but will forbear-</l>
<l n="3">First, lest I tire a friend, whose state</l>
<l n="4">And avocations are so great:</l>
<l n="5">And then, if other pens should try</l>
<l n="6">This morals cheme as well as I,</l>
<l n="7">They may have something to pursue:--</l>
<l n="8">Yet if the spacious field we view,</l>
<l n="9">More men are wanting for the plan,</l>
<l n="10">Rather than matter for the man.</l>
<l n="11">Now for that prize I make my plea</l>
<l n="12">You promised to my brevity.</l>
<l n="13">Keep your kind word; for life, my friend,</l>
<l n="14">Is daily nearer to its end;</l>
<l n="15">And I shall share your love the less</l>
<l n="16">The longer you your hand repress:</l>
<l n="17">The sooner you the boon insure,</l>
<l n="18">The more the tenure must endure;</l>
<l n="19">And if I quick possession take,</l>
<l n="20">The greater profit must I make,</l>
<l n="21">While yet declining age subsists,</l>
<l n="22">A room for friendly aid exists.</l>
<l n="23">Anon with tasteless years grown weak,</l>
<l n="24">In vain benevolence will seek</l>
<l n="25">To do me good-when Death at hand</l>
<l n="26">Shall come and urge his last demand.</l>
<l n="27">'Tis folly, you'll be apt to say,</l>
<l n="28">A thousand times to beg and pray</l>
<l n="29">Of one with so much worth and sense,</l>
<l n="30">Whose gen'rous bounty is propense.</l>
<l n="31">If e'er a miscreant succeeds,</l>
<l n="32">By fair confession of his deeds,</l>
<l n="33">An innocent offender's case</l>
<l n="34">Is far more worthy of your grace.</l>
<l n="35">You for example sake begin,</l>
<l n="36">Then others to the lure you'll win,</l>
<l n="37">And in rotation more and more</l>
<l n="38">Will soon communicate their stoic.</l>
<l n="39">Consider in your mind how far</l>
<l n="40">At stake your word and honour are;</l>
<l n="41">And let your closing the debate</l>
<l n="42">By what I may congratulate.</l>
<l n="43">I have been guilty of excess</l>
<l n="44">Beyond my thought in this address</l>
<l n="45">But 'tis not easy to refrain</l>
<l n="46">A spirit work'd up to disdain</l>
<l n="47">By wretches insolent and vile,</l>
<l n="48">With a clear conscience all the while.</l>
<l n="49">You'll ask me, sir, at whom I hint-</l>
<l n="50">In time they may appear in print.</l>
<l n="51">But give me leave to cite a phrase</l>
<l n="52">I met with in my boyish days.</l>
<l n="53">"'Tis dangerous for the mean and low</l>
<l n="54">Too plain their grievances to show."</l>
<l n="55">This is advice I shall retain</l>
<l n="56">While life and sanity remain.

<l n="17">But now a tale comes in of course,</l>
<l n="18">Which these assertions will enforce.</l>
<l n="19">Demetrius, who was justly call'd</l>
<l n="20">The tyrant, got himself install'd,</l>
<l n="21">And held o'er <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> impious sway.</l>
<l n="22">The crowd, as ever is the way,</l>
<l n="23">Came, eager rushing far and wide,</l>
<l n="24">And, "Fortunate event!" they cried.</l>
<l n="25">The nobles came, the throne address'd'</l>
<l n="26">The hand by which they were oppress'd</l>
<l n="27">They meekly kiss'd, with inward stings</l>
<l n="28">Of anguish for the face of things.</l>
<l n="29">The idlers also, with the tribe</l>
<l n="30">Of those who to themselves prescribe</l>
<l n="31">Their ease and pleasure, in the end</l>
<l n="32">Came sneaking, lest they should offend.</l>
<l n="33">Amongst this troop Menander hies,</l>
<l n="34">So famous for his comedies</l>
<l n="35">(Him, though he was not known by sight,</l>
<l n="36">The tyrant read with great delight,</l>

<l n="38">In flowing robes bedaub'd with nard,</l>
<l n="39">And saunt'ring tread he came along,</l>
<l n="40">Whom, at the bottom of the throng,</l>
<l n="41">When Phalereus beheld, he said:</l>
<l n="42">" How dares that fribble show his head</l>
<l n="43">In this our presence ?" he was told-</l>
<l n="44">" It is Menander you behold."</l>

<l n="2">One fearful; one without dismay,</l>
<l n="3">An able fencer. As they went,</l>
<l n="4">A robber came with black intent;</l>
<l n="5">Demanding, upon pain of death,</l>
<l n="6">Their gold and silver in a breath.</l>

<l n="10">Soon as the rogue was fairly slain,</l>

<l n="12">And drew his sword, and stripp'd in buff-</l>
<l n="13">"Leave me alone with him! stand back!</l>

<l n="15">Then he who fought, " I wish, my friend,</l>

<l n="1">In ev'ry age, in each profession,</l>
<l n="2">Men err the most by prepossession;</l>
<l n="3">But when the thing is clearly shown,</l>
<l n="4">Is fairly urged, and fully known,</l>
<l n="5">We soon applaud what we deride.</l>

<l n="14">There came a genius who profess'd</l>
<l n="15">To have a curious trick in store</l>
<l n="16">That never was performed before.</l>
<l n="17">Through all the town this soon got air,</l>
<l n="18">And the whole house was like a fair;</l>
<l n="19">But soon his entry as he made,</l>
<l n="20">Without a prompter or parade,</l>
<l n="21">'Twas all expectance and suspense,</l>
<l n="22">And silence gagg'd the audience.</l>
<l n="23">He, stooping down and looking big,</l>
<l n="24">So wondrous well took off a pig,</l>
<l n="25">All swore 'twas serious, and no joke,</l>
<l n="26">For that, or underneath his cloak</l>
<l n="27">He had concealed some grunting elf,</l>
<l n="28">Or was a real hog himself</l>
<l n="29">A search was made-no pig was found-</l>
<l n="30">With thund'ring claps the seats resound,</l>

<l n="37">Declaring to each beau and belle</l>
<l n="38">That he this grunter would excel.</l>
<l n="39">The morrow came-the crowd was greater--</l>
<l n="40">But prejudice and rank ill-nature</l>
<l n="41">Usurp'd the minds of men and wenches,</l>
<l n="42">Who came to hiss and break the benches.</l>

<l n="58">Was hiss'd, and catcall'd from the house.</l>
<l n="59">" Soft ye, a word before I go,"</l>

<l n="56">The people think that Prince's aim</l>
<l n="57">Is for a crown of bays at least.</l>
<l n="58">Now all the seats perceived the jest,</l>
<l n="59">And with his bandage white as snow,</l>
<l n="60">White frock, white pumps, a perfect beauty</l>
<l n="61">Proud of the feats he had achieved,</l>
<l n="62">And these high honours he received,</l>
<l n="63">With one unanimous huzza,</l>
<l n="64">Poor Prince was kick'd out of the play.

<head>Opportunity</head>

<l n="1">Bald, naked, of a human shape,</l>
<l n="2">With fleet wings ready to escape,</l>
<l n="3">Upon a razor's edge his toes,</l>
<l n="4">And lock that on his forehead grows-</l>
<l n="5">Him hold, when seized, for goodness' sake</l>
<l n="6">For Jove himself cannot retake</l>
<l n="7">The fugitive when once he's gone.</l>
<l n="8">The picture that we here have drawn</l>
<l n="9">Is Opportunity so brief.-</l>
<l n="10">The ancients, in a bas-relief,</l>
<l n="11">Thus made an effigy of Time,</l>
<l n="12">That every one might use their prime;</l>
<l n="13">Nor e'er impede, by dull delay,</l>
<l n="14">Th' effectual business of to-day.

<head>The Bull and the Calf</head>

<l n="1">A Bull was struggling to secure</l>
<l n="2">His passage at a narrow door,</l>
<l n="3">And scarce could reach the rack of hay,</l>
<l n="4">His horns so much were in his way.</l>
<l n="5">A Calf officious, fain would show</l>
<l n="6">How he might twist himself and go.</l>
<l n="7">"Hold thou thy prate; all this," says he,</l>
<l n="8">Ere thou wert calved was known to me."</l>
<l n="9">He, that a wiser man by half</l>
<l n="10">Would teach, may think himself this Calf.

<head>The Old Dog and the Huntsman</head>

<l n="1">A Dog, that time and often tried,</l>
<l n="2">His master always satisfied;</l>
<l n="3">And whensoever he assail'd,</l>
<l n="4">Against the forest-beasts prevail'd</l>
<l n="5">Both by activity and strength,,</l>
<l n="6">Through years began to flag at length</l>
<l n="7">One day, when hounded at a boar,</l>
<l n="8">His ear he seized, as heretofore;</l>
<l n="9">But with his teeth, decay'd and old,</l>
<l n="10">Could not succeed to keep his hold.</l>
<l n="11">A t which the huntsman, much concern'd,</l>

<l n="15">For what I am if I am chid,</l>

<l n="18">Of this, with which I take my leave.</l></div></div>
