<head>Prologue.</head>
<l n="tr">WHAT from the founder <placeName key="tgn,2318967">Esop</placeName> fell,</l>
<l n="tr">In neat familiar verse I tell:</l>
<l n="tr">Twofold's the genius of the page,</l>
<l n="tr">To make you smile and make you sage.</l>
<l n="tr">But if the critics we displease,</l>
<l n="tr">By wrangling brutes and talking trees,</l>
<l n="tr">Let them remember, ere they blame,</l>
<l n="tr">We're working neither sin nor shame;</l>
<l n="tr">'Tis but a play to form the youth</l>
<l n="tr">By fiction, in the cause of truth.
</l></div2>
<div2 type="poem" n="1">
<head>The Wolf and the Lamb</head>

<l n="tr">BY thirst incited; to the brook</l>
<l n="tr">The Wolf and Lamb themselves betook.</l>
<l n="tr">The Wolf high up the current drank,</l>
<l n="tr">The Lamb far lower down the bank.</l>
<l n="tr">Then, bent his ravenous maw to cram,</l>
<l n="tr">The Wolf took umbrage at the Lamb.</l>
<l n="tr">"How dare you trouble all the flood,</l>
<l n="tr">And mingle my good drink with mud?"</l>
<l n="tr">"Sir," says the Lambkin, sore afraid,</l>
<l n="tr">"How should I act, as you upbraid?</l>
<l n="tr">The thing you mention cannot be,</l>
<l n="tr">The stream descends from you to me."</l>
<l n="tr">Abash'd by facts, says he, " I know</l>
<l n="tr">'Tis now exact six months ago</l>
<l n="tr">You strove my honest fame to blot"-</l>
<l n="tr">"Six months ago, sir, I was not."</l>
<l n="tr">"Then 'twas th' old ram thy sire," he cried,</l>
<l n="tr">And so he tore him, till he died.</l>
<l n="tr">To those this fable I address</l>
<l n="tr">Who are determined to oppress,</l>
<l n="tr">And trump up any false pretence,</l>
<l n="tr">But they will injure innocence.

<div2 type="poem" n="2">
<head>The Frogs Desiring a King</head>

<l n="tr">With equal laws when <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName> throve,</l>
<l n="tr">The petulance of freedom drove</l>
<l n="tr">Their state to license, which overthrew</l>
<l n="tr">Those just restraints of old they knew.</l>
<l n="tr">Hence, as a factious discontent</l>
<l n="tr">Through every rank and order went,</l>
<l n="tr">Pisistratus the tyrant form'd</l>
<l n="tr">A party, and the fort he storm'd:</l>
<l n="tr">Which yoke, while all bemoaned in grief</l>
<l n="tr">(Not that he was a cruel chief,</l>
<l n="tr">But they unused to be controlled)</l>
<l n="tr">Then <placeName key="tgn,2318967">Esop</placeName> thus his fable told:</l>
<l n="tr">The Frogs, a freeborn people made,</l>
<l n="tr">From out their marsh with clamor pray'd</l>
<l n="tr">That Jove a monarch would assign</l>
<l n="tr">With power their manners to refine.</l>
<l n="tr">The sovereign smiled, and on their bog</l>
<l n="tr">Bent his petitioners a log,</l>
<l n="tr">Which, as it dash'd upon the place,</l>
<l n="tr">At first alarm'd the tim'rous race.</l>
<l n="tr">But ere it long had lain to cool,</l>
<l n="tr">One slily peep'd out of the pool,</l>
<l n="tr">And finding it a king in jest,</l>
<l n="tr">He boldly summoned all the rest.</l>
<l n="tr">Now, void of fear, the tribe advance,</l>
<l n="tr">And on the timber leap'd and danced,</l>
<l n="tr">And having let their fury loose,</l>
<l n="tr">In gross affronts and rank abuse,</l>
<l n="tr">Of Jove they sought another king,</l>
<l n="tr">For useless was this wooden thing.</l>
<l n="tr">Then he a water-snake empower'd,</l>
<l n="tr">Who one by one their race devoured.</l>
<l n="tr">They try to make escape in vain,</l>
<l n="tr">Nor, dumb through fear, can they complain.</l>
<l n="tr">By stealth they Mercury depute,</l>
<l n="tr">That Jove would once more hear their suit,</l>
<l n="tr">And send their sinking state to save;</l>
<l n="tr">But he in wrath this answer gave:</l>
<l n="tr">"You scorn'd the good king that you had,</l>
<l n="tr">And therefore you shall bear the bad."</l>
<l n="tr">Ye likewise, 0 Athenian friends,</l>
<l n="tr">Convinced to what impatience tends,</l>
<l n="tr">Though slavery be no common curse,</l>
<l n="tr">Be still, for fear of worse and worse.
</l></div2>
<div2 type="poem" n="3">
<head>The Vain Jackdaw</head>

<l n="tr">Lest any one himself should plume,</l>
<l n="tr">And on his neighbour's worth presume;</l>
<l n="tr">But still let Nature's garb prevail-</l>
<l n="tr"><placeName key="tgn,2318967">Esop</placeName> has left this little tale:</l>
<l n="tr">A Daw, ambitious and absurd,</l>
<l n="tr">Pick'd up the quills of Juno's bird;</l>
<l n="tr">And, with the gorgeous spoil adorn'd,</l>
<l n="tr">All his own sable brethren scorn'd,</l>
<l n="tr">And join'd the peacocks-who in scoff</l>
<l n="tr">Stripp'd the bold thief; and drove him off</l>
<l n="tr">The Daw, thus roughly handled, went</l>
<l n="tr">To his own kind in discontent:</l>
<l n="tr">But they in turn contemn the spark,</l>
<l n="tr">And brand with many a shameful mark.</l>
<l n="tr">Then one he formerly disdain'd,</l>
<l n="tr">"Had you," said he, "at home remain'd--</l>
<l n="tr">Content with Nature's ways and will,</l>
<l n="tr">You had not felt the peacock's bill;</l>
<l n="tr">Nor 'mongst the birds of your own dress</l>
<l n="tr">Had been deserted in distress."
</l></div2>
<div2 type="poem" n="4">
<head>The Dog in the River.</head>
<l n="tr">The churl that wants another's fare</l>
<l n="tr">Deserves at least to lose his share.</l>
<l n="tr">As through the stream a Dog convey'd</l>
<l n="tr">A piece of meat, he spied his shade</l>
<l n="tr">In the clear mirror of the flood,</l>
<l n="tr">And thinking it was flesh and blood,</l>
<l n="tr">Snapp'd to deprive him of the treat:-</l>
<l n="tr">But mark the glutton's self-defeat,</l>
<l n="tr">Miss'd both another's and his own,</l>
<l n="tr">Both shade and substance, beef and bone.
</l></div2>
<div2 type="poem" n="5">
<head>The Heifer, Goat, Sheep, and Lion.</head>
<l n="tr">A partnership with men in power</l>
<l n="tr">We cannot build upon an hour.</l>
<l n="tr">This Fable proves the fact too true:</l>
<l n="tr">An Heifer, Goat, and harmless Ewe,</l>
<l n="tr">Were with the Lion as allies,</l>
<l n="tr">To raise in desert woods supplies.</l>
<l n="tr">There, when they jointly had the luck</l>
<l n="tr">To take a most enormous buck,</l>
<l n="tr">The Lion first the parts disposed,</l>
<l n="tr">And then his royal will disclosed.</l>
<l n="tr">" The first, as Lion hight, I crave;</l>
<l n="tr">The next you yield to me, as brave;</l>
<l n="tr">The third is my peculiar due,</l>
<l n="tr">As being stronger far than you;</l>
<l n="tr">The fourth you likewise will renounce,</l>
<l n="tr">For him that touches, I shall trounce."</l>
<l n="tr">Thus rank unrighteousness and force</l>
<l n="tr">Seized all the prey without remorse.
</l></div2>
<div2 type="poem" n="6">
<head>The Frogs and Sun</head>

<l n="tr">When <placeName key="tgn,2318967">Esop</placeName> saw, with inward grief,</l>
<l n="tr">The nuptials of a neighboring thief,</l>
<l n="tr">He thus his narrative begun:</l>
<l n="tr">Of old 'twas rumor'd that the Sun</l>
<l n="tr">Would take a wife: with hideous cries</l>
<l n="tr">The quer'lous Frogs alarm'd the skies.</l>
<l n="tr">Moved at their murmurs, Jove inquired</l>
<l n="tr">What was the thing that they desired?</l>
<l n="tr">When thus a tenant of the lake,</l>
<l n="tr">In terror, for his brethren spake:</l>
<l n="tr">"Ev'n now one Sun too much is found,</l>
<l n="tr">And dries up all the pools around,</l>
<l n="tr">Till we thy creatures perish here;</l>
<l n="tr">But oh, how dreadfully severe,</l>
<l n="tr">Should he at length be made a sire,</l>
<l n="tr">And propagate a race of fire !"
</l></div2>
<div2 type="poem" n="7">
<head>The Fox and the Tragic Mask</head>

<l n="tr">A Fox beheld a Mask- "0 rare</l>
<l n="tr">The headpiece, if but brains were there !"</l>
<l n="tr">This holds-whene'er the Fates dispense</l>
<l n="tr">Pomp, pow'r, and everything but sense.
</l></div2>
<div2 type="poem" n="8">
<head>The Wolf and Crane</head>

<l n="tr">Who for his merit seeks a price</l>
<l n="tr">From men of violence and vice,</l>
<l n="tr">Is twice a fool-first so declared,</l>
<l n="tr">As for the worthless he has cared;</l>
<l n="tr">Then after all, his honest aim</l>
<l n="tr">Must end in punishment and shame.</l>
<l n="tr">A bone the Wolf devoured in haste,</l>
<l n="tr">Stuck in his greedy throat so fast,</l>
<l n="tr">That, tortured with the pain, he roar'd,</l>
<l n="tr">And ev'ry beast around implored,</l>
<l n="tr">That who a remedy could find</l>
<l n="tr">Should have a premium to his mind.</l>
<l n="tr">A Crane was wrought upon to trust</l>
<l n="tr">His oath at length-and down she thrust</l>
<l n="tr">Her neck into his throat impure,</l>
<l n="tr">And so perform'd a desp'rate cure.</l>
<l n="tr">At which, when she desired her fee,</l>
<l n="tr">"You base, ungrateful minx," says he,</l>
<l n="tr">"Whom I so kind forbore to kill,</l>
<l n="tr">And now, forsooth, you'd bring your bill!"
</l></div2>
<div2 type="poem" n="9">
<head>The Hare and the Sparrow</head>
<l n="tr">Still to give cautions, as a friend,</l>
<l n="tr">And not one's own affairs attend,</l>
<l n="tr">Is but impertinent and vain,</l>
<l n="tr">As these few verses will explain.</l>
<l n="tr">A Sparrow taunted at a Hare</l>
<l n="tr">Caught by an eagle high in air,</l>
<l n="tr">And screaming loud-- "Where now," says she,</l>
<l n="tr">" Is your renown'd velocity ?</l>
<l n="tr">Why loiter'd your much boasted speed?"</l>
<l n="tr">Just as she spake, an hungry glede</l>
<l n="tr">Did on th' injurious railer fall,</l>
<l n="tr">Nor could her cries avail at all.</l>
<l n="tr">The Hare, with its expiring breath,</l>
<l n="tr">Thus said: " See comfort ev'n in death!</l>
<l n="tr">She that derided my distress</l>
<l n="tr">Must now deplore her own no less."
</l></div2>
<div2 type="poem" n="10">
<head>The Wolf and Fox, with the Ape for Judge</head>
<l n="tr">Whoe'er by practice indiscreet</l>
<l n="tr">Has pass'd for a notorious cheat,</l>
<l n="tr">Will shortly find his credit fail,</l>
<l n="tr">Though he speak truth, says <placeName key="tgn,2318967">Esop</placeName>'s tale.</l>
<l n="tr">The Wolf the Fox for theft arraigned;</l>
<l n="tr">The Fox her innocence maintained:</l>
<l n="tr">The Ape, as umpire, takes his seat;</l>
<l n="tr">Each pleads his cause with skill and heat.</l>
<l n="tr">Then thus the Ape, with aspect grave,</l>
<l n="tr">The sentence from the hustings gave:</l>
<l n="tr">"For you, Sir Wolf, I do descry</l>
<l n="tr">That all your losses are a lie-</l>
<l n="tr">And you, with negatives so stout,</l>
<l n="tr">0 Fox! have stolen the goods no doubt."
</l></div2>
<div2 type="poem" n="11">
<head>The Ass and the Lion Hunting</head>

<l n="tr">A coward, full of pompous speech,</l>
<l n="tr">The ignorant may overreach;</l>
<l n="tr">But is the laughing-stock of those</l>
<l n="tr">Who know how far his valor goes.</l>
<l n="tr">Once on a time it came to pass,</l>
<l n="tr">The Lion hunted with the Ass,</l>
<l n="tr">Whom hiding in the thickest shade</l>
<l n="tr">He there proposed should lend him aid,</l>
<l n="tr">By trumpeting so strange a bray,</l>
<l n="tr">That all the beasts he should dismay,</l>
<l n="tr">And drive them o'er the desert heath</l>
<l n="tr">Into the lurking Lion's teeth.</l>
<l n="tr">Proud of the task, the long-ear'd loon</l>
<l n="tr">Struck up such an outrageous tune,</l>
<l n="tr">That 'twas a miracle to hear-</l>
<l n="tr">The beasts forsake their haunts with fear,</l>
<l n="tr">And in the Lion's fangs expired:</l>
<l n="tr">Who, being now with slaughter tired,</l>
<l n="tr">Call'd out the Ass, whose noise he stops.</l>
<l n="tr">The Ass, parading from the copse,</l>
<l n="tr">Cried out with most conceited scoff,</l>
<l n="tr">"How did my music-piece go off?</l>
<l n="tr">So well-were not thy courage known,</l>
<l n="tr">Their terror had been all my own!"
</l></div2>
<div2 type="poem" n="12">
<head>The Stag at the Fountain</head>

<l n="tr">FULL often what you now despise</l>
<l n="tr">Proves better than the things you prize;</l>
<l n="tr">Let <placeName key="tgn,2318967">Esop</placeName>'s narrative decide:</l>
<l n="tr">A Stag beheld, with conscious pride,</l>
<l n="tr">(As at the fountain-head he stood)</l>
<l n="tr">His image in the silver flood,</l>
<l n="tr">And there extols his branching horns,</l>
<l n="tr">While his poor spindle-shanks he scorns-</l>
<l n="tr">But, lo! he hears the hunter's cries,</l>
<l n="tr">And, frightened, o'er the champaign flies--</l>
<l n="tr">His swiftness baffles the pursuit:</l>
<l n="tr">At length a wood receives the brute,</l>
<l n="tr">And by his horns entangled there,</l>
<l n="tr">The pack began his flesh to tear:</l>
<l n="tr">Then dying thus he wail'd his fate:</l>
<l n="tr">"Unhappy me! and wise too late!</l>
<l n="tr">How useful what I did disdain!</l>
<l n="tr">How grievous that which made me vain!
</l></div2>
<div2 type="poem" n="13">
<head>The Fox and the Crow</head>

<l n="tr">His folly in repentance ends,</l>
<l n="tr">Who, to a flatt'ring knave attends.</l>
<l n="tr">A Crow, her hanger to appease,</l>
<l n="tr">Had from a window stolen some cheese,</l>
<l n="tr">And sitting on a lofty pine</l>
<l n="tr">In state, was just about to dine.</l>
<l n="tr">This, when a Fox observed below,</l>
<l n="tr">He thus harangued the foolish Crow:</l>
<l n="tr">" Lady, how beauteous to the view</l>
<l n="tr">Those glossy plumes of sable hue!</l>
<l n="tr">Thy features how divinely fair!</l>
<l n="tr">With what a shape, and what an air!</l>
<l n="tr">Could you but frame your voice to sing,</l>
<l n="tr">You'd have no rival on the wing.'</l>
<l n="tr">But she, now willing to display</l>
<l n="tr">Her talents in the vocal way,</l>
<l n="tr">Let go the cheese of luscious taste,</l>
<l n="tr">Which Renard seized with greedy haste.</l>
<l n="tr">The grudging dupe now sees at last</l>
<l n="tr">That for her folly she must fast.
</l></div2>
<div2 type="poem" n="14">
<head>The Cobbler Turned Doctor</head>

<l n="tr">A bankrupt Cobbler, poor and lean,</l>
<l n="tr">(No bungler e'er was half so mean)</l>
<l n="tr">Went to a foreign place, and there</l>
<l n="tr">Began his med'cines to prepare;</l>
<l n="tr">But one of more especial note</l>
<l n="tr">He call'd his sovereign antidote;</l>
<l n="tr">And by his technical bombast</l>
<l n="tr">Contrived to raise a name at last.</l>
<l n="tr">It happen'd that the king was sick,</l>
<l n="tr">Who, willing to detect the trick,</l>
<l n="tr">Call'd for some water in an ewer,</l>
<l n="tr">Poison in which he feign'd to pour</l>
<l n="tr">The antidote was likewise mix'd;</l>
<l n="tr">He then upon th' empiric fix'd</l>
<l n="tr">To take the medicated cup,</l>
<l n="tr">And, for a premium, drink it up</l>
<l n="tr">The quack, through dread of death, confessed</l>
<l n="tr">That he was of no skill possessed;</l>
<l n="tr">But all this great and glorious job</l>
<l n="tr">Was made of nonsense and the mob.</l>
<l n="tr">Then did the king his peers convoke,</l>
<l n="tr">And thus unto th' assembly spoke:</l>
<l n="tr">" My lords and gentlemen, I rate</l>
<l n="tr">Your folly as inordinate,</l>
<l n="tr">Who trust your heads into his hand,</l>
<l n="tr">Where no one had his heels japann'd."--</l>
<l n="tr">This story their attention craves</l>
<l n="tr">Whose weakness is the prey of knaves.

<head>The Sapient Ass</head>

<l n="tr">In all the changes of a state,</l>
<l n="tr">The poor are the most fortunate,</l>
<l n="tr">Who, save the name of him they call</l>
<l n="tr">Their king, can find no odds at all.</l>
<l n="tr">The truth of this you now may read-</l>
<l n="tr">A fearful old man in a mead,</l>
<l n="tr">While leading of his Ass about,</l>
<l n="tr">Was startled at the sudden shout</l>
<l n="tr">Of enemies approaching nigh.</l>
<l n="tr">He then advised the Ass to fly,</l>
<l n="tr">"Lest we be taken in the place:"</l>
<l n="tr">But loth at all to mend his pace,</l>
<l n="tr">"Pray, will the conqueror," quoth Jack,</l>
<l n="tr">"With double panniers load my back ?"</l>
<l n="tr">"No," says the man. "If that's the thing,"</l>
<l n="tr">Cries he, "I care not who is king."

<head>The Sheep, the Stag, and the Wolf</head>
<l n="tr">When one rogue would another get</l>

<l n="tr">'Tis not the thing t' accept the terms,</l>
<l n="tr">But dread th' event-the tale affirms.</l>
<l n="tr">A Stag approached the Sheep, to treat</l>
<l n="tr">For one good bushel of her wheat.</l>
<l n="tr">"The honest Wolf will give his bond."</l>
<l n="tr">At which, beginning to despond,</l>
<l n="tr">"The Wolf (cries she) 's a vagrant bite,</l>

<l n="tr">One loaf directly to refund,</l>

<l n="tr">The Wolf was summoned, and he swore</l>
<l n="tr">It was not one, but ten or more.</l>
<l n="tr">The Sheep was therefore cast at law</l>
<l n="tr">To pay for things she never saw.</l>
<l n="tr">But, lo! ere many days ensued,</l>

<head>The Bitch and Her Puppies</head>

<l n="tr">Bad men have speeches smooth and fair,</l>
<l n="tr">Of which, that we should be aware,</l>
<l n="tr">And such designing villains thwart,</l>
<l n="tr">The underwritten lines exhort.</l>
<l n="tr">A Bitch besought one of her kin</l>
<l n="tr">For room to put her Puppies in:</l>
<l n="tr">She, loth to say her neighbour nay,</l>
<l n="tr">Directly lent both hole and hay.</l>
<l n="tr">But asking to be repossessed,</l>
<l n="tr">For longer time the former press'd,</l>
<l n="tr">Until her Puppies gathered strength,</l>
<l n="tr">Which second lease expired at length;</l>

<l n="tr">Him setting on th' the eternal base,</l>
<l n="tr">Whom servile rank could not disgrace;</l>
<l n="tr">That they might teach to all makind</l>
<l n="tr">The way to honor's unconfined,</l>
<l n="tr">That glory's due to rising worth,</l>
<l n="tr">And not alone to pomp and birth.</l>
<l n="tr">Since then another seized the post</l>
<l n="tr">Lest I priority should boast,</l>
<l n="tr">This pow'r and praise was yet my own,</l>
<l n="tr">That he should not excel alone:</l>
<l n="tr">Nor is this Envy's jealous ire,</l>
<l n="tr">But Emulation's genuine fire.</l>
<l n="tr">And if <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> should approve my piece,</l>
<l n="tr">She'll soon have more to rival <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>.</l>
<l n="tr">But should th' invidious town declare</l>
<l n="tr">Against my plodding over-care,</l>
<l n="tr">They cannot take away, nor hurt</l>
<l n="tr">Th' internal conscience of desert.</l>
<l n="tr">If these my studies reach their aim,</l>
<l n="tr">And, reader, your attention claim,</l>
<l n="tr">If your perception fully weighs</l>
<l n="tr">The drift of these my labour'd lays;</l>
<l n="tr">Then such success precludes complaint.</l>
<l n="tr">But if the Picture which I paint</l>

<l n="tr">Whom luckless Nature brought to light,</l>
<l n="tr">Who scorn the labours of a man,</l>
<l n="tr">And when they carp do all they can;</l>
<l n="tr">Yet must this fatal cause to mourn</l>

<head>Prologue, To Eutychus.</head>
<l n="tr">THE tales of Phaedrus would you read,</l>

<l n="tr">From business, that the mind unbent</l>
<l n="tr">May take the author's full intent.</l>
<l n="tr">You urge that this poetic turn</l>
<l n="tr">Of mine is not of such concern,</l>
<l n="tr">As with your time to interfere</l>
<l n="tr">A moment's space: 'tis therefore clear</l>
<l n="tr">For those essays you have no call,</l>
<l n="tr">Which suit not your affairs at all</l>

<l n="tr">That I shall make a holiday,</l>

<l n="tr">And can you such vile stuff peruse,</l>
<l n="tr">Rather than serve domestic views,</l>
<l n="tr">Return the visits of a friend,</l>
<l n="tr">Or with your wife your leisure spend,</l>
<l n="tr">Relax your mind, your limbs relieve,</l>
<l n="tr">And for new toil new strength receive ?</l>
<l n="tr">From wordly cares you must estrange</l>
<l n="tr">Your thoughts, and feel a perfect change,</l>
<l n="tr">If to <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName> you repair,</l>
<l n="tr">And seek for your admission there,</l>
<l n="tr">Me-(whom a Grecian mother bore</l>
<l n="tr">On Hill Pierian, where of yore</l>
<l n="tr">Mnemosyne in love divine</l>
<l n="tr">Brought forth to Jove the tuneful Nine.</l>
<l n="tr">Though sprung where genius reign'd with art</l>
<l n="tr">I grubb'd up av'rice from my heart,</l>
<l n="tr">And rather for applause than pay,</l>
<l n="tr">Embrace the literary way)</l>
<l n="tr">Yet as a writer and a wit,</l>
<l n="tr">With some abatements they admit.</l>
<l n="tr">What is his case then, do you think,</l>
<l n="tr">Who toils for wealth nor sleeps a wink.</l>
<l n="tr">Preferring to the pleasing pain</l>
<l n="tr">Of composition sordid gain ?</l>
<l n="tr">But hap what will (as Sinon said,</l>
<l n="tr">When to king Priam he was led),</l>
<l n="tr">I book the third shall now fulfil,</l>

<l n="tr">Which book I dedicate to you,</l>
<l n="tr">As both to worth and honour due</l>

<l n="tr">As conscious of a sure event,</l>
<l n="tr">That these my fables shall remain,</l>
<l n="tr">And after-ages entertain.</l>
<l n="tr">In a few words I now propose</l>
<l n="tr">To point from whence the Fable rose.</l>
<l n="tr">A servitude was all along</l>
<l n="tr">Exposed to most oppressive wrong,</l>
<l n="tr">The suff'rer therefore did not dare</l>
<l n="tr">His heart's true dictates to declare;</l>
<l n="tr">But couch'd his meaning in the veil</l>
<l n="tr">Of many an allegoric tale,</l>
<l n="tr">And jesting with a moral aim,</l>
<l n="tr">Eluded all offence and blame.</l>
<l n="tr">This is the path that I pursue,</l>
<l n="tr">Inventing more than AEsop knew;</l>
<l n="tr">And certain topics by-the-by,</l>
<l n="tr">To my own hindrence did I try.</l>
<l n="tr">But was there any of mankind,</l>
<l n="tr">Besides Sejanus, so inclined,</l>
<l n="tr">Who was alone to work my fall,</l>
<l n="tr">Informer, witness, judge and all;</l>
<l n="tr">I would confess the slander true,</l>
<l n="tr">And own such hardships were my due;</l>
<l n="tr">Nor would I fly, my grief to ease,</l>
<l n="tr">To such poor lenitives as these.</l>
<l n="tr">If any through suspicion errs,</l>
<l n="tr">And to himself alone refers,</l>
<l n="tr">What was design'd for thousands more</l>
<l n="tr">He 'll show too plainly, where he's sore</l>
<l n="tr">Yet ev'n from such I crave excuse,</l>
<l n="tr">For (far from personal abuse)</l>
<l n="tr">My verse in gen'ral would put down</l>
<l n="tr">True life and manners of the town.</l>
<l n="tr">But here, perhaps, some one will ask</l>
<l n="tr">Why I, forsooth, embraced this task ?</l>
<l n="tr">If <placeName key="tgn,2318967">Esop</placeName>, though a Phrygian, rose,</l>
<l n="tr">And ev'n derived from Scythian snows;</l>
<l n="tr">If Anacharsis could devise</l>
<l n="tr">By wit to gain th' immortal prize;</l>
<l n="tr">Shall I, who to learn'd <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> belong,</l>
<l n="tr">Neglect her honour and her song,</l>
<l n="tr">And by dull sloth myself disgrace ?</l>
<l n="tr">Since we can reckon up in <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>,</l>
<l n="tr">The authors that have sweetest sung,</l>
<l n="tr">Where Linus from Apollo sprung;</l>
<l n="tr">And he whose mother was a muse,</l>
<l n="tr">Whose voice could tenderness infuse</l>
<l n="tr">To solid rocks, strange monsters quell'd,</l>
<l n="tr">And <placeName key="tgn,7002660">Hebrus</placeName> in his course withheld.</l>
<l n="tr">Envy, stand clear, or thou shalt rue</l>
<l n="tr">Th' attack, for glory is my due.</l>
<l n="tr">Thus having wrought upon your ear,</l>
<l n="tr">I beg that you would be sincere,</l>

<l n="tr">That candor, all the world allow.

<l n="tr">A Dog, as fat as dog could be:</l>

<l n="tr">"If with my master you'll abide."</l>
<l n="tr">"For what ?" "Why merely to attend,</l>

<l n="tr">" I gladly will accept the post,</l>

<l n="tr">And all this rough inclement plight,</l>

<l n="tr">With fabulous antiquity,</l>
<l n="tr">I now a curious tale shall tell,</l>
<l n="tr">Which I myself remember well.</l>
<l n="tr">An honest man, that loved his wife,</l>
<l n="tr">Was introducing into life</l>
<l n="tr">A son upon the man's estate.</l>
<l n="tr">One day a servant (whom, of late,</l>
<l n="tr">He with his freedom had endu'd)</l>
<l n="tr">Took him aside, and being shrewd,</l>
<l n="tr">Supposed that he might be his heir</l>
<l n="tr">When he'd divulged the whole affair.</l>
<l n="tr">Much did he lie against the youth,</l>
<l n="tr">But more against the matron's truth:</l>
<l n="tr">And hinted that, which worst of all</l>
<l n="tr">Was sure a lover's heart to gall,</l>
<l n="tr">The visits of a lusty rake,</l>
<l n="tr">And honour of his house at stake.</l>
<l n="tr">He at this scandal taking heat,</l>
<l n="tr">Pretends a journey to his seat;</l>
<l n="tr">But stopp'd at hand, while it was light,</l>
<l n="tr">Where, on a sudden, and by night,</l>
<l n="tr">He to his wife's apartment sped,</l>
<l n="tr">Where she had put the lad to bed,</l>
<l n="tr">As watchful of his youthful bloom.</l>
<l n="tr">While now they're running to the room,</l>
<l n="tr">And seek a light in haste, the sire,</l>
<l n="tr">No longer stifling of his ire,</l>
<l n="tr">Flies to the couch, where grouping round,</l>
<l n="tr">A head, but newly shaved, he found;</l>
<l n="tr">Then, as alone, he vengeance breath'd,</l>
<l n="tr">The sword within his bosom sheath'd-</l>

<l n="tr">The bleeding youth, and by his side</l>
<l n="tr">The spotless dame, who being fast</l>
<l n="tr">Asleep, knew nothing that had pass'd,</l>
<l n="tr">Instant in utmost grief involved,</l>
<l n="tr">He vengeance for himself resolved;</l>
<l n="tr">And on that very weapon flew,</l>
<l n="tr">Which his too cred'lous fury drew.</l>
<l n="tr">Th' accusers take the woman straight,</l>
<l n="tr">And drag to the centumvirate;</l>

<l n="tr">A strong suspicion of her guilts,</l>

<l n="tr">The Drones asserted they had wrought.</l>
<l n="tr">Then to the bar the cause was brought</l>

<l n="tr">Who well might argue either brief,</l>
<l n="tr">As of a middle nature made.</l>
<l n="tr">He therefore to both parties said:</l>
<l n="tr">"You're not dissimilar in size,</l>

<l n="tr">That there's a doubt concerning both:</l>
<l n="tr">But, lest I err, upon my oath,</l>

<l n="tr">That, from the flavor and the form,</l>
<l n="tr">We may point out the genuine swarm."</l>
<l n="tr">The Drones refuse, the Bees agree-</l>
<l n="tr">Then thus did Justice Wasp decree:</l>
<l n="tr">" Who can, and who cannot, is plain,</l>
<l n="tr">So take, ye Bees, your combs again."</l>

<l n="tr">She founder'd soon as out at sea.</l>
<l n="tr">Some purses, some their jewels tie</l>

<l n="tr">Which these assertions will enforce.</l>
<l n="tr">Demetrius, who was justly call'd</l>

<l n="tr">The crowd, as ever is the way,</l>
<l n="tr">Came, eager rushing far and wide,</l>
<l n="tr">And, "Fortunate event!" they cried.</l>
<l n="tr">The nobles came, the throne address'd'</l>
<l n="tr">The hand by which they were oppress'd</l>
<l n="tr">They meekly kiss'd, with inward stings</l>

<l n="tr">The idlers also, with the tribe</l>
<l n="tr">Of those who to themselves prescribe</l>
<l n="tr">Their ease and pleasure, in the end</l>
<l n="tr">Came sneaking, lest they should offend.</l>
<l n="tr">Amongst this troop Menander hies,</l>
<l n="tr">So famous for his comedies</l>
<l n="tr">(Him, though he was not known by sight,</l>
<l n="tr">The tyrant read with great delight,</l>
<l n="tr">Struck with the genius of the bard.)</l>
<l n="tr">In flowing robes bedaub'd with nard,</l>
<l n="tr">And saunt'ring tread he came along,</l>
<l n="tr">Whom, at the bottom of the throng,</l>
<l n="tr">When Phalereus beheld, he said:</l>
<l n="tr">" How dares that fribble show his head</l>
<l n="tr">In this our presence ?" he was told-</l>
<l n="tr">" It is Menander you behold."</l>
<l n="tr">Then, changed at once from fierce to bland,</l>

<l n="tr">Then he who fought, " I wish, my friend,</l>

<head>The Buffoon and Country-fellow</head>

<l n="tr">In ev'ry age, in each profession,</l>
<l n="tr">Men err the most by prepossession;</l>
<l n="tr">But when the thing is clearly shown,</l>
<l n="tr">Is fairly urged, and fully known,</l>
<l n="tr">We soon applaud what we deride.</l>
<l n="tr">And penitence succeeds to pride.</l>
<l n="tr">A certain noble, on a day,</l>
<l n="tr">Having a mind to show away,</l>
<l n="tr">Invited by reward the mimes</l>
<l n="tr">And play'rs and tumblers of the times,</l>
<l n="tr">And built a large commodious stage</l>
<l n="tr">For the choice spirits of the age:</l>
<l n="tr">But, above all, amongst the rest</l>
<l n="tr">There came a genius who profess'd</l>
<l n="tr">To have a curious trick in store</l>
<l n="tr">That never was performed before.</l>
<l n="tr">Through all the town this soon got air,</l>
<l n="tr">And the whole house was like a fair;</l>
<l n="tr">But soon his entry as he made,</l>
<l n="tr">Without a prompter or parade,</l>
<l n="tr">'Twas all expectance and suspense,</l>
<l n="tr">And silence gagg'd the audience.</l>
<l n="tr">He, stooping down and looking big,</l>
<l n="tr">So wondrous well took off a pig,</l>
<l n="tr">All swore 'twas serious, and no joke,</l>
<l n="tr">For that, or underneath his cloak</l>
<l n="tr">He had concealed some grunting elf,</l>
<l n="tr">Or was a real hog himself</l>
<l n="tr">A search was made-no pig was found-</l>
<l n="tr">With thund'ring claps the seats resound,</l>
<l n="tr">And pit, and box, and gall'ries roar</l>
<l n="tr">With--" 0 rare! bravo !" and " encore."</l>
<l n="tr">Old Roger Grouse, a country clown,</l>
<l n="tr">Who yet knew something of the town,</l>
<l n="tr">Beheld the mimic of his whim,</l>
<l n="tr">And on the morrow challenged him</l>
<l n="tr">Declaring to each beau and belle</l>
<l n="tr">That he this grunter would excel.</l>
<l n="tr">The morrow came-the crowd was greater--</l>
<l n="tr">But prejudice and rank ill-nature</l>
<l n="tr">Usurp'd the minds of men and wenches,</l>
<l n="tr">Who came to hiss and break the benches.</l>
<l n="tr">The mimic took his usual station,</l>
<l n="tr">And squeak'd with general approbation;</l>
<l n="tr">Again "Encore! encore!" they cry-</l>
<l n="tr">" 'Tis quite the thing, 'tis very high."</l>
<l n="tr">Old Grouse conceal'd, amidst this racket,</l>
<l n="tr">A real pig beneath his jacket-</l>
<l n="tr">Then forth he came, and with his nail</l>
<l n="tr">He pinch'd the urchin by the tail.</l>
<l n="tr">The tortured pig, from out his throat,</l>
<l n="tr">Produced the genuine nat'ral note.</l>
<l n="tr">All bellow'd out 'twas very sad!</l>
<l n="tr">Sure never stuff was half so bad.</l>
<l n="tr">" That like a pig!" each cried in scoff;</l>
<l n="tr">"Pshaw! nonsense! blockhead! off! off! off!"</l>

<l n="tr">Was hiss'd, and catcall'd from the house.</l>
<l n="tr">" Soft ye, a word before I go,"</l>
<l n="tr">Quoth honest Hodge; and stooping low,</l>
<l n="tr">Produced the pig, and thus aloud</l>

<head>Prince the Piper</head>

<l n="tr">A little, friv'lous, abject mind,</l>
<l n="tr">Pleased with the rabble, puff'd with wind,</l>
<l n="tr">When once, as fast as pride presumes,</l>
<l n="tr">Itself with vanity it plumes,</l>
<l n="tr">Is by fond lightness brought with ease</l>
<l n="tr">To any ridicule you please.</l>
<l n="tr">One Prince, a piper to the play,</l>
<l n="tr">Was rather noted in his way,</l>
<l n="tr">As call'd upon to show his art,</l>
<l n="tr">Whene'er Bathyllus did his part,</l>

<l n="tr">(I do not well remember where,)</l>

<l n="tr">Not taking heed, his leg displaced,</l>

<l n="tr">(Would he his pipes had rather marr'd!</l>
<l n="tr">Though they, poor fellow! were to him</l>
<l n="tr">As dear almost as life and limb).</l>
<l n="tr">Borne by the kind officious crowd,</l>
<l n="tr">Home he's conducted, groaning loud.</l>
<l n="tr">Some months elapsed before he found</l>
<l n="tr">Himself recover'd of his wound:</l>
<l n="tr">Meantime, according to their way,</l>
<l n="tr">The droll frequenters of the play</l>
<l n="tr">Had a great miss of him, whose touch</l>
<l n="tr">The dancers' spirits raised so much.</l>
<l n="tr">A certain man of high renown</l>
<l n="tr">Was just preparing for the town</l>
<l n="tr">Some games the mob to entertain,</l>
<l n="tr">When Prince began to walk again;</l>
<l n="tr">Whom, what with bribes and pray'rs, his grace?</l>
<l n="tr">Prevail'd upon to show his face</l>
<l n="tr">In this performance, by all means-</l>
<l n="tr">And while he waits behind the scenes,</l>
<l n="tr">A rumour through the house is spread,</l>
<l n="tr">By certain, that "the piper's dead."</l>
<l n="tr">Others cried out, "The man is here,</l>
<l n="tr">And will immediately appear."</l>
<l n="tr">The curtain draws, the lightnings flash,</l>
<l n="tr">The gods speak out their usual trash.</l>
<l n="tr">An ode, not to the Piper known,</l>
<l n="tr">Was to the chorus leader shown,</l>
<l n="tr">Which he was order'd to repeat,</l>
<l n="tr">And which was closed with this conceit--</l>
<l n="tr">"Receive with joy, O loyal <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>,</l>
<l n="tr">Thy Prince just rescued from his tomb."</l>
<l n="tr">They all at once stand up and clap,</l>
<l n="tr">At which my most facetious chap</l>
<l n="tr">Kisses his hand, and scrapes and bows</l>
<l n="tr">To his good patrons in the house.</l>
<l n="tr">First the equestrian order smoke</l>
<l n="tr">The fool's mistake, and high in joke,</l>
<l n="tr">Command the song to be encored;</l>
<l n="tr">Which ended, flat upon the board</l>
<l n="tr">The <placeName key="tgn,2091960">Piper</placeName> falls, the knights acclaim;</l>
<l n="tr">The people think that Prince's aim</l>
<l n="tr">Is for a crown of bays at least.</l>
<l n="tr">Now all the seats perceived the jest,</l>
<l n="tr">And with his bandage white as snow,</l>
<l n="tr">White frock, white pumps, a perfect beauty</l>
<l n="tr">Proud of the feats he had achieved,</l>
<l n="tr">And these high honours he received,</l>
<l n="tr">With one unanimous huzza,</l>
