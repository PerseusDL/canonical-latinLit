<l n="37">That dealt the wound and left the death behind.<note anchored="true">Mr. Froude in his essay entitled 'Divus Caesar' hints that these famous lines may have been written in mockery. Probably the five years known as the Golden Era of Nero had passed when they were written: yet the text itself does not aid such a suggestion; and the view generally taken, namely that Lucan was in earnest, appears preferable. There were many who dreamed at the time that the disasters of the Civil War were being compensated by the wealth and prosperity of the empire under Nero; and the assurance of universal peace, then almost realised, which is expressed in lines 69-71, seems inconsistent with the idea that this passage was written in irony. Lecky ('European Morals from Augustus to Charlemagne,' vol. i. p. 240) describes these latter verses as written 'with all the fervour of a <placeName key="tgn,2000780">Christian</placeName> poet.' See also Merivale's ' Roman Empire,'chapter liv.</note></l>

<l n="67">Where Caesar sits be evermore serene</l>
<l n="68">And smile upon us with unclouded blue.</l>
<l n="69">Then may all men lay down their arms, and peace</l>
<l n="70">Through all the nations reign, and shut the gates</l>
<l n="71">That close the temple of the God of War.</l>

<l n="83">The world's disruption, all things shall revert</l>
<l n="84">To that primaeval chaos, stars on stars</l>

<l n="105">No king shall brook his fellow, nor shall rule</l>

<l n="213">Great tumults pondering and the coming shock.</l>
<l n="214">Now on the marge of <placeName key="tgn,1129218">Rubicon</placeName>, he saw,</l>
<l n="215">In face most sorrowful and ghostly guise,</l>
<l n="216">His trembling country's image; huge it seemed</l>
<l n="217">Through mists of night obscure; and hoary hair</l>
<l n="218">Streamed from the lofty front with turrets crowned:</l>
<l n="219">Torn were her locks and naked were her arms.</l>
<l n="220">Then thus, with broken sighs the Vision spake:</l>
<l n="221">What seek ye, men of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>?  and whither hence</l>
<l n="222">Bear ye my standards?  If by right ye come,</l>
<l n="223">My citizens, stay here; these are the bounds;</l>
<l n="224">No further dare.' But Caesar's hair was stiff</l>
<l n="225">With horror as he gazed, and ghastly dread</l>
<l n="226">Restrained his footsteps on the further bank.</l>
<l n="227">Then spake he, ' Thunderer, who from the rock</l>
<l n="228">Tarpeian seest the wall of mighty <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>;</l>
<l n="229">Gods of my race who watched o'er <placeName key="tgn,7014164">Troy</placeName> of old;</l>
<l n="230">Thou Jove of Alba's height, and <placeName key="tgn,2744463">Vestal</placeName> fires,</l>
<l n="231">And rites of <placeName key="tgn,2072021">Romulus</placeName> erst rapt to heaven,</l>
<l n="232">And God-like <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>; be friendly to my quest.</l>
<l n="233">Not with offence or hostile arms I come,</l>
<l n="234">Thy Caesar, conqueror by land and sea,</l>
<l n="235">Thy soldier here and wheresoe'er thou wilt:</l>
<l n="236">No other's; his, his only be the guilt</l>
<l n="237">Whose acts make me thy foe.' He gives the word</l>
<l n="238">And bids his standards cross the swollen stream.</l>
<l n="239">So in the wastes of Afric's burning clime</l>
<l n="240">The lion crouches as his foes draw near,</l>
<l n="241">Feeding his wrath the while, his lashing tail</l>
<l n="242">Provokes his fury; stiff upon his neck</l>
<l n="243">Bristles his mane: deep from his gaping jaws</l>
<l n="244">Resounds the muttered growl, and should a lance</l>
<l n="245">Or javelin reach him from the hunter's ring,</l>
<l n="246">Scorning the puny scratch he bounds afield.</l>
<l n="247">From modest fountain blood-red <placeName key="tgn,1129218">Rubicon</placeName></l>
<l n="248">In summer's heat flows on; his pigmy tide</l>
<l n="249">Creeps through the valleys and with slender marge</l>
<l n="250">Divides the Italian peasant from the <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>.</l>
<l n="251">Then winter gave him strength, and fraught with rain</l>
<l n="252">The third day's crescent moon; while Eastern winds</l>
<l n="253">Thawed from the Alpine slopes the yielding snow.</l>
<l n="254">The cavalry first form across the stream</l>
<l n="255">To break the torrent's force; the rest with ease</l>
<l n="256">Beneath their shelter gain the further bank.</l>
<l n="257">When Caesar crossed and trod beneath his feet</l>
<l n="258">The soil of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>'s forbidden fields,</l>
<l n="259">Here,' spake he, 'peace, here broken laws be left;</l>
<l n="260">Farewell to treaties. Fortune, lead me on;</l>
<l n="261">War is our judge, and in the fates our trust.'</l>
<l n="262">Then in the shades of night he leads the troops</l>
<l n="263">Swifter than Balearic sling or shaft</l>
<l n="264">Winged by retreating Parthian, to the walls</l>
<l n="265">Of threatened <placeName key="tgn,7004929">Rimini</placeName>, while fled the stars,</l>
<l n="266">Save Lucifer, before the coming sun,</l>
<l n="267">Whose fires were veiled in clouds, by south wind driven,</l>
<l n="268">Or else at heaven's command: and thus drew on</l>
<l n="269">The first dark morning of the civil war.</l>
<l n="270">Now stood the troops within the captured town,</l>
<l n="271">Their standards planted; and the trumpet clang</l>
<l n="272">Rang forth in harsh alarums, giving note</l>
<l n="273">Of impious strife: roused from their sleep the men</l>
<l n="274">Rushed to the hall and snatched the ancient arms</l>
<l n="275">Long hanging through the years of peace;  the shield</l>
<l n="276">With crumbling frame; dark with the tooth of rust</l>

<l n="279">But when the well-known signs and eagles shone,</l>
<l n="280">And Caesar towering o'er the throng was seen,</l>
<l n="281">They shook for terror, fear possessed their limbs,</l>
<l n="282">And thoughts unuttered stirred within their souls.</l>
<l n="283">O miserable those to whom their home</l>

<l n="295">As when in winter all the fields are still,</l>
<l n="296">And birds are voiceless, and no murmured sound</l>
<l n="297">Breaks on the silence of the central sea;</l>
<l n="298">So deep the stillness. But when through the shades</l>

This was in effect a declaration of war; and Curio, after a last attempt at resistance, left the city, and betook himself to Caesar. (See the close of Book IV.)</note></l>

<l n="510">While you, ye Druids,<note anchored="true">The horror of the Druidical groves is again alluded to in Book III., lines 460-490. Dean Merivale remarks (chapter li.) on this passage, that in the despair of another life which pervaded Paganism at the time, the Roman was exasperated at the Druids' assertion of the transmigration ofsouls. But the passage seems also to betray a lingering suspicion that the doctrine may in some shape be true, however horrible were the rites and sacrifices. The reality of a future life was a part of Lucan's belief, as a state of reward for heroes. (See the passage at the beginning of Book IX.)  But all was vague and uncertain, and he appears to have viewed the Druidical transmigration rather with doubt and unbelief, as a possible form of future or recurring life, than with scorn as an absurdity.</note>  when the war was done,</l>

<l n="5">How seemed it just to thee, <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>' king,</l>
<l n="6">That suffering mortals at thy doom should know</l>
<l n="7">By dreadful omens massacres to come?</l>
<l n="8">Or did the primal parent of the world</l>
<l n="9">When first the flames gave way and yielding left</l>
<l n="10">Matter unformed to his subduing hand,</l>
<l n="11">And realms unbalanced, fix by stern decree</l>
<l n="12">Unalterable laws to bind the whole</l>

<l n="23">No plaints were uttered, and a voiceless grief</l>

<l n="26">Before the mother calls the name aloud</l>
<l n="27">Or bids her grieving maidens beat the breast,</l>
<l n="28">While still she marks the glazing eye, and soothes</l>
<l n="29">The stiffening limbs and gazes on the face,</l>
<l n="30">In dread, not sorrow yet, in wondering awe</l>
<l n="31">Of death approaching: and with mind distraught</l>
<l n="32">Clings to the dying in a last embrace.</l>
<l n="33">The matrons laid aside their wonted garb:</l>
<l n="34">Crowds filled the temples-on the unpitying stones</l>
<l n="35">Some dashed their bosoms; others bathed with tears</l>
<l n="36">The statues of the gods;  some tore their hair</l>
<l n="37">Upon the holy threshold, and with shrieks</l>
<l n="38">And vows unceasing called upon the names</l>
<l n="39">Of those whom mortals supplicate. Nor all</l>
<l n="40">Lay in the Thunderer's fane: at every shrine</l>
<l n="41">Some prayers were offered which refused would bring</l>

<l n="752">Escape to hinder, and with labour vain</l>
<l n="753">Piled in the greedy main gigantic rocks:</l>
<l n="754">Mountains of earth down to the sandy depths</l>

<l n="756">Just as if <placeName key="perseus,Eryx">Eryx</placeName> and its lofty top</l>
<l n="757">Were cast into the deep, yet not a speck</l>
<l n="758">Should mark the watery plain; or Gaurus huge</l>
<l n="759">Split from his summit to his base, were plunged</l>
<l n="760">In fathomless Avernus' stagnant pool.</l>
<l n="761">The billows thus unstemmed, 'twas Caesar's will</l>
<l n="762">To hew the stately forests and with trees</l>
<l n="763">Enchained to form a rampart. Thus of old</l>
<l n="764">(If fame be true) the boastful Persian king</l>
<l n="765">Prepared a way across the rapid strait</l>
<l n="766">'Twixt Sestos and <placeName key="tgn,6000030">Abydos</placeName>, and made one</l>
<l n="767">The European and the Trojan shores;</l>
<l n="768">And marched upon the waters, wind and storm</l>
<l n="769">Counting as nought, but trusting his emprise</l>
<l n="770">To one frail bridge, so that his ships might pass</l>
<l n="771">Through middle <placeName key="tgn,7002722">Athos</placeName>. Thus a mighty mole</l>
<l n="772">Of fallen forests grew upon the waves,</l>
<l n="773">Free until then, and lofty turrets rose,</l>
<l n="774">And land usurped the entrance to the main.</l>
<l n="775">This when Pompeius saw, with anxious care</l>
<l n="776">His soul was filled; yet hoping to regain</l>
<l n="777">The exit lost, and win a wider world</l>
<l n="778">Wherein to wage the war, on chosen ships</l>
<l n="779">He hoists the sails; these, driven by the wind</l>
<l n="780">Which filled the bellying sails, not once nor twice</l>
<l n="781">Scattered the beams asunder; and at night</l>
<l n="782">Not seldom engines, worked by stalwart arms,</l>
<l n="783">Flung flaming torches forth. But when the time</l>
<l n="784">For secret flight was come, no sailor shout</l>
<l n="785">Rang on the shore, no trumpet marked the hour,</l>
<l n="786">No clarion called the armament to sea.</l>
<l n="787">Already shone the Virgin in the sky</l>
<l n="788">Leading the Scorpion in her course, whose claws</l>
<l n="789">Foretell the rising Sun, when noiseless all</l>
<l n="790">They cast the vessels loose; no song was heard</l>
<l n="791">To greet the anchor wrenched from stubborn sand;</l>
<l n="792">No captain's order, when the lofty mast</l>
<l n="793">Was raised, or yards were bent; a silent crew</l>
<l n="794">Drew down the sails which hung upon the ropes,</l>
<l n="795">Nor shook the mighty cables, lest the wind</l>
<l n="796">Should sound upon them. But the chief, in prayer,</l>
<l n="797">Thus spake to Fortune: ' Thou whose high decree</l>
<l n="798">Has made us exiles from <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italia</placeName>'s shores,</l>
<l n="799">Grant us at least to leave them.' Yet the fates</l>
<l n="800">Hardly permitted, for a murmur vast</l>
<l n="801">Came from the ocean, as the countless keels</l>
<l n="802">Furrowed the waters, and with ceaseless splash</l>
<l n="803">The parted billows rose again and fell.</l>
<l n="804">Then were the gates thrown wide; for with the fates</l>
<l n="805">The city turned to Caesar: and the foe,</l>
<l n="806">Seizing the town, rushed onward by the pier</l>
<l n="807">That circled in the harbour; then they knew</l>
<l n="808">With shame and sorrow that the fleet was gone</l>
<l n="809">And held the open: and Pompeius' flight</l>
<l n="810">Gave a poor triumph.    Yet was narrower far</l>
<l n="811">The channel which gave access to the sea</l>
<l n="812">Than that Euboean strait <note anchored="true">It seems that the Euripus was bridged over. (Mr. Haskins' note.)</note>  whose waters lave</l>
<l n="813">The shore by <placeName key="perseus,Chalcis">Chalcis</placeName>. Here two ships stuck fast</l>
<l n="814">Alone, of all the fleet; the fatal hook</l>
<l n="815">Grappled their decks and drew them to the land,</l>
<l n="816">And the first bloodshed of the civil war</l>
<l n="817">Here left a blush upon the ocean wave.</l>
<l n="818">As when the famous ship <note anchored="true">The '<placeName key="tgn,1094163">Argo</placeName>.'</note>  sought <placeName key="tgn,7012263">Phasis</placeName>' stream</l>
<l n="819">The rocky gates closed in and hardly gripped</l>
<l n="820">Her flying stern; then from the empty sea</l>
<l n="821">The cliffs rebounding to their ancient seat</l>
<l n="822">Were fixed to move no more. But now the steps</l>
<l n="823">Of morn approaching tinged the eastern sky</l>
<l n="824">With roseate hues: the Pleiades were dim,</l>
<l n="825">The wagon of the Charioteer grew pale,</l>
<l n="826">The planets faded, and the silvery star</l>
<l n="827">Which ushers in the day, was lost in light.</l>
<l n="828">Thou, Magnus, hold'st the deep; yet not the same</l>
<l n="829">Now are thy fates, as when from every sea</l>
<l n="830">Thy fleet triumphant swept the pirate pest.</l>
<l n="831">Tired of thy conquests, Fortune now no more</l>
<l n="832">Shall smile upon thee. With thy spouse and sons,</l>
<l n="833">Thy household gods, and peoples in thy train,</l>
<l n="834">Still great in exile, in a distant land</l>
<l n="835">Thou seek'st thy fated fall; not that the gods,</l>
<l n="836">Wishing to rob thee of a Roman grave,</l>
<l n="837">Decreed the strands of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> for thy tomb:</l>
<l n="838">'Twas Italy they spared, that far away</l>
<l n="839">Fortune on shores remote might hide her crime,</l>

<l n="130">Yet in one breast the spirit of Freedom rose</l>

<l n="165">Rose yet the more, and at his soldiers' swords</l>
<l n="166">One look he cast, forgetting for the time</l>
<l n="167">What robe he wore; but soon Metellus heard</l>
<l n="168">These words from Cotta: ' When men bow to power</l>

Herodotus (7, 60) says the men were numbered in ten thousands by being packed close together and having a circle drawn round them. After the first ten thousand had been so measured a fence was put where the circle had been, and the subsequent ten thousands were driven into the enclosure. It is not unlikely that they piled their weapons before being so measured, and Lucan's account would then be made to agree with that of Herodotus.  Francken, on the other hand, quotes a Scholiast, who says that each hundredth man shot off an arrow. See Mr. J. A. R.

<l n="434">Fit (as he deemed it) for a camp with ditch</l>
<l n="435">And mound encircling. To a lofty height</l>
<l n="436">The nearest portion of the city rose,</l>
<l n="437">While intervening valleys lay between.</l>
<l n="438">These summits with a mighty trench to bind</l>
<l n="439">The chief resolves, gigantic though the toil.</l>
<l n="440">But first, from furthest boundaries of his camp,</l>
<l n="441">Enclosing streams and meadows, to the sea</l>
<l n="442">To draw a rampart, upon either hand</l>

<l n="445">Then did the Grecian city win renown</l>
<l n="446">Eternal, deathless, for that uncompelled</l>
<l n="447">Nor fearing for herself, but free to act</l>
<l n="448">She made the conqueror pause: and he who seized</l>

<l n="459">Its chill recesses; matted boughs entwined</l>
<l n="460">Prisoned the air within. No sylvan nymphs</l>
<l n="461">Here found a home, nor Pan, but savage rites</l>
<l n="462">And barbarous worship, altars horrible</l>
<l n="463">On massive stones upreared; sacred with blood</l>
<l n="464">Of men was every tree. If faith be given</l>
<l n="465">To ancient myth, no fowl has ever dared</l>
<l n="466">To rest upon those branches, and no beast</l>

<l n="470">Filled with mysterious trembling; dripped the streams</l>
<l n="471">From coal-black fountains; effigies of gods</l>
<l n="472">Rude, scarcely fashioned from some fallen trunk</l>
<l n="473">Held the mid space: and, pallid with decay,</l>
<l n="474">Their rotting shapes struck terror. Thus do men</l>
<l n="475">Dread most the god unknown. 'Twas said that caves</l>
<l n="476">Rumbled with earthquakes, that the prostrate yew</l>
<l n="477">Rose up again; that fiery tongues of flame</l>
<l n="478">Gleamed in the forest depths, yet were the trees</l>
<l n="479">Unkindled; and that snakes in frequent folds</l>
<l n="480">Were coiled around the trunks. Men flee the spot</l>
<l n="481">Nor dare to worship near: and e'en the priest</l>
<l n="482">Or when bright Phoebus holds the height, or when</l>
<l n="483">Dark night controls the heavens, in anxious dread</l>
<l n="484">Draws near the grove and fears to find its lord.</l>
<l n="485">Spared in the former war, still dense it rose</l>
<l n="486">Where all the hills were bare, and Caesar now</l>
<l n="487">Its fall commanded. But the brawny arms</l>
<l n="488">Which swayed the axes trembled, and the men,</l>
<l n="489">Awed by the sacred grove's dark majesty,</l>
<l n="490">Held back the blow they thought would be returned.</l>
<l n="491">This Caesar saw, and swift within his grasp</l>
<l n="492">Uprose a ponderous axe, which downward fell</l>
<l n="493">Cleaving a mighty oak that towered to heaven,</l>
<l n="494">While thus he spake: ' Henceforth let no man dread</l>
<l n="495">'To fell this forest : all the crime is mine.</l>
<l n="496">'This be your creed.' He spake, and all obeyed,</l>
<l n="497">For Caesar's ire weighed down the wrath of Heaven.</l>
<l n="498">Yet ceased they not to fear. Then first the oak,</l>
<l n="499"><placeName key="perseus,Dodona">Dodona</placeName>'s ancient boast; the knotty holm;</l>
<l n="500">The cypress, witness of patrician grief,</l>
<l n="501">The buoyant alder, laid their foliage low</l>
<l n="502">Admitting day; though scarcely through the stems</l>
<l n="503">Their fall found passage. At the sight the Gauls</l>
<l n="504">Grieved; but the garrison within the walls</l>
<l n="505">Rejoiced: for thus shall men insult the gods</l>
<l n="506">And find no punishment?  Yet fortune oft</l>
<l n="507">Protects the guilty; on the poor alone</l>
<l n="508">The gods can vent their ire. Enough hewn down,</l>
<l n="509">They seize the country wagons; and the hind,</l>
<l n="510">His oxen gone which else had drawn the plough,</l>

<l part="F" n="tr">But the eager chief</l>
<l n="511">Impatient of the combat by the walls</l>
<l n="512">Carries the warfare to the furthest west.</l>
<l n="513">Meanwhile a giant mound, on star-shaped wheels</l>
<l n="514">Concealed, they fashion, crowned with double towers</l>
<l n="515">High as the battlements, by cause unseen</l>
<l n="516">Slow creeping onwards; while amazed the foe</l>

<l n="518">Had burst the caverns of the earth and forced</l>
<l n="519">The nodding pile aloft, and wondered sore</l>
<l n="520">Their walls should stand unshaken. From its height</l>
<l n="521">Hissed down the weapons; but the Grecian bolts</l>
<l n="522">WVith greater force were on the Romans hurled;</l>
<l n="523">Nor by the arm unaided, for the lance</l>
<l n="524">Urged by the catapult resistless rushed</l>
<l n="525">Through arms and shield and flesh, and left a death</l>
<l n="526">Behind, nor stayed its course : and massive stones</l>

<l n="543">Crushed down innocuous; but as the blows</l>
<l n="544">Rained fierce and ceaseless and the Romans tired,</l>
<l n="545">Some here and there sank fainting. Next the roof</l>
<l n="546">Moves on with earth besprinkled: underneath</l>
<l n="547">The ram conceals his head, which, poised and swung,</l>
<l n="548">They dash with mighty force upon the wall,</l>
<l n="549">Covered themselves with mantlets. Though the head</l>
<l n="550">Light on the lower stones, yet as the shock</l>

<l n="552">The rampart soon shall topple. But by balks</l>

<l n="557">Thus far to hold their battlements was all</l>
<l n="558">The Greeks had hoped; now, venturing attack,</l>
<l n="559">With glittering torches for their arms, by night</l>
<l n="560">Fearless they sallied forth: nor lance they bear</l>
<l n="561">Nor deadly bow, nor shaft;  for fire alone</l>

<l n="565">The fury of the flames, which, fed afresh</l>

<l n="596">Liburnian galleys follow. Over all</l>
<l n="597">Towers Brutus' deck praetorian. Oars on oars</l>
<l n="598">Propel the bulky vessel through the main,</l>
<l n="599">Six ranks; the topmost strike the waves afar.</l>
<l n="600">When such a space remained between the fleets</l>
<l n="601">As could be covered by a single stroke,</l>
<l n="602">Innumerable voices rise in air</l>
<l n="603">Drowning with resonant din the beat of oars</l>
<l n="604">And note of trumpet summoning: and all</l>
<l n="605">Sit on the benches and with mighty stroke</l>
<l n="606">Sweep o'er the sea and gain the space between.</l>
<l n="607">Then crashed the prows together, and the keels</l>
<l n="608">Rebounded backwards, and unnumbered darts</l>
<l n="609">Or darkened all the sky or, in their fall,</l>
<l n="610">The vacant ocean. As the wings grew wide,</l>
<l n="611">Less densely packed the fleet, some Grecian ships</l>
<l n="612">Pressed in between; as when with west and east</l>
<l n="613">The tide contends, this way the waves are driven</l>
<l n="614">And that the sea; so as they plough the deep</l>
<l n="615">In various lines converging, what the prow</l>
<l n="616">Throws up advancing, from the foemen's oars</l>
<l n="617">Falls back repelled. But soon the Grecian fleet</l>
<l n="618">Was handier found in battle, and in flight</l>
<l n="619">Pretended, and in shorter curves could round;</l>
<l n="620">More deftly governed by the guiding helm :</l>
<l n="621">While on the Roman side their steadier keels</l>
<l n="622">Gave vantage, as to men who fight on land.</l>
<l n="623">Then Brutus to the pilot of his ship:</l>
<l n="624">' Dost suffer them to range the wider deep,</l>
<l n="625">'Contending with the foe in naval skill?</l>
<l n="626">' Draw close the war and drive us on the prows</l>
<l n="627">'Of these Phocaeans.' Him the pilot heard;</l>
<l n="628">And turned his vessel slantwise to the foe.</l>
<l n="629">Then was the sea all covered with the war:</l>
<l n="630">Then Grecian ships attacking Brutus found</l>
<l n="631">Their ruin in the stroke, and vanquished lay</l>
<l n="632">Beside his bulwarks; with curved hooks and chains</l>
<l n="633">The foe they grapple, by entangled oars</l>
<l n="634">Themselves held back. And now no outstretched arm</l>
<l n="635">Hurls forth the javelin, but sword in hand</l>
<l n="636">They wage a naval fight: each from his ship</l>
<l n="637">Leans forward to the stroke, and falls when slain</l>
<l n="638">Upon a foeman's deck. Deep flows the stream</l>
<l n="639">Of purple slaughter to the foamy main :</l>
<l n="640">By piles of floating corpses are the sides,</l>
<l n="641">Though grappled, kept asunder. Some, half dead,</l>
<l n="642">Plunge in the ocean, gulping down the brine</l>
<l n="643">Encrimsoned with their blood; some lingering still</l>
<l n="644">Draw their last struggling breath amid the wreck</l>
<l n="645">Of broken navies: weapons which have missed</l>
<l n="646">Find yet their victims, and the falling steel</l>
<l n="647">Fails not in middle deep to deal the wound.</l>
<l n="648">One vessel circled by Phocaean keels</l>
<l n="649">Divides her strength, and on the right and left</l>
<l n="650">On either side with equal war contends;</l>
<l n="651">On whose high poop while <placeName key="tgn,7016546">Tagus</placeName> fighting gripped</l>
<l n="652">The stern Phocaean, pierced his back and breast</l>
<l n="653">Two fatal weapons; in the midst the steel</l>
<l n="654">Met, and the blood, uncertain whence to flow,</l>
<l n="655">Stood still, arrested, till with double course</l>
<l n="656">Forth by a sudden gush it drove each dart,</l>
<l n="657">And sent the life abroad through either wound.</l>
<l n="658">Here fated Telon also steered his ship:</l>
<l n="659">No pilot's hand upon an angry sea</l>
<l n="660">More deftly ruled a vessel. Well he knew,</l>
<l n="661">Or by the sun or crescent moon, how best</l>
<l n="662">To set his canvas fitted for the breeze</l>
<l n="663">The coming hours would bring. His rushing stem</l>
<l n="664">Shattered a Roman vessel: but a dart</l>
<l n="665">Hurled at the moment quivered in his breast.</l>
<l n="666">He falls, and in the fall his dying hand</l>
<l n="667">Diverts the prow. Then Gyareus, in act</l>
<l n="668">To climb the friendly deck, by javelin pierced,</l>
<l n="669">Still as he hung, by the retaining steel</l>
<l part="I" n="tr">Fast to the side was nailed.</l>
<l part="F" n="tr">Twin brethren stand</l>
<l n="670">A fruitful mother's pride; with different fates,</l>
<l n="671">But ne'er distinguished till death's savage hand</l>
<l n="672">Struck once, and ended error: he that lived,</l>
<l n="673">Cause of fresh anguish to their sorrowing souls,</l>
<l n="674">Called ever to the weeping parents back</l>
<l n="675">The image of the lost: who, as the oars</l>
<l n="676">Grecian and Roman mixed their teeth oblique,</l>
<l n="677">Grasped with his dexter hand the Roman ship;</l>
<l n="678">When fell a blow that shore his arm away.</l>
<l n="679">So died, upon the side it held, the hand,</l>
<l n="680">Nor loosed its grasp in death. Yet with the wound</l>
<l n="681">His noble courage rose, and maimed he dared</l>
<l n="682">Renew the fray, and stretched across the sea</l>
<l n="683">To grasp the lost-in vain! another blow</l>
<l n="684">Lopped arm and hand alike. Nor shield nor sword</l>
<l n="685">Henceforth are his. Yet even now he seeks</l>
<l n="686">No sheltering hold, but with his chest advanced</l>
<l n="687">Before his brother armed, he claims the fight,</l>
<l n="688">And holding in his breast the darts which else</l>
<l n="689">Had slain his comrades, pierced with countless spears,</l>
<l n="690">He falls in death well earned; yet ere his end</l>
<l n="691">Collects his parting life, and all his strength</l>
<l n="692">Strains to the utmost and with failing limbs</l>
<l n="693">Leaps on the foeman's deck; by weight alone</l>
<l n="694">Injurious; for streaming down with gore</l>
<l n="695">And piled on high with corpses, while her sides</l>
<l n="696">Sounded to ceaseless blows, the fated ship</l>
<l n="697">Let in the greedy brine until her ways</l>
<l n="698">Were level with the waters-then she plunged</l>
<l n="699">In whirling eddies downwards-and the main</l>
<l n="700">First parted, then closed in upon its prey.</l>
<l n="701">Full many wondrous deaths, with fates diverse,</l>
<l n="702">Upon the sea in that day's fight befell.
<milestone n="635" unit="card"/></l>
<l n="703">Caught by a grappling-hook that missed the side,</l>
<l n="704">Had Lycidas been whelmed in middle deep;</l>
<l n="705">But by his feet his comrades dragged him back,</l>
<l n="706">And rent in twain he hung; nor slowly flowed</l>
<l n="707">As from a wound the blood; but all his veins <note anchored="true">According to some these were the lines which Lucan recited while bleeding to death; according to others, those at Book ix., line 948.</note></l>
<l n="708">Were torn asunder and the stream of life</l>
<l n="709">Gushed o'er his limbs till lost amid the waves.</l>
<l n="710">From no man dying has the vital breath</l>
<l n="711">Rushed by so wide a path; the lower trunk</l>
<l n="712">Succumbed to death, but with the lungs and heart</l>
<l n="713">Long strove the fates, and hardly won the whole.</l>
<l n="714">While, bent upon the fight, an eager crew</l>
<l n="715">Were gathered to the margin of their deck</l>
<l n="716">(Leaving the upper side as bare of foes),</l>
<l n="717">Their ship was overset. Beneath the keel</l>
<l n="718">Which floated upwards, prisoned in the sea,</l>
<l n="719">And powerless by spread of arms to float</l>
<l n="720">The main, they perished. One who haply swam</l>
<l n="721">Amid the battle, chanced upon a death</l>
<l n="722">Strange and unheard of; for two meeting prows</l>
<l n="723">Transfixed his body. At the double stroke</l>
<l n="724">Wide yawns his chest; blood issues from his mouth</l>
<l n="725">With flesh commingled; and the brazen beaks</l>
<l n="726">Resounding clash together, by the bones</l>
<l n="727">Unhindered: now they part and through the gap</l>
<l n="728">Swift pours the sea and drags the corse below.</l>
<l n="729">Next, of a shipwrecked crew, the larger part</l>
<l n="730">Struggling with death upon the waters, reached</l>
<l n="731">A comrade bark; but when with elbows raised</l>
<l n="732">They seized upon the bulwarks and the ship</l>
<l n="733">Rolled, nor could bear their weight, the ruthless crew</l>
<l n="734">Hacked off their straining arms; then maimed they sank</l>
<l n="735">Below the seething waves, to rise no more.</l>
<l n="736">Now every dart was hurled and every spear,</l>
<l n="737">The soldier weaponless; yet their rage found arms:</l>
<l n="738">One hurls an oar; another's brawny arm</l>
<l n="739">Tugs at the twisted stern; or from the seats</l>
<l n="740">The oarsmen driving, swings a bench in air.</l>
<l n="741">The ships are broken for the fight. They seize</l>
<l n="742">The fallen dead and snatch the sword that slew.</l>
<l n="743">Nay, many from their wounds, frenzied for arms,</l>
<l n="744">Pluck forth the deadly steel, and pressing still</l>
<l n="745">Upon their yawning sides, hurl forth the spear</l>
<l n="746">Back to the hostile ranks from which it came;</l>
<l part="I" n="tr">Then ebbs their life blood forth.</l>
<l part="F" n="tr">But deadlier yet</l>
<l n="747">Was that fell force most hostile to the sea;</l>
<l n="748">For, thrown in torches and in sulphurous bolts</l>
<l n="749">Fire all-consuming ran among the ships,</l>
<l n="750">Whose oily timbers soaked in pitch and wax</l>
<l n="751">Inflammable, gave welcome to the flames.</l>
<l n="752">Nor could the waves prevail against the blaze</l>
<l n="753">Which claimed as for its own the fragments borne</l>
<l n="754">Upon the waters. Lo! on burning plank</l>
<l n="755">One hardly 'scapes destruction; one to save</l>
<l n="756">His flaming ship, gives entrance to the main.</l>
<l n="757">Of all the forms of death each fears the one</l>
<l n="758">That brings immediate dying: yet quail not</l>
<l n="759">Their hearts in shipwreck : from the waves they pluck</l>
<l n="760">The fallen darts and furnishing the ships</l>
<l n="761">Essay the feeble stroke; and should that hope</l>
<l n="762">Still fail their hand, they call the sea to aid</l>
<l n="763">And seizing in their grasp some floating foe</l>
<l n="764">Drag him to mutual death.   But on that day</l>
<l n="765">Phoceus above all others proved his skill.</l>
<l n="766">Well trained was he to dive beneath the main</l>
<l n="767">And search the waters with unfailing eye;</l>
<l n="768">And should an anchor 'gainst the straining rope</l>
<l n="769">Too firmly bite the sands, to wrench it free.</l>
<l n="770">Oft in his fatal grasp he seized a foe</l>
<l n="771">Nor loosed his grip until the life was gone.</l>
<l n="772">Such was his frequent deed; but this his fate:</l>
<l n="773">For rising, victor (as he thought), to air,</l>
<l n="774">Full on a keel he struck and found his death.</l>
<l n="775">Some, drowning, seized a hostile oar and checked</l>
<l n="776">The flying vessel; not to die in vain,</l>
<l n="777">Their single care; some on their vessel's side</l>
<l n="778">Hanging, in death, with wounded frame essayed</l>
<l n="779">To check the charging prow.   Tyrrhenus high</l>
<l n="780">Upon the bulwarks of his ship was struck</l>
<l n="781">By leaden bolt from Balearic sling</l>
<l n="782">Of Lygdamus; straight through his temples passed</l>
<l n="783">The fated missile; and in streams of blood</l>
<l n="784">Forced from their seats his trembling eyeballs fell.</l>
<l n="785">Plunged in a darkness as of night, he thought</l>
<l n="786">That life had left him; yet ere long he knew</l>
<l n="787">The living vigour of his limbs; and cried,</l>
<l n="788">'Place me, O friends, as some machine of war</l>
<l n="789">Straight facing towards the foe; then shall my darts</l>
<l n="790">Strike as of old; and thou, Tyrrhenus, spend</l>
<l n="791">Thy latest breath, still left, upon the fight:</l>
<l n="792">So shalt thou play, not wholly dead, the part</l>
<l n="793">That fits a soldier, and the spear that strikes</l>
<l n="794">Thy frame, shall miss the living.' Thus he spake,</l>
<l n="795">And hurled his javelin, blind, but not in vain;</l>
<l n="796">For Argus, generous youth of noble blood,</l>
<l n="797">Below the middle waist received the spear</l>
<l n="798">And falling drave it home. His aged sire</l>
<l n="799">From furthest portion of the conquered ship</l>
<l n="800">Beheld; than whom in pride of manhood none</l>
<l n="801">More brave in battle: now no more he fought,</l>
<l n="802">Yet did the memory of his prowess stir</l>
<l n="803">Phocaean youths to emulate his fame.</l>
<l n="804">Oft stumbling o'er the benches the old man hastes</l>
<l n="805">To reach his boy, and finds him breathing still.</l>
<l n="806">No tear bedewed his cheek; upon his breast</l>
<l n="807">No blow he struck;  but all his frame was stiff,</l>
<l n="808">His hands outspread : and o'er his eyes there fell</l>
<l n="809">A dark impenetrable veil of mist</l>
<l n="810">That blotted out the day; nor could he more</l>
<l n="811">Discern his luckless Argus. He, who saw</l>
<l n="812">His parent, raising up his drooping head</l>
<l n="813">With parted lips and silent features asks</l>
<l n="814">A father's latest kiss, a father's hand</l>
<l n="815">To close his dying eyes. But soon his sire,</l>
<l n="816">Recovering from his swoon, when ruthless grief</l>
<l n="817">Possessed his spirit, 'This short space,' he cried,</l>
<l n="818">' I lose not, which the cruel gods have given,</l>
<l n="819">' But die before thee. Grant thy sorrowing sire</l>
<l n="820">' Forgiveness that he fled thy last embrace.</l>
<l n="821">Not yet has passed thy life blood from the wound</l>
<l n="822">Nor yet is death upon thee-still thou may'st<note anchored="true">It was regarded as the greatest of misfortunes if a child died before his parent.</note></l>
<l n="823">Outlive thy parent.' Thus he spake, and seized</l>
<l n="824">The reeking sword and drave it to the hilt,</l>
<l n="825">Then plunged into the deep, with headlong bound,</l>
<l n="826">To anticipate his son: for this he feared</l>
<l n="827">A single form of death should not suffice.</l>
<l n="828">Now gave the fates their judgment, and in doubt</l>
<l n="829">No longer was the war: the Grecian fleet</l>
<l n="830">In most part sunk; -some ships by Romans oared</l>
<l n="831">Conveyed the victors home: in headlong flight</l>
<l n="832">Some sought the yards for shelter.  On the strand</l>
<l n="833">What tears of parents for their offspring slain,</l>
<l n="834">How wept the mothers! 'Mid the pile confused</l>
<l n="835">Ofttimes the wife sought madly for her spouse</l>
<l n="836">And chose for her last kiss some Roman slain;</l>
<l n="837">While wretched fathers by the blazing pyres</l>
<l n="838">Fought for the dead. But Brutus thus at sea</l>
<l n="839">First gained a triumph for great Caesar's arms.<note anchored="true">It was Brutus who gained the naval victory over the Veneti some seven years before; the first naval fight, that we know of, fought in the <placeName key="tgn,7014206">Atlantic Ocean</placeName>.</note>

<l n="2">Fierce Caesar warring, though in fight he dealt</l>

<l n="19">Was Magnus' camp; but Caesar's on a hill,</l>
<l n="20">Rivalling the first; and in the midst a stream.</l>
<l n="21">Here boundless plains are spread beyond the range</l>

<l n="27">Guiltless of war, the first day saw the hosts</l>
<l n="28">In long array confronted; standard rose</l>
<l n="29">Opposing standard, numberless; yet none</l>
<l n="30">Attacked, through shame of strife; one bloodless day</l>
<l n="31">They gave their country and her broken laws.</l>
<l n="32">But Caesar, when from heaven fell the night,</l>
<l n="33">Drew round a hasty trench; his foremost rank</l>
<l n="34">With close array concealing those who wrought.</l>
<l n="35">Then with the morn he bids them seize the hill</l>
<l n="36">Which parted from the camp <placeName key="tgn,7007789">Ilerda</placeName>'s walls,</l>
<l n="37">And gave them safety. But in fear and shame</l>
<l n="38">On rushed the foe and seized the vantage ground,</l>
<l n="39">First in the onset. From the height they held</l>
<l n="40">Their hopes of conquest; but to Caesar's men</l>
<l n="41">Their hearts by courage stirred, and their good swords</l>
<l n="42">Promised the victory. Burdened up the ridge</l>
<l n="43">The soldier climbed, and from the opposing steep</l>
<l n="44">But for his comrade's shield had fallen back;</l>
<l n="45">None had the space to hurl the quivering lance</l>
<l n="46">Upon the foeman: spear and pike made sure</l>
<l n="47">The failing foothold, and the falchion's edge</l>
<l n="48">Hewed out their upward path. But Caesar saw</l>
<l n="49">Ruin impending, and he bade his horse</l>
<l n="50">By circuit to the left, with shielded flank,</l>
<l n="51">Hold back the foe. Thus gained his troops retreat,</l>
<l n="52">For none pressed on them; and the victor chiefs,</l>
<l n="53">Forced to withdrawal, gained the day in vain.</l>
<l n="54">Henceforth the fitful changes of the year</l>

<l n="56">For stubborn frost still lay upon the land,</l>
<l n="57">And northern winds, controlling all the sky,</l>
<l n="58">Prisoned the rain in clouds; the hills were nipped</l>

<l n="139">Coped with the flood and scattered all the clouds</l>
<l n="140">In fleecy masses; and the reddening east</l>
<l n="141">Proclaimed the coming day; the land resumed</l>

<l n="148">Of hoary willow bark they build, which bent</l>

<l n="156">The fallen forest, and to form the arch</l>
<l n="157">By which imperious Sicoris shall be spanned.</l>
<l n="158">Yet fearing he might rise in wrath anew,</l>
<l n="159">Not on the nearest marge they place the beams,</l>
<l n="160">But in mid-field.  Thus the presumptuous stream</l>
<l n="161">They tame with chastisement, parting his flood</l>
<l n="162">In devious channels out; and curb his pride.</l>
<l n="163">Petreius, seeing that all things gave way</l>
<l n="164">To Caesar's destiny, leaves <placeName key="tgn,7007789">Ilerda</placeName>'s steep,</l>

<l n="167">Who, loving death, rush in upon the foe,<note anchored="true">Compare Book I., 520.</note></l>
<l n="168">And win their conquests at the point of sword.</l>
<l n="169">But in the dawn, when Caesar saw the camp</l>
<l n="170">Stand empty on the hill, ' To arms! ' he cries:</l>
<l n="171">' No bridge nor ford; but stem with brawny arms</l>
<l n="172">' The foaming river.' Rushing to the fray</l>
<l n="173">They dare the torrent they had feared in flight.</l>
<l n="174">Their arms regained, they race until the blood</l>
<l n="175">Throbs in their veins anew, and their wet limbs</l>
<l n="176">Are warm again. At length the shadows fall</l>
<l n="177">Short on the sward, and day is at the height.</l>
<l n="178">Then dash the horsemen on, and hold the foe</l>
<l n="179">'Twixt flight and battle. In the plain arose</l>
<l n="180">Two rocky heights: from each a loftier ridge</l>
<l n="181">Of hills ranged onwards, sheltering in their midst</l>
<l n="182">A hollow vale, whose deep and winding paths</l>
<l n="183">Were safe from warfare; which, when Caesar saw</l>
<l n="184">That if Petreius held, the war must pass</l>
<l n="185">To lands remote by savage tribes possessed;</l>
<l n="186">'Speed on,' he cries, ' and meet their flight in front;</l>
<l n="187">'Fierce be your frown and battle in your glance:</l>
<l n="188">' No coward's death be theirs; but as they flee</l>
<l n="189">'Plunge in their breasts the sword.' They seize the pass</l>
<l n="190">And place their camp. Short was the span between</l>
<l n="191">Th' opposing sentinels; with eager eyes</l>
<l n="192">Undimmed by space, they gazed on brothers, sons,</l>
<l n="193">Or friends and fathers; and within their souls</l>
<l n="194">They grasped the impious horror of the war.<note anchored="true">Compare the passage in Tacitus, 'Hist.,' ii., 45, in which the historian
describes how the troops of Otho and Vitellius wept over each other after
the battle and deplored the miseries of a civil war. <quote xml:lang="lat">'Victi victoresque in

<l n="195">Yet for a little while no voice was heard,</l>
<l n="196">For fear restrained; by waving blade alone</l>
<l n="197">Or gesture, spake they; but their passion grew,</l>
<l n="198">And broke all discipline; and soon they leap</l>
<l n="199">The hostile rampart; every hand outstretched</l>
<l n="200">Embraces hand of foeman, palm in palm;</l>
<l n="201">One calls by name his neighbour, one his host,</l>
<l n="202">Another with his schoolmate talks again</l>

<l n="204">Found not a comrade, was no son of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</l>
<l n="205">Wet are their arms with tears, and sobs break in</l>
<l n="206">Upon their kisses; each, unstained by blood,</l>
<l n="207">Dreads what he might have done. Why beat thy breast?</l>
<l n="208">Why, madman, weep?  The guilt is thine alone</l>

<l n="210">Who takes his title to be feared from thee?</l>
<l n="211">When Caesar's trumpets sound the call to arms</l>
<l n="212">Heed not the summons; when thou seest advance</l>
<l n="213">His standards, halt. The civil Fury thus</l>
<l n="214">Shall fold her wings; and in a private robe</l>
<l part="I" n="tr">Caesar shall love his kinsman.</l>
<l part="F" n="tr">Holy Love</l>
<l n="215">Who sway'st the universe, whose firm embrace</l>

<l n="217">Come, gentle Concord! these our times <note anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Saecula nostra</foreign> may refer either to Lucan's own time or to the moment arrived at in the poem; or it may, as Francken suggests, have a more general meaning.</note>  do now</l>

<l n="219">The coming centuries!  Ah, cruel fate!</l>
<l n="220">Now have the people lost their cloak for crime:</l>
<l n="221">Their hope of pardon. They have known their kin.</l>
<l n="222">Woe for the respite given by the gods</l>
<l n="223">Making more black the hideous guilt to come!</l>
<l n="224">Now all was peaceful, and in either camp</l>
<l n="225">Sweet converse held the soldiers; on the grass</l>
<l n="226">They place the meal, and pour the mingled cup;</l>
<l n="227">Bright glows the turf upon the friendly fire;</l>
<l n="228">On mutual couch with stories of their fights,</l>

<l n="233">Faith is renewed and trust. Thus envious fate</l>
<l n="234">Made worse their doom, and all the crimes to be</l>
<l n="235">Grew with their love.   For when Petreius knew</l>
<l n="236">The treaties made, himself and all his camp</l>
<l n="237">Sold to the foe, he stirred his guard to work</l>
<l n="238">An impious slaughter: the defenceless foe</l>
<l n="239">Flung headlong forth: and parted fond embrace</l>
<l n="240">By stroke of weapon and in streams of blood.</l>
<l n="241">And thus in words of wrath, to stir the war:</l>
<l n="242">'Of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> forgetful, to your faith forsworn!</l>
<l n="243">'And could ye not with victory gained return,</l>

<l n="248">'Will you like cravens to your master bear</l>

Mr. Haskins says, 'shall you have to beg for them?' But it means that to do so is the height of disgrace.</note></l>
<l n="252">'Nay! never shall our safety be the price</l>
<l n="253">'Of base betrayal! Not for boon of life</l>
<l n="254">'We wage a civil war. This name of peace</l>
<l n="255">'Drags us to slavery. Ne'er from depths of earth,</l>
<l n="256">'Fain to withdraw her wealth, should toiling men</l>
<l n="257">'Draw store of iron; ne'er entrench a town;</l>
<l n="258">'Ne'er should the war-horse dash into the fray</l>

<l n="267">Monarchs of distant realms, while haply here</l>
<l n="268">We in our treaties bargain for thy-life!  '</l>
<l n="269">Thus did he stir their minds and rouse anew</l>
<l n="270">The love of impious battle. So when beasts</l>
<l n="271">Grown strange to forests, long confined in dens,</l>
<l n="272">Their fierceness lose, and learn to bear with man;</l>
<l n="273">Once should they taste of blood, their thirsty jaws</l>
<l n="274">Swell at the touch, and all the ancient rage</l>
<l n="275">Comes back upon them till they hardly spare</l>
<l n="276">Their keeper. Thus they rush on every crime:</l>
<l n="277">And blows which dealt in blindness of affray</l>
<l n="278">Might seem the crimes of chance, or of the gods</l>
<l n="279">Wreaking their hate, such recent vows of love</l>
<l n="280">Made monstrous, horrid. Where they lately spread</l>
<l n="281">The mutual couch and banquet, and embraced</l>
<l n="282">Some new-found friend, now falls the fatal blow</l>
<l n="283">Upon the self-same breast; and though at first</l>
<l n="284">Groaning at the fell chance, they drew the sword;</l>
<l n="285">Hate rises as they strike, the murderous arm</l>
<l n="286">Confirms the doubtful will: in dreadful joy</l>
<l n="287">Through the wild camp they smote their kinsmen down;</l>
<l n="288">And carnage raged unchecked; and each man strove,</l>
<l n="289">Proud of his crime, before his leader's face</l>
<l part="I" n="tr">To prove his shamelessness of guilt.

<l n="291">The gods do favour thee. Thessalian fields</l>
<l n="292">Gave thee no better fortune, nor the waves</l>
<l n="293">That lave <placeName key="tgn,7008781">Massilia</placeName>; nor on Pharos' main</l>

<l n="295">Thou from this moment of the better cause</l>
<l n="296">Shalt be the Captain.</l>
<l n="297">Since the troops were stained</l>
<l n="298">With foulest slaughter thus, their leaders shunned</l>
<l n="299">All camps with Caesar's joined, and sought again</l>
<l n="300"><placeName key="tgn,7007789">Ilerda</placeName>'s lofty walls; but Caesar's horse</l>
<l n="301">Seized on the plain and forced them to the hills</l>

<l n="303">He cuts them from the river, nor permits</l>
<l n="304">Their circling ramparts to enclose a spring.</l>
<l n="305">By this dread path Death trapped his captive prey.</l>
<l n="306">Which when they knew, fierce anger filled their souls,</l>
<l n="307">And took the place of fear. They slew the steeds</l>
<l n="308">Now useless grown, and rushed upon their fate;</l>
<l n="309">Hopeless of life and flight. But Caesar cried:</l>
<l n="310">Hold back your weapons, soldiers, from the foe,</l>
<l n="311">Strike not the breast advancing; let the war</l>
<l n="312">' Cost me no blood; he falls not without price</l>
<l n="313">' Who with his life-blood challenges the fray.</l>
<l n="314">Scorning their own base lives and hating light,</l>
<l n="315">To Caesar's loss they rush upon their death,</l>
<l n="316">Nor heed our blows. But let this frenzy pass,</l>
<l n="317">This madman onset; let the wish for death</l>
<l n="318">Die in their souls.' Thus to its embers shrank</l>
<l n="319">The fire within, when battle was denied,</l>
<l n="320">And fainter grew their rage until the night</l>
<l n="321">Drew down her starry veil and sank the sun.</l>
<l n="322">Thus keener fights the gladiator whose wound</l>
<l n="323">Is recent, while the blood within the veins</l>
<l n="324">Still gives the sinews motion, ere the skin</l>
<l n="325">Shrinks on the bones: but as the victor stands</l>
<l n="326">His fatal thrust achieved, and points the blade</l>
<l n="327">Unfaltering, watching for the end, there creeps</l>
<l n="328">Torpor upon the limbs, the blood congeals</l>
<l n="329">About the gash, more faintly throbs the heart,</l>
<l n="330">And slowly fading, ebbs the life away.</l>
<l n="331">Raving for water now they dig the plain</l>
<l n="332">Seeking for hidden fountains, not with spade</l>
<l n="333">And mattock only searching out the depths,</l>
<l n="334">But with the sword; they hack the stony heights,</l>
<l n="335">In shafts that reach the level of the plain.</l>
<l n="336">No further flees from light the pallid wretch</l>
<l n="337">Who tears the bowels of the earth for gold.</l>
<l n="338">Yet neither riven stones revealed a spring,</l>
<l n="339">Nor streamlet whispered from its hidden source;</l>
<l n="340">No water trickled on the gravel bed,</l>
<l n="341">Nor dripped within the cavern. Worn at length</l>
<l n="342">With labour huge, they crawl to light again,</l>
<l n="343">After such toil to fall to thirst and heat</l>
<l n="344">The readier victims: this was all they won.</l>
<l n="345">All food they loathe; and 'gainst their deadly thirst</l>
<l n="346">Call famine to their aid. Damp clods of earth</l>
<l n="347">They squeeze upon their mouths with straining hands.</l>
<l n="348">Wherever on foulest mud some stagnant slime</l>
<l n="349">Or moisture lies, each dying soldier strives</l>
<l n="350">With dying comrade first to lap the draught,</l>
<l n="351">Loathsome had life been his. Like beasts they drain</l>
<l n="352">The swollen udder, and where milk was not,</l>
<l n="353">They suck the life-blood forth. From herbs and boughs</l>
<l n="354">Dripping with dew, from tender shoots they press,</l>
<l n="355">Nay, from the pith of trees, the juice within.</l>
<l n="356">Happy the host that onward marching finds</l>
<l n="357">Its savage enemy has fouled the wells</l>
<l n="358">With murderous venom; hadst thou, Caesar, cast</l>
<l n="359">The reeking filth of shambles in the stream,</l>
<l n="360">And henbane dire and all the poisonous herbs</l>
<l n="361">That lurk on Cretan slopes, still had they drunk</l>
<l n="362">The fatal waters, rather than endure</l>
<l n="363">Such lingering agony. Their bowels racked</l>
<l n="364">With torments as of flame; the swollen tongue</l>
<l n="365">And jaws now parched and rigid, and the veins;</l>
<l n="366">Each laboured breath with anguish from the lungs</l>
<l n="367">Enfeebled, moistureless, is scarcely drawn,</l>
<l n="368">And scarce again returned; and yet agape,</l>
<l n="369">Their panting mouths suck in the nightly dew;</l>
<l n="370">They watch for showers from heaven, and in despair</l>
<l n="371">Gaze on the clouds, whence lately poured a flood.</l>
<l n="372">Nor were their tortures less that <placeName key="tgn,7000856">Meroe</placeName></l>

<l n="464">But for his steeds the earth no forage gave,</l>

<l n="466">Gnawed the dry herbage of the scanty turf</l>
<l n="467">Within their rampart lines. But when they knew</l>
<l n="468">That Basilus was on th' opposing shore</l>
<l n="469">With friendly force, by novel mode of flight</l>
<l n="470">They aim to reach him. Not the accustomed keel</l>
<l n="471">They lay, nor build the ship, but shapeless rafts</l>
<l n="472">Of timbers knit together, strong to bear</l>
<l n="473">All ponderous weight; on empty casks beneath</l>
<l n="474">By tightened chains made firm, in double rows</l>
<l n="475">Supported; nor upon the deck were placed</l>
<l n="476">The oarsmen, to the hostile dart exposed,</l>
<l n="477">But in a hidden space, by beams concealed.</l>
<l n="478">And thus the eye amazed beheld the mass</l>
<l n="479">Move silent on its path across the sea,</l>
<l n="480">By neither sail nor stalwart arm propelled.</l>
<l n="481">They watch the main until the refluent waves</l>
<l n="482">Ebb from the growing sands; then, on the tide</l>
<l n="483">Receding, launch their vessel; thus she floats</l>
<l n="484">With comrades twin: and rises over each</l>
<l n="485">With quivering battlements a lofty tower.</l>
<l n="486">Octavius, guardian of Illyrian seas,</l>
<l n="487">Restrained his swifter keels, and left the rafts</l>
<l n="488">Free from attack, in hope of larger spoil</l>
<l n="489">From fresh adventures; for the peaceful sea</l>
<l n="490">Might tempt them, and their goal in safety reached,</l>
<l n="491">To dare a second voyage. Round the stag</l>
<l n="492">Thus will the cunning hunter draw a line</l>

<l n="497">Trusted to any dog but such as tracks</l>
<l n="498">The scent with lowered nostrils, and refrains</l>
<l n="499">From giving tongue the while; content to mark</l>
<l n="500">By shaking cord the covert of the prey.</l>
<l n="501">Ere long they manned the rafts in eager wish</l>
<l n="502">To quit the island, when the latest glow</l>
<l n="503">Still parted day from night. But Magnus' troops,</l>
<l n="504">Cilician once, taught by their ancient art,</l>
<l n="505">In fraudulent deceit had left the sea</l>
<l n="506">To view unguarded; but with chains unseen</l>
<l n="507">Fast to Illyrian shores, and hanging loose,</l>
<l n="508">They blocked the outlet in the waves beneath.</l>
<l n="509">The leading rafts passed safely, but the third,</l>
<l n="510">Caught by the rope, was drawn beneath the rocks.</l>
<l n="511">These, hollowed by the sea, in ponderous mass</l>
<l n="512">O'erhanging, seemed upon the point to fall;</l>
<l n="513">And trees made dark the wave. Here oft the main</l>
<l n="514">Within the deep recess sweeps broken wrecks</l>
<l n="515">And bodies of the drowned, till ebbing tides</l>
<l n="516">Return the spoil. Then from the cavernous arch</l>
<l n="517">Is belched the ocean forth in such turmoil</l>
<l n="518">Of swirling billows, as excels the rage</l>
<l n="519">Of that famed whirlpool on Sicilian shores.</l>
<l n="520">Here, with Venetian settlers for its load,</l>
<l n="521">Stood motionless the raft. Octavius' ships</l>
<l n="522">Gathered around, while foemen on the land</l>
<l n="523">Filled all the shore. But well the captain knew,</l>
<l n="524">Volteius, how the secret fraud was planned,</l>
<l n="525">And tried in vain with sword and steel to burst</l>
<l n="526">The chains that held them; without hope he fights,</l>
<l n="527">Uncertain where to avoid or front the foe.</l>
<l n="528">Caught in the strait they strove as brave men should</l>
<l n="529">Against opposing hosts; nor long the fight,</l>
<l n="530">For fallen darkness brought a truce to arms.</l>
<l n="531">Then to his men disheartened and in fear</l>
<l n="532">Of coming fate Volteius, great of soul,</l>
<l n="533">Thus spake in tones commanding: ' Free no more,</l>

<l n="537">' Who can take thought for death, nor is your fame</l>

<l n="539">'Ye meet your destined doom. None know how long</l>

<l n="541">'And equal is your praise, whether the hand</l>

<l n="543">' Or shear the hope of years. But choice to die</l>
<l n="544">'Is thrust not on the mind-we cannot flee;</l>
<l n="545">'See at our throats, e'en now, our kinsmen's swords.</l>
<l n="546">' Then choose for death; desire what fate decrees.</l>
<l n="547">'At least in war's blind cloud we shall not fall;</l>
<l n="548">' Nor when the flying weapons hide the day,</l>
<l n="549">'And slaughtered heaps of foemen load the field,</l>
<l n="550">'And death is common, and the brave man sinks</l>
<l n="551">'Unknown, inglorious. Us within this ship,</l>
<l n="552">'Seen of both friends and foes, the gods have placed;</l>
<l n="553">'Both land and sea and island cliffs shall bear,</l>

<l n="555">'In which some great and memorable fame</l>
<l n="556">'Thou, Fortune, dost prepare. What glorious deeds</l>
<l n="557">' Of warlike heroism, of noble faith,</l>
<l n="558">'Time's annals show! All these shall we surpass.</l>
<l n="559">'True, Caesar, that to fall upon our swords</l>
<l n="560">'For thee is little; yet beleaguered thus,</l>
<l n="561">'With neither sons nor parents at our sides,</l>
<l n="562">'Shorn of the glory that we might have earned,</l>
<l n="563">'We give thee here the only pledge we may.</l>
<l n="564">'Yet let these hostile thousands fear the souls</l>
<l n="565">'That rage for battle and that welcome death,</l>
<l n="566">'And know us for invincible, and joy</l>
<l n="567">'That no more rafts were stayed. They'll offer terms,</l>
<l n="568">'And tempt us with a base unhonoured life.</l>
<l n="569">'Would that, to give that death which shall be ours</l>
<l n="570">'The greater glory, they may bid us hope</l>
<l n="571">'For pardon and for life! lest when our swords</l>
<l n="572">'Are reeking with our hearts'-blood, they may say</l>
<l n="573">'This was despair of living. Great must be</l>
<l n="574">'The prowess of our end, if in the hosts</l>
<l n="575">'That fight his battles, Caesar is to mourn</l>
<l n="576">'This little handful lost. For me, should fate</l>
<l n="577">'Grant us retreat-myself would scorn to shun</l>
<l n="578">'The coming onset. Life I cast away,</l>
<l n="579">'The frenzy of the death that comes apace</l>

<l n="592">Swarmed with the galleys and their Grecian fleet</l>

<l n="594">And terms proposed: life to the foe they thought</l>
<l n="595">Would seem the sweeter, by delay of death</l>
<l n="596">Thus granted. But the band devoted stood,</l>
<l n="597">Proud of their promised end, life all forsworn,</l>
<l n="598">And careless of the fight: no jarring note</l>
<l n="599">Opposed their high resolve. In numbers few</l>
<l n="600">'Gainst foemen numberless by land and sea,</l>
<l n="601">They wage the desperate war; then satiate</l>
<l n="602">Turn from the foe. And first demanding death</l>
<l n="603">Volteius bared his throat. ' What youth,' he cries,</l>
<l n="604">' Dares strike me down, and through his captain's wounds</l>
<l n="605">'Attest his love for death?  ' Then through his side</l>

<l n="607">He praises all : but him who struck the first</l>
<l n="608">Grateful, with dying strength, he does to death.</l>
<l n="609">They rush together, and without a foe</l>
<l n="610">Work all the guilt of battle. Thus of yore,</l>
<l n="611">Rose up the glittering Dircaean band</l>
<l n="612">From seed by Cadmus sown, and fought and died,</l>

<l n="614">And so in <placeName key="tgn,7012263">Phasis</placeName>' fields the sons of earth,</l>
<l n="615">Born of the sleepless dragon, all inflamed</l>
<l n="616">By magic incantations, with their blood</l>
<l n="617">Deluged the monstrous furrow, while the Queen</l>
<l n="618">Feared at the spells she wrought. Devoted thus</l>
<l n="619">To death, they fall, yet in their death itself</l>
<l n="620">Less valour show than in the fatal wounds</l>
<l n="621">They take and give; for e'en the dying hand</l>
<l n="622">Missed not a blow  nor did the stroke alone</l>
<l n="623">Inflict the wound, but rushing on the sword</l>
<l n="624">Their throat or breast received it to the hilt;</l>
<l n="625">And when by fatal chance or sire with son,</l>
<l n="626">Or brothers met, yet with unfaltering weight</l>
<l n="627">Down flashed the pitiless sword: this proved their love,</l>
<l n="628">To give no second blow. Half living now</l>
<l n="629">They dragged their mangled bodies to the side,</l>
<l n="630">Whence flowed into the sea a crimson stream</l>
<l n="631">Of slaughter. 'Twas their pleasure yet to see</l>
<l n="632">The light they scorned; with haughty looks to scan</l>
<l n="633">The faces of their victors, and to feel</l>
<l n="634">The death approaching. But the raft was now</l>
<l n="635">Piled up with dead; which, when the foemen saw,</l>
<l n="636">Wondering at such a chief and such a deed,</l>
<l n="637">They gave them burial. Never through the world</l>
<l n="638">Of any brave achievement was the fame</l>
<l n="639">More widely blazed. Yet meaner men, untaught</l>
<l n="640">By such examples, see not that the hand</l>
<l n="641">Which frees from slavery needs no valiant mind</l>
<l n="642">To guide the stroke. But tyranny is feared</l>
<l n="643">As dealing death; and Freedom's self is galled</l>
<l n="644">By ruthless arms; and knows not that the sword</l>
<l n="645">Was given for this, that none need live a slave.</l>
<l n="646">Ah Death! wouldst thou but let the coward live</l>

<l n="782">Not eagerness alone to save the state</l>
<l n="783">Stirred Juba's spirit: private hatred too</l>

<l n="815">Then victory on his arms deceptive shone</l>
<l n="816">Hiding the ills to come: for from the field</l>
<l n="817">Driving the hostile host with sword and spear,</l>

<l n="832">Behind the deadly fangs: forth from its seat</l>
<l n="833">Balked of its purpose, through the brimming jaws</l>

<l n="841">Urged on his ears: ' Beware of Punic fraud,</l>

<l n="847">Who still deceiving, simulated flight,</l>
<l n="848">Till from the height in loose unordered lines</l>
<l n="849">The Roman forces streamed upon the plain,</l>
<l n="850">In thought that Juba fled. Then first was known</l>
<l n="851">The treacherous fraud: for swift Numidian horse</l>
<l n="852">On every side surround them: leader, men-</l>
<l n="853">All see their fate in one dread moment come.</l>
<l n="854">No coward flees, no warrior bravely strides</l>
<l n="855">To meet the battle: nay, the trumpet call</l>
<l n="856">Stirs not the charger with resounding hoof</l>
<l n="857">To spurn the rock, nor galling bit compels</l>
<l n="858">To champ in eagerness; nor toss his mane</l>
<l n="859">And prick the ear, nor prancing with his feet</l>
<l n="860">To claim his share of combat. Tired, the neck</l>
<l n="861">Droops downwards: smoking sweat bedews the limbs:</l>
<l n="862">Dry from the squalid mouth protrudes the tongue,</l>
<l n="863">Hoarse, raucous panting issues from their chests;</l>
<l n="864">Their flanks distended: and on every curb</l>
<l n="865">Dry foam of blood; the ruthless sword alone</l>
<l n="866">Could move them onward, powerless even then</l>
<l n="867">To charge; but giving to the hostile dart</l>
<l n="868">A nearer victim. But when the Afric horse</l>
<l n="869">First made their onset, loud beneath their hoofs</l>
<l n="870">Rang the wide plain, and rose the dust in air</l>
<l n="871">As by some Thracian whirlwind stirred; and veiled</l>
<l n="872">The heavens in darkness. When on Curio's host</l>
<l n="873">The tempest burst, each footman in the rank</l>
<l n="874">Stood there to meet his fate-no doubtful end</l>
<l n="875">Hung in the balance: destiny proclaimed</l>
<l n="876">Death to them all. No conflict hand to hand</l>
<l n="877">Was granted them, by lances thrown from far</l>
<l n="878">And sidelong sword-thrusts slain: nor wounds alone,</l>
<l n="879">But clouds of weapons falling from the air</l>
<l n="880">By weight of iron o'erwhelmed them. Still drew in</l>
<l n="881">The straightening circle, for the first pressed back</l>
<l n="882">On those behind; did any shun the foe,</l>
<l n="883">Seeking the inner safety of the ring,</l>
<l n="884">He needs must perish by his comrades' swords.</l>
<l n="885">And as the front rank fell, still narrower grew</l>
<l n="886">The close crushed phalanx, till to raise their swords</l>
<l n="887">Space was denied. Still close and closer forced</l>
<l n="888">The armed breasts against each other driven</l>
<l n="889">Pressed out the life. Thus not upon a scene</l>
<l n="890">Such as their fortune promised, gazed the foe.</l>
<l n="891">No tide of blood was there to glut their eyes,</l>
<l n="892">No members lopped asunder, though the earth</l>
<l n="893">Was piled with corpses; for each Roman stood</l>
<l n="894">In death upright against his comrade dead.</l>
<l n="895">Let cruel <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> rouse her hated ghosts</l>

<l n="902">Now was the dust laid low by streams of blood,</l>
<l n="903">And Curio, knowing that his host was slain,</l>
<l n="904">Chose not to live; and, as a brave man should,</l>
<l n="905">He rushed upon the heap, and fighting fell.</l>
<l n="906">In vain with turbid speech hast thou profaned</l>

<l n="928">In stream transverse; and, bribed by spoils of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName></l>
<l n="929">And golden gifts of Caesar, Curio changed</l>
<l n="930">Turned with his change the scale of human things.</l>
<l n="931">True, mighty Sulla, cruel Marius,</l>
<l n="932">And bloody Cinna, and the long descent</l>
<l n="933">Of Caesar and of Caesar's house became</l>
<l n="934">Lords of our lives. But who had power like him?</l>
<l n="935">All others bought the state: he sold alone.<note anchored="true">For the character and career of Curio, see Merivale's 'History of the Roman Empire,' chapter xvi. He was of profligate character, but a friend and pupil of Cicero;  at first a rabid partisan of the oligarchy, he had, about the period of his tribuneship (B.C. <date from="-0050" to="-0049">50-49</date>), become a supporter of Caesar.  How far Gaulish gold was the cause of this conversion we cannot tell. It is in allusion to this change that he was termed the prime mover of the civil war. His arrival in Caesar's camp is described in Book I., line 306.  He became Caesar's chief lieutenant in place of the deserter Labienus;  and, as described in Book III., was sent to <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, whence he expelled the senatorial forces. His final expedition to <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, defeat, and death, form the subject of the latter part of this book. Mommsen describes him as a man of talent, and finds a resemblance between him and Caesar.  (Vol. iv., p. 393.)</note>

<l n="167">Was known, for though she would deny the gods</l>

<l n="169">A twisted fillet, while a shining wreath</l>
<l n="170">Of Phocian laurels crowns the locks that flow</l>
<l n="171">Upon her shoulders. Hesitating yet,</l>
<l n="172">The priest compelled her, and she passed within.</l>
<l n="173">But horror filled her of the holiest depths</l>

<l n="175">And resting near the doors, in breast unmoved</l>
<l n="176">She dares invent the god in words confused,</l>
<l n="177">Which proved no mind possessed with fire divine;</l>
<l n="178">By such false chant less injuring the chief</l>
<l n="179">Than faith in Phoebus and the sacred fane.</l>
<l n="180">No burst of words with tremor in their tones,</l>
<l n="181">No voice re-echoing through the spacious vault</l>
<l n="182">Proclaimed the deity, no bristling locks</l>
<l n="183">Shook off the laurel chaplet; but the grove</l>
<l n="184">Unshaken, and the summits of the shrine,</l>
<l n="185">Gave proof she shunned the god. The Roman knew</l>
<l n="186">The tripods yet were idle, and in rage,</l>
<l n="187">'Wretch,' he exclaimed, 'to us and to the gods,</l>
<l n="188">'Whose presence thou pretendest, thou shalt pay</l>

<l n="197">Untouched; nor ever with a mightier power</l>
<l n="198">Did Paean's inspiration seize the frame</l>
<l n="199">Of Delphic priestess; his pervading touch</l>
<l n="200">Expelled the mortal, and her former mind,</l>
<l n="201">And made her wholly his. In maddened trance</l>
<l n="202">She whirled throughout the cave, her locks erect</l>
<l n="203">With horror, and the fillets of the god</l>
<l n="204">Dashed to the ground; her steps unguided turned</l>
<l n="205">To this side and to that; the tripods fell</l>
<l n="206">O'erturned; within her seethed the mighty fire</l>
<l n="207">Of angry Phoebus; nor with whip alone</l>
<l n="208">He urged her onwards, but with curb restrained;</l>
<l n="209">Nor was it given her by the god to speak</l>
<l n="210">All that she knew; for into one vast mass <note anchored="true">These lines form the Latin motto prefixed to Shelley's poem, 'The Demon of the World.'</note></l>
<l n="211">All time was gathered, and her panting chest</l>

<l n="213">All things lay bare: the future yet unveiled</l>

<l n="229">Till through the spacious vault a voice at length</l>
<l n="230">Broke from the virgin conquered by the god:</l>
<l n="231">'From this great struggle thou, O Roman, free</l>

<l n="248">From the temple doors</l>
<l n="249">Rushed forth the prophetess in frenzy driven,</l>
<l n="250">Not all her knowledge uttered; and her eyes,</l>
<l n="251">Still troubled by the god who reigned within,</l>
<l n="252">Or filled with wild affright, or fired with rage</l>
<l n="253">Gaze on the wide expanse: still works her face</l>
<l n="254">Convulsive; on her cheeks a crimson blush</l>
<l n="255">With ghastly pallor blent, though not of fear.</l>
<l n="256">Her weary heart throbs ever; and as seas</l>

<l n="365">They from the sword recoil? and thou rush on</l>
<l n="366">Heedless of guilt, through right and through unright,</l>
<l n="367">Nor learn that men may lay their arms aside</l>
<l n="368">Yet bear to live?  This civil butchery</l>

<l n="370">Nor force thy will on those who will no more.</l>
<l n="371">Upon a turfy mound unmoved he stood</l>

<l n="449">Then first of all the names by which we now</l>
<l n="450">Lie to our masters, men found out the use:</l>
<l n="451">For to preserve his right to wield the sword</l>
<l n="452">He mixed the civil axes with his brands;</l>
<l n="453">With eagles, fasces; with an empty word</l>

<l n="461">Nor did they heed the portents of the sky:</l>
<l n="462">Deaf were the augurs to the thunder roll;</l>
<l n="463">The owl flew on the left; yet were the birds</l>
<l n="464">Propitious sworn.   Then was the ancient name</l>

<l n="470">Then through <placeName key="tgn,7010380">Apulia</placeName>'s fallows, which her hinds</l>
<l n="471">Left all untilled, to sluggish weeds a prey</l>
<l n="472">Passed Caesar onward, swifter than the fire</l>
<l n="473">Of heaven, or tigress dam: until he reached</l>
<l n="474"><placeName key="perseus,Brundusium">Brundusium</placeName>'s winding ramparts, built of old</l>
<l n="475">By Cretan colonists. There icy winds</l>
<l n="476">Constrained the billows, and his trembling fleet</l>
<l n="477">Feared for the winter storms nor dared the main.</l>
<l n="478">But Caesar's soul burned at the moments lost</l>
<l n="479">For speedy battle, nor could brook delay</l>
<l n="480">Within the port, indignant that the sea</l>
<l n="481">Should give safe passage to his routed foe:</l>
<l n="482">And thus he stirred his troops, in seas unskilled,</l>
<l n="483">With words of courage: 'When the winter wind</l>
<l n="484">'Has seized on sky and ocean, firm its hold;</l>
<l n="485">But the inconstancy of cloudy spring</l>
<l n="486">'Permits no certain breezes to prevail</l>
<l n="487">'Upon the billows. Straight shall be our course.</l>
<l n="488">'No winding nooks of coast, but open seas</l>
<l n="489">Struck by the northern wind alone we plough,</l>
<l n="490">'And may he bend the spars, and bear us swift</l>
<l n="491">'To Grecian cities; else Pompeius' ships</l>
<l n="492">'From coasts Phaeacian,<note anchored="true"><placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrhachium</placeName> was founded by the Corcyreans, with whom the Homeric Phaeacians have been identified.</note>  with their swifter oars</l>
<l n="493">May catch our flagging sails. Cast loose the ropes</l>
<l n="494">'From our victorious prows. Too long we waste</l>
<l n="495">'Tempests that blow to bear us to our goal.'</l>
<l n="496">Now sank the sun to rest; the evening star</l>
<l n="497">Shone on the darkening heaven, and the moon</l>
<l n="498">Reigned with her paler light, when all the fleet</l>
<l n="499">Freed from retaining cables seized the main.</l>
<l n="500">With slackened sheet the canvas wooed the breeze,</l>
<l n="501">Which rose and fell and fitful died away,</l>
<l n="502">Till motionless the sails, and all the waves</l>
<l n="503">Were still as deepest pool, where never wind</l>
<l n="504">Ripples the surface. Thus in Scythian climes</l>
<l n="505">Cimmerian Bosphorus restrains the deep</l>

<l n="507">No more impel the main, and ships constrained</l>
<l n="508">Stand fast in ice; and while in depths below</l>
<l n="509">The waves still murmur, loud the charger's hoof</l>
<l n="510">Sounds on the surface, and the travelling wheel</l>
<l n="511">Furrows a track upon the frozen marsh.</l>
<l n="512">Cruel as tempest was the calm that lay</l>
<l n="513">In stagnant pools upon the mournful deep:</l>
<l n="514">Against the course of nature lay outstretched</l>
<l n="515">A rigid ocean: 'twas as if the sea</l>
<l n="516">Forgat its ancient ways and knew no more</l>
<l n="517">The ceaseless tides, nor any breeze of heaven,</l>
<l n="518">Nor quivered at the image of the sun,</l>
<l n="519">Mirrored upon its wave. For while the fleet</l>
<l n="520">Hung in mid passage motionless, the foe</l>
<l n="521">Might hurry to attack, with sturdy stroke</l>
<l n="522">Churning the deep; or famine's deadly grip</l>
<l n="523">Might seize the ships becalmed. For dangers new</l>
<l n="524">New vows they found: for tempests was their prayer,</l>
<l n="525">To rouse the billows till the watery plain</l>
<l n="526">Freed from its torpor should be sea once more.</l>
<l n="527">But cloudless was the sky and calm the deep,</l>
<l n="528">All hope of shipwreck gone, till night was fled,</l>
<l n="529">And marred by gathering mist the day arose</l>
<l n="530">And stirred the depths, and moved the fleet along</l>
<l n="531">Towards the Ceraunian headland; and the waves</l>
<l n="532">And favouring breezes followed on the ships,</l>
<l n="533">Now speeding faster, till (their goal attained)</l>
<l n="534">They cast their anchors on Palaeste's <note anchored="true">At the foot of the Acroceraunian range.</note>  shore.</l>
<l n="535">This land first saw the chiefs in neighbouring camps</l>
<l n="536">Confronted, which the streams of Apsus bound</l>
<l n="537">And swifter Genusus; a lengthy course</l>
<l n="538">Is run by neither, but on Apsus' waves</l>
<l n="539">Scarce flowing from a marsh, the frequent boat</l>
<l n="540">Finds room to swim; while on the foamy bed</l>
<l n="541">Of Genusus by sun or shower compelled</l>
<l n="542">The melted snows pour seawards. Here were met</l>
<l n="543">(So Fortune ordered it) the mighty pair;</l>
<l n="544">And in its woes the world yet vainly hoped</l>
<l n="545">That, brought to nearer touch, their crime itself</l>
<l n="546">Might breed abhorrence: for from either camp</l>
<l n="547">Voices were clearly heard and features seen.</l>
<l n="548">Nor e'er, Pompeius, since that distant day</l>
<l n="549">When Caesar's daughter and thy spouse was reft</l>
<l n="550">By pitiless fate away, nor left a pledge,</l>
<l n="551">Did thy loved kinsman (save on sands of <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName>)</l>
<l n="552">So nearly look upon thy face again.
<milestone n="476" unit="card"/></l>
<l n="553">But Caesar's mind though frenzied for the fight</l>
<l n="554">Was forced to pause until Antonius brought</l>
<l n="555">The rearward troops; Antonius even now</l>
<l n="556">Rehearsing <placeName key="tgn,7002712">Leucas</placeName>' fight. With prayers and threats</l>
<l n="557">Caesar exhorts him. ' Why delay the fates,</l>
<l n="558">Thou cause of evil to the suffering world?</l>
<l n="559">My speed hath won the major part: from thee</l>
<l n="560">Fortune demands the final stroke alone.</l>
<l n="561">Do Libyan whirlpools with deceitful tides</l>
<l n="562">Uncertain separate us?  Is the deep</l>
<l n="563">Untried to which I call?  To unknown risks</l>
<l n="564">Art thou commanded? Caesar bids thee come,</l>
<l n="565">Thou sluggard, not to leave him. Long ago</l>
<l n="566">I ran my ships midway through sands and shoals</l>
<l n="567">To harbours held by foes; and dost thou fear</l>
<l n="568">My friendly camp? I mourn the waste of days</l>
<l n="569">'Which fate allotted us. Upon the waves</l>
<l n="570">And winds I call unceasing: hold not back</l>
<l n="571">Thy willing troops, but let them dare the sea;</l>
<l n="572">Here gladly shall they come to join my camp,</l>
<l n="573">Though risking shipwreck: with indignant voice</l>
<l n="574">I call upon thee. Not in equal shares</l>
<l n="575">'The world has fallen between us: thou alone</l>
<l n="576">Dost hold <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italia</placeName>, but <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName> I</l>
<l n="577">And all the lords of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.' Twice called and thrice</l>
<l n="578">Antonius lingered still: but Caesar's mind</l>
<l n="579">Was that he failed the gods, not they his cause.</l>
<l n="580">By night he braved the strait which others feared</l>
<l n="581">Though bidden: for he knew that daring deeds</l>
<l n="582">Are safely wrought beneath the smile of heaven:</l>
<l n="583">And thus he hoped in fragile boat to cross</l>
<l n="584">The stormy billows fearful to a fleet.</l>
<l n="585">Now gentle night had brought repose from arms;</l>
<l n="586">And sleep, blest guardian of the poor man's couch,</l>
<l n="587">Restored the weary; and the camp was still.</l>
<l n="588">The hour was come that called the second watch</l>
<l n="589">When mighty Caesar, in the silence vast</l>
<l n="590">With cautious tread advanced to such a deed <note anchored="true">Caesar himself says nothing of this adventure. But it is mentioned by <placeName key="perseus,Dion">Dion</placeName>, Appian and Plutarch ('Caesar,' 38). Dean Merivale thinks the story may have been invented to introduce the apophthegm used by Caesar to the sailor, 'Fear nothing: you carry Caesar and his fortunes' (line 665 post). Mommsen accepts the story, as of an attempt which was only abandoned because no mariner could be induced to undertake it. Lucan colours it with his wildest and most exaggerated hyperbole.</note></l>
<l n="591">As slaves should dare not. Fortune for his guide,</l>
<l n="592">Alone he passes on, and o'er the guard</l>
<l n="593">Stretched in repose he leaps, in secret wrath</l>
<l n="594">At such a sleep. Pacing the winding beach,</l>
<l n="595">Fast to a sea-worn rock he finds a boat</l>
<l n="596">On ocean's marge afloat. Hard by on shore</l>
<l n="597">Its master dwelt within his humble home.</l>
<l n="598">No solid front it reared, for sterile rush</l>
<l n="599">And marshy reed enwoven formed the walls,</l>
<l n="600">Propped by a shallop with its bending sides</l>
<l n="601">Turned upwards. Caesar's hand upon the door</l>
<l n="602">Knocks twice and thrice until the fabric shakes.</l>
<l n="603">Amyclas from his couch of soft seaweed</l>
<l n="604">Arising, calls: ' What shipwrecked sailor seeks</l>
<l n="605">'My humble home?      Who hopes for aid from me,</l>
<l n="606">' By fates adverse compelled? ' He stirs the heap</l>
<l n="607">Upon the hearth, until a tiny spark</l>
<l n="608">Glows in the darkness, and throws wide the door.</l>
<l n="609">Careless of war, he knew that civil strife</l>
<l n="610">Stoops not to cottages. O!  happy life</l>
<l n="611">That poverty affords!  great gift of heaven</l>
<l n="612">Too little understood! what mansion wall,</l>
<l n="613">What temple of the gods, would feel no fear</l>
<l n="614">When Caesar called for entrance?  Then the chief:</l>
<l n="615">' Enlarge thine hopes and look for better things.</l>
<l n="616">' Do but my bidding, and on yonder shore</l>
<l n="617">' Place me, and thou shalt cease from one poor boat</l>
<l n="618">' To earn thy living; and in years to come</l>
<l n="619">' Look for a rich old age: and trust thy fates</l>
<l n="620">' To those high gods whose wont it is to bless</l>
<l n="621">' The poor with sudden plenty.' So he spake</l>
<l n="622">E'en at such time in accents of command,</l>
<l n="623">For how could Caesar else?  Amyclas said,</l>
<l n="624">''Twere dangerous to brave the deep to-night.</l>
<l n="625">' The sun descended not in ruddy clouds</l>
<l n="626">' Or peaceful rays to rest; part of his beams</l>
<l n="627">' Presaged a southern gale, the rest proclaimed</l>
<l n="628">' A northern tempest; and his middle orb,</l>
<l n="629">' Shorn of its strength, permitted human eyes</l>
<l n="630">' To gaze upon his grandeur; and the moon</l>
<l n="631">' Rose not with silver horns upon the night</l>
<l n="632">' Nor pure in middle space; her slender points</l>
<l n="633">'Not drawn aright, but blushing with the track</l>
<l n="634">' Of raging tempests, till her lurid light</l>
<l n="635">'Was sadly veiled within the clouds. Again</l>
<l n="636">' The forest sounds; the surf upon the shore;</l>
<l n="637">' The dolphin's mood, uncertain where to play;</l>
<l n="638">' The sea-mew on the land; the heron used</l>
<l n="639">' To wade among the shallows, borne aloft</l>
<l n="640">' And soaring on his wings-all these alarm;</l>
<l n="641">' The raven, too, who plunged his head in spray,</l>
<l n="642">' As if to anticipate the coming rain,</l>
<l n="643">And trod the margin with unsteady gait.</l>
<l n="644">But if the cause demands, behold me thine.</l>
<l n="645">'Either we reach the bidden shore, or else</l>
<l n="646">'Storm and the deep forbid-we can no more.'</l>
<l n="647">Thus said he loosed the boat and raised the sail.</l>
<l n="648">No sooner done than stars were seen to fall</l>
<l n="649">In flaming furrows from the sky: nay, more;</l>
<l n="650">The pole star trembled in its place on high:</l>
<l n="651">Black horror marked the surging of the sea;</l>
<l n="652">The main was boiling in long tracts of foam,</l>
<l n="653">Uncertain of the wind, yet seized with storm.</l>
<l n="654">Then spake the captain of the trembling bark:</l>
<l n="655">See what remorseless ocean has in store!</l>
<l n="656">Whether from east or west the storm may come</l>
<l n="657">Is still uncertain, for as yet confused</l>
<l n="658">'The billows tumble. Judged by clouds and sky</l>
<l n="659">'A western tempest: by the murmuring deep</l>
<l n="660">'A wild south-eastern gale shall sweep the sea.</l>
<l n="661">'Nor bark nor man shall reach Hesperia's shore</l>
<l n="662">In this wild rage of waters. To return</l>
<l n="663">'Back on our course forbidden by the gods,</l>
<l n="664">'Is our one refuge, and with labouring boat</l>
<l n="665">'To reach the shore ere yet the nearest land</l>
<l n="666">'May be too distant.'</l>
<l n="667">But great Caesar's trust</l>
<l n="668">Was in himself, to make all dangers yield.</l>
<l n="669">And thus he answered: ' Scorn the threatening sea,</l>
<l n="670">Spread out thy canvas to the raging wind;</l>
<l n="671">If for thy pilot thou refusest heaven,</l>
<l n="672">'Me in its stead receive. Alone in thee</l>
<l n="673">One cause of terror just-thou dost not know</l>
<l n="674">'Thy comrade, ne'er deserted by the gods,</l>
<l n="675">'Whom fortune blesses e'en without a prayer.</l>

<l n="830">When Caesar's troops were gathered in their strength</l>

<l n="836">Thus art thou tyrant o'er the mightiest mind!</l>
<l n="837">His spouse was the one cause why Magnus stayed</l>
<l n="838">Nor met his fortunes, though he staked the world</l>

<l n="840">He speaks not though resolved; so sweet it seemed,</l>

<l n="845">And win his kisses; when amazed she saw</l>
<l n="846">His cheek was tearful, and with boding soul</l>
<l n="847">Shrank from the hidden wound, nor dared surprise</l>
<l n="848">Magnus in tears. But sighing thus he spake:</l>
<l n="849">' Dearer to me than life itself, when life</l>
<l n="850">'Is happy (not at moments such as these);</l>

<l n="862">'On the eve of war to slumber at thy side,</l>
<l n="863">'And rise from thy dear breast when trumpets call</l>
<l n="864">'A woeful world to misery and arms.</l>
<l n="865">'I dread lest Magnus in this war endure</l>

<l n="886">'Hang by one chain; and dost thou bid me now</l>
<l n="887">'The thunder-bolts of ruin to withstand</l>
<l n="888">Without thee?  Is it well that I should die</l>
<l n="889">'Even while you pray for fortune?  And suppose</l>
<l n="890">' I flee from evil and with death self-sought</l>
<l n="891">' Follow thy footsteps to the realms below--</l>

<l n="896">' As fate reserves for us: but at such a strength</l>
<l n="897">' My spirit trembles. Ah! forgive the truth.</l>
<l n="898">' And if the favouring gods shall hear my prayers,</l>
<l n="899">' I shall be last to hear the victory</l>
<l n="900">' In that lone isle of rocks. When all are glad,</l>
<l n="901">' My heart shall throb with anguish, and the sail</l>
<l n="902">' Which brings the message I shall see with fear,</l>
<l n="903">' Not safe e'en then: for Caesar in his flight</l>
<l n="904">' Might seize me there, abandoned and alone</l>
<l n="905">To be his hostage. If thou place me there,</l>
<l n="906">The spouse of Magnus, shall not all the world</l>
<l n="907">'Well know the secret <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Mitylene</placeName> holds?</l>
<l n="908">This my last prayer: if all is lost but flight,</l>
<l n="909">'And thou shalt seek the ocean, to my shores</l>
<l n="910">'Turn not thy keel, ill-fated one: for there,</l>
<l n="911">'There will they seek thee.' Thus she spoke distraught,</l>
<l n="912">Leaped from the couch and rushed upon her fate;</l>
<l n="913">No stop nor stay: she clung not to his neck</l>
<l n="914">Nor threw her arms about him;  both forego</l>
<l n="915">The last caress, the last fond pledge of love,</l>
<l n="916">And grief rushed in unchecked upon their souls;</l>
<l n="917">Still gazing as they part no final words</l>
<l n="918">Could either utter, and the sweet Farewell</l>
<l n="919">Remained unspoken. This the saddest day</l>
<l n="920">Of all their lives: for other woes that came</l>
<l n="921">More gently struck on hearts inured to grief.</l>
<l n="922">Borne to the shore with failing limbs she fell</l>
<l n="923">And grasped the sands, embracing, till at last</l>
<l n="924">Her maidens placed her senseless in the ship.</l>
<l n="925">Not in such grief she left her country's shores</l>
<l n="926">When Caesar's host drew near; for now she leaves,</l>
<l n="927">Though faithful to her lord, his side in flight</l>
<l n="928">And flees her spouse. All that next night she waked;</l>
<l n="929">Then first what means a widowed couch she knew,</l>
<l n="930">Its cold, its solitude. When slumber found</l>
<l n="931">Her eyelids, and forgetfulness her soul,</l>
<l n="932">Seeking with outstretched arms the form beloved,</l>
<l n="933">She grasps but air. Though tossed by restless love,</l>
<l n="934">She leaves a place beside her as for him</l>
<l n="935">Returning. Yet she feared Pompeius lost</l>
<l n="936">To her for ever. Nay! such happy lot</l>
<l n="937">The gods prepared not; for the hour drew near</l>
<l n="938">Which gave her Magnus to her arms again.

<l n="36">Here Caesar hastes, with distant rampart lines</l>
<l n="37">Seeking unseen to coop his foe within,</l>
<l n="38">Though spread in spacious camp upon the hills.</l>
<l n="39">With eagle eye he measures out the land</l>
<l n="40">Meet to be compassed, nor content with turf</l>
<l n="41">Fit for a hasty mound, he bids his troops</l>
<l n="42">Tear from the quarries many a giant rock:</l>
<l n="43">And spoils the dwellings of the Greeks, and drags</l>
<l n="44">Their walls asunder for his own. Thus rose</l>
<l n="45">A mighty barrier which no ram could burst</l>
<l n="46">Nor any ponderous machine of war.</l>
<l n="47">Mountains are cleft, and level through the hills</l>
<l n="48">The work of Caesar strides : wide yawns the moat,</l>
<l n="49">Forts show their towers rising on the heights,</l>
<l n="50">And in vast circle forests are enclosed</l>
<l n="51">And groves and spacious lands, and beasts of prey,</l>
<l n="52">As in a line of toils. Pompeius lacked</l>
<l n="53">Nor field nor forage in th' encircled span</l>
<l n="54">Nor room to move his camp; nay, rivers rose</l>
<l n="55">Within, and ran their course and reached the sea;</l>
<l n="56">And Caesar wearied ere he saw the whole,</l>
<l n="57">And daylight failed him. Let the ancient tale</l>
<l n="58">Attribute to the labours of the gods</l>
<l n="59">The walls of <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName>: let the fragile bricks</l>
<l n="60">Which compass in great <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName>, amaze</l>
<l n="61">The fleeting Parthian. Here a larger space</l>
<l n="62">Than those great cities which Orontes swift</l>
<l n="63">And <placeName key="tgn,1130850">Tigris</placeName>' stream enclose, or that which boasts</l>
<l n="64">In Eastern climes, the lordly palaces</l>
<l n="65">Fit for Assyria's kings, is closed by walls</l>
<l n="66">Amid the haste and tumult of a war</l>
<l n="67">Forced to completion. Yet this labour huge</l>
<l n="68">Was spent in vain. So many hands had joined</l>
<l n="69">Or <placeName key="perseus,Sestos">Sestos</placeName> with <placeName key="tgn,6000031">Abydos</placeName>, or had tamed</l>
<l n="70">With mighty mole the Hellespontine wave,</l>
<l n="71">Or <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> from the realm of Pelops king</l>
<l n="72">Had rent asunder, or had spared each ship</l>
<l n="73">Her voyage round the long Malean cape,</l>
<l n="74">Or had done anything most hard, to mould</l>
<l n="75">The world's created surface. Here the war</l>
<l n="76">Was prisoned: blood predestinate to flow</l>
<l n="77">In all the parts of earth; the host foredoomed</l>
<l n="78">To fall in <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName> or in <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName></l>
<l n="79">Was here: in such small amphitheatre</l>
<l n="80">The tide of civil passion rose and fell.</l>
<l n="81">At first Pompeius knew not: so the hind</l>
<l n="82">Who peaceful tills the mid-Sicilian fields</l>
<l n="83">Hears not Pelorus <note anchored="true">C. del <placeName key="tgn,1000852">Faro</placeName>, the N.E. point of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>.</note>  sounding to the storm;</l>
<l n="84">So billows thunder on Rutupian shores,<note anchored="true">The shores of <placeName key="tgn,7008153">Kent</placeName>.</note></l>
<l n="85">Unheard by distant <placeName key="tgn,7002444">Caledonia</placeName>'s tribes.</l>
<l n="86">But when he saw the mighty barrier stretch</l>
<l n="87">O'er hill and valley, and enclose the land,</l>
<l n="88">He bade his columns leave their rocky hold</l>
<l n="89">And seize on posts of vantage in the plain;</l>
<l n="90">Thus forcing Caesar to extend his troops</l>
<l n="91">On wider lines; and holding for his own</l>
<l n="92">Such space encompassed as divides from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName></l>
<l n="93"><placeName key="perseus,Aricia">Aricia</placeName>,<note anchored="true"><placeName key="perseus,Aricia">Aricia</placeName> was situated on the <placeName key="tgn,6006324">Via Appia</placeName>, about sixteen miles from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.  There was a temple of Diana close to it, among some woods on a small lake. <placeName key="perseus,Aricia">Aricia</placeName> was Horace's first halting place on his journey to <placeName key="tgn,7004094">Brundisium</placeName></note>  sacred to that goddess chaste</l>
<l n="94">Of old <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName>; or as <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName> holds</l>
<l n="95">From <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>'s high ramparts to the Tuscan sea,</l>
<l n="96">Unless he deviate. No trumpet call</l>
<l n="97">Commands an onset, and the darts that fly</l>
<l n="98">Fly though forbidden; but the arm that flings</l>
<l n="99">For proof the lance, at random, here and there</l>
<l n="100">Deals impious slaughter. Weighty care compelled</l>
<l n="101">Each leader to withhold his troops from fight;</l>
<l n="102">For there the weary earth of produce failed</l>
<l n="103">Pressed by Pompeius' steeds, whose horny hoofs</l>
<l n="104">Rang in their gallop on the grassy fields</l>
<l n="105">And killed the succulence. They strengthless lay</l>
<l n="106">Upon the mown expanse, nor pile of straw,</l>
<l n="107">Brought from full barns in place of living grass,</l>
<l n="108">Relieved their craving; shook their panting flanks,</l>
<l n="109">And as they wheeled Death struck his victim down.</l>
<l n="110">Then foul contagion filled the murky air</l>
<l n="111">Whose poisonous weight pressed on them in a cloud</l>
<l n="112">Pestiferous; as in Nesis' isle <note anchored="true">An island in the Bay of <placeName key="perseus,Puteoli">Puteoli</placeName>.</note>  the breath</l>
<l n="113">Of Styx rolls upwards from the mist-clad rocks;</l>
<l n="114">Or that fell vapour which the caves exhale</l>
<l n="115">From Typhon <note anchored="true">Typhon, the hundred-headed giant, was buried under <placeName key="tgn,7003867">Mount Etna</placeName>.</note>  raging in the depths below.</l>
<l n="116">Then died the soldiers, for the streams they drank</l>
<l n="117">Held yet more poison than the air: the skin</l>
<l n="118">Was dark and rigid, and the fiery plague</l>
<l n="119">Made hard their vitals, and with pitiless tooth</l>
<l n="120">Gnawed at their wasted features, while their eyes</l>
<l n="121">Started from out their sockets, and the head</l>
<l n="122">Drooped from sheer weariness. So the disease</l>
<l n="123">Grew swifter in its strides till scarce was room,</l>
<l n="124">'Twixt life and death, for sickness, and the pest</l>
<l n="125">Slew as it struck its victim, and the dead</l>
<l n="126">Thrust from the tents (such all their burial) lay</l>
<l n="127">Blent with the living. Yet their camp was pitched</l>
<l n="128">Hard by the breezy sea by which might come</l>
<l n="129">All nations' harvests, and the northern wind</l>
<l n="130">Not seldom rolled the murky air away.</l>
<l n="131">Their foe, not vexed with pestilential air</l>
<l n="132">Nor stagnant waters, ample range enjoyed</l>
<l n="133">Upon the spacious uplands: yet as though</l>
<l n="134">In leaguer, famine seized them for its prey.</l>
<l n="135">Scarce were the crops half grown when Caesar saw</l>
<l n="136">How prone they seized upon the food of beasts,</l>
<l n="137">And stripped of leaves the bushes and the groves,</l>
<l n="138">And dragged from roots unknown the doubtful herb,</l>
<l n="139">Which might be death: all things they ate that fire</l>
<l n="140">May soften, or teeth may bite, or arid throat</l>
<l n="141">May swallow; things that never heretofore</l>
<l n="142">Were placed on tables-thus the host at large-</l>
<l n="143">Yet was there plenty with the leaguered foe.
<milestone n="119" unit="card"/></l>
<l n="144">When Magnus first was pleased to break his bonds,</l>
<l n="145">No nightly dash he makes, by craft to seize</l>
<l n="146">His sleeping foe unarmed: his soul had scorned</l>
<l n="147">Such path obscure to victory. Twas his aim,</l>
<l n="148">To lay the turrets low; to mark his track,</l>
<l n="149">By ruin spread afar; and with the sword</l>
<l n="150">To hew a path between his slaughtered foes.</l>
<l n="151">Minucius'<note anchored="true">This was Scaeva's name.</note>  turret was the chosen spot</l>
<l n="152">Where groves of trees and thickets gave approach</l>
<l n="153">Safe, unbetrayed by dust. Up from the fields</l>
<l n="154">Flashed all at once his eagles into sight</l>
<l n="155">And all his trumpets blared. But ere the sword</l>
<l n="156">Could win the battle, on the hostile ranks</l>
<l n="157">Dread panic fell; prone as in death they lay</l>
<l n="158">Where else upright they should withstand the foe;</l>
<l n="159">Nor more availed their valour, and in vain</l>
<l n="160">The cloud of weapons flew, with none to slay.</l>
<l n="161">Then blazing torches rolling pitchy flame</l>
<l n="162">Are hurled, and shaken nod the lofty towers</l>
<l n="163">And threaten ruin, and the bastions groan</l>
<l n="164">Struck by the frequent engine, and the troops</l>
<l n="165">Of Magnus by triumphant eagles led</l>
<l n="166">Stride o'er the rampart, in their front the world.</l>
<l n="167">Yet now that passage which not Caesar's self</l>
<l n="168">Nor thousand valiant squadrons had availed</l>
<l n="169">To rescue from their grasp, one man in arms</l>
<l n="170">Steadfast till death refused them; Scaeva named</l>
<l n="171">This hero soldier: long he served in fight</l>
<l n="172">Waged 'gainst the savage on the banks of <placeName key="tgn,7023890">Rhone</placeName>;</l>
<l n="173">And now centurion made, through deeds of blood,</l>
<l n="174">He bore the staff<note anchored="true">The vinewood staff was the badge of the centurion's office.</note>  before the marshalled line.</l>
<l n="175">Prone to all wickedness, he little recked</l>
<l n="176">How valourous deeds in civil war may be</l>
<l n="177">Greatest of crimes; and when he saw how turned</l>
<l n="178">His comrades fron the war and sought in flight</l>
<l n="179">A refuge, ' Whence,' he cried, 'this impious fear</l>
<l n="180">Unknown to Caesar's armies?  Do ye turn</l>
<l n="181">'Your backs on death, and are ye not ashamed</l>
<l n="182">Not to be found where slaughtered heroes lie?</l>
<l n="183">'Is loyalty too weak?  Yet love of fight</l>
<l n="184">'Might bid you stand. We are the chosen few</l>
<l n="185">'Through whom the foe would break. Unbought by blood</l>
<l n="186">'This day shall not be theirs. 'Neath Caesar's eye,</l>
<l n="187">'True, death would be more happy; but this boon</l>
<l n="188">'Fortune denies: at least my fall shall be</l>
<l n="189">'Praised by Pompeius. Shatter with your breasts</l>
<l n="190">' Their weapons; blunt the edges of their swords</l>
<l n="191">' With throats unyielding. In the distant lines</l>
<l n="192">' The dust is seen already, and the sound</l>
<l n="193">' Of tumult and of ruin finds the ear</l>
<l n="194">Of Caesar: strike; the victory is ours:</l>
<l n="195">'For he shall come who while his soldiers die</l>
<l n="196">Shall make the fortress his.' His voice calls forth</l>
<l n="197">The courage that the trumpets failed to rouse</l>
<l n="198">When first they rang: his comrades mustering come</l>
<l n="199">To watch his deeds; and, wondering at the man,</l>
<l n="200">To test if valour thus by foes oppressed,</l>
<l n="201">In narrow space, could hope for aught but death.</l>
<l n="202">But Scaeva standing on the tottering bank</l>
<l n="203">Heaves from the brimming turret on the foe</l>
<l n="204">The corpses of the fallen; the ruined mass</l>
<l n="205">Gives weapons to his hands; with beams and poles</l>
<l n="206">And ponderous stones, with his own breast he threats</l>
<l n="207">His enemies; and thrusts with mighty stakes</l>
<l n="208">The host advancing; when they grasp the wall</l>
<l n="209">He lops the arm: rocks crush the foeman's skull</l>
<l n="210">And rive the scalp asunder: fiery bolts</l>
<l n="211">Dashed at another set his hair aflame,</l>
<l n="212">Till rolls the greedy blaze about his eyes</l>
<l n="213">With hideous crackle. As the pile of slain</l>
<l n="214">Rose to the summit of the wall he sprang,</l>
<l n="215">Swift as across the nets a hunted pard,</l>
<l n="216">Above the swords upraised, till in mid throng</l>
<l n="217">Of foes he stood, hemmed in by densest ranks</l>
<l n="218">And ramparted by war; in front and rear,</l>
<l n="219">Where'er he struck, the victor. Now his sword</l>
<l n="220">Blunted with gore congealed no more could wound,</l>
<l n="221">But brake the stricken limb; while every hand</l>
<l n="222">Flung every quivering dart at him alone;</l>
<l n="223">Nor missed their aim, for rang against his shield</l>
<l n="224">Dart after dart unerring, and his helm</l>
<l n="225">In broken fragments pressed upon his brow;</l>
<l n="226">His vital parts were safeguarded by spears</l>
<l n="227">That bristled in his body. Fortune saw</l>
<l n="228">Thus waged a novel combat, for there warred</l>
<l n="229">Against one man an army. Why with darts,</l>
<l n="230">Madmen, assail him and with slender shafts,</l>
<l n="231">'Gainst which his life is proof? Or ponderous stones</l>
<l n="232">This warrior chief shall overwhelm, or bolts</l>
<l n="233">Flung by the twisted thongs of mighty slings.</l>
<l n="234">Let steel-shod ram or catapult remove</l>
<l n="235">This champion of the gate. No fragile wall</l>
<l n="236">Stands here for Caesar, blocking with its bulk</l>
<l n="237">Pompeius' way to freedom. Now he trusts</l>
<l n="238">His shield no more, lest his sinister hand,</l>
<l n="239">Idle, give life by shame; and on his breast</l>
<l n="240">Bearing a forest of spears, though spent with toil</l>
<l n="241">And worn with onset, falls upon his foe</l>
<l n="242">And braves alone the wounds of all the war.</l>
<l n="243">Thus may an elephant in Afric wastes,</l>
<l n="244">Oppressed by frequent darts, break those that fall</l>
<l n="245">Rebounding from his horny hide, and shake</l>
<l n="246">Those that find lodgment, while his life within</l>
<l n="247">Lies safe, protected, nor does spear avail</l>
<l n="248">To reach the fount of blood. Unnumbered wounds</l>
<l n="249">By arrow dealt, or lance, thus fail to slay</l>
<l n="250">This single warrior. But lo! from far</l>
<l n="251">A Cretan archer's shaft, more sure of aim</l>
<l n="252">Than vows could hope for, strikes on Scaeva's brow</l>
<l n="253">To light within his eye: the hero tugs</l>
<l n="254">Intrepid, bursts the nerves, and tears the shaft</l>
<l n="255">Forth with the eyeball, and with dauntless heel</l>
<l n="256">Treads them to dust. Not otherwise a bear</l>
<l n="257">Pannonian, fiercer for the wound received,</l>
<l n="258">Maddened by dart from Libyan thong propelled,</l>
<l n="259">Turns circling on her wound, and still pursues</l>
<l n="260">The weapon fleeing as she whirls around.</l>
<l n="261">Thus, in his rage destroyed, his shapeless face</l>
<l n="262">Stood foul with crimson flow. The victors' shout</l>
<l n="263">Glad to the sky arose; no greater joy</l>
<l n="264">A little blood could give them had they seen</l>
<l n="265">That Caesar's self was wounded. Down he pressed</l>
<l n="266">Deep in his soul the anguish, and, with mien</l>
<l n="267">No longer bent on fight, submissive cried,</l>
<l n="268">Spare me, ye citizens; remove the war</l>
<l n="269">Far hence: no weapons now can haste my death;</l>
<l n="270">Draw from my breast the darts, but add no more.</l>
<l n="271">Yet raise me up to place me in the camp</l>
<l n="272">Of Magnus, living: this your gift to him;</l>
<l n="273">No brave man's death my title to renown,</l>
<l n="274">But Caesar's flag deserted.' So he spake.</l>
<l n="275">Unhappy Aulus thought his words were true,</l>
<l n="276">Nor saw within his hand the ready sword;</l>
<l n="277">And leaping forth in haste to make his own</l>
<l n="278">The prisoner and his arms, in middle throat</l>
<l n="279">Received the lightning blade. By this one death</l>
<l n="280">Rose Scaeva's valour again; and thus he cried,</l>
<l n="281">Such be the punishment of all who thought</l>
<l n="282">Great Scaeva vanquished; if Pompeius seeks</l>
<l n="283">Peace from this reeking sword, low let him lay</l>
<l n="284">' At Caesar's feet his standards. Me do ye think</l>
<l n="285">' Such as yourselves, and slow to meet the fates?</l>
<l n="286">'Your love for Magnus and the Senate's cause</l>
<l n="287">'Is less than mine for death.' These were his words;</l>
<l n="288">And dust in columns proved that Caesar came.</l>
<l n="289">Thus was Pompeius' glory spared the stain</l>
<l n="290">Of flight compelled by Scava. He, when ceased</l>
<l n="291">The battle, fell, no more by rage of fight,</l>
<l n="292">Or sight of blood out-pouring from his wounds,</l>
<l n="293">Roused to the combat. Fainting there he lay</l>
<l n="294">Upon the shoulders of his comrades borne,</l>
<l n="295">Who him adoring (as though deity</l>
<l n="296">Dwelt in his bosom) for his matchless deeds,</l>
<l n="297">Plucked forth the gory shafts and took his arms</l>
<l n="298">To deck the gods and shield the breast of Mars.</l>
<l n="299">Thrice happy thou with such a name achieved,</l>
<l n="300">Had but the fierce Iberian from thy sword,</l>
<l n="301">Or heavy shielded Teuton, or had fled</l>
<l n="302">The light Cantabrian: now no spoils of thine</l>
<l n="303">Shall deck the Thunderer's temple, nor upraise</l>
<l n="304">The shout of triumph in the ways of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</l>
<l n="305">For all thy prowess, all thy deeds of pride</l>

<milestone n="263" unit="card"/></l>
<l part="F" n="tr">Nor on this hand</l>
<l n="306">Repulsed, Pompeius idly ceased from war,</l>
<l n="307">Content within his bars; but as the sea</l>
<l n="308">Tireless, which tempests force upon the crag</l>
<l n="309">That breaks it, or which gnaws a mountain side</l>
<l n="310">Some day to fall in ruin on itself;</l>
<l n="311">He sought the turrets nearest to the main,</l>
<l n="312">On double onset bent; nor closely kept</l>
<l n="313">His troops in hand, but on the spacious plain</l>
<l n="314">Spread forth his camp. They joyful leave the tents</l>
<l n="315">And wander at their will. Thus <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus</placeName> flows</l>
<l n="316">In brimming flood, and foaming at his bounds,</l>
<l n="317">Making whole districts quake; and should the bank</l>
<l n="318">Fail 'neath his swollen waters, all his stream</l>
<l n="319">Breaks forth in swirling eddies over fields</l>
<l n="320">Not his before; some lands are lost, the rest</l>
<l n="321">Gain from his bounty.</l>
<l n="322">Hardly from his tower</l>
<l n="323">Had Caesar seen the fire or known the fight:</l>
<l n="324">And coming found the rampart overthrown,</l>
<l n="325">The dust no longer stirred, the ruins cold</l>
<l n="326">As from a battle done. The peace that reigned</l>
<l n="327">There and on Magnus' side, as though men slept,</l>
<l n="328">Their victory won, aroused his angry soul.</l>
<l n="329">Quick he prepares, so that he end their joy</l>
<l n="330">Careless of slaughter or defeat, to rush</l>
<l n="331">With threatening columns on Torquatus' post.</l>
<l n="332">But swift as sailor, by his trembling mast</l>
<l n="333">Warned of Circeian tempest, furls his sails,</l>
<l n="334">So swift Torquatus saw, and prompt to wage</l>
<l n="335">The war more closely, he withdrew his men</l>
<l part="I" n="tr">Within a narrower wall.</l>
<l part="F" n="tr">Now past the trench</l>
<l n="336">Were Caesar's companies, when from the hills</l>
<l n="337">Pompeius hurled his host upon their ranks</l>
<l n="338">Shut in, and hampered. Not so much o'erwhelmed</l>
<l n="339">As Caesar's soldiers is the hind who dwells</l>
<l n="340">On <placeName key="tgn,7003867">Etna</placeName>'s slopes, when blows the southern wind,</l>

<l n="344">A blazing torrent. Blinded by the dust,</l>
<l n="345">Encircled, vanquished, ere the fight, they fled</l>
<l n="346">In cloud of terror on their rearward foe,</l>
<l n="347">So rushing on their fates. Thus had the war</l>
<l n="348">Shed its last drop of blood and peace ensued,</l>

<l n="617">Upon those locks unkempt that crowned her brow.</l>
<l n="618">In starless nights of tempest crept the hag</l>
<l n="619">Out from her tomb to seize the levin bolt;</l>
<l n="620">Treading the harvest with accursed foot</l>
<l n="621">She burned the fruitful growth, and with her breath</l>
<l n="622">Poisoned the air else pure. No prayer she breathed</l>
<l n="623">Nor supplication to the gods, nor knew</l>
<l n="624">The pulse of entrails : logs from flaming pyres</l>
<l n="625">She loves to cast on altars of the gods,</l>
<l n="626">And incense pilfered from the smoking tomb.</l>
<l n="627">The gods at her first utterance grant her prayer</l>
<l n="628">For things unlawful, lest they hear again</l>
<l n="629">Its fearful accents: men whose limbs were quick</l>
<l n="630">With vital power she thrust within the grave</l>
<l n="631">Despite the fates who owed them years to come:</l>
<l n="632">The funeral reversed brought from the tomb</l>
<l n="633">Those who were dead no longer; and the pyre</l>
<l n="634">Yields to her shameless clutch still smoking dust</l>
<l n="635">And bones enkindled, torches which but now</l>
<l n="636">Some grieving father held, and fragments mixed</l>
<l n="637">In sable smoke and ceremental cloths</l>
<l n="638">Singed with the redolent fire that burned the dead.</l>
<l n="639">But those who lie within a stony cell</l>
<l n="640">Untouched by fire, whose dried and mummied frames</l>
<l n="641">No longer know corruption, limb by limb</l>
<l n="642">Venting her rage she tears, the bloodless eyes</l>
<l n="643">Drags from their cavities, and mauls the nail</l>
<l n="644">Upon the withered hand: she gnaws the noose</l>
<l n="645">By which some wretch has died, and from the tree</l>
<l n="646">Drags down a pendent corpse, its members torn</l>
<l n="647">Asunder to the winds: forth from the palms</l>
<l n="648">Wrenches the iron, and from the unbending bond</l>
<l n="649">Hangs by her teeth, and with her hands collects</l>
<l n="650">The slimy gore which drips upon the limbs.</l>
<l n="651">Where lay a corpse upon the naked earth</l>
<l n="652">On ravening birds and beasts of prey the hag</l>
<l n="653">Kept watch, nor marred by knife or hand her spoil,</l>
<l n="654">Till on his victim seized some nightly wolf; <note anchored="true">'As if that piece were sweeter which the wolf had bitten.' Note to'The Masque of Queens,' in which the first hag says:

But more probably the meaning is that the wolf's bite gave the flesh magical efficacy.</note></l>
<l n="659">Then dragged the morsel from his thirsty fangs;</l>
<l n="660">Nor fears she murder, if some banquet fell</l>
<l n="661">Need blood fresh issued from the gaping throat,</l>
<l n="662">Or panting entrail. By unnatural means</l>
<l n="663">Wombs yield to her the infant to be placed</l>
<l n="664">On glowing altars: and whene'er she needs</l>
<l n="665">Some fierce undaunted ghost, he fails not her</l>
<l n="666">Who has all deaths in use. Her hand has chased</l>
<l n="667">From smiling cheeks the rosy bloom of life;</l>
<l n="668">And with sinister hand from dying youth</l>
<l n="669">Has shorn the fatal lock: and holding oft</l>
<l n="670">In foul embraces some departed friend</l>
<l n="671">Severed the head, and through the ghastly lips,</l>
<l n="672">Held by her own apart, some impious tale</l>

<l n="675">When Sextus first, through rumours of the place,</l>

<l n="744">And through redoubled night, a squalid veil</l>
<l n="745">Swathing her pallid features, stole among</l>
<l n="746">Unburied carcases. Fast fled the wolves,</l>
<l n="747">The carrion birds with maw unsatisfied</l>
<l n="748">Relaxed their talons, as with creeping step</l>
<l n="749">She sought her prophet. Firm must be the flesh</l>
<l n="750">As yet, though cold in death, and firm the lungs</l>

<l n="760">O'er rocks she drags him to the mountain cave</l>

<l n="762">The dead man's life. Close to the hidden brink</l>
<l n="763">The land that girds the precipice of hell</l>
<l n="764">Sinks towards the depths: with ever falling leaves</l>
<l n="765">A wood o'ershadows, and a spreading yew</l>
<l n="766">Casts shade impenetrable. Foul decay</l>
<l n="767">Fills all the space, and in the deep recess</l>
<l n="768">Darkness unbroken, save by chanted spells,</l>
<l n="769">Reigns ever. Not where gape the misty jaws</l>
<l n="770">Of caverned Taenarus, the gloomy bound</l>
<l n="771">Of either world, through which the nether kings</l>

<l n="774">Nay, though the witch had power to call the shades</l>
<l n="775">Forth from the depths, 'twas doubtful if the cave</l>
<l n="776">Were not a part of hell. Discordant hues</l>
<l n="777">Flamed on her garb as by a fury worn;</l>
<l n="778">Bare was her visage, and upon her brow</l>
<l n="779">Dread vipers hissed, beneath her streaming locks</l>
<l n="780">In sable coils entwined. But when she saw</l>
<l n="781">The youth's companions trembling, and himself</l>
<l n="782">With eyes cast down, with visage as of death,</l>
<l n="783">Thus spake the witch: ' Forbid your craven souls</l>

<l n="818">And sounds discordant from the tongues of men</l>
<l n="819">She utters, scarce articulate: the bay</l>

<l n="586">But while Pompeius' ranks, shield wedged to shield,</l>
<l n="587">Were ranged in dense array, and scarce had space</l>
<l n="588">To draw the blade, came rushing at the charge</l>
<l n="589">Full on the central column Caesar's host,</l>
<l n="590">Mad for the battle. Man nor arms could stay</l>
<l n="591">The crash of onset, and the furious sword</l>

<l n="596">Nor Fortune lingered, but decreed the doom</l>

<l n="612">Behind the standards Caesar in reserve</l>
<l n="613">Had placed some companies of foot, in fear</l>
<l n="614">The foremost ranks might waver. These at his word,</l>
<l n="615">No trumpet sounding, break upon the ranks</l>
<l n="616">Of Magnus' horsemen where they rode at large</l>
<l n="617">Flanking the battle. They, unshamed of fear</l>
<l n="618">And careless of the fray, when first a steed</l>
<l n="619">Pierced through by javelin spurned with sounding hoof</l>
<l n="620">The temples of his rider, turned the rein,</l>
<l n="621">And through their comrades spurring from the field</l>
<l n="622">In panic, proved that not with warring <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName></l>
<l n="623">Barbarians may grapple. Then arose</l>
<l n="624">Immeasurable carnage: here the sword,</l>
<l n="625">There stood the victim, and the victor's arm</l>
<l n="626">Wearied of slaughter. Oh, that to thy plains,</l>

<l n="628">From hosts barbarian, nor other blood</l>
<l n="629">Pollute thy fountains' sources! these alone</l>

<l n="636">Where stood the chosen of Pompeius' force,</l>

<milestone n="557" unit="card"/></l>
<l n="649">But Caesar adding fury to the breasts</l>
<l n="650">Already flaming with the rage of war,</l>
<l n="651">That each might bear his portion of the guilt</l>
<l n="652">Which stained the host, unflinching through the ranks</l>
<l n="653">Passed at his will. He looked upon the brands,</l>
<l n="654">These reddened only at the point, and those</l>
<l n="655">Streaming with blood and gory to the hilt:</l>
<l n="656">He marks the hand which trembling grasped the sword,</l>
<l n="657">Or held it idle, and the cheek that grew</l>
<l n="658">Pale at the blow, and that which at his words</l>
<l n="659">Glowed with the joy of battle: midst the dead</l>
<l n="660">He treads the plain and on each gaping wound</l>
<l n="661">Presses his hand to keep the life within.</l>
<l n="662">Thus Caesar passed: and where his footsteps fell</l>
<l n="663">As when Bellona shakes her crimson lash,</l>

<l n="665">When shunning the dread face on Pallas' shield,</l>
<l n="666">He drives his chariot, there arose a night</l>
<l n="667">Dark with huge slaughter and with crime, and groans</l>
<l n="668">As of a voice immense, and sound of arms</l>
<l n="669">As fell the wearer, and of sword on sword</l>
<l n="670">Crashed into fragments. With a ready hand</l>
<l n="671">Caesar supplies the weapon and bids strike</l>
<l n="672">Full at the visage; and with lance reversed</l>
<l n="673">Urges the flagging ranks and stirs the fight.</l>
<l n="674">Where flows the nation's blood, where beats the heart,</l>

<l n="676">But seeks the senators-thus <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> he strikes,</l>
<l n="677">Thus the last hold of Freedom. In the fray,</l>
<l n="678">Then fell the nobles with their mighty names</l>
<l n="679">Of ancient prowess; there Metellus' sons,</l>
<l n="680">Corvini, Lepidi, Torquati too,</l>

<l part="F" n="tr">But, Brutus, where,</l>
<l n="683">Where was thy sword?  <note anchored="true">Plutarch states that Brutus after the battle escaped and made his way to Larissa, whence he wrote to Caesar. Caesar, pleased that he was alive, asked him to come to him; and it was on Brutus' opinion that Caesar determined to hurry to <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> as the most probable refuge of Pompeius. Caesar entrusted Brutus with the command of Cisalpine Gaul when he was in <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>.</note>  Veiled by a common helm</l>

<l n="697">Thee, brave Domitius.<note anchored="true">'He perished, after a career of furious partisanship, disgraced with cruelty and treachery, on the field of Pharsalia' (Merivale, 'Hist. Romans under the Empire,' chapter lii.). Unless this man had been an ancestor of Nero it is impossible to suppose that Lucan would have thus singled him out. But he appears to have been the only leader who fell. (Compare Book II., lines 534-590, for his conduct at <placeName key="perseus,Corfinium">Corfinium</placeName>.)</note>  Whene'er the day</l>
<l n="698">Was adverse to the fortunes of thy chief</l>
<l n="699">Thine was the arm which vainly stayed the fight.</l>
<l n="700">Vanquished so oft by Caesar, now 'twas thine</l>
<l n="701">Yet free to perish. By a thousand wounds</l>
<l n="702">Came welcome death, nor had thy conqueror power</l>
<l n="703">Again to pardon. Caesar stood and saw</l>
<l n="704">The dark blood welling forth and death at hand,</l>
<l n="705">And thus in words of scorn: ' And dost thou lie,</l>
<l n="706">'Domitius, there?  And did Pompeius name</l>
<l n="707">'Thee his successor, thee?  Why leavest thou then</l>
<l n="708">His standards helpless?' But the parting life</l>
<l n="709">Still faintly throbbed within Domitius' breast,</l>
<l n="710">Thus finding utterance: 'Yet thou hast not won</l>
<l n="711">Thy hateful prize, for doubtful are the fates;</l>
<l n="712">'Nor thou the master, Caesar; free as yet,</l>
<l n="713">'With great Pompeius for my leader still,</l>

<l part="I" n="tr">Then closed his eyes in death.</l>
<l part="F" n="tr">'Twere shame to shed,</l>
<l n="718">When thus a world was perishing, the tear</l>
<l n="719">Meet for each fate, or sing the wound that reft</l>

<l n="721">His vitals as they trailed; one faced the foe</l>
<l n="722">And as the sword struck deep into his throat</l>
<l n="723">Breathed forth his life: another fell to earth</l>
<l n="724">Prone at the stroke; one stood though shorn of limb;</l>
<l n="725">Glanced from this breast unharmed the quivering spear;</l>
<l n="726">That it transfixed to earth. Here from the veins</l>
<l n="727">Spouted the life-blood, till the foeman's arms</l>
<l n="728">Were crimsoned. One his brother slew, nor dared</l>
<l n="729">To spoil the corse, till severed from the neck</l>
<l n="730">He flung the head afar. Another dashed</l>
<l n="731">Full in his father's teeth the fatal sword,</l>
<l n="732">By murderous frenzy striving to disprove</l>
<l n="733">His kinship with the slain. Yet for each death</l>
<l n="734">We find no separate dirge, nor weep for men</l>

<l n="744">In that day's battle dealt; nor only then</l>

<l n="755">Now saw Pompeius, grieving, that the gods</l>
<l n="756">Had left his side, and knew the fates of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName></l>
<l n="757">Passed from his governance; yet all the blood</l>
<l n="758">That filled the field scarce brought him to confess</l>
<l n="759">His fortunes fled. A little hill he sought</l>
<l n="760">Whence to descry the battle raging still</l>

<l n="762">The warring ranks concealed. Thence did the chief</l>
<l n="763">Gaze on unnumbered swords that flashed in air</l>

<l n="768">Still were the gods thought worthy of his prayers</l>

<l part="F" n="tr">When Italian blood</l>
<l n="854">Flowed deep enough upon the fatal field,</l>

<l n="856">Whose deaths were vain. But that the hostile camp</l>
<l n="857">Might not recall the foe, nor calm of night</l>

<l n="860">Straight on the ramparts of the conquered foe.</l>
<l n="861">Light was the task to urge them to the spoil</l>
<l n="862">Though worn by battle, wearied with the fray:</l>
<l n="863">Soldiers,' he said, ' the victory is ours,</l>

<l n="877">What rampart had restrained them as they rushed</l>

<l n="65">Dark on her soul a night of anguish fell;</l>
<l n="66">Her trembling limbs no longer bore her frame:</l>

<l n="674">And son, I pray you; from the shore afar</l>
<l n="675">' Await my fortunes; mine shall be the life</l>
<l n="676">' To test their honour.' But Cornelia still</l>
<l n="677">Withstood his bidding, and with arms outspread</l>
<l n="678">Frenzied she cried: ' And whither without me,</l>

<l n="686">Leaning upon the bulwark, dazed with dread;</l>
<l n="687">Nor could she turn her straining gaze aside,</l>
<l n="688">Nor see her parting husband. All the fleet</l>
<l n="689">Stood silent, anxious, waiting for the end:</l>

<l part="F" n="tr">As Magnus passed,</l>
<l n="692">A Roman soldier from the Pharian boat,</l>
<l n="693">Septimius, salutes him. Gods of heaven!</l>
<l n="694">There stood he, minion to a barbarous king,</l>
<l n="695">Nor bearing still the javelin of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>;</l>
<l n="696">But vile in all his arms; giant in form</l>
<l n="697">Fierce, brutal, thirsting as a beast may thirst</l>
<l n="698">For carnage. Didst thou, Fortune, for the sake</l>
<l n="699">Of nations, spare to dread <placeName key="tgn,7010797">Pharsalus</placeName> field</l>
<l n="700">This savage monster's blows?  Or dost thou place</l>
<l n="701">Throughout the world, for thy mysterious ends,</l>
<l n="702">Some ministering swords for civil war?</l>
<l n="703">Thus, to the shame of victors and of gods,</l>
<l n="704">This story shall be told in days to come:</l>
<l n="705">A Roman swordsman, once within thy ranks,</l>
<l n="706">Slave to the orders of a puny prince,</l>
<l n="707">Severed Pompeius' neck. And what shall be</l>
<l n="708">Septimius' fame hereafter?  By what name</l>
<l n="709">This deed be called, if Brutus wrought a crime?</l>
<l n="710">Now came the end, the latest hour of all:</l>
<l n="711">Rapt to the boat was Magnus, of himself</l>
<l n="712">No longer master, and the miscreant crew</l>
<l n="713">Unsheathed their swords; which when the chieftain saw</l>
<l n="714">He swathed his visage, for he scorned unveiled</l>
<l n="715">To yield his life to fortune;  closed his eyes</l>
<l n="716">And held his breath within him, lest some word,</l>
<l n="717">Or sob escaped, might mar the deathless fame</l>
<l n="718">His deeds had won. And when within his side</l>
<l n="719">Achillas plunged his blade, nor sound nor cry</l>
<l n="720">He gave, but calm consented to the blow</l>
<l n="721">And proved himself in dying; in his breast</l>
<l n="722">These thoughts revolving: ' In the years to come</l>
<l n="723">' Men shall make mention of our Roman toils,</l>
<l n="724">' Gaze on this boat, ponder the Pharian faith;</l>
<l n="725">' And think upon thy fame and all the years</l>
<l n="726">' While Fortune smiled: but for the ills of life</l>
<l n="727">' How thou couldst bear them, this men shall not know</l>
<l n="728">' Save by thy death. Then weigh thou not the shame</l>
<l n="729">' That waits on thine undoing. Whoso strikes,</l>
<l n="730">' The blow is Caesar's. Men may tear this frame</l>
<l n="731">'And cast it mangled to the winds of heaven;</l>
<l n="732">'Yet have I prospered, nor can all the gods</l>
<l n="733">' Call back my triumphs. Life may bring defeat,</l>
<l n="734">'But death no misery. If my spouse and son</l>
<l n="735">'Behold me murdered, silently the more</l>
<l n="736">' I suffer: admiration at my death</l>
<l n="737">'Shall prove their love.' So did Pompeius die,</l>
<l n="738">And so kept guard upon his thoughts in death.
<milestone n="637" unit="card"/></l>
<l n="739">His spouse, less patient to behold the crime</l>
<l n="740">Than to endure it, filled the airs with cries;</l>
<l n="741">'0, husband, whom my wicked self hath slain!</l>
<l n="742">'That lonely isle apart thy bane hath been</l>
<l n="743">'And stayed thy coming. Caesar to the <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></l>
<l n="744">'Has won before us; for what other hand</l>
<l n="745">'May do such work?  But whosoe'er thou art</l>
<l n="746">'Sent from the gods with power, for Caesar's ire,</l>
<l n="747">'Or thine own sake, to slay, thou dost not know</l>
<l n="748">'Where lies the heart of Magnus. Thou dost haste</l>
<l n="749">To deal the blow as he would have it fall.</l>
<l n="750">'Let me die first, and let him seeing bear</l>
<l n="751">'An agony no less than death can bring.</l>
<l n="752">'No freedom mine from blame of war. Alone</l>
<l n="753">Of Roman wives, through oceans and through camps,</l>
<l n="754">Fearing no fates, I followed him afield;</l>
<l n="755">And in defeat when even monarchs feared</l>
<l n="756">Received my husband. Did I then deserve</l>
<l n="757">Thus to be left of thee, and didst thou seek</l>
<l n="758">To spare me? And when rushing on thine end</l>
<l n="759">Was I to live?  Without the monarch's help</l>
<l n="760">Death shall be mine, either by headlong leap</l>
<l n="761">Beneath the waters; or some sailor's hand</l>
<l n="762">Shall bind around this neck the fatal cord;</l>
<l n="763">Or else some comrade, worthy of his chief,</l>
<l n="764">Drive to my heart his blade for Magnus' sake,</l>
<l n="765">And claim the service done to Caesar's arms.</l>
<l n="766">What! does your cruelty withhold my fate?</l>
<l n="767">Ah!  still he lives, nor is it mine as yet</l>
<l n="768">To win this freedom; they forbid me death,</l>
<l n="769">Kept for the victor's triumph.' Thus she spake,</l>
<l n="770">While friendly hands upheld her fainting form;</l>
<l n="771">And sped the trembling vessel from the shore.</l>
<l n="772">Men say that Magnus, when the deadly blows</l>
<l n="773">Fell thick upon him, lost nor form divine,</l>
<l n="774">Nor venerated mien; and as they gazed</l>
<l n="775">Upon his lacerated head they marked</l>
<l n="776">Still on his features anger with the gods.</l>
<l n="777">For fierce Septimius in the very blow</l>
<l n="778">Made yet more black his crime-unwound the folds</l>
<l n="779">That swathed the face, and seized the noble head</l>
<l n="780">And drooping neck ere yet was fled the life:</l>
<l n="781">Then placed upon the bench; and with his blade</l>
<l n="782">Slow at its hideous task, and blows unskilled</l>
<l n="783">Hacked through the flesh and brake the knotted bone;</l>
<l n="784">For yet man had not learned by swoop of sword</l>
<l n="785">Deftly to lop the neck. Achillas claimed</l>
<l n="786">The gory head dissevered. What! shalt thou</l>
<l n="787">A Roman soldier, while thy blade yet reeks</l>
<l n="788">From Magnus' slaughter, play the second part</l>
<l n="789">To this base varlet of the Pharian king?</l>
<l n="790">Nor bear thyself the bleeding trophy home?</l>
<l n="791">Then, that the impious boy (ah! shameful fate)</l>
<l n="792">Might know the features of the hero slain,</l>
<l n="793">Seized by the locks, the dread of kings, which waved</l>
<l n="794">Upon his stately front, on Pharian pike</l>
<l n="795">The head was lifted; while almost the life</l>
<l n="796">Gave to the tongue its accents, and the eyes</l>
<l n="797">Were yet scarce glazed: that head at whose command</l>
<l n="798">Was peace or war, that tongue whose eloquent tones</l>
<l n="799">Would move assemblies, and that noble brow</l>
<l n="800">On which were showered the rewards of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</l>

<l n="814">Shall Magnus' body hither and thither borne</l>

<l n="816">Too much it troubled thee to guard the corse</l>
<l n="817">Unmutilated, for his kinsman's eye</l>

<l n="824">By one day's carnage! In his happy time</l>
<l n="825">Heaven did not harass him, nor did she spare</l>

<l n="827">That dashed him down. Now beaten by the sands,</l>
<l n="828">Torn upon rocks, the sport of ocean's waves</l>
<l n="829">Poured through its wounds, his headless carcase lies,</l>
<l n="830">Save by the lacerated trunk unknown.
<milestone n="712" unit="card"/></l>
<l n="831">Yet ere the victor touched the Pharian sands</l>
<l n="832">Some scanty rites to Magnus Fortune gave,</l>
<l n="833">Lest he should want all burial. Pale with fear</l>
<l n="834">Came Cordus, hasting from his hiding place;</l>
<l n="835">Quaestor, he joined Pompeius on thy shore,</l>
<l n="836">Idalian Cyprus, bringing in his train</l>
<l n="837">A cloud of evils. Through the darkening shades</l>
<l n="838">Love for the dead compelled his trembling steps,</l>
<l n="839">Hard by the margin of the deep to search</l>
<l n="840">And drag to land his master. Through the clouds</l>
<l n="841">The moon shone sadly, and her rays were dim;</l>
<l n="842">But by its hue upon the hoary main</l>
<l n="843">He knew the body. In a fast embrace</l>
<l n="844">He holds it, wrestling with the greedy sea,</l>
<l n="845">And deftly watching for a refluent wave</l>
<l n="846">Gains help to bring his burden to the land.</l>
<l n="847">Then clinging to the loved remains, the wounds</l>
<l n="848">Washed with his tears, thus to the gods he speaks,</l>
<l n="849">And misty stars obscure: 'Here, Fortune, lies</l>
<l n="850">Pompeius, thine: no costly incense rare</l>
<l n="851">Or pomp of funeral he dares to ask;</l>
<l n="852">Nor that the smoke rise heavenward from his pyre</l>

<l n="856">' With dirges; nor that triumphs won of yore</l>
<l n="857">'Be borne before him; nor for sorrowing hosts</l>

<l n="860">His mutilated corse may reach the flame.</l>
<l n="861">Grudge not his misery the pile of wood</l>
<l n="862">' Lit by this menial hand. Is't not enough</l>
<l n="863">'That his Cornelia with dishevelled hair</l>
<l n="864">' Weeps not beside him at his obsequies,</l>

<l part="I" n="tr">' Hard by still wanders? '</l>
<l part="F" n="tr">Burning from afar</l>
<l n="867">He sees the pyre of some ignoble youth</l>
<l n="868">Deserted of his own, with none to guard:</l>
<l n="869">And quickly drawing from beneath the limbs</l>
<l n="870">Some glowing logs, ' Whoe'er thou art,' he said,</l>
<l n="871">Neglected shade, uncared for, dear to none,</l>
<l n="872">Yet happier than Pompeius in thy death,</l>
<l n="873">Pardon I ask that this my stranger hand</l>
<l n="874">' Should violate thy tomb. Yet if to shades</l>
<l n="875">'Be sense or memory, gladly shalt thou yield</l>
<l n="876">'This from thy pyre to Magnus. 'Twere thy shame,</l>
<l n="877">'Blessed with due burial, if his remains</l>
<l n="878">Were homeless.' Speaking thus, the wood aflame</l>
<l n="879">Back to the headless trunk at speed he bore,</l>
<l n="880">Which hanging on the margin of the deep,</l>
<l n="881">Almost the sea had won. In sandy trench</l>
<l n="882">The gathered fragments of a broken boat,</l>
<l n="883">Trembling, he placed around the noble limbs.</l>
<l n="884">No pile above the corse nor under lay,</l>
<l n="885">Nor was the fire beneath. Then as he crouched</l>
<l n="886">Beside the blaze, ' 0, greatest chief,' he cried,</l>
<l n="887">Majestic champion of Hesperia's name,</l>
<l n="888">'If to be tossed unburied on the deep</l>
<l n="889">Rather than these poor rites thy shade prefer,</l>
<l n="890">'From these mine offices thy mighty soul</l>
<l n="891">Withdraw, Pompeius. Injuries dealt by fate</l>
<l n="892">Command this duty, lest some bird or beast</l>
<l n="893">'Or ocean monster, or fierce Caesar's wrath</l>
<l n="894">'Should venture aught upon thee. Take the fire;</l>
<l n="895">All that thou canst; by Roman hand at least</l>
<l n="896">'Enkindled. And should Fortune grant return</l>
<l n="897">'To loved Hesperia's land, not here shall rest</l>
<l n="898">'Thy sacred ashes; but within an urn</l>
<l n="899">Cornelia, from this humble hand received,</l>
<l n="900">Shall place them. Here upon a meagre stone</l>
<l n="901">We draw the characters to mark thy tomb.</l>
<l n="902">These letters reading may some kindly friend</l>
<l n="903">'Bring back thine head, dissevered, and may grant</l>
<l n="904">'Full funeral honours to thine earthly frame.'</l>
<l n="905">Then did he cherish the enfeebled fire</l>
<l n="906">Till Magnus' body mingled with its flames.</l>
<l n="907">But now the harbinger of coming dawn</l>
<l n="908">Had paled the constellations: he in fear</l>
<l n="909">Seeks for his hiding place. Whom dost thou dread,</l>
<l n="910">Madman, what punishment for such a crime,</l>
<l n="911">For which thy fame by rumour trumpet-tongued</l>
<l n="912">Has been sent down to ages?  Praise is thine</l>
<l n="913">For this thy work, at impious Caesar's hands;</l>
<l n="914">Sure of a pardon, go; confess thy task,</l>
<l n="915">And beg the head dissevered. But his work</l>
<l n="916">Was still unfinished, and with pious hand</l>
<l n="917">(Fearing some foe) he seizes on the bones</l>
<l n="918">Now half consumed, and sinews; and the wave</l>
<l n="919">Pours in upon them, and in shallow trench</l>
<l n="920">Commits them to the earth; and lest some breeze</l>
<l n="921">Might bear away the ashes, or by chance</l>
<l n="922">Some sailor's anchor might disturb the tomb,</l>
<l n="923">A stone he places, and with stick half burned</l>
<l n="924">Traces the sacred name: Here Magnus lies.</l>
<l n="925">And art thou, Fortune, pleased that such a spot</l>
<l n="926">Should be his tomb which even Caesar's self</l>
<l n="927">Had chosen, rather than permit his corse</l>
<l n="928">To rest unburied?  Why, with thoughtless hand</l>
<l n="929">Confine his shade within the narrow bounds</l>
<l n="930">Of this poor sepulchre?  Where the furthest sand</l>
<l n="931">Hangs on the margin of the baffled deep</l>
<l n="932">Cabined he lies; yet where the Roman name</l>
<l n="933">Is known, and Empire, such in truth shall be</l>
<l n="934">The boundless measure of his resting-place.</l>
<l n="935">Blot out this stone, this proof against the gods!</l>

The perfect of men passed after death into a region between our hemisphere and the heavens, where they remained until the day of general conflagration (see Book VII., line 955), with their senses amplified and rendered akin to divine.</note>  and sought the sky</l>
<l n="5">Where dwells the Thunderer.     Black the space of air</l>

<l n="31">Shorn of her guardian his country found</l>

<l n="34">Back to the craven hands that cast them forth.</l>
<l n="35">Nor yet for empire did he wage the war</l>
<l n="36">Nor fearing slavery: nor in arms achieved</l>

<l n="48">Sweeps o'er the yielding wave, by northern breeze</l>
<l n="49">Borne past the Cretan shores. But Phycus dared</l>
<l n="50">Refuse her harbour, and th' avenging hand</l>
<l n="51">Left her in ruins. Thus with gentle airs</l>

<l n="875">Amid these pests undaunted Cato urged</l>
<l n="876">His desert journey on. His hardy troops</l>
<l n="877">Beneath his eyes, pricked by a scanty wound,</l>
<l n="878">In strangest forms of death unnumbered fall.</l>
<l n="879">Tyrrhenian Aulus, bearer of a flag,</l>
<l n="880">Trod on a Dipsas; quick with head reversed</l>
<l n="881">The serpent struck; no mark betrayed the tooth:</l>
<l n="882">The aspect of the wound nor threatened death,</l>
<l n="883">Nor any evil;  but the poison germ</l>
<l n="884">In silence working as consuming fire</l>
<l n="885">Absorbed the moisture of his inward frame,</l>
<l n="886">Draining the natural juices that were spread</l>
<l n="887">Around his vitals; in his arid jaws</l>
<l n="888">Set flame upon his tongue: his wearied limbs</l>
<l n="889">No sweat bedewed; dried up, the fount of tears</l>
<l n="890">Fled from his eyelids. Tortured by the fire</l>
<l n="891">Nor Cato's sternness, nor of his sacred charge</l>
<l n="892">The honour could withhold him; but he dared</l>
<l n="893">To dash his standard down, and through the plains</l>
<l n="894">Raging, to seek for water that might slake</l>
<l n="895">The fatal venom thirsting at his heart.</l>
<l n="896">Plunge him in <placeName key="tgn,1123466">Tanais</placeName>, in <placeName key="tgn,7023890">Rhone</placeName> and Po,</l>
<l n="897">Pour on his burning tongue the flood of <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName>,</l>
<l n="898">Yet were the fire unquenched. So fell the fang</l>
<l n="899">Of Dipsas in the torrid Libyan lands;</l>
<l n="900">In other climes less fatal. Next he seeks</l>
<l n="901">Amid the sands, all barren to the depths,</l>
<l n="902">For moisture: then returning to the shoals</l>
<l n="903">Laps them with greed-in vain-the briny draught</l>
<l n="904">Scarce quenched the thirst it made. Nor knowing yet</l>
<l n="905">The poison in his frame, he steels himself</l>
<l n="906">To rip his swollen veins and drink the gore.</l>
<l n="907">Cato bids lift the standard, lest his troops</l>
<l n="908">May find in thirst a pardon for the deed.</l>
<l n="909">But on Sabellus' yet more piteous death</l>
<l n="910">Their eyes were fastened. Clinging to his skin</l>
<l n="911">A Seps with curving tooth, of little size,</l>
<l n="912">He seized and tore away, and to the sands</l>
<l n="913">Pierced with his javelin. Small the serpent's bulk;</l>
<l n="914">None deals a death more horrible in form.</l>
<l n="915">For swift the flesh dissolving round the wound</l>
<l n="916">Bared the pale bone; swam all his limbs in blood;</l>
<l n="917">Wasted the tissue of his calves and knees:</l>
<l n="918">And all the muscles of his thighs were thawed</l>
<l n="919">In black distilment, and the membrane sheath</l>
<l n="920">Parted, that bound his vitals, which abroad</l>
<l n="921">Flowed upon earth: yet seemed it not that all</l>
<l n="922">His frame was loosed, for by the venomous drop</l>
<l n="923">Were all the bands that held his muscles drawn</l>
<l n="924">Down to a juice; the framework of his chest</l>
<l n="925">Was bare, its cavity, and all the parts</l>
<l n="926">Hid by the organs of life, that make the man.</l>
<l n="927">So by unholy death there stood revealed</l>
<l n="928">His inmost nature. Head and stalwart arms,</l>
<l n="929">And neck and shoulders, from their solid mass</l>
<l n="930">Melt in corruption. Not more swiftly flows</l>
<l n="931">Wax at the sun's command, nor snow compelled</l>
<l n="932">By southern breezes. Yet not all is said:</l>
<l n="933">For so to noxious humours fire consumes</l>
<l n="934">Our fleshly frame; but on the funeral pyre</l>
<l n="935">What bones have perished? These dissolve no less</l>
<l n="936">Than did the mouldered tissues, nor of death</l>
<l n="937">Thus swift is left a trace. Of Afric pests</l>
<l n="938">Thou bear'st the palm for hurtfulness: the life</l>
<l n="939">They snatch away, thou only with the life</l>
<l part="I" n="tr">The clay that held it.</l>
<l part="F" n="tr">Lo! a different fate,</l>
<l n="940">Not this by melting! for a Prester's fang</l>
<l n="941">Nasidius struck, who erst in Marsian fields</l>
<l n="942">Guided the plough. Upon his face there burns</l>
<l n="943">A redness as of flame: swollen the skin,</l>
<l n="944">His features hidden, swollen all his limbs</l>
<l n="945">Till more than human: and his definite frame</l>
<l n="946">One tumour huge conceals. A ghastly gore</l>
<l n="947">Is puffed from inwards as the virulent juice</l>
<l n="948">Courses through all his body; which, thus grown,</l>
<l n="949">His corselet holds not. Not in caldron so</l>
<l n="950">Boils up to mountainous height the steaming wave;</l>
<l n="951">Nor in such bellying curves does canvas bend</l>
<l n="952">To Eastern tempests. Now the ponderous bulk</l>
<l n="953">Rejects the limbs, and as a shapeless trunk</l>
<l n="954">Burdens the earth: and there, to beasts and birds</l>
<l n="955">A fatal feast, his comrades leave the corse;</l>
<l n="956">Nor dare to place, yet swelling, in the tomb.</l>
<l n="957">But for their eyes the Libyan pests prepared</l>
<l n="958">More dreadful sights. On Tullus great in heart,</l>

<l n="963">A sable poison: from the natural pores</l>
<l n="964">Of moisture, gore profuse; his mouth was filled</l>

<l part="F" n="tr">Then piteous Levus next</l>

<l n="973">Lo! Upon branchless trunk a serpent, named</l>

<l n="1201">But day arose, and veiled the nightly lamp</l>
<l n="1202">Ere rode his barks on waters safe from storm.</l>
<l n="1203">Then Caesar saw that tumult held the shore,</l>

<l n="1205">Struck on his ear: and trusting not himself</l>

<l n="1209">Bearing his dreadful gift, Pompeius' head,</l>
<l n="1210">Wrapped in a covering of Pharian wool.</l>

<l n="1220">To mend his fallen fortunes; on our swords</l>
<l n="1221">'Here met his death. With such a pledge of faith</l>
<l n="1222">Here have we bought thee, Caesar; with his blood</l>

<l n="1224">Sought by no bloodshed, take the rule of <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName>,</l>
<l n="1225">Take all that thou wouldst give for Magnus' life:</l>

<l n="1239">Pass condemnation; nor avert his gaze,</l>
<l n="1240">But dwelt upon the features till he knew</l>
<l n="1241">The crime accomplished. Then when truth was sure</l>
<l n="1242">The loving father rose, and tears he shed</l>
<l n="1243">Which flowed at his command, and glad in heart</l>
<l n="1244">Forced from his breast a groan : thus by the flow</l>

<l n="1246">His joy else manifest: and the ghastly boon</l>
<l n="1247">Sent by the king disparaging, professed</l>
<l n="1248">Rather to mourn his son's dissevered head,</l>
<l n="1249">Than count it for a debt. For thee alone,</l>
<l n="1250">Magnus, he durst not fail to find a tear:</l>
<l n="1251">He, Caesar, who with mien unaltered spurned</l>
<l n="1252">The Roman Senate, and with eyes undimmed</l>
<l n="1253">Looked on Pharsalia's field. O fate most hard!</l>
<l n="1254">Didst thou with impious war pursue the man</l>
<l n="1255">Whom 'twas thy lot to mourn?  No kindred ties,</l>
<l n="1256">No memory of thy daughter and her son</l>
<l n="1257">Touch on thy heart?  Didst think perchance that grief</l>
<l n="1258">Might help thy cause 'mid lovers of his name?</l>
<l n="1259">Or haply, moved by envy of the king,</l>
<l n="1260">Griev'st that to other hands than thine was given</l>
<l n="1261">To shed the captive's life-blood?  and complain'st</l>
<l n="1262">Thy vengeance perished and the conquered chief</l>
<l n="1263">Snatched from thy haughty hand? Whate'er the cause</l>
<l n="1264">That urged thy grief, 'twas far removed from love.</l>
<l n="1265">Was this forsooth the object of thy toil</l>
<l n="1266">O'er lands and oceans, that without thy ken</l>
<l n="1267">He should not perish?  Nay! but well was reft</l>
<l n="1268">From thine arbitrament his fate. What crime</l>
<l n="1269">Did cruel Fortune spare, what depth of shame</l>
<l n="1270">To Roman honour! since she suffered not,</l>
<l n="1271">Perfidious traitor, while yet Magnus lived,</l>
<l part="I" n="tr">That thou shouldst pity him!</l>
<l part="F" n="tr">Thus by words he dared</l>
<l n="1272">To gain their credence in his sembled grief:</l>
<l n="1273">Hence from my sight with his detested gift,</l>
<l n="1274">Thou minion, to thy king. Worse does your crime</l>
<l n="1275">Deserve from Caesar than from Magnus' hands.</l>
<l n="1276">The only prize that civil war affords</l>
<l n="1277">Thus have we lost-to bid the conquered live.</l>
<l n="1278">If but the sister of this Pharian king</l>
<l n="1279">Were not by him detested, by the head</l>
<l n="1280">Of Cleopatra had I paid this gift.</l>
<l n="1281">Such were the fit return. Why did he draw</l>
<l n="1282">His separate sword, and in the toil that's ours</l>
<l n="1283">Mingle his weapons?  In Thessalia's field</l>
<l n="1284">Gave we such right to the Pellaean blade?</l>
<l n="1285">Such licence did your mutual kingdom gain?</l>
<l n="1286">Magnus as partner in the rule of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName></l>
<l n="1287">I had not brooked; and shall I tolerate</l>
<l n="1288">Thee, Ptolemaeus?  In vain with civil wars</l>
<l n="1289">Thus have we roused the nations, if there be</l>
<l n="1290">Now any might but Caesar's, if any land</l>
<l n="1291">Yet owns you masters. From your shore I'd turn</l>
<l n="1292">The prows of <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName>;  but fame forbids,</l>
<l n="1293">Lest men should whisper that I did not damn</l>

<l n="1295">Nor think ye to deceive; victorious here</l>
<l n="1296">I stand: else had my welcome at your hands</l>
<l n="1297">Been that of Magnus; and that neck were mine</l>
<l n="1298">But for Pharsalia's chance. At greater risk</l>
<l n="1299">So seems it, than we dreamed of, took we arms;</l>
<l n="1300">Exile, and Magnus' threats, and <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> I knew,</l>

<l n="1302">Pass by the murder. Let the princeling know</l>

<l n="1304">And now in honour of the mighty dead,</l>
<l n="1305">Not merely that the earth may hide your guilt,</l>

<l n="1307">' With proper sepulture appease his shade</l>
<l n="1308">'And place his scattered ashes in an urn.</l>

<l n="1">WHEN Caesar, following those who bore the head,</l>
<l n="2">First trod the shore accursed, with <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>'s fates</l>
<l n="3">His fortunes battled, whether <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> should pass</l>
<l n="4">In crimson conquest o'er the guilty land,</l>
<l n="5">Or <placeName key="tgn,7001186">Memphis</placeName>' arms should ravish from the world</l>
<l n="6">Victor and vanquished: and the warning shade</l>
<l n="7">Of Magnus saved his kinsman from the sword.</l>
<l n="8">By that dread crime assured, his standards borne</l>
<l n="9">Before, he marched upon the Pharian town;</l>
<l n="10">But when the people, jealous of their laws,</l>
<l n="11">Murmured against the fasces, Caesar knew</l>
<l n="12">Their minds were adverse, and that not for him</l>
<l n="13">Was Magnus' murder wrought. And yet with brow</l>
<l n="14">Dissembling fear, intrepid, through the shrines</l>
<l n="15">Of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>'s gods he strode, and round the fane</l>

<l n="18">Yet did nor gold nor ornament restrain</l>

<l n="171">When Juba was his captive. Blind in soul</l>
<l n="172">By madness of ambition, thus to fire</l>
<l n="173">By such profusion of her wealth, the mind</l>
<l n="174">Of Caesar armed, her guest in civil war!</l>
<l n="175">Not though he aimed with pitiless hand to grasp</l>

<l n="179">Or he who, Consul, left in sordid garb</l>

<l n="182">They piled the banquet sought in earth and air</l>

<l n="190">But noble vintage of Falernian growth</l>
<l n="191">Which seasons few in <placeName key="tgn,7000856">Meroe</placeName>'s famous vats</l>
<l n="192">Had mellowed as with age. Upon their brows</l>
<l n="193">Chaplets were placed of roses ever young</l>
<l n="194">With glistening nard entwined; and in their locks</l>
<l n="195">Was cinnamon infused, not yet in air</l>
<l n="196">Its fragrance perished, nor in foreign climes;</l>
<l n="197">And rich amomum from the neighbouring fields.</l>
<l n="198">Thus Caesar learned the booty of a world</l>
<l n="199">To lavish, and his breast was shamed of war</l>
<l n="200">Waged with his son-in-law, from whose defeat</l>
<l n="201">His spoils were meagre, and he longed to find</l>
<l n="202">A cause of battle with the Pharian realm.</l>

<l n="441">' Her spouse: how hope we from so stern a judge</l>

<l n="443">'Those who ne'er sought her favours?  By the deed</l>
<l n="444">We dared together and lost, by Magnus' blood</l>

<l n="461">'Yet have we risen to a height of power</l>
<l n="462">For deeds of blood, and Fortune to our hands</l>

<l n="464">Lies in our compass, and a second death</l>
<l n="465">Hesperia shall appease; for Caesar's blood,</l>
<l n="466">Shed by these hands, shall give us this, that <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName></l>
<l n="467">Shall love us, guilty of Pompeius' fall.</l>
<l n="468">Why fear these titles, why this chieftain's strength?</l>
<l n="469">For shorn of these, before your swords he lies</l>
<l n="470">A common soldier. To the civil war</l>
<l n="471">This night shall bring completion, and shall give</l>
<l n="472">To peoples slain fit offerings, and send</l>
<l n="473">That life the world demands beneath the shades.</l>
<l n="474">Rise then in all your hardihood and smite</l>

<l n="477">No do thou tarry: full of wine and feast</l>
<l n="478">Thou'lt fall upon him in the lists of love;</l>
<l n="479">Then dare the venture, and the heavenly gods</l>
<l n="480">Shall grant of Cato's and of Brutus' prayers</l>
<l part="I" n="tr">To thee fulfilment.'</l>
<l part="F" n="tr">Nor was Achillas slow</l>
<l n="481">To hear the voice that counselled him to crime.</l>
<l n="482">No sounding clarion summoned, as is wont,</l>
<l n="483">His troops to arms;  nor trumpet blare betrayed</l>
<l n="484">Their nightly march: but rapidly he seized</l>
<l n="485">All needed instruments of blood and war.</l>
<l n="486">Of Latian race the most part of his train,</l>
<l n="487">Yet to barbarian customs were their minds</l>
<l n="488">By long forgetfulness of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> debased:</l>
<l n="489">Else had it shamed to serve the Pharian King;</l>
<l n="490">But now his vassal and his minion's word</l>
<l n="491">Compel obedience. Those who serve in camps</l>
<l n="492">Lose faith and love of kin: their pittance earned<note anchored="true">Reading <quote xml:lang="lat">'ibi fas ubi proxima merces,'</quote> with Hosius and Francken.</note></l>
<l n="493">Makes just the deed: and for their sordid pay,</l>
<l n="494">Not for themselves, they threaten Caesar's life.</l>
<l n="495">Where finds the piteous destiny of the realm</l>
<l n="496"><placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> with herself at peace?  The host withdrawn</l>
<l n="497">From dread <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessalia</placeName> raves on Nilus' banks</l>
<l n="498">As all the race of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. What more had dared,</l>
<l n="499">With Magnus welcomed, the Lagean house?</l>
<l n="500">Each hand must render to the gods their due,</l>
<l n="501">Nor son of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> may cease from civil war;</l>
<l n="502">By Heaven's command our state was rent in twain;</l>
<l n="503">Nor love for husband nor regard for sire</l>
<l n="504">Parted our peoples. 'Twas a slave who stirred</l>
<l n="505">Afresh the conflict, and Achillas grasped</l>
<l n="506">In turn the sword of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>: nay more, had won,</l>
<l n="507">Had not the fates adverse restrained his hand</l>
<l part="I" n="tr">From Caesar's slaughter.</l>
<l part="F" n="tr">For the murderous pair</l>
<l n="508">Ripe for their plot were met; the spacious hall</l>
<l n="509">Still busied with the feast. So might have flowed</l>
<l n="510">Into the kingly cups a stream of gore,</l>
<l n="511">And in mid banquet fallen Caesar's head.</l>
<l n="512">Yet did they fear lest in the nightly strife</l>
<l n="513">(The fates permitting) some incautious hand-</l>
<l n="514">So did they trust the sword-might slay the King.</l>
<l n="515">Thus stayed the deed, for in the minds of slaves</l>
<l n="516">The chance of doing Caesar to the death</l>
<l n="517">Might bear postponement: when the day arose</l>
<l n="518">Then should he suffer;  and a night of life</l>
<l n="519">Thus by Pothinus was to Caesar given.
<milestone n="434" unit="card"/></l>
<l n="520">Now from the Casian rock looked forth the Sun</l>
<l n="521">Flooding the land of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> with a day</l>
<l n="522">Warm from its earliest dawn, when from the walls</l>
<l n="523">Not wandering in disorder are they seen,</l>
<l n="524">But drawn in close array, as though to meet</l>
<l n="525">A foe opposing; ready to receive</l>
<l n="526">Or give the battle. Caesar, in the town</l>
<l n="527">Placing no trust, within the palace courts</l>
<l n="528">Lay in ignoble hiding place, the gates</l>
<l n="529">Close barred : nor all the kingly rooms possessed,</l>
<l n="530">But in the narrowest portion of the space</l>
<l n="531">He drew his band together. There in arms</l>
<l n="532">They stood, with dread and fury in their souls.</l>
<l n="533">He feared attack, indignant at his fear.</l>
<l n="534">Thus will a noble beast in little cage</l>
<l n="535">Imprisoned, fume, and break upon the bars</l>
<l n="536">His teeth in frenzied wrath; nor more would rage</l>
<l n="537">The flames of <placeName key="tgn,1050339">Vulcan</placeName> in Sicilian depths</l>
<l n="538">Should <placeName key="tgn,7003867">Etna</placeName>'s top be closed. He who but now</l>
<l n="539">By <placeName key="tgn,7011635">Haemus</placeName>' mount against Pompeius chief,</l>
<l n="540"><placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italia</placeName>'s leaders and the Senate line,</l>
<l n="541">His cause forbidding hope, looked at the fates</l>
<l n="542">He knew were hostile, with unfaltering gaze,</l>
<l n="543">Now fears before the crime of hireling slaves,</l>
<l n="544">And in mid palace trembles at the blow:</l>
<l n="545">He whom nor Scythian nor Alaun had dared</l>
<l n="546">To violate, nor the Moor who aims the dart</l>
<l n="547">Upon his victim slain, to prove his skill.</l>
<l n="548">The Roman world but now did not suffice</l>
<l n="549">To hold him, nor the realms from furthest Ind</l>
<l n="550">To Tyrian Gades. Now, as puny boy,</l>
<l n="551">Or woman, trembling when a town is sacked,</l>
<l n="552">Within the narrow corners of a house</l>
<l n="553">He seeks for safety; on the portals closed</l>
<l n="554">His hope of life: and with uncertain gait</l>
<l n="555">He treads the halls; yet not without the King;</l>
<l n="556">In purpose, Ptolemaeus, that thy life</l>
<l n="557">For his shall give atonement; and to hurl</l>
<l n="558">Thy severed head among the servant throng</l>
<l n="559">Should darts and torches fail. So story tells</l>
<l n="560">The Colchian princess <note anchored="true">Medea, who fled from <placeName key="tgn,7016642">Colchis</placeName> with her brother, Absyrtus. Pursued by her father AEetes, she killed her brother and strewed the parts of his body into the sea. The king paused to collect them.</note>  with sword in hand,</l>
<l n="561">And with her brother's neck bared to the blow,</l>
<l n="562">Waited her sire, avenger of his realm</l>
<l n="563">Despoiled, and of her flight. In the imminent risk</l>
<l n="564">Caesar, in hopes of peace, an envoy sent</l>
<l n="565">To the fierce vassals, from their absent lord</l>
<l n="566">Bearing a message, thus : ' At whose command</l>
<l n="567">Wage ye the war?' But not the laws which bind</l>
<l n="568">All nations upon earth, nor sacred rights,</l>
<l n="569">Availed to save or messenger of peace,</l>
<l n="570">Or King's ambassador; or thee from crime</l>
<l n="571">Such as befitted thee, thou land of <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></l>
<l n="572">Fruitful in monstrous deeds: not Juba's realm,</l>
<l n="573">Vast though it be, nor <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>, nor the land</l>
<l n="574">Thessalian, nor the arms of Pharnaces,</l>
<l n="575">Nor yet the tracts which chill <placeName key="tgn,7007649">Iberus</placeName> girds,</l>
<l n="576">Nor Libyan coasts such wickedness have dared,</l>
<l n="577">As thou, and all thy minions. Closer now</l>
<l n="578">War hemmed them in, and weapons in the courts,</l>
<l n="579">Shaking the innermost recesses, fell.</l>
<l n="580">Yet did no ram, fatal with single stroke,</l>
<l n="581">Assail the portal, nor machine of war;</l>
<l n="582">Nor flame they called in aid; but blind of plan</l>
<l n="583">They wander purposeless, in separate bands</l>
<l n="584">Around the circuit, nor at any spot</l>
<l n="585">With strength combined attempt to breach the wall.</l>
<l n="586">The fates forbad, and Fortune from their hands</l>
<l n="587">Held fast the palace as a battlement.</l>
<l n="588">Nor failed they to attack from ships of war</l>
<l n="589">The regal dwelling, where its frontage bold</l>
<l n="590">Made stand apart the waters of the deep :</l>
<l n="591">There, too, was Caesar's all-protecting arm;</l>
<l n="592">For these at point of sword, and those with fire</l>
<l n="593">He forces back, and though besieged he dares</l>
<l n="594">To storm th' assailants: and as lay the ships</l>
<l n="595">Joined rank to rank, bids drop upon their sides</l>
<l n="596">Lamps drenched with reeking tar. Nor slow the fire</l>
<l n="597">To seize the hempen cables and the decks</l>
<l n="598">Oozing with melting pitch; the oarsman's bench</l>
<l n="599">All in one moment, and the topmost yards</l>
<l n="600">Burst into flame: half merged the vessels lay</l>
<l n="601">While swam the foemen, all in arms, the wave;</l>
<l n="602">Nor fell the blaze upon the ships alone,</l>
<l n="603">But seized with writhing tongues the neighbouring homes,<note anchored="true">It was in this conflagration that a large part of the library of the Ptolemies was destroyed. 400,000 volumes are stated to have perished.</note></l>
<l n="604">And fanned to fury by the Southern breeze</l>
<l n="605">Tempestuous, it leaped from roof to roof;</l>
<l n="606">Not otherwise than on its heavenly track,</l>
<l n="607">Unfed by matter, glides the ball of light,</l>
<l part="I" n="tr">By air alone aflame.</l>
<l part="F" n="tr">This pest recalled</l>
<l n="608">Some of the forces to the city's aid</l>
<l n="609">From the besieged halls. Nor Caesar gave</l>
<l n="610">To sleep its season; swifter than all else</l>
<l n="611">To seize the crucial moment of the war.</l>
<l n="612">Quick in the darkest watches of the night</l>
<l n="613">He leaped upon his ships, and Pharos <note anchored="true">The island of Pharos, which lay over against the port of <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>, had been connected with the mainland in the middle by a narrow causeway. On it stood the lighthouse. (See Book IX., 1192.) Proteus, the old man of the sea, kept here his flock of seals, according to the Homeric story. ('Odyssey,' Book IV., 400.)</note>  seized,</l>
<l n="614">Gate of the main; an island in the days</l>
<l n="615">Of Proteus seer, now bordering the walls</l>
<l n="616">Of Alexander's city. Thus he gained</l>
<l n="617">A double vantage, for his foes were pent</l>
<l n="618">Within the narrow entrance, which for him</l>
<l n="619">And for his aids gave access to the sea.</l>
<l n="620">Nor longer was Pothinus' doom delayed,</l>
<l n="621">Yet not with cross or flame, nor with the wrath</l>
<l n="622">His crime demanded; nor by savage beasts</l>
<l n="623">Torn, did he suffer; but by Magnus' death,</l>
<l n="624">Alas the shame! he fell; his head by sword</l>
<l n="625">Hacked from his shoulders. Next by frauds prepared</l>
<l n="626">By Ganymede her base attendant, fled</l>
<l n="627"><placeName key="tgn,7016892">Arsinoe</placeName><note anchored="true">Younger sister of Cleopatra.</note>   from the Court to Caesar's foes;</l>
<l n="628">There in the absence of the King she ruled</l>
<l n="629">As of Lagean blood: there at her hands,</l>
<l n="630">The savage minion of the tyrant boy,</l>
<l n="631">Achillas, fell by just avenging sword.</l>
<l n="632">Thus did another victim to thy shade</l>
<l n="633">Atone, Pompeius; but the gods forbid</l>
<l n="634">That this be all thy vengeance! Not the King</l>
<l n="635">Nor all the stock of <placeName key="tgn,7000497">Lagos</placeName> for thy death</l>
<l n="636">Would make fit sacrifice! So Fortune deemed;</l>
<l n="637">And not till patriot swords shall drink the blood</l>
<l n="638">Of Caesar, Magnus, shalt thou be appeased.</l>
<l n="639">Still, though was slain the author of the strife,</l>
<l n="640">Sank not their rage: with Ganymede for chief</l>
<l n="641">Again they rush to arms; in deeds of fight</l>
<l n="642">Again they conquer. So might that one day</l>
<l n="643">Have witnessed Caesar's fate; so might its fame</l>
<l part="I" n="tr">Have lived through ages.</l>
<l part="F" n="tr">As the Roman Chief,</l>
<l n="644">Crushed on the narrow surface of the mole,</l>
<l n="645">Prepared to throw his troops upon the ships,</l>
<l n="646">Sudden upon him the surrounding foes</l>
<l n="647">With all their terrors came. In dense array</l>
<l n="648">Their navy lined the shores, while on the rear</l>
<l n="649">The footmen ceaseless charged. No hope was left,</l>
<l n="650">For flight was not, nor could the brave man's arm</l>
<l n="651">Achieve or safety or a glorious death.</l>
<l n="652">Not now were needed for great Caesar's fall,</l>
<l n="653">Caught in the toils of nature, routed host</l>
<l n="654">Or mighty heaps of slain: his only doubt</l>
<l n="655">To fear or hope for death: while on his brain</l>
<l n="656">Brave Scaeva's image flashed, now vainly sought,</l>
<l n="657">Who on the wall by <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Epidamnus</placeName>' fields</l>
<l n="658">Earned fame immortal, and with single arm</l>
<l n="659">Drove back Pompeius as he trod the breach.</l></div>
