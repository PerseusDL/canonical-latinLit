Probably the five years known as the Golden Era of Nero had passed when they were written: yet the text itself does not aid such a suggestion; and the view generally taken, namely that Lucan was in earnest, appears preferable. There were many who dreamed at the time that the disasters of the Civil War were being compensated by the wealth and prosperity of the empire under Nero; and the assurance of universal peace, then almost realised, which is expressed in lines 69-71, seems inconsistent with the idea that this passage was written in irony. Lecky ('European Morals from Augustus to Charlemagne,' vol. i. p. 240) describes these latter verses as written 'with all the fervour of a <placeName key="tgn,2000780">Christian</placeName> poet.' See also Merivale's ' Roman Empire,'chapter liv.</note>

Dean Merivale remarks (chapter li.) on this passage, that in the despair of another life which pervaded Paganism at the time, the Roman was exasperated at the Druids' assertion of the transmigration ofsouls. But the passage seems also to betray a lingering suspicion that the doctrine may in some shape be true, however horrible were the rites and sacrifices. The reality of a future life was a part of Lucan's belief, as a state of reward for heroes. (See the passage at the beginning of Book IX.)  But all was vague and uncertain, and he appears to have viewed the Druidical transmigration rather with doubt and unbelief, as a possible form of future or recurring life, than with scorn as an absurdity.</note>  when the war was done,</l>

                  <l n="tr">And marched upon the waters, wind and storm</l>

                  <l n="tr">Thus spake to Fortune: ' Thou whose high decree</l>

                  <l n="tr">Came from the ocean, as the countless keels</l>
                  <l n="tr">Furrowed the waters, and with ceaseless splash</l>
                  <l n="tr">The parted billows rose again and fell.</l>
                  <l n="tr">Then were the gates thrown wide; for with the fates</l>
                  <l n="tr">The city turned to Caesar: and the foe,</l>
                  <l n="tr">Seizing the town, rushed onward by the pier</l>
                  <l n="tr">That circled in the harbour; then they knew</l>
                  <l n="tr">With shame and sorrow that the fleet was gone</l>

Herodotus (7, 60) says the men were numbered in ten thousands by being packed close together and having a circle drawn round them. After the first ten thousand had been so measured a fence was put where the circle had been, and the subsequent ten thousands were driven into the enclosure. It is not unlikely that they piled their weapons before being so measured, and Lucan's account would then be made to agree with that of Herodotus.  Francken, on the other hand, quotes a Scholiast, who says that each hundredth man shot off an arrow. See Mr. J. A. R. Munro's paper in vol. xxii. of the Hellenic Society's publications, at p. 296.</note>

                  <l n="tr">Transfixed his body. At the double stroke</l>
                  <l n="tr">Wide yawns his chest; blood issues from his mouth</l>
                  <l n="tr">With flesh commingled; and the brazen beaks</l>

                  <l n="tr">Hacked off their straining arms; then maimed they sank</l>
                  <l n="tr">Below the seething waves, to rise no more.</l>
                  <l n="tr">Now every dart was hurled and every spear,</l>

                  <l n="tr">But deadlier yet</l>

                  <l n="tr">That brings immediate dying: yet quail not</l>

                  <l n="tr">Essay the feeble stroke; and should that hope</l>
                  <l n="tr">Still fail their hand, they call the sea to aid</l>
                  <l n="tr">And seizing in their grasp some floating foe</l>
                  <l n="tr">Drag him to mutual death.   But on that day</l>
                  <l n="tr">Phoceus above all others proved his skill.</l>
                  <l n="tr">Well trained was he to dive beneath the main</l>
                  <l n="tr">And search the waters with unfailing eye;</l>

                  <l n="tr">Oft in his fatal grasp he seized a foe</l>
                  <l n="tr">Nor loosed his grip until the life was gone.</l>
                  <l n="tr">Such was his frequent deed; but this his fate:</l>
                  <l n="tr">For rising, victor (as he thought), to air,</l>
                  <l n="tr">Full on a keel he struck and found his death.</l>
                  <l n="tr">Some, drowning, seized a hostile oar and checked</l>
                  <l n="tr">The flying vessel; not to die in vain,</l>
                  <l n="tr">Their single care; some on their vessel's side</l>
                  <l n="tr">Hanging, in death, with wounded frame essayed</l>
                  <l n="tr">To check the charging prow.   Tyrrhenus high</l>
                  <l n="tr">Upon the bulwarks of his ship was struck</l>

                  <l n="tr">Of Lygdamus; straight through his temples passed</l>
                  <l n="tr">The fated missile; and in streams of blood</l>
                  <l n="tr">Forced from their seats his trembling eyeballs fell.</l>
                  <l n="tr">Plunged in a darkness as of night, he thought</l>
                  <l n="tr">That life had left him; yet ere long he knew</l>
                  <l n="tr">The living vigour of his limbs; and cried,</l>
                  <l n="tr">'Place me, O friends, as some machine of war</l>
                  <l n="tr">Straight facing towards the foe; then shall my darts</l>
                  <l n="tr">Strike as of old; and thou, Tyrrhenus, spend</l>
                  <l n="tr">Thy latest breath, still left, upon the fight:</l>
                  <l n="tr">So shalt thou play, not wholly dead, the part</l>
                  <l n="tr">That fits a soldier, and the spear that strikes</l>
                  <l n="tr">Thy frame, shall miss the living.' Thus he spake,</l>
                  <l n="tr">And hurled his javelin, blind, but not in vain;</l>
                  <l n="tr">For Argus, generous youth of noble blood,</l>
                  <l n="tr">Below the middle waist received the spear</l>
                  <l n="tr">And falling drave it home. His aged sire</l>
                  <l n="tr">From furthest portion of the conquered ship</l>
                  <l n="tr">Beheld; than whom in pride of manhood none</l>
                  <l n="tr">More brave in battle: now no more he fought,</l>
                  <l n="tr">Yet did the memory of his prowess stir</l>
                  <l n="tr">Phocaean youths to emulate his fame.</l>
                  <l n="tr">Oft stumbling o'er the benches the old man hastes</l>
                  <l n="tr">To reach his boy, and finds him breathing still.</l>
                  <l n="tr">No tear bedewed his cheek; upon his breast</l>
                  <l n="tr">No blow he struck;  but all his frame was stiff,</l>
                  <l n="tr">His hands outspread : and o'er his eyes there fell</l>
                  <l n="tr">A dark impenetrable veil of mist</l>
                  <l n="tr">That blotted out the day; nor could he more</l>
                  <l n="tr">Discern his luckless Argus. He, who saw</l>
                  <l n="tr">His parent, raising up his drooping head</l>
                  <l n="tr">With parted lips and silent features asks</l>
                  <l n="tr">A father's latest kiss, a father's hand</l>
                  <l n="tr">To close his dying eyes. But soon his sire,</l>
                  <l n="tr">Recovering from his swoon, when ruthless grief</l>
                  <l n="tr">Possessed his spirit, 'This short space,' he cried,</l>
                  <l n="tr">' I lose not, which the cruel gods have given,</l>

                  <l n="tr">Not yet has passed thy life blood from the wound</l>

                  </l>

                  <l n="tr">The reeking sword and drave it to the hilt,</l>
                  <l n="tr">Then plunged into the deep, with headlong bound,</l>
                  <l n="tr">To anticipate his son: for this he feared</l>
                  <l n="tr">A single form of death should not suffice.</l>
                  <l n="tr">Now gave the fates their judgment, and in doubt</l>
                  <l n="tr">No longer was the war: the Grecian fleet</l>
                  <l n="tr">In most part sunk; -some ships by Romans oared</l>
                  <l n="tr">Conveyed the victors home: in headlong flight</l>

He was of profligate character, but a friend and pupil of Cicero;  at first a rabid partisan of the oligarchy, he had, about the period of his tribuneship (B.C. <date from-iso="-0050" to-iso="-0049">50-49</date>), become a supporter of Caesar.  How far Gaulish gold was the cause of this conversion we cannot tell. It is in allusion to this change that he was termed the prime mover of the civil war. His arrival in Caesar's camp is described in Book I., line 306.  He became Caesar's chief lieutenant in place of the deserter Labienus;  and, as described in Book III., was sent to <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, whence he expelled the senatorial forces. His final expedition to <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, defeat, and death, form the subject of the latter part of this book. Mommsen describes him as a man of talent, and finds a resemblance between him and Caesar.  (Vol. iv., p. 393.)</note>

Dean Merivale thinks the story may have been invented to introduce the apophthegm used by Caesar to the sailor, 'Fear nothing: you carry Caesar and his fortunes' (line 665 post). Mommsen accepts the story, as of an attempt which was only abandoned because no mariner could be induced to undertake it. Lucan colours it with his wildest and most exaggerated hyperbole.</note>

                  <l n="tr">More gently struck on hearts inured to grief.</l>
                  <l n="tr">Borne to the shore with failing limbs she fell</l>
                  <l n="tr">And grasped the sands, embracing, till at last</l>
                  <l n="tr">Her maidens placed her senseless in the ship.</l>
                  <l n="tr">Not in such grief she left her country's shores</l>

                  <l n="tr">Then first what means a widowed couch she knew,</l>
                  <l n="tr">Its cold, its solitude. When slumber found</l>
                  <l n="tr">Her eyelids, and forgetfulness her soul,</l>
                  <l n="tr">Seeking with outstretched arms the form beloved,</l>
                  <l n="tr">She grasps but air. Though tossed by restless love,</l>
                  <l n="tr">She leaves a place beside her as for him</l>
                  <l n="tr">Returning. Yet she feared Pompeius lost</l>
                  <l n="tr">To her for ever. Nay! such happy lot</l>
                  <l n="tr">The gods prepared not; for the hour drew near</l>
                  <l n="tr">Which gave her Magnus to her arms again.

                  <l n="tr">Let steel-shod ram or catapult remove</l>
                  <l n="tr">This champion of the gate. No fragile wall</l>
                  <l n="tr">Stands here for Caesar, blocking with its bulk</l>
                  <l n="tr">Pompeius' way to freedom. Now he trusts</l>
                  <l n="tr">His shield no more, lest his sinister hand,</l>
                  <l n="tr">Idle, give life by shame; and on his breast</l>
                  <l n="tr">Bearing a forest of spears, though spent with toil</l>
                  <l n="tr">And worn with onset, falls upon his foe</l>
                  <l n="tr">And braves alone the wounds of all the war.</l>
                  <l n="tr">Thus may an elephant in Afric wastes,</l>

                  <l n="tr">To reach the fount of blood. Unnumbered wounds</l>

                  <l n="tr">This single warrior. But lo! from far</l>
                  <l n="tr">A Cretan archer's shaft, more sure of aim</l>
                  <l n="tr">Than vows could hope for, strikes on Scaeva's brow</l>
                  <l n="tr">To light within his eye: the hero tugs</l>
                  <l n="tr">Intrepid, bursts the nerves, and tears the shaft</l>
                  <l n="tr">Forth with the eyeball, and with dauntless heel</l>
                  <l n="tr">Treads them to dust. Not otherwise a bear</l>
                  <l n="tr">Pannonian, fiercer for the wound received,</l>

                  <l n="tr">Turns circling on her wound, and still pursues</l>
                  <l n="tr">The weapon fleeing as she whirls around.</l>
                  <l n="tr">Thus, in his rage destroyed, his shapeless face</l>
                  <l n="tr">Stood foul with crimson flow. The victors' shout</l>
                  <l n="tr">Glad to the sky arose; no greater joy</l>

                  <l n="tr">That Caesar's self was wounded. Down he pressed</l>
                  <l n="tr">Deep in his soul the anguish, and, with mien</l>
                  <l n="tr">No longer bent on fight, submissive cried,</l>
                  <l n="tr">Spare me, ye citizens; remove the war</l>
                  <l n="tr">Far hence: no weapons now can haste my death;</l>
                  <l n="tr">Draw from my breast the darts, but add no more.</l>
                  <l n="tr">Yet raise me up to place me in the camp</l>
                  <l n="tr">Of Magnus, living: this your gift to him;</l>
                  <l n="tr">No brave man's death my title to renown,</l>
                  <l n="tr">But Caesar's flag deserted.' So he spake.</l>
                  <l n="tr">Unhappy Aulus thought his words were true,</l>
                  <l n="tr">Nor saw within his hand the ready sword;</l>
                  <l n="tr">And leaping forth in haste to make his own</l>
                  <l n="tr">The prisoner and his arms, in middle throat</l>
                  <l n="tr">Received the lightning blade. By this one death</l>
                  <l n="tr">Rose Scaeva's valour again; and thus he cried,</l>
                  <l n="tr">Such be the punishment of all who thought</l>
                  <l n="tr">Great Scaeva vanquished; if Pompeius seeks</l>
                  <l n="tr">Peace from this reeking sword, low let him lay</l>
                  <l n="tr">' At Caesar's feet his standards. Me do ye think</l>
                  <l n="tr">' Such as yourselves, and slow to meet the fates?</l>
                  <l n="tr">'Your love for Magnus and the Senate's cause</l>
                  <l n="tr">'Is less than mine for death.' These were his words;</l>
                  <l n="tr">And dust in columns proved that Caesar came.</l>
                  <l n="tr">Thus was Pompeius' glory spared the stain</l>
                  <l n="tr">Of flight compelled by Scava. He, when ceased</l>
                  <l n="tr">The battle, fell, no more by rage of fight,</l>
                  <l n="tr">Or sight of blood out-pouring from his wounds,</l>
                  <l n="tr">Roused to the combat. Fainting there he lay</l>

                  <l n="tr">Plucked forth the gory shafts and took his arms</l>
                  <l n="tr">To deck the gods and shield the breast of Mars.</l>
