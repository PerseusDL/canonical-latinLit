<p>If a painter<note anchored="yes" n="1" resp="Hurd"><p>All that our poet says here may be referred, in general, to three heads, the fable, the manners, and the diction. We should take notice that this piece particularly regards epic and dramatic poetry, and that our author only occasionally mentions any other kind. The most important precept for the composition of a poem is unity and simplicity of design. There should be only one action, to which all the incidents ought to refer; and this point of perfection, every regular work requires. To show the necessity of this rule, Horace compares an irregular poem to pictures formed by a wild assortment of many parts entirely unlike each other. Every part, considered in itself, may have its proper, natural perfection, while their union produces nothing but what is monstrous and ridiculous. FRAN. The critic's rules must be taken either, 1. from the general standing laws of composition; or, 2. from the peculiar ones, appropriated to the kind. Now the direction to be fetched from the former of these sources will of course precede, as well on account of its superior dignity, as that the mind itself delights to descend from universals to the consideration of particulars. Agreeably to this rule of nature, the poet, having to correct, in the Roman drama, these three points, 1. a misconduct in the disposition; 2. an abuse of language; and, 3. a disregard of the peculiar characters and colorings of its different species, hath chosen to do this on principles of universal nature; which, while they include the case of the drama, at the same time extend to poetic composition at large. These prefatory, universal observations being delivered, he then proceeds, with advantage, to the second source of this art, viz., the consideration of the laws and rules peculiar to the kind.</p></note> should wish to unite a horse's neck to a human head, and spread a variety of plumage over limbs [of different animals] taken from every part [of nature],<note anchored="yes" n="2" resp="TAB"><p>But Orelli more rightly treats <cit><quote lang="la">collatis membris</quote><bibl n="Hor. Ars 3">Hor. Ars 3</bibl></cit> as the ablative absolute.</p></note> so that what is a beautiful woman in the upper part terminates unsightly in an ugly fish below; could you, my friends, refrain from laughter, were you admitted to such a sight  Believe, ye Pisos, the book will be perfectly like such a picture, the ideas of which, like a sick man's dreams, are all vain and fictitious: so that neither head nor foot can correspond to any one form. "Poets and painters [you will say] have ever had equal authority for attempting any thing." We are conscious of this, and this privilege we demand and allow in turn: but not to such a degree, that the tame should associate with the savage; nor that serpents should be coupled with birds, lambs with tigers.
</p>
<p>In pompous introductions,<note anchored="yes" n="3" resp="Hurd"><p>These preparatory observations, concerning the laws of poetic composition at large, have been thought to glance more particularly at the epic poetry which was not improper: for, 1. the drama which he was about to criticise, had its rise and origin from the <foreign lang="xgreek">epos</foreign>. Thus we are told by the great critic, that Homer was the first who invented dramatic imitations <quote lang="greek">mo/nos &mdash; o(/ti mimh/seis dramatika\s e)poi/hse</quote>. 2. The several censures, here pointed at the epic, would bear still more directly against the tragic poem; it being more glaringly inconsistent with the genius of the drama to admit of foreign and digressive ornaments, than of the extended, episodical <foreign lang="xgreek">epopaeia</foreign>. For both these reasons, it was altogether pertinent to the poet's purpose, in a criticism on the drama, to expose the vicious practice of the epic models. Though, to preserve the unity of his piece, and for a further reason (see note on v. 1), he hath artfully done this under the cover of general criticism.</p></note> and such as promise a great deal, it generally happens that one or two verses of purple patch-work, that may make a great show, are tagged on; as when the grove and the altar of Diana and the meandering of a current hastening through pleasant fields, or the river <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName>, or the rainbow is described. But here there was no room for these [fine things]: perhaps, too, you know how to draw a cypress:<note anchored="yes" n="4" resp="Fran"><p>Boughs of cypress were carried in funeral processions, and placed before the houses of the great, upon particular occasions of sorrow, <cit><quote lang="la">Et non plebeios luctus testata cupressus.</quote> <bibl>Lucan.</bibl></cit> From hence, perhaps, this tree was usually drawn in votive tablets; in pictures carried by beggars, to excite charity; and in those used by lawyers in courts of justice, to raise the compassion of the judges, by representing the distresses of their clients. A painter might, by frequent practice, excel in drawing a tree for which there was such demand; and he therefore absurdly determines to show his skill upon all occasions, even by painting it in the middle of the ocean, and making it overshadow the storm. The commentators understand this passage in a different manner.</p></note> but what is that to the purpose, if he, who is painted for the given price, is [to be represented as] swimming hopeless out of a shipwreck? A large vase at first was designed: why, as the wheel revolves, turns out a little pitcher? In a word, be your subject what it will, let it be merely simple and uniform.
</p>
<p>The great majority of us poets, father, and youths worthy such a father, are misled by the appearance of right. I labor to be concise, I become obscure: nerves and spirit fail him, that aims at the easy: one, that pretends to be sublime, proves bombastical: he who is too cautious and fearful of the storm, crawls along the ground: he who wants to vary his subject in a marvelous manner,
<note anchored="yes" n="5" resp="Hurd"><p>The word <foreign lang="la">prodigialiter</foreign> apparently refers to that fictitious monster, under which the poet allusively shadows out the idea of absurd and inconsistent composition. The application, however, differs in this, that, whereas the monster, there painted, was intended to expose the extravagance of putting together incongruous parts, without any reference to a whole, this prodigy is designed to characterize a whole, but deformed by the ill-judged position of its parts. The former is like a monster, whose several members as of right belonging to different animals, could by no disposition be made to constitute one consistent animal. The other, like a landscape which hath no objects absolutely irrelative, or irreducible to a whole, but which a wrong position of the parts only renders prodigious. Send the boar to the woods, and the dolphin to the waves; and the painter might show them both on the same canvas.</p>
<p>Each is a violation of the law of unity, and a real monster: the one, because it contains an assemblage of natural incoherent parts; the other, because its parts, though in themselves coherent, are misplaced and disjointed.</p></note> paints the dolphin in the woods, the boar in the sea.  The avoiding of an error leads to a fault, if it lack skill.</p>
<p>A statuary about the Aemilian school shall of himself, with singular skill,<note anchored="yes" n="6" resp="Orelli"><p><quote lang="la">Unus</quote> = <foreign lang="la">praeter caeteros</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">melius quam reliqui omnes</foreign>.</p></note> both express the nails, and imitate in brass the flexible hair; unhappy yet in the main, because he knows not how to finish a complete piece. I would no more choose to be such a one as this, had I a mind to compose any thing, than to live with a distorted nose, [though] remarkable for black eyes and jetty hair.</p>
<p>Ye who write, make choice of a subject suitable to your abilities; and revolve in your thoughts a considerable time what your strength<note anchored="yes" n="7" resp="TAB"><p>Literally, "shoulders," a phrase derived from wrestlers. The reading before <placeName key="tgn,7010699">Bentley</placeName> was <foreign lang="la">imus</foreign>. </p></note> declines, and what it is able to support. Neither elegance of style, nor a perspicuous disposition, shall desert the man, by whom the subject matter is chosen judiciously.
</p>
<p>This, or I am mistaken, will constitute the merit and beauty of arrangement, that the poet just now say what ought just now to be said, put off most of his thoughts, and waive them for the present.

</p></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="44">
<p>In the choice of his words, too, the author of the projected poem must be delicate and cautious, he must embrace one and reject another: you will express yourself eminently well, if a dexterous combination should give an air of novelty to a well-known word. If it happen to be necessary to explain some abstruse subjects by new invented terms; it will follow that you must frame words never heard of by the old-fashioned<note anchored="yes" n="8" resp="McCaul"><p><cit><quote lang="la">Cinctutis.</quote><bibl n="Hor. Ars 50">Hor. Ars 50</bibl></cit> Having the tunic tightened by the cinctus, or wearing the cinctus instead of the tunic, as appears to have been the custom of the ancient Romans. This was a vest which passed round the waist, and extended down to the feet. That it was an ancient vesture may appear from its being used by the Luperci. Comp. <bibl n="Ov. Fast. 5.101">Ovid. Fast. v. 101</bibl>. As it did not embarrass the motion of the arms, even after the tunic became part of the dress, it was sometimes substituted for it by those who had occasion to use much bodily exertion. Hence <foreign lang="la">cinctutis</foreign> is supposed by some to have a meaning here similar to that of <foreign lang="la">succinctus</foreign>, "active, industrious." Others explain the word as referring to that arrangement of the toga called <foreign lang="la">cinctus Gabinus.</foreign></p></note> Cethegi: and the license will be granted, if modestly used: and new and lately-formed words will have authority, if they descend from a Greek source, with a slight deviation. But why should the Romans grant to Plautus and Caecilius a privilege denied to Virgil and Varius? Why should I be envied, if I have it in my power to acquire a few words, when the language of Cato and Ennius has enriched our native tongue, and produced new names of things It has been, and ever will be, allowable to coin a word marked with the stamp in present request. As leaves in the woods are changed with the fleeting years; the earliest fall off first: in this manner words perish with old age, and those lately invented flourish and thrive, like men in the time of youth. We, and our works, are doomed to death: whether Neptune,<note anchored="yes" n="9" resp="San"><p>Agrippa opened a communication between the Lucrine and Avernian Lakes in 717, and built a magnificent haven there, which he named Portius Julius, in honor of Augustus, who was at that time only called Julius Octavianus.</p></note> admitted into the continent, defends our fleet from the north winds, a kingly work; or the lake, for a long time unfertile and fit for oars, now maintains its neighboring cities and feels the heavy plow; or the river, taught to run in a more convenient channel, has changed its course which was so destructive<note anchored="yes" n="10" resp="TAB"><p>The Scholiast informs us, that Agrippa opened a canal to receive the waters of the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>, which had overflowed the country.</p></note> to the fruits. Mortal works must perish: much less can the honor and elegance of language be long-lived. Many words shall revive,<note anchored="yes" n="11" resp="Hurd"><p>This revival of old words is one of those niceties in composition, not to be attempted by any but great masters. It may be done two ways: 1. by restoring such terms as are grown entirely obsolete; or 2. by selecting out of those which have still a currency, and are not quite laid aside, such as are most forcible and expressive. These choice words, among such as are still in use, I take to be those which are employed by the old writers in some peculiarly strong and energetic sense, yet so as with good advantage to be copied by the moderns, without appearing barbarous or affected. (See <bibl n="Hor. Ep. 2.2.115">Hor. lib. ii. ep. ii. v. 115.</bibl>) The other use of old terms, i. e. when become obsolete, he says, must be made parce, more sparingly.</p></note> which now have fallen off; and many which are now in esteem shall fall off, if it be the will of custom, in whose power is the decision and right and standard of language.

<p>Homer has instructed us in what measure the achievements<note anchored="yes" n="12" resp="Hurd"><p>The purport of these lines (from v. 73 to 86), and their connection with what follows, hath not been fully seen. They would express this general proposition, "That the several kinds of poetry essentially differ from each other, as may be gathered, not solely from their different subjects, but their different measures; which good sense, and an attention to the peculiar natures of each, instructed the great inventors and masters of them to employ." The use made of this proposition is to infer, "That therefore the like attention should be had to the different species of the same kind of poetry (v. 89, etc.), as in the case of tragedy and comedy (to which the application is made), whose peculiar differences and correspondences, as resulting from the natures of each, should, in agreement to the universal law of decorum, be exactly known and diligently observed by the poet."</p></note> of kings, and chiefs, and direful war might be written.</p>
<p>Plaintive strains originally were appropriated to the unequal numbers [of the elegiac]:<note anchored="yes" n="13" resp="Torr"><p>Elegy was at first only a lamentation for the death of a person beloved, and probably arose frem the death of Adonis. It was afterward applied to the joys and griefs of lovers.</p></note> afterward [love and] successful desires were included.

<p>Rage armed Archilochus with the iambic of his own invention. The sock and the majestic buskin assumed this measure as adapted for dialogue, and to silence the noise of the populace, and calculated for action.</p>
<p>To celebrate gods, and the sons of gods, and the victorious wrestler, and the steed foremost in the race, and the inclination of youths, and the free joys of wine, the muse has allotted to the lyre.</p>
<p>If I am incapable and unskillful to observe the distinction described, and the complexions of works [of genius], why am I accosted by the name of "Poet?" Why, out of false modesty, do I prefer being ignorant to being learned?</p>
<p>A comic subject will not be handled in tragic verse:<note anchored="yes" n="15" resp="Hurd"><p><cit><quote lang="la">Indignatur item &hellip; Coena Thyestae.</quote><bibl n="Hor. Ars 90">Hor. Ars 90</bibl></cit> <quote lang="fr">"Il met le souper de Thyeste pour toutes sortes de tragedies,"</quote> says M. Dacier, with whom agrees the whole band of commentators: but why this subject should be singled out, as the representative of the rest, is nowhere explained by any of them. We may be sure, it was not taken up at random. The reason was, that the Thyestes of Ennius was peculiarly chargeable with the fault here censured; as is plain from a curious passage in the Orator, where Cicero, speaking of the loose numbers of certain poets, observes this, in particular, of the tragedy of Thyestes, <quote lang="la">Similia sunt quaedam apud nostros: velut in Thyeste, <quote lang="la"><l>Quemnam te esse dicam? qui tarda in senectute,</l></quote> et quae sequuntur: quae, nisi cum tibicen accesserit, oratione sunt solutae simillimae</quote>: which character exactly agrees to this of Horace, wherein the language of that play is censured, as flat and prosaic, and hardly rising above the plain narrative of an ordinary conversation in comedy. This allusion to a particular play, written by one of their best poets, and frequently exhibited on the Roman stage, gives great force and spirit to the precept, at the same time that it exemplifies it in the happiest manner. It seems further probable to me, that the poet also designed an indirect compliment to Varius, whose Thyestes we are told (<bibl n="Quint. 10.1">Quinctil. l. x c. 1</bibl>) was not inferior to any tragedy of the Greeks. This double intention of these lines well suited to the poet's general aim, which is seen through all his critical works, of beating down the excessive admiration of the old poets, and of asserting and advancing the just honors of the deserving moderns. It may further be observed, that the critics have not felt the force of the words <quote lang="la">exponi</quote> and <quote lang="la">narrari</quote> in this precept. They are admirably chosen to express the two faults condemned: the first implying a kind of pomp and ostentation in the language, which is therefore improper for the low subjects of comedy; and the latter, as I have hinted, a flat, prosaic expression, not above the cast of a common narrative, and therefore equally unfit for tragedy.</p></note> in like manner the banquet of Thyestes will not bear to be held in familiar verses, and such as almost suit the sock. Let  each peculiar species [of writing] fill with decorum its proper place. Nevertheless sometimes even comedy exalts her voice, and passionate Chremes rails in a tumid strain: and a tragic writer generally expresses grief in a prosaic style. Telephus and Peleus, when they are both in poverty and exile, throw aside their rants and gigantic expressions if they have a mind to move the heart of the spectator with their complaint.
</p></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="99">
<p>It is not enough that poems be beautiful;<note anchored="yes" n="16" resp="Hurd"><p><cit><quote lang="la">Non satis est pulchra</quote><bibl n="Hor. Ars 99">Hor. Ars 99</bibl></cit>, etc. <placeName key="tgn,2046166">Bentley</placeName> objects to <foreign lang="la">pulchra</foreign> because this, he says, is a general term including under it every species of beauty, and therefore that of <foreign lang="la">dulcis</foreign> or the affecting. As if general terms were not frequently restrained and determined to a peculiar sense by the context. But the great critic did not sufficietly attend to the connection, which, as F. Robertellus, in his paraphrase on the epistle, well observes, stands thus: "It is not enough, that tragedies have that kind of beauty which arises from a pomp and splendor of diction, they must also be pathetic or affecting."</p></note> let them be tender and affecting, and bear away the soul of the auditor whithersoever they please. As the human countenance smiles on those that smile, so does it sympathize with those that weep. If you would have me weep you must first express the passion of grief yourself; then, Telephus or Peleus, your misfortunes hurt me: if you pronounce the parts assigned you ill, I shall either fall asleep or laugh.</p>
<p>Pathetic accents suit a melancholy countenance; words full of menace, an angry one; wanton expressions, a sportive look; and serious matter, an austere one. For nature forms us first within to every modification of circumstances; she delights or impels us to anger, or depresses us to the earth and afflicts us with heavy sorrow: then expresses those emotions of the mind by the tongue, its interpreter. If the words be discordant to the station of the speaker, the Roman knights and plebians will raise an immoderate laugh. It will make a wide difference, whether it be Davus that speaks, or a hero; a man well-stricken in years, or a hot young fellow in his bloom; and a matron of distinction, or an officious nurse; a roaming merchant, or the cultivator of a verdant little farm; a Colchian, or an Assyrian; one educated at <placeName key="tgn,7011071">Thebes</placeName>, or one at <placeName key="tgn,7010720">Argos</placeName>.</p>
<p>You, that write, either follow tradition,<note anchored="yes" n="17" resp="Hurd"><p>The connection lies thus: language must agree with character; character with fame, or at least with itself.</p></note> or invent such fables as are congruous to themselves. If as poet you have to represent the renowned Achilles; let him be indefatigable, wrathful, inexorable, courageous, let him deny that laws were made for him, let him arrogate every thing to force of arms Let Medea be fierce and untractable, Ino an object of pity, Ixion perfidious, Io wandering, Orestes in distress.

</p></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="125">
<p>If you offer to the stage any thing unattempted, and venture to form a new character; let it be preserved to the last<note anchored="yes" n="18" resp="Hurd"><p>The rule is, as appears from the reason of the thing, and from Aristotle, "Let a uniformity of character be preserved, or at least a consistency": i. e. either let the manners be exactly the same from the beginning to the end of the play, as those of Medea, for instance, and Orestes; or, if any change be necessary, let it be such as may consist with, and be easily reconciled to, the manners formerly attributed, as is seen in the case of Electra and Iphigenia.</p></note> such as it set out at the beginning, and be consistent with itself. It is difficult to write with propriety<note anchored="yes" n="19" resp="Hurd"><p><cit><quote lang="la">Difficile est proprie communia dicere.</quote><bibl n="Hor. Ars 128">Hor. Ars 128</bibl></cit> Lambin's comment is, <quote lang="la">Communia hoc loco appellat Horatius argumenta fabularum a nullo adhuc tractata: et ita, quae cuivis exposita sunt et in medio quadammodo posit, quasi vacua et a nemino occupata.</quote> And that this is the true meaning of <foreign lang="la">communia</foreign> is evidently fixed by the words <foreign lang="la">ignota indictaque</foreign>, which are explanatory of it.</p></note> on subjects to which all writers have a common claim; and you with more prudence will reduce the Iliad into acts, than if you first introduce arguments unknown and never treated of before.

Ars 131</bibl></cit> is just the reverse of what the poet had before styled <foreign lang="la">communia</foreign>: the latter meaning such subjects or characters as, though by their nature left in common to all, had yet, in fact, not been occupied by any writer; the former, those which had already been made public by occupation. In order to acquire a property in subjects of this sort, the poet directs us to observe the three following cautions: 1. Not to follow the trite, obvious round of the original work; i. e. not servilely and scrupulously to adhere to its plan of method. 2. Not to be translators, instead of imitators, i. e. if it shall be thought fit to imitate more expressly any part of the original, to do it with freedom and spirit, and without a slavish attachment to the mode of expression. 3. Not to adopt any particular incident that may occur in the proposed model, which either decency or the nature of the work would reject.</p></note> if you do not dwell upon the whole circle of events, which is paltry and open to every one; nor must you be so faithful a translator, as to take the pains of rendering [the original] word for word; nor by imitating throw yourself into straits, whence either shame or the rules of your work may forbid you to retreat. Nor  must you make such an exordium, as the Cyclic<note anchored="yes" n="21" resp="McCaul"><p><cit><quote lang="la">Scriptor cyclicus.</quote><bibl n="Hor. Ars 136">Hor.

Do you attend to what I, and the public in my opinion, expect from you [as a dramatic writer]. If you are desirous of an applauding spectator, who will wait for [the falling of] the curtain, and till the chorus calls out "your plaudits"; the manners of every age must be marked by you, and a proper decorum assigned to men's varying dispositions and years.

Though even these may be supposed, in cases where the character toward which they draw is represented as virtuous.

This is one of those many passages in the epistle about which the critics have said a great deal, without explaining any thing. In support of what I mean to offer, as the true interpretation, I observe,</p>
<p>I. That the poet's intention certainly was, not to censure the false refinements of their stage music; but, in a short digressive history (such as the didactic form will sometimes require), to describe the rise and progress of the true. This I collect, 1. From the expression itself, which can not, without violence, be understood in any other way. For, as to the words <foreign lang="la">licentia</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">praeceps</foreign>, which have occasioned much of the difficulty, the first means a freer use, not a licentiousness properly so-called; and the other only expresses a vehemence and rapidity of language, naturally productive of a quicker elocution, such as must of course attend the more numerous harmony of the lyre: not, as M. Dacier translates it, <quote lang="fr">"une eloquence temeraire et outr&eacute;e,"</quote> an extravagant straining and affectation of style. 2. From the reason of the thing, which makes it incredible that the music of the theater should then be most complete, when the times were barbarous, and entertainments of this kind little encouraged or understood. 3. From the character of that music itself; for the rudeness of which, <placeName key="tgn,2077718">Horace</placeName>, in effect, apologizes, in defending it only on the score of the imperfect state of the stage, and the simplicity of its judges. This then being clear, I observe,</p>
<p>II. That those two verses, 
<cit><quote lang="la"><lg type="hexameter"><l>Indoctus quid enim saperet liberque laborum,</l>
<l>Rusticus urbane confusus, turpis honesto?</l></lg></quote> <bibl n="Hor. Ars 211">(212-213)</bibl></cit>
are, as they now stand, utterly inexplicable. This hath appeared long since, from the fruitless labors of the critics, and, above all, of Lambin, one of the best of them, who, after several repeated efforts to elucidate this place, leaves it just as dark and unintelligible as he found it. The interpretation, without them, stands thus: "The tibia," says the poet, "was at first low and simple. The first, as best agreeing to the then state of the stage, which required only a soft music to go along with and assist the chorus, there being no large and crowded theaters to fill in those days. And the latter, as suiting best to the then state of the times, whose simplicity and frugal manners exacted the severest temperance, as in every thing else, so in their dramatic ornaments and decorations. But, when conquest had enlarged the territory and widened the walls of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, and, in consequence thereof, a social spirit had dispelled that severity of manners, by the introduction of frequent festival solemnities, then, as was natural to expect, a freer and more varied harmony took place. And thus it was, that the <foreign lang="la">tibicen</foreign>, the musician who played to the declamation in the acts, instead of the rude and simpler strain of the old times, gave a richness and variety of tone; and instead of the old inactive posture, added the grace of motion to his art. Just in the same manner," continues he, "it happened to the lyre, i. e. the music in the chorus, which originally, as that of the <foreign lang="la">tibia</foreign>, was severe and simple; but, by degrees, acquired a quicker and more expressive modulation, such as corresponded to the more elevated and passionate turn of the poet's style, and the diviner enthusiasm of his sentiment."</p></note> (not as now, begirt with brass and emulous of the trumpet, but) slender and of simple form, with few stops, was of service to accompany and assist the chorus, and with its tone was sufficient to fill the rows that were not as yet too crowded, where an audience, easily numbered, as being small and sober, chaste and modest, met together. But when the victorious Romans began to extend their territories, and an ampler wall encompassed the city, and their genius was indulged on festivals by drinking wine in the day-time without censure; a greater freedom arose both to the numbers [of poetry], and the measure [of music].<note anchored="yes" n="33" resp="TAB"><p><cit><quote lang="la">Accessit numerisque modisque licentia major.</quote><bibl n="Hor. Ars 211">Hor. Ars 211</bibl></cit> M.

Ars 216</bibl></cit>, etc. This is the application of what hath been said, in general, concerning the refinement of theatrical music to the case of tragedy. Some commentators say, and to comedy. But in this they mistake, as will appear presently. M. Dacier hath I know not what conceit about a comparison betwixt the Roman and Greek stage. His reason is, that the lyre was used in the Greek chorus, as appears, lie says, from Sophocles playing upon this instrument himself in one of his tragedies. And was it not used too in the Roman chorus, as appears from <placeName key="tgn,2538429">Nero</placeName>'s playing upon it in several tragedies? But the learned critic did not apprehend this matter. Indeed, from the caution with which his guides, the dealers in antiquities, always touch this point, it should seem that they too had no very clear conception of it. The case I take to have been this: the tibia, as being most proper to accompany the declamation of the acts, <quote lang="la">cantanti succinere</quote>, was constantly employed, as well in the Roman tragedy as comedy. This appears from many authorities. I mention only two from <placeName key="tgn,2068515">Cicero</placeName>. <cit><bibl n="Cic. Luc. 7">(Acad. 1. ii. 7)</bibl> <quote lang="la">"Quam multa quae nos fugiunt in cantu, exaudiunt in eo genere exercitati: Qui, primo inflatu tibicinis, Antiopam esse aiunt aut Andromachem, cum nos ne suspicemur quidem."</quote></cit> The other is still more express. In his piece entitled "Orator," speaking of the negligence of the Roman writers in respect of numbers, he observes, that there were even many passages in their tragedies, which, unless the tibia played to them, could not be distinguished from mere prose: <quote lang="la">"quae nisi cum tibicen accesserit, orationi sint solutae simillima."</quote> One of these passages is expressely quoted from Thyestes, a tragedy of Ennius, and, as appears from the measure, taken out of one of the acts. It is clear, then, that the tibia was certainly used in the declamation of tragedy. But now the song of the tragic chorus, being of the nature of the ode, of course required <foreign lang="la">fides</foreign>, the lyre, the peculiar and appropriated instrument of the lyric muse. And this is clearly collected, if not from express testimonies, yet from some occasional hints dropped by the ancients. For, 1. The lyre we are told (<bibl n="Cic. Leg. 2.9">Cic. de Leg. ii. 9 and 15</bibl>), and is agreed on all hands, was an instrument of the Roman theater; but it was not employed in comedy. This we certainly know from the short accounts of the music prefixed to Terrence's plays. 2. Further, the <foreign lang="la">tibicen</foreign>, as we saw, accompanied the declamation of the acts in tragedy. It remains, then, that the proper place of the lyre was, where one should naturally look for it, in the songs of the chorus; but we need not go further than this very passage for a proof. It is unquestionable, that the poet is here speaking of the chorus only, the following lines not admitting any other possible interpretation. By <foreign lang="la">fidibus</foreign>, then, it is necessarily understood the instrument peculiarly used in it. In this view, the whole digression is more pertinent and connects better. The poet had before been speaking of tragedy. All his directions, from l. 100, respect this species of the drama only. The application of what he had said concerning music is then most naturally made, 1. To the <foreign lang="la">tibia</foreign>, the music of the acts; and, 2. To <foreign lang="la">fides</foreign>, that of the choir: thus confining himself, as the tenor of this part required, to tragedy only. Hence is seen the mistake, not only of M. Dacier, whose comment is in every view insupportable; but, as was hinted, of Heinsius, Lambin, and others, who, with more probability, explained this of the Roman tragedy and comedy. For, though <foreign lang="la">tibia</foreign> might be allowed to stand for comedy, as opposed to <foreign lang="la">tragoedia</foreign> (as, in fact, we find it in <bibl n="Hor. Ep. 2.1.98">II. Ep. 1. 98</bibl>), that being the only instrument employed in it; yet, in speaking expressly of the music of the stage, <foreign lang="la">fides</foreign> could not determinately enough, and in contradistinction to <foreign lang="la">tibia</foreign>, denote that of tragedy, it being an instrument used solely or principally in the chorus, of which the context shows, he alone speaks. It is further to be observed, that in the application here made, besides the music, the poet takes in the other improvements of the tragic chorus, these happening, as from the nature of the thing they must, at the same time.</p></note> new movements and a  luxuriance to the ancient art, and strutting backward and forward, drew a length of train over the stage; thus likewise new notes were added to the severity of the lyre, and precipitate eloquence produced an unusual language [in the theater]: and the sentiments [of the chorus, then] expert in teaching useful things and prescient of futurity, differ hardly from the oracular <placeName key="tgn,7010770">Delphi</placeName>.<note anchored="yes" n="35" resp="Hurd"><p><cit><quote lang="la">Sententia Delphis.</quote><bibl n="Hor. Ars 219">Hor. Ars 219</bibl></cit> <foreign lang="la">Sententia</foreign> is properly an aphorism taken from life, briefly representing either what is or what ought to be the conduct of it: <cit><quote lang="la">"Oratio sumpta de vita, quae aut quid sit aut quid esse oporteat in vita, breviter ostendit."</quote> <bibl n="Rhet. Her. 1.4">(Ad Herenn. Rhet. 1. iv.)</bibl></cit> These aphorisms are here mentioned, as constituting the peculiar praise and beauty of the chorus. This is finely observed, and was intended to convey an oblique censure on the practice of those poets, who stuff out every part of the drama alike with moral sentences, not considering that the only proper receptacle of them is the chorus, where indeed they have an extreme propriety, it being the peculiar office and character of the chorus to moralize.</p></note>

were, I observed, certainly misplaced. They should, I think, come in here, where their sense is extremely pertinent. The poet had been speaking of the satyric drama, which, says he, was added to the tragic,

But why, it might be asked, this compliance, in so false a taste, with a drunken, lawless rabble? The answer is natural and to the purpose. "Because their theaters necessarily consisted of a mixed assembly, every part of which was to be considered in the public diversions." The question then hath an extreme propriety, <quote lang="la">"Indoctus quid enim saperet liberque laborum, Rusticus urbane confusus, turpis honesto?"</quote> The <foreign lang="la">rusticus</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">turpis</foreign> demanded the satyric piece.

For, the cast of them being necessarily romantic, and the persons those fantastic beings called satyrs, the <foreign lang="greek">to\ o(/moion</foreign>, or probable, will require the subject to have gained a popular belief, without which the representation must appear unnatural.

<p>It is not every judge that discerns inharmonious verses, and an undeserved indulgence is [in this case] granted to the Roman poets. But shall I on this account run riot and write licentiously?

A native of Icarius, a village in <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, to whom the invention of the drama has been ascribed. Before his time there were no performers except the chorus. He led the way to the formation of a dramatic plot and language, by directing a pause in the performance of the chorus, during which he came forward and recited with gesticulation a mythological story. Comp. note <bibl n="Hor. Ep. 2.1.163">Epist. ii. 1. 163</bibl>.  The date is thus given by the Par. Chron.

After him Aeschylus, the inventor of the vizard mask and decent robe, laid the stage over with boards of a tolerable size, and taught to speak in lofty tone, and strut in the buskin. To these succeeded the old comedy, not without considerable praise: but its personal freedom degenerated into excess and violence, worthy to be regulated by law; a law was made accordingly, and the chorus, the right of abusing being taken away, disgracefully became silent.</p>
<p>Our poets have left no species [of the art] unattempted; nor have those of them merited the least honor, who dared to forsake the footsteps of the Greeks, and celebrate domestic facts; whether they have instructed us in tragedy, or comedy.<note anchored="yes" n="47" resp="Hurd"><p><cit><quote lang="la">Vel qui praetextas, vel qui docuere togatas.</quote><bibl n="Hor. Ars 288">Hor. Ars 288</bibl></cit> There hath been much difficulty here in settling a very plain point. The question is, whether <foreign lang="la">praetextas</foreign> means tragedy or a species of comedy. The answer is very clear from Diomedes, whose account is, in short, this: "<foreign lang="la">Togatae</foreign> is a general term for all sorts of Latin plays adopting the Roman customs and dresses; as <foreign lang="la">Palliatae</foreign> is for all adopting the Grecian. Of the <foreign lang="la">Togatae</foreign>, the several species are, 1. <foreign lang="la">Praetexta</foreign> or <foreign lang="la">praetextata</foreign>, in which the Roman kings or generals were introduced, and is so called because the <foreign lang="la">praetexta</foreign> was the distinguishing habit of such persons; 2. <foreign lang="la">Tabernaria</foreign>, frequently called <foreign lang="la">Togata</foreign>, though that word, as we have seen, had properly a larger sense. 3. <foreign lang="la">Atellana</foreign>. 4. <foreign lang="la">Planipedis</foreign>."  He next marks the difference of these several sorts of the <foreign lang="la">Togatae</foreign> from the similar corresponding ones of the <foreign lang="la">Palliatae</foreign>, which are these: 1. "<foreign lang="la">Tragoedia</foreign>, absolutely so styled. 2. <foreign lang="la">Comoedia</foreign>. 3. <foreign lang="la">Satyri</foreign>.  4. <foreign lang="greek">Mi=mos</foreign>." (These four sorts of the <foreign lang="la">Palliatae</foreign> were also probably in use at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; certainly, at least, the two former.) It appears then from thence, that <foreign lang="la">praetextata</foreign> was properly the Roman tragedy. But he adds, <quote lang="la">"Togata praetextata a tragoedia differt"</quote> and it is also said, "to be only like tragedy, <quote lang="la">tragoediae similis</quote>." What is this difference and this likeness? The explanation follows. "Heroes are introduced into tragedy, such as Orestes, Chryses, and the like. In the <foreign lang="la">praetextata</foreign>, Brutus, Decius, or Marcellus." So then we see when Grecian characters were introduced, it was called simply <foreign lang="la">tragoedia</foreign>; when Roman, <foreign lang="la">praetextata</foreign>; yet both, tragedies. The sole difference lay in the persons being foreign or domestic. The correspondence in every other respect was exact. The same is observed of the Roman comedy; when it adopted Greek characters, it was called <foreign lang="la">comoedia</foreign>; when Roman, <foreign lang="la">togata tabernaria</foreign>, or <foreign lang="la">togata</foreign>, simply.</p></note>  Nor would <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> be raised higher by valor and feats of arms, than by its language, did not the fatigue and tediousness of using the file disgust every one of our poets. Do you, the descendants of Pompilius, reject that poem, which many days and many a blot have not ten times subdued to the most perfect accuracy. Because Democritus believes that genius is more successful than wretched art, and excludes from Helicon all poets who are in their senses, a great number do not care to part with their nails or beard, frequent places of solitude, shun the baths. For he will acquire, [he thinks,] the esteem and title of a poet, if he neither submits his head, which is not to be cured by even three Anticyras, to Licinius the barber. What an unlucky fellow am I, who am purged for the bile in spring-time! Else nobody would compose better poems; but the purchase is not worth the expense. Therefore I will serve instead of a whetstone, which though not able of itself to cut, can make steel sharp: so I, who can write no poetry myself, will teach the duty and business [of an author]; whence he may be stocked with rich materials; what nourishes and forms the poet; what gives grace, what not; what is the tendency of excellence, what that of error.

<p>To have good sense, is the first principle and fountain of writing well. The Socratic papers will direct you in the choice of your subjects; and words will spontaneously accompany the subject, when it is well conceived. He who has learned what he owes to his country, and what to his friends; with what affection a parent, a brother, and a stranger, are to be loved; what is the duty of a senator, what of a judge; what the duties of a general sent out to war; he, [I say,] certainly knows how to give suitable attributes to every character.

To attain to this truth of expression in dramatic poetry two things are prescribed: 1. A diligent study of the Socratic philosophy; and, 2, A masterly knowledge and comprehension of human life. The first, because it is the peculiar distinction of this school <cit><quote lang="la">"ad veritatem vitae propius accedere."</quote> <bibl n="Cic. de Orat. 1.51">(Cic. de.

Ars 319</bibl></cit>, etc. The poet's science in ethics will principally show itself in these two ways: 1. in furnishing proper matter for general reflection on human life and conduct; and, 2, in a due adjustment of the manners. By the former of these two applications of moral knowledge a play becomes, what the poet calls, <quote lang="la">speciosa locis</quote>, i. e. (for the term is borrowed from the rhetoricians) striking in its moral topics: a merit of the highest importance on the ancient stage, and which, if prudently employed in subserviency to the latter more essential requisite of the drama, a just expression of the manners, will deserve to be so reputed at all times, and on every theater. The danger is, lest a studied, declamatory moral, affectedly introduced, or indulged to access, should prejudice the natural exhibition of the characters, and so convert the image of human life into an unaffecting, philosophical dialogue.</p>
<p><cit><quote lang="la">Moratque recta fabula</quote><bibl n="Hor. Ars 319">Hor. Ars 319</bibl></cit>, etc. This judgment of the poet, in regard of the superior efficacy of manners, is generally thought to be contradicted by Aristotle; who, in treating this subject, observes, <cit><quote lang="en">"that let a piece be ever so perfect in the manners, sentiments, and style, it will not so well answer the end and purpose of tragedy, as if defective in these, and finished only in the fable and composition."</quote><bibl n="Aristot. Poet. 1450a"></bibl></cit> M. Dacier thinks to clear this matter by saying, "that what Aristotle remarks holds true of tragedy, but not of comedy, of which alone Horace is here speaking." But granting that the artificial contexture of the fable is less necessary to the perfection of comedy than of tragedy, yet, the tenor of this whole division, exhorting to correctness in general, makes it unquestionable that Horace must intend to include both. The case, as it seems to me, is this. The poet is not comparing the respective importance of the fable and manners, but of the manners and diction, under this word including also numbers. He gives them the preference not to a good plot, nor even to fine sentiments, but to <cit><quote lang="la">versus inopes rerum nugaeque canorae</quote><bibl n="Hor. Ars 322">Hor. Ars 322</bibl></cit>. The art he speaks of, is the art of expressing the thoughts properly, gracefully, and harmoniously: the <foreign lang="la">pondus</foreign> is the force and energy of good versification. <foreign lang="la">Venus</foreign> is a general term including both kinds of beauty.  <foreign lang="la">Fabula</foreign> does not mean the fable (in distinction from the rest), but simply a play.</p></note> and where the manners are well marked, though of no elegance, without force or art, gives the people much higher delight and more effectually commands their attention, than verse void of matter, and tuneful trifles. To the Greeks, covetous of nothing but praise, the muse gave genius; to the Greeks the power of expressing themselves in round periods. The Roman youth learn by long computation to subdivide a pound into an hundred parts. Let the son of Albinus tell me, if from five ounces one be subtracted, what remains?

Let whatever is imagined for the sake of entertainment, have as much likeness to truth as possible; let not your play demand belief for whatever [absurdities] it is inclinable [to exhibit]: nor take out of a witch's belly a living child that she had dined upon.
