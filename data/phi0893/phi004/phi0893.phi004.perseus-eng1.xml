<p>How comes it to pass, Maecenas, that no one lives content with his condition, whether reason
      gave it him, or chance threw it in his way; [but] praises those who follow different pursuits?
      "O happy merchants!" says the soldier, oppressed with years, <milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/>and now broken down in his limbs through excess of labor. On the other side, the
      merchant, when the south winds toss his ship [cries], "Warfare is preferable;" for why? the
      engagement is begun, and in an instant there comes a speedy death or a joyful victory. The
      lawyer praises the farmer's state <milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line"/>when the client knocks
      at his door by cockcrow. He who, having entered into a recognizance,<note anchored="yes" n="1"

        </cit> 

In some suit, the farmer had given bail for his attendance on the day appointed for
        the trial. The persons who had bound themselves as bail for his appearance, are called
         <foreign lang="la">vades</foreign>. The derivation of the word is supposed to be <foreign
         lang="la">vadere</foreign>, "to go," because the person who procures such persons to answer
        for his appearance, is allowed to go until the day of the trial.</p>
      </note> is dragged, from the country into the city, cries, "Those only are happy who live in
      the city." The other instances of this kind (they are so numerous) would weary out the
      loquacious Fabius;<note anchored="yes" n="2" resp="McCaul">
       <p>It is not known to whom Horace alludes. The Scholiast informs us that there was a knight
        of this name, a partisan of Pompey's, who had written some treatises on the doctrines of the
        Stoics, and who, he says, argued sometimes with Horace for the truth of the principles of
        that sect.</p>
      </note> not to keep you in suspense, hear to what an issue I will bring the matter. <milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/>If any god should say, "Lo! I will effect what you desire: you,
      that were just now a soldier, shall be a merchant; you, lately a lawyer [shall be] a farmer.
      Do ye depart one way, and ye another, having exchanged the parts you are to act in life. How
      now! Why do you stand?" They are unwilling; and yet it is in their power to be happy.
       <milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/>What reason can be assigned, but that <placeName
       key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> should deservedly distend both his cheeks in
      indignation, and declare that for the future he will not be so indulgent as to lend an ear to
      their prayers? But further, that I may not run over this in a laughing manner, like those [who
      treat] on ludicrous subjects (though what hinders one being merry, while telling the truth?
       <milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/>as good-natured teachers at first give cakes to their
      boys, that they may be willing to learn their first rudiments: raillery, however, apart, let
      us investigate serious matters) lie that turns the heavy glebe with the hard plowshare, this

      through every sea, profess that they endure toil with this intention, that as old men they may
      retire into a secure resting-place, when once they have gotten together a sufficient
      provision.</p>
     <p>Thus the little ant (for she is an example), of great industry, carries in her mouth
      whatever she is able, and adds to the heap which she piles up, <milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line"/>by no means ignorant and not careless for the future. Which [ant, nevertheless],
      as soon as Aquarius saddens the changed year, never creeps abroad, but wisely makes use of
      those stores which were provided beforehand: while neither sultry summer, nor winter, fire,
      ocean, sword, can drive you from gain. <milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line"/>You surmount
      every obstacle, that no other man may be richer than yourself. What pleasure is it for you,
      trembling to deposit an immense weight of silver and gold in the earth dug up by stealth?<note

       <p>i. e. to hide it.</p>

      than mine: just as if it were your lot to carry on your loaded shoulder the basket of bread
      among slaves, you would receive no more [for your own share] than he who bore no part of the
      burthen. Or tell me, what is it to the purpose of that man, who lives within the compass of
      nature, <milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line"/>whether he plow a hundred or a thousand acres?
      "But it is still delightful to take out of a great hoard."</p>
     <p>While you leave us to take as much out of a moderate store why should you extol your
      granaries, more than our cornbaskets? As if you had occasion for no more than a pitcher or
      glass of water, and should say, "I had rather draw [so much] from a great river, than the very
      same quantity from this little fountain." Hence it comes to pass, that the rapid <placeName
       key="tgn,1128017">Aufidus</placeName> carries away, together with the bank, such men as an
      abundance more copious than what is just delights. But he who desires only so much as is
      sufficient, <milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line"/>neither drinks water fouled with the mud,
      nor loses his life in the waves.

<div3 type="card" n="61">
<p>But a great majority of mankind, misled by a wrong desire, cry, "No sum is enough; because
      you are esteemed in proportion to what you possess." What can one do to such a tribe as this?
      Why, bid them be wretched, since their inclination prompts them to it. As a certain person is
      recorded [to have lived] at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, <milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line"/>covetous and rich, who was wont to despise the talk of the people
      in this manner: "The crowd hiss me; but I applaud myself at home, as soon as I contemplate my
      money in my chest." The thirsty Tantalus catches at the streams, which elude his lips. Why do
      you laugh? The name changed, the tale is told of you. <milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line" />You sleep upon your bags, heaped up on every side, gaping over them, and are obliged to
      abstain from them, as if they were consecrated things, or to amuse yourself with them as you
      would with pictures. Are you ignorant of what value money has, what use it can afford? Bread,
      herbs, a bottle of wine may be purchased; to which [necessaries], <milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line"/>add [such others], as, being withheld, human nature would be uneasy with itself.
      What, to watch half dead with terror, night and day, to dread profligate thieves, fire, and
      your slaves, lest they should run away and plunder you; is this delightful? I should always
      wish to be very poor in possessions held upon these terms.</p>
     <p><milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line"/>But if your body should be disordered by being seized
      with a cold, or any other casualty should confine you to your bed, have you one that will
      abide by you, prepare medicines, entreat the physician that he would set you upon your feet,
      and restore you to your children and dear relations?</p>
     <p>Neither your wife, nor your son, desires your recovery; <milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line" />all your neighbors, acquaintances, [nay the very] boys and girls hate you. Do you wonder
      that no one tenders you the affection which you do not merit, since you prefer your money to
      every thing else? If you think to retain, and preserve as friends, the relations which nature
      gives you, without taking any pains; <milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line"/>wretch that you
      are, you lose your labor equally, as if any one should train an ass to be obedient to the
      rein, and run in the Campus [Martius]. Finally, let there be some end to your search; and, as
      your riches increase, be in less dread of poverty; and begin to cease from your toil, that
      being acquired which you coveted: <milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line"/>nor do as did one
      Umidius (it is no tedious story), who was so rich that he measured his money, so sordid that
      he never clothed himself any better than a slave; and, even to his last moments, was in dread
      lest want of bread should oppress him: but his freed-woman, <milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line"/>the bravest of all the daughters of Tyndarus,<note anchored="yes" n="6"

      not exist. I return now whence I digressed. Does no one, after the miser's example, like his
      own station, but rather praise those who have different pursuits; <milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line"/>and pines, because his neighbor's she-goat bears a more distended udder; nor
      considers himself in relation to the greater multitude of poor; but labors to surpass, first
      one, and then another? Thus the richer man is always an obstacle to one that is hastening [to
      be rich]: <milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line"/>as when the courser whirls along the chariot,
      dismissed from the place of starting; the charioteer presses upon those horses which outstrip
      his own, despising him that is left behind coming on among the last. Hence it is, that we
      rarely find a man who can say he has lived happy, and content with his past life, can retire
      from the world like a satisfied guest.<note anchored="yes" n="8" resp="TAB">

      unwilling to be reckoned sordid, or of a mean spirit: he is praised by some, condemned by

      walks with his garments trailing upon the ground; there is another droll fellow who [goes]

      young fellows to come hither, in comparison of their meddling with other men's wives."

      conceal that which is offensive. This is the custom with men of fortune: when they buy horses,

      sensations: thenceforward they began to abstain from war, to fortify towns, and establish
      laws: that no person should be a thief, a robber, or an adulterer. For before Helen's time
      there existed [many] a woman who was the dismal cause of war: but those fell by unknown
      deaths, whom pursuing uncertain venery, as the bull in the herd, the strongest slew. It must
      of necessity be acknowledged, if you have a mind to turn over the aeras and annals of the
      world, that laws were invented from an apprehension of the natural injustice [of mankind]. Nor
      can nature separate what is unjust from what is just, in the same manner as she distinguishes
      what is good from its reverse, and what is to be avoided from that which is to be sought: nor
      will reason persuade men to this, that he who breaks down the cabbage-stalk of his neighbor,
      sins in as great a measure, and in the same manner, as he who steals by night things

<p>In the first place, I will except myself out of the number of those I would allow to be
      poets: for one must not call it sufficient to tag a verse: nor if any person, like me, writes
      in a style bordering on conversation, must you esteem him to be a poet. To him who has genius,
      who has a soul of a diviner cast, and a greatness of expression, give the honor of this
      appellation. On this acount some have raised the question, whether comedy be a poem or not;
      because an animated spirit and force is neither in the style, nor the subject-matter: bating
      that it differs from prose by a certain measure, it is mere prose. But [one may object to
      this, that even in comedy] an inflamed father rages, because his.dissolute son, mad after a
      prostitute mistress, refuses a wife with a large portion; and (what is an egregious scandal)
      rambles about drunk with flambeaux by day-light. Yet could Pomponius, were his father alive,
      hear less severe reproofs! Wherefore it is not sufficient to write verses merely in proper
      language; which, if you take to pieces, any person may storm in the same manner as the father
      in the play. If from these verses which I write at this present, or those that Lucilius did
      formerly, you take away certain pauses and measures, and make that word which was first in
      order hindermost, by placing the latter [words] before those that preceded [in the verse]; you
      will not discern the limbs of a poet, when pulled in pieces, in the same manner as you would
      were you to transpose ever so [these lines of Ennius]: <quote lang="en">

<p>So far of this matter; at another opportunity [I may investigate] whether [a comedy] be a
      true poem or not: now I shall only consider this point, whether this [satiric] kind of writing
      be deservedly an object of your suspicion. Sulcius the virulent, and Caprius hoarse with their
      malignancy, walk [openly], and with their libels too [in their hands]; each of them a singular
      terror to robbers: but if a man lives honestly and with clean hands, he may despise them both.
      Though you be like highwaymen, Coelus and Byrrhus, I am not [a common accuser], like Caprius
      and Sulcius; why should you be afraid of me? No shop nor stall holds my books, which the

      miserably Barrus? A strong lesson to hinder any one from squandering away his patrimony. When

      bully at such a rate?" For a foul scar has disgraced the left part of Messius's bristly

      without a smoke that brought tears into our eyes; occasioned by a hearth's burning some green
      boughs with the leaves upon them. Here, like a great fool as I was, I wait till midnight for a

      that post of honor, yet could he not do so with regard to your being my friend! especially as
      you are cautious to admit such as are worthy; and are far from having any sinister ambitious
      views. I can not reckon myself a lucky fellow on this account, as if it were by accident that
      I got you for my friend; for no kind of accident threw you in my way. That best of men,
      Virgil, long ago, and after him, Varius, told you what I was. When first I came into your
      presence, I spoke a few words in a broken manner (for childish bashfulness hindered me from
      speaking more); I did not tell you that I was the issue of an illustrious father: I did not
      [pretend] that I rode about the country on a Satureian horse, but plainly what I really was;
      you answer (as your custom is) a few words: I depart: and you re-invite me after the ninth
      month, and command me to be in the number of your friends. I esteem it a great thing that I
      pleased you, who distinguish probity from baseness, not by the illustriousness of a father,

      in so populous a city, he would have concluded that those expenses were supplied to me out of
      some hereditary estate. He himself, of all others the most faithful guardian, was constantly
      about every one of my prcceptors. Why should I multiply words? He preserved me chaste (which
      is the first honor of virtue) not only from every actual guilt, but likewise from [every] foul
      imputation, nor was he afraid lest any should turn it to his reproach, if I should come to
      follow a business attended with small profits, in capacity of an auctioneer, or (what he was
      himself) a taxgatherer. Nor [had that been the case] should I have complained. On this account
      the more praise is due to him, and from me a greater degree of gratitude. As long as I am in

      [for my birth], in the manner that numbers do, by affirming it to be no fault of theirs. My
      language and way of thinking is far different from such persons. For if nature were to make us
      from a certain term of years to go over our past time again, and [suffer us] to choose other
      parents, such as every man for ostentation's sake would wish for himself; I, content with my
      own, would not assume those that are honored with the ensigns and seats of state; [for which I
      should seem] a madman in the opinion of the mob, but in yours, I hope a man of sense; because
      I should be unwilling to sustain a troublesome burden, being by no means used to it. For I
      must [then] immediately set about acquiring a larger fortune, and more people must be
      complimented; and this and that companion must be taken along, so that I could neither take a
      jaunt into the country, or a journey by myself; more attendants and more horses must be fed;

       <p>Lucilius had his numerous admirers in <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, who
        were greatly disobliged by the freedom with which our poet had treated him in his fourth

        and address. Respecting the eight spurious verses usually prefixed to this satire, see
        Orelli's Excursus. The verses are as follows: <quote lang="la">

       <p><foreign lang="la">Mimi</foreign> were farces written purely for diversion and laughing.
        Decimus Laberius was made a Roman knight by Julius Caesar. He had long maintained the first
        character in this kind of writing, but Publius Syrus at last became his rival, and carried
        off all the applause of the theater.</p>
      </note> as fine poems. Hence it is by no means sufficient to make an auditor grin with
      laughter: and yet there is some degree of merit even in this. There is need of conciseness
      that the sentence may run, and not embarrass itself with verbiage, that overloads the sated
      ear; and sometimes a grave, frequently jocose style is necessary, supporting the character one
      while of the orator, and [at another] of the poet, now and then that of a graceful rallier
      that curbs the force of his pleasantry and weakens it on purpose. For ridicule often decides
      matters of importance more effectually and in a better manner, than severity. Those poets by
      whom the ancient comedy was written, stood upon this [foundation], and in this are they worthy
      of imitation: whom neither the smooth-faced Hermogenes ever read, nor that baboon who is
      skilled in nothing but singing [the wanton compositions of] Calvus and Catullus.</p>
     <p>But [Lucilius, say they,] did a great thing, when he intermixed Greek words with Latin. O
      late-learned dunces! What! do you think that arduous and admirable, which was done by Pitholeo
      the Rhodian? But [still they cry] the style elegantly composed of both tongues is the more
      pleasant, as if Falernian wine is mixed with Chian. When you make verses, I ask you this

      to be taken away than left. Be it so; do you, who are a scholar, find no fault with any thing
      in mighty Homer, I pray? Does the facetious Lucilius make no alterations in the tragedies of
      Accius? Does not he ridicule many of Ennius' verses, which are too light for the gravity [of
      the subject]? When he speaks of himself by no means as superior to what he blames. What should
      hinder me likewise, when I am reading the works of Lucilius, from inquiring whether it be his
      [genius], or the difficult nature of his subject, that will not suffer his verses to be more
      finished, and to run more smoothly than if some one, thinking it sufficient to conclude a
      something of six feet, be fond of writing two hundred verses before he eats, and as many after

        He was greatly in favor both with Julius Caesar and Augustus. As he accompanied the first in

      well-timed, will gain the attention of Caesar; whom, [like a generous steed,] if you stroke

      these are by nature bulky, and those very light. A hungry stomach seldom loathes common
      victuals. O that I could see a swingeing mullet extended on a swingeing dish! cries that
      gullet, which is fit for the voracious harpies themselves. But O [say I] ye southern blasts,

       <p>The fanciful, fashionable taste is but of short continuance; that of nature is

        the praetor decided in favor of sturgeon. Another glutton brought turbots and storks into
        vogue, and perhaps we only wait for a third man of taste to assure us, that a roasted
        cormorant is infinitely more delicious than sturgeons, turbots, or storks.</p>

        his guests or his servants should be too profuse of his oil, he pours it himself. The poet
        tells us, his bottle was of two pounds weight, as if it were his whole store, although he

     <p>What manner of living therefore shall the wise man put in practice, and which of these
      examples shall he copy? On one side the wolf presses on, and the dog on the other, as the
      saying is. A person will be accounted decent, if he offends not by sordidness, and is not
      despicable through either extreme of conduct. Such a man will not, after the example of old
      Albutius, be savage while he assigns to his servants their respective offices; nor, like
      simple Naevius, will he offer greasy water to his company: for this too is a great fault.</p>

      thrushes and shell-fish; the sweet juices will turn to bile, and the thick phlegm will bring a
      jarring upon the stomach. Do not you see, how pale each guest rises from a perplexing variety
      of dishes at an entertainment. Beside this, the body, overloaded with the debauch of

     <p>You write so seldom, as not to call for parchment four times in the year, busied in

      Dictate therefore something worthy of your promises: begin. There is nothing. The pens are
      found fault with to no purpose, and the harmless wall, which must have been built under the
      displeasure of gods and poets, suffers [to no end]. But you had the look of one that
      threatened many and excellent things, when once your villa had received you, free from

      hoards up cash and gold [and] knows not how to use them when accumulated, and is afraid to
      touch them as if they were consecrated? If any person before a great heap of corn should keep
      perpetual watch with a long club, and, though the owner of it, and hungry, should not dare to
      take a single grain from it; and should rather feed upon bitter leaves: if, while a thousand

      addresses: neither be wanting in your pains, nor immoderately exuberant. By garrulity you will

      and stand with your head on one side, much like one who is in great awe. Attack him with
      complaisance: if the air freshens, advise him carefully to cover up his precious head:
      disengage him from the crowd by opposing your shoulders to it: closely attach your ear to him,
      if chatty. Is he immoderately fond of being praised? Pay him home, till he shall cry out, with
      his hands lifted up to heaven, "Enough:" and puff up the swelling bladder with tumid speeches.
      When he shall have [at last] released you from your long servitude and anxiety; and being
      certainly awake, you shall hear [this article in his will]? "Let Ulysses be heir to one fourth

      household gods; and feed my saucy slaves with viands, of which libations have been made. The
      guest, according to every one's inclination, takes off the glasses of different sizes, free
      from mad laws: whether one of a strong constitution chooses hearty bumpers; or another more
      joyously gets mellow with moderate ones. Then conversation arises, not concerning other
      people's villas and houses, nor whether Lepos dances well or not; but we debate on what is
      more to our purpose, and what it is pernicious not to know-whether men are made happier by
      riches or by virtue; or what leads us into intimacies, interest or moral rectitude; and what
      is the nature of good, and what its perfection. Meanwhile, my neighbor Cervius prates away old
      stories relative to the subject. For, if any one ignorantly commends the troublesome riches of
      Aurelius, he thus begins: "On a time a countrymouse is reported to have received a city-mouse
      into his poor cave, an old host, his old acquaintance; a blunt fellow and attentive to his
      acquisitions, yet so as he could [on occasion] enlarge his narrow soul in acts of hospitality.
      What need of many words? He neither grudged him the hoarded vetches, nor the long oats; and
      bringing in his mouth a dry plum, and nibbled scraps of bacon, presented them to him, being
      desirous by the variety of the supper to get the better of the daintiness of his guest, who
      hardly touched with his delicate tooth the several things: while the father of the family
      himself, extended on fresh straw, ate a spelt and darnel, leaving that which was better [for
      his guest]. At length the citizen addressing him, &lsquo;Friend,&rsquo; says he,
      &lsquo;what delight have you to live laboriously on the ridge of a rugged thicket? Will
      you not prefer men and the city to the savage woods? Take my advice, and go along with me:
      since mortal lives are allotted to all terrestrial animals, nor is there any escape from
      death, either for the great or the small. Wherefore, my good friend, while it is in your
      power, live happy in joyous circumstances: live mindful of how brief an existence you
      are.&rsquo; Soon as these speeches had wrought upon the peasant, he leaps nimbly from his
      cave: thence they both pursue their intended journey, being desirous to steal under the city
      walls by night. And now the night possessed the middle region of the heavens, when each of
      them set foot in a gorgeous palace, where carpets dyed with crimson grain glittered upon ivory
      couches, and many baskets of a magnificent entertainment remained, which had yesterday been
      set by in baskets piled upon one another. After he had placed the peasant then, stretched at
      ease, upon a splendid carpet; he bustles about like an adroit host, and keeps bringing up one
      dish close upon another, and with an affected civility performs all the ceremonies, first
      tasting of every thing he serves up. He, reclined, rejoices in the change of his situation,
      and acts the part of a boon companion in the good cheer: when on a sudden a prodigious
      rattling of the folding doors shook them both from their couches. Terrified they began to
      scamper all about the room, and more and more heartless to be in confusion, while the lofty
      house resounded with [the barking of] mastiff dogs; upon which, says the country-mouse,
      &lsquo;I have no desire for a life like this; and so farewell: my wood and cave, secure

     <p>How did the entertainment of that happy fellow Nasidienus please you? for yesterday, as I
      was seeking to make you my guest, you were said to be drinking there from mid-day.<note
       anchored="yes" n="100" resp="ed. Dubl.">
       <p>Nasidienus, to give himself an air of a rake, dines three or four hours before the usual
        time; or perhaps Fundanius would insinuate that this was too solemn a feast for vulgar
        hours.</p>
      </note> [It pleased me so], that I never was happier in my life. Say (if it be not
      troublesome) what food first calmed your raging appetite.</p>
     <p>In the first place, there was a Lucanian boar, taken when the gentle south wind blew,<note
       anchored="yes" n="1" resp="ed. Dubl.">
       <p>Either by buying it cheap, or keeping it too long, the boar was tainted; but our host
        would insinuate that it had a particular flavor, by being taken when the wind was south,
        which made it delicate and tender.</p>
      </note> as the father of the entertainment affirmed; around it sharp rapes, lettuces,
      radishes; such things as provoke a languid appetite; skirrets, anchovies, dregs of Coan wine.
      These once removed, one slave, tucked high with a purple cloth,<note anchored="yes" n="2"
       resp="Dac">
       <p>The table was made of maple, a cheap and common wood; but Nasidienus, in an air of polite

      </note> wiped the maple table, and a second gathered up whatever lay useless, and whatever
      could offend the guests;<note anchored="yes" n="3" resp="Dac">
       <p>This was the pretense, that nothing might offend his guests, but his design was that
        nothing might be lost. </p>

      Alcon brings those of <placeName key="tgn,7002670">Chios</placeName>, undamaged by the
       sea.<note anchored="yes" n="4" resp="Lamb">
       <p>It was customary to mix sea-water with the strong wines of <placeName key="tgn,1000074"
         >Greece</placeName>; but Fundanius, when he tells us that the wine Alcon carried had not a
        drop of water in it, would have us understand that this wine had never crossed the seas, and
        that it was an Italian wine which Nasidienus recommended for Chian.</p>
      </note> Here the master [cries], "Maecenas, if <placeName key="tgn,1031727">Alban</placeName>
      or Falernian wine delight you more than those already brought, we have both."</p>
     <p>Ill-fated riches! But, Fundanius, I am impatient to know, who were sharers-in this feast
      where you fared so well. I was highest, and next me was Viscus Thurinus, and below, if I
      remember, was Varius; with Servilius Balatro, Vibidius, whom Maecenas had brought along with
      him, unbidden guests. Above [Nasidienus] himself was Nomentanus, below him Porcius, ridiculous
      for swallowing whole cakes at once. Nomentanus [was present] for this purpose, that if any
      thing should chance to be unobserved, he might show it with his pointing finger. For the other
      company, we, I mean, eat [promiscuously] of fowls, oysters, fish, which had concealed in them
      a juice far different from the known: as presently appeared, when he reached to me the
      entrails of a plaice and of a turbot, such as had never been tasted before. After this he
      informed me that honey-apples were most ruddy when gathered under the waning moon. What
      difference this makes you will hear best from himself. Then [says] Vibidius to Balatro; "If we
      do not drink to his cost, we shall die in his debt;" and he calls for larger tumblers. A
      paleness changed the countenance of our host, who fears nothing so much as hard drinkers:
      either because they are more freely censorious; or because heating wines deafen the subtle
      [judgment of the] palate. Vibidius and Balatro, all following their example, pour whole casks
      into Alliphanians;<note anchored="yes" n="5" resp="schol">
       <p>Large cups, so called from <placeName key="perseus,Allifae">Allifae</placeName>, a town of
        Samnium.</p>
      </note> the guests of the lowest couch did no hurt to the flagons. A lamprey is brought in,
      extended in a dish, in the midst of floating shrimps. Whereupon, "This," says the master, "was
      caught when pregnant; which, after having young, would have been less delicate in its flesh."
      For these a sauce is mixed up; with oil which the best cellar of <placeName
       key="perseus,Venafrum">Venafrum</placeName> pressed, with pickle from the juices of the
      Iberian fish, with wine of five years old, but produced on this side the sea, while it is
      boiling (after it is boiled, the Chian wine suits it so well, that no other does better than
      it) with white pepper, and vinegar which, by being vitiated, turned sour the Methymnean grape.</p>
     <p>I first showed the way to stew in it the green rockets and bitter elecampane: Curtillus, [to
      stew in it] the sea-urchins unwashed, as being better than the pickle which the sea shell-fish
      yields. 
</p><div3 type="card" n="54--1">
<p>In the mean time the suspended tapestry made a heavy downfall upon the dish, bringing along
      with it more black dust than the north wind ever raises on the plains of <placeName
       key="tgn,7003005">Campania</placeName>. Having been fearful of something worse, as soon as we
      perceive there was no danger, we rise up. Rufus, hanging his head, began to weep, as if his
      son had come to an untimely death: what would have been the end, had not the discreet
      Nomentanus thus raised his friend! "Alas! 0 fortune, what god is more cruel to us than thou?
      How dost thou always take pleasure in sporting with human affairs!" Varius could scarcely
      smother a laugh with his napkin. Balatro, sneering at every thing, observed: "This is the
      condition of human life, and therefore a suitable glory will never answer your labor. Must you
      be rent and tortured with all manner of anxiety, that I may be entertained sumptuously; lest
      burned bread, lest ill-seasoned soup should be set before us; that all your slaves should
      wait, properly attired and neat? Add, besides, these accidents; if the hangings should tumble
      down, as just now, if the groom slipping with his foot should break a dish. But adversity is
      wont to disclose, prosperity to conceal, the abilities of a host as well as of a general." To
      this Nasidienus: "May the gods give you all the blessings, whatever you can pray for, you are
      so good a man and so civil a guest;" and calls for his sandals.<note anchored="yes" n="6"
       resp="Torr">
       <p>That he might rise from table. The guests laid their slippers at the end of the bed when
        they went to supper.</p>
      </note> Then on every couch you might see divided whispers buzzing in each secret ear. I would
      not choose to have seen any theatrical entertainments sooner than these things. But come,
      recount what you laughed at next. While Vibidius is inquiring of the slaves, whether the
      flagon was also broken,<note anchored="yes" n="7" resp="Cruq, Dac">
       <p>Vibidius asks whether the groom had broken the bottle at the same time that he broke the
        dish, for <foreign lang="la">quoque</foreign> certainly refers to <cit>
         <quote lang="la">patinam lapsus frangat agaso</quote>
         <bibl n="Hor. S. 2.8.72"/>
        </cit>. He seems to insinuate that Nasidienus had given orders to his slaves not to be in
        too much haste to supply the guests with wine, but to let them call for it more than
       once.</p>
      </note> because cups were not brought when he called for them; and while a laugh is continued
      on feigned pretences, Balatro seconding it; you, Nasidienus, return with an altered
      countenance, as if to repair your ill-fortune by art. Then followed the slaves, bearing on a
      large charger the several limbs of a crane besprinkled with much salt, not without flour, and
      the liver of a white goose fed with fattening figs, and the wings of hares torn off, as a much
      daintier dish than if one eats them with the loins. Then we saw blackbirds also set before us
      with scorched breasts, and ringdoves without the rumps: delicious morsels! did not the master
      give us the history of their causes and natures: whom we in revenge fled from, so as to taste
      nothing at all; as if Canidia, more venomous than African serpents, had poisoned them with her
      breath.</p>
