<lg type="stanza"><l>Maecenas, born of monarch ancestors,</l>
<l>The shield at once and glory of my life!</l>
<l>There are who joy them in the Olympic strife</l>
<l>And love the dust they gather in the course;</l></lg>
<lg><l>The goal by hot wheels shunn'd, the famous prize,</l>
<l>Exalt them to the gods that rule mankind;</l>
<l>This joys, if rabbles fickle as the wind</l>
<l>Through triple grade of honours bid him rise,</l></lg>
<lg><l>That, if his granary has stored away</l>
<l>Of <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>'s thousand floors the yield entire;</l>
<l>The man who digs his field as did his sire,</l>
<l>With honest pride, no Attalus may sway</l></lg>
<lg><l>By proffer'd wealth to tempt Myrtoan seas,</l>
<l>The timorous captain of a Cyprian bark.</l>
<l>The winds that make Icarian billows dark</l>
<l>The merchant fears, and hugs the rural ease</l></lg>
<lg><l>Of his own village home; but soon, ashamed</l>
<l>Of penury, he refits his batter'd craft.</l>
<l>There is, who thinks no scorn of Massic draught,</l>
<l>Who robs the daylight of an hour unblamed,</l></lg>
<lg><l>Now stretch'd beneath the arbute on the sward,</l>
<l>Now by some gentle river's sacred spring;</l>
<l>Some love the camp, the clarion's joyous ring,</l>
<l>And battle, by the mother's soul abhorr'd.</l></lg>
<lg><l>See, patient waiting in the clear keen air,</l>
<l>The hunter, thoughtless of his delicate bride,</l>
<l>Whether the trusty hounds a stag have eyed,</l>
<l>Or the fierce Marsian boar has burst the snare.</l></lg>
<lg><l>To me the artist's meed, the ivy wreath</l>
<l>Is very heaven: me the sweet cool of woods,</l>
<l>Where Satyrs frolic with the Nymphs, secludes</l>
<l>From rabble rout, so but Euterpe's breath</l></lg>
<lg><l>Fail not the flute, nor Polyhymnia fly</l>
<l>Averse from stringing new the Lesbian lyre.</l>
<l>O, write my name among that minstrel choir,</l>
<l>And my proud head shall strike upon the sky!</l></lg></div2>
<div2 type="Poem" n="2" met="aaab">
<lg><l>Enough of snow and hail at last</l>
<l>The sire has sent in vengeance down:</l>
<l>His bolts, at his own temple cast,</l>
<l>Appall'd the town,</l></lg>
<lg><l>Appall'd the lands, lest <placeName key="perseus,Pyrrha">Pyrrha</placeName>'s time</l>
<l>Return, with all its monstrous sights,</l>
<l>When Proteus led his flocks to climb</l>
<l>The flatten'd heights,</l></lg>
<lg><l>When fish were in the elm-tops caught,</l>
<l>Where once the stock-dove wont to bide,</l>
<l>And does were floating, all distraught,</l>
<l>Adown the tide.</l></lg>
<lg><l>Old <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>, hurl'd in tumult back</l>
<l>From mingling with the Etruscan main,</l>
<l>Has threaten'd Numa's court with wrack</l>
<l>And Vesta's fane.</l></lg>
<lg><l>Roused by his <placeName key="tgn,5001986">Ilia</placeName>'s plaintive woes,</l>
<l>He vows revenge for guiltless blood,</l>
<l>And, spite of Jove, his banks o'erflows,</l>
<l>Uxorious flood.</l></lg>
<lg><l>Yes, Fame shall tell of civic steel</l>
<l>That better Persian lives had spilt,</l>
<l>To youths, whose minish'd numbers feel</l>
<l>Their parents' guilt.</l></lg>
<lg><l>What god shall <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> invoke to stay</l>
<l>Her fall? Can suppliance overbear</l>
<l>The ear of Vesta, turn'd away</l>
<l>From chant and prayer?</l></lg>
<lg><l>Who comes, commission'd to atone</l>
<l>For crime like ours? at length appear,</l>
<l>A cloud round thy bright shoulders thrown,</l>
<l>Apollo seer!</l></lg>
<lg><l>Or Venus, laughter-loving dame,</l>
<l>Round whom gay Loves and Pleasures fly;</l>
<l>Or thou, if slighted sons may claim</l>
<l>A parent's eye,</l></lg>
<lg><l>O weary with thy long, long game,</l>
<l>Who lov'st fierce shouts and helmets bright,</l>
<l>And Moorish warrior's glance of flame</l>
<l>Or e'er he smite!</l></lg>
<lg><l>Or <placeName key="tgn,1049816">Maia</placeName>'s son, if now awhile</l>
<l>In youthful guise we see thee here,</l>
<l>Caesar's avenger&mdash;such the style</l>
<l>Thou deign'st to bear;</l></lg>
<lg><l>Late be thy journey home, and long</l>
<l>Thy sojourn with <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>'s family;</l>
<l>Nor let thy wrath at our great wrong</l>
<l>Lend wings to fly.</l></lg>
<lg><l>Here take our homage, Chief and Sire;</l>
<l>Here wreathe with bay thy conquering brow,</l>
<l>And bid the prancing <placeName key="tgn,1045322">Mede</placeName> retire,</l>
<l>Our Caesar thou!</l></lg></div2>
<div2 type="Poem" n="3" met="ab">
<lg><l>Thus may <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>' heavenly queen,</l>
<l>Thus Helen's brethren, stars of brightest sheen,</l>
<l>Guide thee!  May the sire of wind</l>
<l>Each truant gale, save only Zephyr, bind!</l>
<l>So do thou, fair ship, that ow'st</l>
<l>Virgil, thy precious freight, to Attic coast,</l>
<l>Safe restore thy loan and whole,</l>
<l>And save from death the partner of my soul!</l>
<l>Oak and brass of triple fold</l>
<l>Encompass'd sure that heart, which first made bold</l>
<l>To the raging sea to trust</l>
<l>A fragile bark, nor fear'd the Afric gust</l>
<l>With its Northern mates at strife,</l>
<l>Nor Hyads' frown, nor South-wind fury-rife,</l>
<l>Mightiest power that <placeName key="perseus,Hadria">Hadria</placeName> knows,</l>
<l>Wills he the waves to madden or compose.</l>
<l>What had Death in store to awe</l>
<l>Those eyes, that huge sea-beasts unmelting saw,</l>
<l>Saw the swelling of the surge,</l>
<l>And high Ceraunian cliffs, the seaman's scourge?</l>
<l>Heaven's high providence in vain</l>
<l>Has sever'd countries with the estranging main,</l>
<l>If our vessels ne'ertheless</l>
<l>With reckless plunge that sacred bar transgress.</l>
<l>Daring all, their goal to win,</l>
<l>Men tread forbidden ground, and rush on sin:</l>
<l>Daring all, Prometheus play'd</l>
<l>His wily game, and fire to man convey'd;</l>
<l>Soon as fire was stolen away,</l>
<l>Pale Fever's stranger host and wan Decay</l>
<l>Swept o'er earth's polluted face,</l>
<l>And slow Fate quicken'd Death's once halting pace.</l>
<l>Daedalus the void air tried</l>
<l>On wings, to humankind by Heaven denied;</l>
<l><placeName key="tgn,1120946">Acheron</placeName>'s bar gave way with ease</l>
<l>Before the arm of labouring Hercules.</l>
<l>Nought is there for man too high;</l>
<l>Our impious folly e'en would climb the sky,</l>
<l>Braves the dweller on the steep,</l>
<l>Nor lets the bolts of heavenly vengeance sleep.</l></lg></div2>
<div2 type="Poem" n="4" met="ab">
<lg><l>The touch of Zephyr and of Spring has loosen'd Winter's thrall;</l>
<l>The well-dried keels are wheel'd again to sea:</l>
<l>The ploughman cares not for his fire, nor cattle for their stall,</l>
<l>And frost no more is whitening all the lea.</l>
<l>Now Cytherea leads the dance, the bright moon overhead;</l>
<l>The Graces and the Nymphs, together knit,</l>
<l>With rhythmic feet the meadow beat, while <placeName key="tgn,1050339">Vulcan</placeName>, fiery red,</l>
<l>Heats the Cyclopian forge in <placeName key="tgn,7003867">Aetna</placeName>'s pit.</l>
<l>'Tis now the time to wreathe the brow with branch of myrtle green,</l>
<l>Or flowers, just opening to the vernal breeze;</l>
<l>Now Faunus claims his sacrifice among the shady treen,</l>
<l>Lambkin or kidling, which soe'er he please.</l>
<l>Pale Death, impartial, walks his round: he knocks at cottage-gate</l>
<l>And palace-portal.  Sestius, child of bliss!</l>
<l>How should a mortal's hopes be long, when short his being's date?</l>
<l>Lo here! the fabulous ghosts, the dark abyss,</l>
<l>The void of the Plutonian hall, where soon as e'er you go,</l>
<l>No more for you shall leap the auspicious die</l>
<l>To seat you on the throne of wine; no more your breast shall glow</l>
<l>For Lycidas, the star of every eye.</l></lg></div2>
<div2 type="Poem" n="5" met="aaab">
<lg><l>What slender youth, besprinkled with perfume,</l>
<l>Courts you on roses in some grotto's shade?</l>
<l>Fair <placeName key="perseus,Pyrrha">Pyrrha</placeName>, say, for whom</l>
<l>Your yellow hair you braid,</l></lg>
<lg><l>So trim, so simple! Ah! how oft shall he</l>
<l>Lament that faith can fail, that gods can change,</l>
<l>Viewing the rough black sea</l>
<l>With eyes to tempests strange,</l></lg>
<lg><l>Who now is basking in your golden smile,</l>
<l>And dreams of you still fancy-free, still kind,</l>
<l>Poor fool, nor knows the guile</l>
<l>Of the deceitful wind!</l></lg>
<lg><l>Woe to the eyes you dazzle without cloud</l>
<l>Untried! For me, they show in yonder fane</l>
<l>My dripping garments, vow'd</l>
<l>To Him who curbs the main.</l></lg></div2>
<div2 type="Poem" n="6" met="aaab">
<lg><l>Not I, but Varius:&mdash;he, of Homer's brood</l>
<l>A tuneful swan, shall bear you on his wing,</l>
<l>Your tale of trophies, won by field or flood,</l>
<l>Mighty alike to sing.</l></lg>
<lg><l>Not mine such themes, Agrippa; no, nor mine</l>
<l>To chant the Wrath that fill'd Pelides' breast,</l>
<l>Nor dark Ulysses' wanderings o'er the brine,</l>
<l>Nor Pelops' house unblest.</l></lg>
<lg><l>Vast were the task, I feeble; inborn shame,</l>
<l>And she, who makes the peaceful lyre submit,</l>
<l>Forbid me to impair great Caesar's fame</l>
<l>And yours by my weak wit.</l></lg>
<lg><l>But who may fitly sing of Mars array'd</l>
<l>In adamant mail, or Merion, black with dust</l>
<l>Of <placeName key="tgn,7014164">Troy</placeName>, or Tydeus' son by <placeName key="tgn,2565867">Pallas</placeName>' aid</l>
<l>Strong against gods to thrust?</l></lg>
<lg><l>Feasts are my theme, my warriors maidens fair,</l>
<l>Who with pared nails encounter youths in fight;</l>
<l>Be Fancy free or caught in Cupid's snare,</l>
<l>Her temper still is light.</l></lg></div2>
<div2 type="Poem" n="7" met="ab">

<l>Each famous, or Thessalian Tempe green;</l>
<l>There are who make chaste Pallas' virgin tower</l>
<l>The daily burden of unending song,</l>
<l>And search for wreaths the olive's rifled bower:</l>
<l>The praise of Juno sounds from many a tongue,</l>
<l>Telling of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>' steeds, <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName>'s gold.</l>
<l>For me stern <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> forges no such spell,</l>
<l>No, nor Larissa's plain of richest mould,</l>
<l>As bright Albunea echoing from her cell.</l>
<l>O headlong Anio!  O Tiburnian groves,</l>
<l>And orchards saturate with shifting streams!</l>
<l>Look how the clear fresh south from heaven removes</l>
<l>The tempest, nor with rain perpetual teems!</l>
<l>You too be wise, my Plancus: life's worst cloud</l>
<l>Will melt in air, by mellow wine allay'd,</l>
<l>Dwell you in camps, with glittering banners proud,</l>
<l>Or 'neath your <placeName key="perseus,Tibur">Tibur</placeName>'s canopy of shade.</l>
<l>When Teucer fled before his father's frown</l>
<l>From <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName>, they say his temples deep</l>
<l>He dipp'd in wine, then wreath'd with poplar crown,</l>
<l>And bade his comrades lay their grief to sleep:</l>
<l>&ldquo;Where Fortune bears us, than my sire more kind,</l>
<l>There let us go, my own, my gallant crew.</l>
<l>'Tis Teucer leads, 'tis Teucer breathes the wind;</l>
<l>No more despair; Apollo's word is true.</l>
<l>Another <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> in kindlier air</l>
<l>Shall yet arise.  Hearts, that have borne with me</l>
<l>Worse buffets! drown today in wine your care;</l>

<l>Of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> and queenly <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</l>
<l>Ister to thee, and <placeName key="tgn,1123466">Tanais</placeName> fleet,</l>
<l>And <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName> that will not tell his birth,</l>
<l>To thee the monstrous seas that beat</l>
<l>On <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>'s coast, the end of earth,</l>
<l>To thee the proud Iberians bow,</l>
<l>And Gauls, that scorn from death to flee;</l>
<l>The fierce Sygambrian bends his brow,</l>

<div2 type="Poem" n="15" met="ab">
<lg><l>Of battles fought I fain had told,</l>
<l>And conquer'd towns, when Phoebus smote</l>
<l>His harp-string: &ldquo;Sooth, 'twere over-bold.</l>
<l>To tempt wide seas in that frail boat.&rdquo;</l>
<l>Thy age, great Caesar, has restored</l>
<l>To squalid fields the plenteous grain,</l>
<l>Given back to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>'s almighty Lord</l>
<l>Our standards, torn from Parthian fane,</l>
<l>Has closed Quirinian Janus' gate,</l>
<l>Wild passion's erring walk controll'd,</l>
<l>Heal'd the foul plague-spot of the state,</l>
<l>And brought again the life of old,</l>
<l>Life, by whose healthful power increased</l>
<l>The glorious name of <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName> spread</l>
<l>To where the sun illumes the east</l>
<l>From where he seeks his western bed.</l>
<l>While Caesar rules, no civil strife</l>
<l>Shall break our rest, nor violence rude,</l>
<l>Nor rage, that whets the slaughtering knife</l>
<l>And plunges wretched towns in feud.</l>
<l>The sons of <placeName key="tgn,7012913">Danube</placeName> shall not scorn</l>
<l>The Julian edicts; no, nor they</l>
<l>By <placeName key="tgn,1123466">Tanais</placeName>' distant river horn,</l>
<l>Nor <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,6005315">Scythia</placeName>, or Cathay.</l>
<l>And we on feast and working-tide,</l>
<l>While Bacchus' bounties freely flow,</l>
<l>Our wives and children at our side,</l>
<l>First paying Heaven the prayers we owe,</l>
<l>Shall sing of chiefs whose deeds are done,</l>
<l>As wont our sires, to flute or shell,</l>
<l>And <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Troy</placeName>, Anchises, and the son</l>
<l>Of Venus on our tongues shall dwell.</l></lg></div2></div1>
