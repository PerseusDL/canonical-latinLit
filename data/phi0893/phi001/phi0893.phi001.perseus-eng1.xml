<l n="31">While strains of mine have voice and breath:</l>
<l n="32">The dull neglect of days to come</l>

<l n="34">No, Lollius, no: a soul is yours,</l>

<l n="36">When fortune smiles, and when she lowers:</l>
<l n="37">To greed and rapine still severe,</l>
<l n="38">Spurning the gain men find so sweet:</l>
<l n="39">A consul, not of one brief year,</l>
<l n="40">But oft as on the judgment-seat</l>
<l n="41">You bend the expedient to the right,</l>
<l n="42">Turn haughty eyes from bribes away,</l>
<l n="43">Or bear your banners through the fight,</l>
<l n="44">Scattering the foeman's firm array.</l>
<l n="45">The lord of boundless revenues,</l>
<l n="46">Salute not him as happy: no,</l>
<l n="47">Call him the happy, who can use</l>
<l n="48">The bounty that the gods bestow,</l>
<l n="49">Can bear the load of poverty,</l>
<l n="50">And tremble not at death, but sin:</l>
<l n="51">No recreant he when called to die</l>
