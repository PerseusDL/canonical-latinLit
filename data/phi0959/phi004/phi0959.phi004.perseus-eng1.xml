				<head>Book I</head>
				<l>In Cupid's school<note anchored="true" place="foot" resp="ed">The poet here lays
						down the proposition of the work, which he comprehends in the two first
						verses: he then invokes the assistance of the gods and begins his
						narration.</note>, whoe'er would take degree</l>
				<l>Must learn his rudiments by reading me,<note anchored="true" place="foot"
						resp="ed">One must learn to love, and what to love: for love is so far from
						being forbidden, that there is nothing so commendable, provided the object
						is good.</note></l>
				<l>Seamen with sailing art their vessels move;</l>
				<l>Art guides the chariot: art instructs to love.</l>
				<l>Of ships and chariots others know the rule;</l>
				<l>But I am master in Love's mighty school.</l>
				<l>Cupid indeed is obstinate and wild,</l>
				<l>A stubborn god<note anchored="true" place="foot" resp="ed">He speaks of love who
						is very seldom guided by reason.</note>; but yet the god's a child:</l>
				<l>Easy to govern in his tender age,</l>
				<l>Like fierce Achilles in his pupilage:</l>
				<l>That hero, born for conquest<note anchored="true" place="foot" resp="ed">This
						alludes to his killing Hector, as in the <bibl n="Hom. Il. 22.363">22nd
							book</bibl> of Homer's <title>Iliads</title>.</note>, trembling
					stood</l>
				<l>Before the centaur, and receiv'd the rod.</l>
				<l>As Chiron mollified his cruel mind</l>
				<l>With art; and taught his warlike hands to wind</l>
				<l>The silver strings of his melodious lyre;<note anchored="true" place="foot"
						resp="ed">Achilles, when he was a lad, was put to this centaur to be
						educated.</note></l>
				<l>So love's fair goddess does my soul inspire</l>
				<l>To teach her softer arts; to sooth the mind,</l>
				<l>And smooth the rugged breasts of human kind.</l>
				<l>Yet Cupid and Achilles, each with scorn</l>
				<l>And rage were fill'd; and both were goddess-born.<note anchored="true"
						place="foot" resp="ed">Cupid was the son of Venus, and Achilles of Thetis.
						Both were children alike, and both hard to govern. For, indeed, the passions
						of love and glory are not easily overcome by reason, which ought always to
						be mistress.</note></l>
				<l>The bull reclaim'd and yolk'd, the burden draws:<note anchored="true"
						place="foot" resp="ed">This he says to show us that love may also be tamed
						by habit. Ovid is full of these sort of similes.</note></l>
				<l>The horse receives the bit within his jaws.</l>
				<l>And stubborn love shall bend beneath my sway,</l>
				<l>Tho' struggling oft he tries to disobey.</l>
				<l>He shakes his torch, he wounds me with his darts;</l>
				<l>But vain his force, and vainer are his arts.</l>
				<l>The more he burns my soul, or wounds my sight,</l>
				<l>The more he teaches to revenge the spite.</l>
				<l>I boast no aid the Delphian god affords,</l>
				<l>Nor auspice from the flight of chattering birds,<note anchored="true"
						place="foot" resp="ed">From whence the ancients drew their auguries. To
						which the poet here alludes.</note></l>
				<l>Nor <placeName key="tgn,2244631">Clio</placeName>, nor her sisters, have I
					seen,</l>
				<l>As Hesiod saw them on the shady green:<note anchored="true" place="foot"
						resp="ed"><placeName key="tgn,2562923">Ovid</placeName> names <placeName
							key="tgn,2244630">Clio</placeName> only, of all the nine, in this place.
						The fable tells us, she and her sisters were born of <placeName
							key="tgn,2075298">Jupiter</placeName>'s caresses of Mnemosyne, that is,
						memory.</note></l>
				<l>Experience makes my work a truth so tried,</l>
				<l>You may believe; and <placeName key="tgn,2744070">Venus</placeName> be my
						guide.<note anchored="true" place="foot" resp="ed">It has been before
						observed, that <placeName key="tgn,2562923">Ovid</placeName> invokes the
						goddess of love to assist his song, <bibl n="Lucr. 1.1">as Lucretius
							does</bibl> the same divinity for his world of nature, as being the
						mother of all generations, and all productions.</note></l>
				<l>Far hence ye vestals be, who bind your hair;<note anchored="true" place="foot"
						resp="ed">The author forewarns all virgins, and chaste persons, not to
						follow, in all things, the precepts of his book.</note></l>
				<l>And wives, who gowns below your ancles wear.</l>
				<l>I sing the brothels loose and unconfin'd,</l>
				<l>Th' unpunishable pleasures of the kind;</l>
				<l>Which all alike for love or money find. <milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="carte"
					/></l>
				<l>You, who in Cupid's roll inscribe your name,</l>
				<l>First seek an object worthy of your flame;<note anchored="true" place="foot"
						resp="ed">The poet here gives his advice as to three things: to seek after
						an amiable object: to win it by respect and complacency, and not to lose it
						after once gotten.</note></l>
				<l>Then strive, with art, your lady's mind to gain;</l>
				<l>And last, provide your love may long remain.</l>
				<l>On these three precepts all my work shall move:</l>
				<l>These are the rules and principles of love.</l>
				<l>Before your youth with marriage is oppress't,<note anchored="true" place="foot"
						resp="ed">That is, while you are a freeman, unmarried, and not engaged to
						any other mistress. The truest meaning that can be given, is, that while you
						are young, and are not yet troubled with the infirmities of age (for an old
						man in love is ridiculous) choose where you please.</note></l>
				<l>Make choice of one who suits your humour best</l>
				<l>And such a damsel drops not from the sky;</l>
				<l>She must be sought for with a curious eye.</l>
				<l>The wary angler, in the winding brook,</l>
				<l>Knows what the fish, and where to bait his hook.</l>
				<l>The fowler and the huntsman know by name</l>
				<l>The certain haunts and harbour of their game.</l>
				<l>So must the lover beat the likeliest grounds;</l>
				<l>Th' Assemblies where his quarries most abound:</l>
				<l>Nor shall my novice wander far astray;</l>
				<l>These rules shall put him in the ready way.</l>
				<l>Thou shalt not fail around the continent,</l>
				<l>As far as Perseus or as <placeName key="tgn,7008038">Paris</placeName> went:</l>
				<l>For <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> alone affords thee such a
					store,</l>
				<l>As all the world can hardly shew thee more.</l>
				<l>The face of heav'n with fewer stars is crown'd,</l>
				<l>Than beauties in the Roman sphere are found.</l>
				<l>Whether thy love is bent on blooming youth,</l>
				<l>On dawning sweetness, in unartful truth;</l>
				<l>Or courts the juicy joys of riper growth;</l>
				<l>Here may'st thou find thy full desires in both:</l>
				<l>Or if autumnal beauties please thy sight</l>
				<l>(An age that knows to give and take delight;)</l>
				<l>Millions of matrons, of the graver sort,</l>
				<l>In common prudence, will not balk the sport.</l>
				<l>In summer's heats thou need'st but only go</l>
				<l>To Pompey's cool and shady portico;<note anchored="true" place="foot" resp="ed"
						>This was a shady walk which Pompey built for the people; and there were
						several in <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> of the same sort;
						but the most admirable one of all the porticos, was the Corinthian, near the
						Flaminian cirque, built by Cneius Octavius.</note></l>
				<l>Or Concord's fane; or that proud edifice</l>
				<l>Whose turrets near the bawdy suburbs rise;</l>
				<l>Or to that other portico, where stands</l>
				<l>The cruel father urging his commands.</l>
				<l>And fifty daughters wait the time of rest,</l>
				<l>To plunge their poniards in the bridegroom's breast.</l>
				<l>Or <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName>' temple; where, on annual
					nights,</l>
				<l>They mourn Adonis with Assyrian rites.<note anchored="true" place="foot"
						resp="ed">It was the custom among the Romans, to meet in the temples of
							<placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName> to mourn Adonis; of which
						the prophet Ezekiel speaks, (<bibl n="Ezekiel 8.14">Ezek. viii. 14.</bibl>);
						and infamous acts of lewdness were there committed, if we may believe
						Juvenal in his <bibl n="Juv. 6">sixth satire</bibl>.</note></l>
				<l>Nor shun the Jewish walk, where the foul drove</l>
				<l>On sabbaths rest from everything but love.<note anchored="true" place="foot"
						resp="ed">There were great numbers of the Jews at <placeName
							key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> in Augustus's reign, who were allowed
						full liberty to exercise their ceremonies, according to the law of
							<placeName key="tgn,2525806">Moses</placeName>. And the Roman ladies
						went often to see them out of curiosity, which gave occasion for
						assignations at their synagogues.</note></l>
				<l>Nor Isis' temple; for that sacred whore</l>
				<l>Makes others, what to Jove she was before;<note anchored="true" place="foot"
						resp="ed">That is, many women were debauched by Isis's means, as she was by
							<placeName key="tgn,2075298">Jupiter</placeName> under the name of
						Io.</note></l>
				<l>And if the hall itself be not belied,</l>
				<l>E'en there the cause of love is often tried;</l>
				<l>Near it at least, or in the palace yard,</l>
				<l>From whence the noisy combatants are heard.</l>
				<l>The crafty counsellors, in formal gown,<note anchored="true" place="foot"
						resp="ed">The following verses are a happy paraphrase of <placeName
							key="tgn,2033049">Ovid</placeName>; in whose time we find the long robe
						dealt as much with the stola, etc., as it does in our own.</note></l>
				<l>There gain another's cause, but lose their own.</l>
				<l>Their eloquence is nonpluss'd in the suit;</l>
				<l>And lawyers, who had words at will, are mute.</l>
				<l><placeName key="tgn,2100948">Venus</placeName> from her adjoining temple
					smiles</l>
				<l>To see them caught in their litigious wiles;</l>
				<l>Grave senators lead home the youthful dame,<note anchored="true" place="foot"
						resp="ed">We see these assemblies were composed of all sorts of persons;
						upon which our French author remarks thus: " This does not very well agree
						to the practice in our days; and I cannot comprehend how gallant women could
						frequent the courts of justice : where it is to be supposed, nobody came but
						such as had business and suits depending."</note></l>
				<l>Returning clients when they patrons came.</l>
				<l>But above all, the Playhouse is the place;<note anchored="true" place="foot"
						resp="ed">It must be owned, the theatres, amphitheatres, cirques,
						hippodromes, and all places where the public feasts and rejoicings were
						kept, were very fatal to the chastity of the women of old.</note></l>
				<l>There's choice of quarry in that narrow chace:</l>
				<l>There take thy stand, and sharply looking out,</l>
				<l>Soon may'st thou find a mistress in the rout,</l>
				<l>For length of time or for a single bout.</l>
				<l>The Theatres are berries for the fair;</l>
				<l>Like ants or mole-hills thither they repair;</l>
				<l>Like bees to hives so numerously they throng,</l>
				<l>It may be said they to that place belong:</l>
				<l>Thither they swarm who have the public voice;</l>
				<l>There choose, if plenty not distracts thy choice.</l>
				<l>To see, and to be seen, in heaps they run;</l>
				<l>Some to undo, and some to be undone. <milestone ed="p" n="101" unit="carte"/></l>
				<l>From <placeName key="tgn,2005143">Romulus</placeName> the rise of plays
					began,</l>
				<l>To his new subjects a commodious man;</l>
				<l>Who, his unmarried soldiers to supply,</l>
				<l>Took care the commonwealth should multiply;</l>
				<l>Providing <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> women for his
					braves,</l>
				<l>Like a true king, to get a race of slaves.</l>
				<l>His playhouse, not of Parian marble made,</l>
				<l>Nor was it spread with purple sails for shade;</l>
				<l>The stage with rushes or with leaves they strew'd;<note anchored="true"
						place="foot" resp="ed">This idea of the Roman theatres in their infancy, may
						put us in mind of our own which we read of in the old poets, in
						Black-friars, the Bull-and-mouth, and Barbican, not much better than the
						strollers at a country-fair. Yet this must be said for them: that the
						audience were much better treated; their fare was good, though the house was
						homely. Which cannot be said of the Roman infant-stage, their wit and their
						theatres were alike rude; and the Shakspeares and Jonsons of <placeName
							key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> did not appear till the stage was
						pompous, and the scene magnificent.</note></l>
				<l>No scenes in prospect, no machining god.</l>
				<l>On rows of homely turf they sat to see,</l>
				<l>Crown'd with the wreaths of ev'ry common tree.</l>
				<l>There, while they sit in rustic majesty,</l>
				<l>Each lover had his mistress in his eye;</l>
				<l>And whom he saw most suiting to his mind,</l>
				<l>For joys of matrimonial rape design'd.</l>
				<l>Scarce could they wait the plaudit in their haste;</l>
				<l>But ere the dances and the song were past,</l>
				<l>The monarch gave the signal from his throne,<note anchored="true" place="foot"
						resp="ed">At which the soldiers were to fall on the women. The poet and his
						translators make an agreeable description of this rape. Some say there were
						thirty of these Sabines ravished: others, as Valerius Antius, make the
						number to be four hundred and twenty-seven: and Jubas, as Plutarch writes in
						the life of <placeName key="tgn,2005143">Romulus</placeName>, swells it to
						six hundred.</note></l>
				<l>And rising, bade his merry men fall on.</l>
				<l>The martial crew, like soldiers, ready press'd,</l>
				<l>Just at the word (the word too was the best),</l>
				<l>With joyful cries each other animate;</l>
				<l>Some choose, and some at hazard seize their mate.</l>
				<l>As doves from eagles, or from wolves the lambs,</l>
				<l>So from their lawless lovers fly the dames.</l>
				<l>Their fear was one, but not one face of fear:</l>
				<l>Some rend the lovely tresses of the hair:</l>
				<l>Some shriek, and some are struck with dumb despair.</l>
				<l>Her absent mother one invokes in vain;</l>
				<l>One stands amaz'd, not daring to complain;</l>
				<l>The nimbler trust their feet, the slow remain.</l>
				<l>But nought availing, all are captives led,</l>
				<l>Trembling and blushing, to the genial bed.</l>
				<l>She who too long resisted or denied,</l>
				<l>The lusty lover made by force a bride,</l>
				<l>And with superior strength compell'd her to his side,</l>
				<l>Then sooth'd her thus! "My soul's far better part,</l>
				<l>Cease weeping, nor afflict thy tender heart;</l>
				<l>For what thy father to thy mother was,</l>
				<l>That faith to thee, that solemn vow I pass !</l>
				<l>Thus <placeName key="tgn,2005143">Romulus</placeName> became so popular;</l>
				<l>This was the way to thrive in peace and war;</l>
				<l>To pay his army, and fresh whores to bring:</l>
				<l>Who wouldn't fight for such a gracious king!</l>
				<l>Thus love in theatres did first improve,</l>
				<l>And theatres are still the scene of love. <milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="carte"
					/></l>
				<l>Nor shun the chariots and the courser's race;</l>
				<l>The circus is no inconvenient place.</l>
				<l>No need is there of talking on the hands;</l>
				<l>Nor nods, nor signs, which lovers understand.<note anchored="true" place="foot"
						resp="ed">It is plain by this, the ancient Romans used to make love by signs
						on their fingers like the modern Spaniards and Portuguese; and this talking
						on the fingers is very common among us ever since Dr. Holder and Dr. Wallis
						taught by Mr. Popham, who was born deaf and dumb, with whom I have, however,
						myself held a conversation of many hours, and that many hundred times, by
						the help of our fingers. But the poet says there was no occasion of this
						dumb language at the cirque; for there was so much noise, that lovers might
						entertain one another as they pleased, without fear of being
						overheard.</note></l>
				<l>But boldly next the fair your seat provide,<note anchored="true" place="foot"
						resp="ed">Young men are apt enough to do this of themselves, and need no
						advice; yet Juvenal, like <placeName key="tgn,2071526">Ovid</placeName>,
						puts them in mind of it.</note></l>
				<l>Close as ye can to hers-and side by side.</l>
				<l>Pleas'd or unpleas'd, no matter, crowding sit;</l>
				<l>For so the laws of public shows permit.</l>
				<l>Then find occasion to begin discourse;</l>
				<l>Enquire whose chariot this, and whose that horse?</l>
				<l>To whatsoever side she is inclin'd,</l>
				<l>Suit all her inclinations to her mind;</l>
				<l>Like what she likes, from thence your court begin.</l>
				<l>And whom she favours, wish that he may win.</l>
				<l>But when the statues of the deities</l>
				<l>In chariots roll'd, appear before the prize;</l>
				<l>When <placeName key="tgn,2021646">Venus</placeName> comes, with deep devotion
					rise.</l>
				<l>If dust be on her lap, or grains of sand,</l>
				<l>Brush both away with your officious hand.</l>
				<l>If none there be, yet brush that nothing thence,</l>
				<l>And still to touch her lap make some pretence.</l>
				<l>Touch any thing of hers, and if her train</l>
				<l>Sweep on the ground, let it not sweep in vain;</l>
				<l>But gently take it up and wipe it clean;</l>
				<l>And while you wipe it, with observing eyes,</l>
				<l>Who knows but you may see her naked thighs!</l>
				<l>Observe who sits behind her, and beware,</l>
				<l>Lest his encroaching knees should press the fair</l>
				<l>Light service takes light minds, for some can tell</l>
				<l>Of favours won by laying cushions well;</l>
				<l>By fanning faces some their fortunes meet,</l>
				<l>And some by laying footstools for their feet.</l>
				<l>These overtures of love the circus gives,</l>
				<l>Nor at the sword play less the lover thrives;</l>
				<l>For there the son of <placeName key="tgn,2021646">Venus</placeName> fights his
					prize,</l>
				<l>And deepest wounds are oft receiv'd from eyes.</l>
				<l>One, while the crowd their acclamations make,</l>
				<l>Or while he bets and puts his ring to stake,</l>
				<l>Is struck from far and feels the flying dart,</l>
				<l>And of the spectacle is made a part. <milestone ed="p" n="171" unit="carte"/></l>
				<l>Caesar would represent a naval fight,<note anchored="true" place="foot" resp="ed"
						>The naval combats were represented in a place dug on purpose on the banks
						of the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>; it was called
						Naumachia; and when occasion required the river water was let into it.
						Tacitus, in his <bibl n="Tac. Ann. 12">twelfth book</bibl>, makes mention of
						a representation of the naval battle of <placeName key="tgn,7010713"
							>Actium</placeName>.</note></l>
				<l>For his own honour and for <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>'s
					delight.</l>
				<l>From either sea the youths and maidens come,</l>
				<l>And all the world was then contain'd in <placeName key="tgn,7013962"
						>Rome</placeName>!</l>
				<l>In this vast concourse, in this choice of game,</l>
				<l>What Roman heart but felt a foreign flame!</l>
				<l>Once more our prince prepares to make us glad,</l>
				<l>And the remaining east to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> will
						add.<note anchored="true" place="foot" resp="ed">Augustus having put an end
						to the war in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, undertook an
						expedition into <placeName key="tgn,2097781">Asia</placeName>, and began the
						Parthian war; in which he recovered the ensigns that had been taken from the
						Romans in the defeat of Crassus, which these verses refer to.</note></l>
				<l>Rejoice, ye Roman soldiers, in your urns,</l>
				<l>Your ensigns from the Parthians shall return,</l>
				<l>And the slain Crassi shall no longer mourn.</l>
				<l>A youth is sent those trophies to demand,</l>
				<l>Ard bears his father's thunders in his hand;</l>
				<l>Doubt not th' imperial boy in wars unseen,</l>
				<l>In childhood all of Caesar's race are men.</l>
				<l>Celestial seeds shoot out before their day,</l>
				<l>Prevent their years, and brook no dull delay.</l>
				<l>Thus infant <placeName key="tgn,2086286">Hercules</placeName> the snakes did

				<l>And in his cradle did his sire confess.</l>
				<l><placeName key="tgn,2097807">Bacchus</placeName> a boy, yet like a hero
					fought,</l>
				<l>And early spoils from conquer'd <placeName key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName>
					brought.</l>
				<l>Thus you your father's troops shall lead to fight,</l>
				<l>And thus shall vanquish in your father's right.</l>
				<l>These rudiments you to your lineage owe;</l>
				<l>Born to increase your titles as you grow.</l>
				<l>Brethren you had, revenge your brethren slain;</l>
				<l>You have a father, and his rights maintain.</l>
				<l>Arm'd by your country's parent and your own,</l>
				<l>Redeem your country and restore his throne.</l>
				<l>Your enemies assert an impious cause;</l>
				<l>You fight both for divine and human laws.</l>
				<l>Already in their cause they are o'ercome;</l>
				<l>Subject them too, by force of arms, to <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
						>Rome</placeName>.</l>
				<l>Great father Mars with greater Caesar join,</l>
				<l>To give a prosperous omen to your line;</l>
				<l>One of you is, and one shall be divine.</l>

							key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> by the servants, in remembrance of a
						great piece of service their predecessors had done the Romans, soon after
						the invasion of the Gauls; the time of celebrating it was in July. It was
						done in honour of <placeName key="tgn,2075297">Juno</placeName> Caprotina
						according to Macrobius, in his Saturnalia, book i. chap. 2. The free maidens
						and servants, says the same author, sacrificed on that day to Juno, under a
						wild fig-tree, called in Latin Caprilicus, in memory of that complaisant
						virtue which inspired the servant maids to expose themselves to the lust and
						revenge of the enemy for the preservation of the public honour. For after
						the Gauls had taken the city, and were driven out again, when things were
						restored to their former order, the neighbouring nations believing the
						Romans were very much weakened by the late invasion, siege, and sack, took
						hold of that opportunity to invade them, choosing Posthumius Livius of
						Fidenes for their chief, and demanded of the senate, that if they would
						preserve their city and authority, they should send them their wives and
						daughters. The senators taking the matter into consideration, could not tell
						what answer to return. They knew their own weakness and the strength of
						their enemies; and in this uncertainty a servant-maid called Tutelar, or
						Philotis. offered to go with some other maids of the same condition to the
						enemy. This proposal was generally liked, and accordingly the maids were
						dressed like the wives of the senators, and the daughters of free citizens,
						and went weeping to put themselves into the hands of the invaders. Livius
						ordered them to be dispersed into several quarters; and, as they had agreed
						among themselves, they tempted their new husbands to drink, pretending that
						day ought to be celebrated as a festival; and when they were almost dead
						drunk they gave the Romans a signal from the top of a fig-tree to fall on.
						The latter were encamped not far off; and at this signal they assautled and
						easily mastered the enemy's camp. putting most of them to the sword. The
						senate, to reward this important service, ordered that the servants should
						be made free, that they should have portions paid to them out of the public
						treasury, and allowed them to wear the ornaments they had taken. The day on
						which this happy expedition was executed, was called the Caprotine nones,
						from the wild fig-tree Caprificus, from whence the signa was given to the
						Romans to sally out and gain so glorious a victory; in remembrance of which
						action the servants sacrificed every year under this or some other fig-tree.

						dedicated in the temple of his father Julius Caesar. This piece was at last
						ruined by time, and Nero put another in its place, drawn by Dorotheus.
						Apelles had begun another Venus for the inhabitants of Cos, which would have

				<l>Let not your passions o'er your sense prevail,</l>
				<l>Nor credit lightly ev'ry idle tale.</l>
				<l>Let Procris' fate a sad example be</l>
				<l>Of what effects attend credulity. <milestone ed="p" n="687" unit="carte"/></l>
				<l>Near where his purple head Hymettus shows,</l>
				<l>And flow'ring hills, a sacred fountain flows;</l>
				<l>With soft and verdant turf the soil is spread,</l>
				<l>And sweetly smelling shrubs the ground o'ershade.</l>
				<l>There rosemary and bays their odours join,</l>
				<l>And with the fragrant myrtle's scent combine.</l>
				<l>There tamarisks with thick-leav'd box are found,</l>
				<l>And cytisus and garden pines abound.</l>
				<l>While through the boughs soft winds of Zephyr pass,</l>
				<l>Tremble the leaves and tender tops of grass.</l>
				<l>Hither would Cephalus retreat to rest,</l>
				<l>When tir'd with hunting, or with heat oppress'd;</l>
				<l>And, thus, to air the panting youth would pray;</l>
				<l>Come, gentle Aura, come, this heat allay."</l>
				<l>But some tale-bearing too officious friend,</l>
				<l>By chance o'erheard him as he thus complain'd;</l>
				<l>Who with the news to Procris quick repair'd,</l>
				<l>Repeating word for word what she had heard.</l>
				<l>Soon as the news of Aura reach'd her ears,</l>
				<l>With jealousy surpris'd. and fainting fears,</l>
				<l>Her rosy colour fled her lovely face,</l>
				<l>And agonies like death supplied the place;</l>
				<l>Pale she appear'd as are the falling leaves</l>
				<l>When first the vine the winter's blast receives.</l>
				<l>Of ripen'd quinces, such the yellow hue,</l>
				<l>Or, when unripe, we cornel-berries view.</l>
				<l>Reviving from her swoon, her robes she tore,</l>
				<l>Nor her own faultless face to wound forbore;</l>
				<l>Now all dishevell'd to the woods she flies,</l>
				<l>With Bacchanalian fury in her eyes.<note anchored="true" place="foot" resp="ed"
						>The priestesses and priests of Bacchus, who celebrated the festival of that
						god, did it with the noise of shouts, drums, timbrels, and cymbals, were
						crowned with ivy, vine, etc., and carried a thyrsus or staff wove with it in
						their hands; they were frantic and outrageous in their actions during the
						cerremony.</note></l>
				<l>Thither arriv'd, she leaves below her friends,</l>
				<l>And all alone the shady hill ascends.</l>
				<l>What fully, Procris, o'er thy mind prevail'd?</l>
				<l>What rage, thus fatally to lie conceal'd?</l>
				<l>"Who'er this Aura be," such was thy thought,</l>
				<l>"She now shall in the very fact be caught "</l>
				<l>Anon thy heart repents its rash designs,</l>
				<l>And now to go, and now to stay, inclines;</l>
				<l>Thus love with doubts perplexes still thy mind,</l>
				<l>And makes thee seek what thou must dread to find.</l>
				<l>But still the rival's name rings in thy ears,</l>
				<l>And more suspicious still the place appears;</l>
				<l>But more than all, excessive love deceives,</l>
				<l>Which all it fears too easily believes.</l>
				<l>And now a chillness runs thro' ev'ry vein,</l>
				<l>Soon as she saw where Cephalus had lain.</l>
				<l>'Twas noon when he again retir'd, to shun</l>
				<l>The scorching ardour of the mid-day's sun;</l>
				<l>With water first he sprinkled o'er his face</l>
				<l>Which glow'd with heat; then sought his usual place.</l>
				<l>Procris, with anxious but with silent care,</l>
				<l>View'd him extended, with his bosom bare;</l>
				<l>And heard him soon th' accustom'd words repeat,</l>
				<l>" Come Zephyr, Aura come, allay this heat."</l>
				<l>Soon as she found her error, from the word,</l>
				<l>Her colour and her temper were restor'd;</l>
				<l>With joy she rose to clasp him in her arms,</l>
				<l>But Cephalus the rustling noise alarms;</l>
				<l>Some beast he thinks he in the bushes hears,</l>
				<l>And straight his arrows and his bow prepares.</l>
				<l>Hold, hold, unhappy youth!-I call in vain;</l>
				<l>With thy own hand thou hast thy Procris slain</l>
				<l>" Me, me," she cries, " thou'st wounded with thy dart;</l>
				<l>But Cephalus was wont to wound this heart.</l>
				<l>Yet lighter on my ashes earth will lie,</l>
				<l>Since, tho' untimely, I unrivall'd die!</l>
				<l>Come, close with thy dear hand my eyes in death;</l>
				<l>Jealous of air, to air I yield my breath."</l>
				<l>Close to his heavy heart her cheek he laid,</l>
				<l>And wash'd with streaming tears the wound he made;</l>
				<l>At length the springs of life their currents leave,</l>
				<l>And her last gasp her husband's lips receive. <milestone ed="p" n="747"

				<l>Now to pursue our voyage we must provide,</l>
				<l>Till safe to port our weary bark we guide.</l>
				<l>You may expect, perhaps, I now should teach</l>
				<l>What rules to treats and entertainments reach.</l>
				<l>Come not the first, invited to a feast;</l>
				<l>Rather come last, as a more grateful guest,</l>
				<l>For that of which we fear to be depriv'd,</l>
				<l>Meets with the surest welcome when arriv'd.</l>
				<l>Besides, complexions of a coarser kind,</l>
				<l>From candle-light no small advantage find.</l>
				<l>During the time you eat, observe some grace,</l>
				<l>Nor let your unwip'd hands besmear your face;</l>
				<l>Nor yet too squeamishly your meat avoid,</l>
				<l>Lest we suspect you were in private cloy'd.</l>
				<l>Of all extremes in either kind forbear</l>
				<l>And still, before your belly's full, beware.</l>
				<l>No glutton nymph, however fair, can wound,</l>
				<l>Tho' more than Helen she in charms abound.</l>
				<l>I own I think of wire the moderate use</l>
				<l>More suits the sex, and sooner finds excuse;</l>
				<l>It warms the blood, adds lustre to the eyes,</l>
				<l>And wine and love have always been allies.</l>
				<l>But carefully from all intemperance keep,</l>
				<l>Nor drink till you see double, lisp, or sleep;</l>
				<l>For in such sleeps brutalities are done,</l>
				<l>Which, tho' you loath, you have no pow'r to shun.</l>
				<l>And now th' instructed nymph from table led,</l>
				<l>Should next be taught how to behave in bed;--</l>
				<l>But modesty forbids: nor more my muse</l>
				<l>With weary wings the labour'd flight pursues;</l>
				<l>Her purple swans unyok'd, the chariot leave,<note anchored="true" place="foot"
						resp="ed">To show that he treats of love affairs, represented by the swans
						that are said to draw <placeName key="tgn,2096104">Venus</placeName>' car
						sometimes; though doves are more often harnessed on this occasion. As to
						swans, <placeName key="tgn,2016081">Ovid</placeName> observes in his
						Metamorphoses, that they were put to this use.</note></l>
				<l>And needful rest (their journey done) receive.</l>
				<l>Thus, with impartial care, my art I show,</l>
				<l>And equal arms on either sex bestow;</l>
				<l>White men and maids, who by my rules improve,</l>
				<l><placeName key="tgn,2025973">Ovid</placeName>, must own, their master is in
					love.</l>
