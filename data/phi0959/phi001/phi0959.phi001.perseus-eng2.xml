					<head>Elegy I: By Dryden</head>
					<l n="1">For mighty wars I thought to tune my lute,</l>
					<l n="2">And make my measures to my subject suit.</l>
					<l n="3">Six feet for ev'ry verse the muse design'd,</l>
					<l n="4">But Cupid laughing, when he saw my mind,</l>
					<l n="5">From ev'ry second verse a foot purloin'd.</l>
					<l n="6">"Who gave thee, boy, this arbitrary sway,</l>
					<l n="7">On subjects, not thy own, commands to lay,</l>
					<l n="8">Who Phoebus only, and his laws obey ?</l>
					<l n="9">'Tis more absurd, than if the queen of love</l>
					<l n="10">Should in Minerva's arms to battle move;</l>
					<l n="11">Or manly Pallas from that queen should take</l>
					<l n="12">Her torch, and o'er the dying lover shake.</l>
					<l n="13">In fields as well may Cynthia sow the corn,</l>
					<l n="14">Or <placeName key="tgn,1092955">Ceres</placeName> wind in woods the
						bugle-horn;</l>
					<l n="15">As well may Phoebus quit the trembling string,</l>
					<l n="16">For sword and shield; and Mars may learn to sing.</l>
					<l n="17">Already thy dominions are too large;</l>
					<l n="18">Be not ambitious of a foreign charge.</l>
					<l n="19">If thou wilt reign o'er all, and ev'ry where,</l>
					<l n="20">The god of music for his harp may fear.</l>
					<l n="21">Thus when with soaring wings I seek renown,</l>
					<l n="22">Thou pluck'st my pinions, and I flutter down.</l>
					<l n="23">Could I on such mean thoughts my muse employ,</l>
					<l n="24">I want a mistress, or a blooming boy."</l>
					<l n="25">Thus I complain'd; his bow the stripling bent,</l>
					<l n="26">And chose an arrow fit for his intent.</l>
					<l n="27">The shaft his purpose fatally pursues;</l>
					<l n="28">" Now, poet, there's a subject for thy muse,"</l>
					<l n="29">He said: (too well, alas, he knows his trade,)</l>
					<l n="30">For in my breast a mortal wound he made.</l>
					<l n="31">Far hence ye proud Hexameters remove,</l>
					<l n="32">My verse is pac'd, and tramell'd into love.</l>
					<l n="33">With myrtle wreaths my thoughtful brows enclose,</l>
					<l n="34">While in unequal verse I sing my woes. </l>

					<l n="1">Ah me! why am I so uneasy grown?</l>
					<l n="2">Ah! why so restless on my bed of down?</l>
					<l n="3">Why do I wish to sleep, but wish in vain?</l>
					<l n="4">Why am I all the tedious night in pain?</l>
					<l n="5">What cause is this, that ease, that rest denies?</l>
					<l n="6">And why my words break forth in gentle sighs?</l>
					<l n="7">Sure I should know if love had fix'd his dart;</l>
					<l n="8">Or creeps he softly in with treacherous art,</l>
					<l n="9">And then grows tyrant, there and wounds the heart?</l>
					<l n="10">'Tis so, the shaft sticks deep, and galls my breast;</l>
					<l n="11">'Tis tyrant love, that robs my thoughts of rest!</l>
					<l n="12">Well, shall I tamely yield, or must I fight?</l>
					<l n="13">I'll yield; 'tis patience makes a burden light:</l>
					<l n="14">A shaken torch grows fierce, and sparks arise;</l>
					<l n="15">But, if unmov'd, the fire looks pale and dies.</l>
					<l n="16">The hard-mouth'd horse smarts for his fierce disdain</l>
					<l n="17">The gentle's ridden with a looser rein.</l>
					<l n="18">Love smooths the gentle, but the fierce reclaims;</l>
					<l n="19">He fires their breasts, and fills their souls with flames.</l>
					<l n="20">I yield; great Love, my former crimes forgive,</l>
					<l n="21">Forget my rebel thoughts, and let me live;</l>
					<l n="22">No need of force: I willingly obey,</l>
					<l n="23">And now unarm'd, shall prove no glorious prey.</l>
					<l n="24">Go take thy mother's doves, thy myrtle crown,</l>
					<l n="25">And for thy chariot, Mars shall lend his own;</l>
					<l n="26">There thou shalt sit in thy triumphant pride,</l>
					<l n="27">And, whilst glad shouts resound on ev'ry side,</l>
					<l n="28">Thy gentle hands thy mother's doves shall guide.</l>
					<l n="29">And there to make thy glorious pomp and state,</l>
					<l n="30">A train of sighing youths, and maids shall wait,</l>
					<l n="31">Yet none complain of an unhappy fate.</l>
					<l n="32">There newly conquer'd I, still fresh my wound,</l>
					<l n="33">Will march along, my hands with myrtle bound;</l>
					<l n="34">There modesty, with veils thrown o'er her face,</l>
					<l n="35">Now doubly blushing at her own disgrace;</l>
					<l n="36">There sober thoughts, and whatso'er disdains</l>
					<l n="37">Love's rules, shall feel his power, and bear his chains:</l>
					<l n="38">Then all shall fear, all bow, yet all rejoice;</l>
					<l n="39">"Io triumphe" be the public voice.</l>
					<l n="40">Thy constant guards, soft fancy, hope and fear,</l>
					<l n="41">Anger, and soft caresses shall be there:</l>
					<l n="42">By these strong guards are men and gods o'erthrown;</l>
					<l n="43">These conquer for thee, Love, and these alone,</l>
					<l n="44">Thy mother, from the sky thy pomp shall grace,</l>
					<l n="45">And scatter sweetest roses in thy face:</l>
					<l n="46">There glorious Love shall ride, profusely dress'd</l>
					<l n="47">With all the richest jewels of the east:</l>
					<l n="48">Rich gems thy quiver, and thy wheels infold,</l>
					<l n="49">And hide the poorness of the baser gold.</l>
					<l n="50">Then thou shalt conquer many, then.thy darts</l>
					<l n="51">Shall scatter thousand wounds on tender hearts:</l>
					<l n="52">Thy shafts themselves will fly, thy neighb'ring fire</l>
					<l n="53">Will catch mens' breasts, and kindle warm desire.</l>
					<l n="54">Thus conqu'ring <placeName key="tgn,2097807">Bacchus</placeName> looks in
						Indian groves,</l>
					<l n="55">He drawn by tigers, thou by murm'ring doves.</l>
					<l n="56">Well then, since I too can increase thy train,</l>
					<l n="57">Spend not thy force on me, and rage in vain;</l>
					<l n="58">Look on thy kinsman Caesar's happy slaves,</l>
					<l n="59">The same victorious arm that conquers, saves. </l>

					<l n="1">Be just, dear maid, an equal passion prove,</l>
					<l n="2">Or show me cause why I should ever love.</l>
					<l n="3">I do not at your cold disdain repine,</l>
					<l n="4">Nor ask your love, do you but suffer mine.</l>
					<l n="5">I dare not aim at more exalted bliss,</l>
					<l n="6">And Venus will bestow her vot'ry this.</l>
					<l n="7">Take hin, who will for endless ages serve:</l>
					<l n="8">Take him whose faithful flame will never swerve</l>
					<l n="9">Though no illustrious names my race adorn;</l>
					<l n="10">Who am but of equestrian order born;</l>
					<l n="11">Though a few ploughs serve my paternal fields,</l>
					<l n="12">Nor my small table many dishes yields;</l>
					<l n="13">Yet Bacchus, Phoebus, and the tuneful nine,</l>
					<l n="14">Are all my friends, and to my side incline,</l>
					<l n="15">And love's great god, at last, will make me thine.</l>
					<l n="16">Heav'n knows, dear maid, I love no other fair;</l>
					<l n="17">In thee lives all my love, my heav'n lies there.</l>
					<l n="18">Oh! may I by indulgent Fate's decree,</l>
					<l n="19">With thee lead all my life, and die with thee.</l>
					<l n="20">Thy beauties yield me my transporting theme;</l>
					<l n="21">And while I celebrate thy charming name,</l>
					<l n="22">My verse shall be as sacred as my flame.</l>
					<l n="23">Jove's sev'ral rapes, his injur'd Io's wrongs,</l>
					<l n="24">Are made immortal in his poet's songs.</l>
					<l n="25">Verse still reveals where Leda's flames began,</l>
					<l n="26">Rais'd by the secret godhead in the swan,</l>
					<l n="27">The story of the rape Europa bore,</l>
					<l n="28">Shall last while winds shall rage, or waters roar.</l>
					<l n="29">Your name shall live like theirs, while verse endures,</l>
					<l n="30">And mine be ever writ, and read with yours. </l>

					<head>Elegy IV: To His Mistress, whose husband is invited to a feast with him.
						The poet instructed her how to behave herself in his company. By <placeName key="tgn,1014723">Dryden</placeName>.</head>
					<l n="1">Your husband will be with us at the treat,</l>
					<l n="2">May that be the last supper he shall eat.</l>
					<l n="3">And am poor I, a guest invited there,</l>
					<l n="4">Only to see, while he may touch the fair?</l>
					<l n="5">To see you kiss, and hug your nauseous lord,</l>
					<l n="6">While his lewd hand descends below the board?</l>
					<l n="7">No wonder that Hippodamia's charms,</l>
					<l n="8">At such a sight, the Centaurs urg'd to arms:</l>
					<l n="9">That in a rage, they threw their cups aside,</l>
					<l n="10">Assail'd the bridegroom, and would force the bride.</l>
					<l n="11">I am not half a horse, (I would I were :)</l>
					<l n="12">Yet hardly can from you my hands forbear.</l>
					<l n="13">Take, then, my counsel; which observ'd, may be,</l>
					<l n="14">Of some importance both to you and me.</l>
					<l n="15">Be sure to come before your man be there,</l>
					<l n="16">There's nothing can be done, but come howe'er.</l>
					<l n="17">Sit next him, (that belongs to decency;)</l>
					<l n="18">But tread upon my foot in passing by.</l>
					<l n="19">Read in my looks what silently they speak,</l>
					<l n="20">And slily, with your eyes, your answer make.</l>
					<l n="21">My lifted eye-brow shall declare my pain,</l>
					<l n="22">My right hand to his fellow shall complain;</l>
					<l n="23">And on the back a letter shall design,</l>
					<l n="24">Beside a note that shall be writ in wine.</l>
					<l n="25">Whene'er you think upon our last embrace,</l>
					<l n="26">With your fore-finger gently touch your face.</l>
					<l n="27">If any word of mine offend my dear,</l>
					<l n="28">Pull with your hand the velvet of your ear;</l>
					<l n="29">If you are pleas'd with what I do or say,</l>
					<l n="30">Handle your rings, or vith your fingers play.</l>
					<l n="31">As suppliants use at altars, hold the board,</l>
					<l n="32">Whene'er you wish the devil may take your lord.</l>
					<l n="33">When he fills for you, never touch the cup,</l>
					<l n="34">But bid th' officious cuckold drink it up:</l>
					<l n="35">The waiter on those services employ;</l>
					<l n="36">Drink you, and I will snatch it from the boy,</l>
					<l n="37">Watching the part where your sweet mouth hath been,</l>
					<l n="38">And thence, with eager lips, will suck it in.</l>
					<l n="39">If he, with clownish manners, thinks it fit</l>
					<l n="40">To taste, and offer you the nasty bit,</l>
					<l n="41">Reject his greasy kindness, and restore</l>
					<l n="42">Th' unsav'ry morsel he had chew'd before.</l>
					<l n="43">Nor let his arms embrace your neck, nor rest</l>
					<l n="44">Your tender cheek upon his hairy breast;</l>
					<l n="45">Let not his hand within your bosom stray,</l>
					<l n="46">And rudely with your pretty bubbies play.</l>
					<l n="47">But, above all, let him no kiss receive,</l>
					<l n="48">That's an offence I never can forgive;</l>
					<l n="49">Do not, oh! do not that sweet mouth resign,</l>
					<l n="50">Lest I rise up in arms, and cry 'tis mine.</l>
					<l n="51">I shall thrust in betwixt, and void of fear</l>
					<l n="52">The manifest adult'rer will appear.</l>
					<l n="53">These things are plain to sight, but more I doubt</l>
					<l n="54">What you conceal beneath your petticoat;</l>
					<l n="55">Take not his leg between your tender thighs,</l>
					<l n="56">Nor with your hand provoke my foe to rise.</l>
					<l n="57">How many love inventions I deplore,</l>
					<l n="58">Which I myself have practis'd all before !</l>
					<l n="59">How oft have I been forc'd the robe to lift</l>
					<l n="60">In company; to make a homely shift</l>
					<l n="61">For a bare bout, ill huddled o'er in haste,</l>
					<l n="62">While o'er my side the fair her mantle cast!</l>
					<l n="63">You to your husband shall not be so kind,</l>
					<l n="64">But lest you should, your mantle leave behind.</l>
					<l n="65">Encourage him to tope, but kiss him not,</l>
					<l n="66">Nor mix one drop of water in his pot.</l>
					<l n="67">If he be fuddled well, and snores apace,</l>
					<l n="68">Then we may take advice from time and place.</l>
					<l n="69">When all depart, while compliments are loud,</l>
					<l n="70">Be sure to mix among the thickest crowd;</l>
					<l n="71">There I will be, and there we cannot miss,</l>
					<l n="72">Perhaps to grubble, or at least to kiss.</l>
					<l n="73">Alas, what length of labor I employ,</l>
					<l n="74">Just to secure a short and transient joy!</l>
					<l n="75">For night must part us, and when night is come</l>
					<l n="76">Tuck'd underneath his arm, he leads you home.</l>
					<l n="77">He locks you in, I follow to the door,</l>
					<l n="78">His fortune envy, and my own deplore;</l>
					<l n="79">He kisses you, he more than kisses too,</l>
					<l n="80">Th' outrageous cuckold thinks it all his due.</l>
					<l n="81">But add not to his joy by your consent,</l>
					<l n="82">And let it not be given, but only lent;</l>
					<l n="83">Return no kiss, nor move in any sort,</l>
					<l n="84">Make it a dull and a malignant sport.</l>
					<l n="85">Had I my wish he should no pleasure take,</l>
					<l n="86">But slubber o'er your bus'ness for my sake;</l>
					<l n="87">And whate'er fortune shall this night befall,</l>
					<l n="88">Coax me to morrow by forswearing all. </l>

					<l n="1">'Twas noon when I, scorch'd with the double fire</l>
					<l n="2">Of the hot sun and my more hot desire,</l>
					<l n="3">Stretch'd on my downy couch at ease was laid,</l>
					<l n="4">Big with expectance of the lovely maid.</l>
					<l n="5">The curtains but half drawn, a light let in</l>
					<l n="6">Such as in shades of thickest groves is seen,</l>
					<l n="7">Such as remains when the sun flies away,</l>
					<l n="8">Or when night's gone, and yet it is not day.</l>
					<l n="9">This light to modest maids must be allow'd,</l>
					<l n="10">Where shame may hope its guilty head to shroud.</l>
					<l n="11">And now my love <placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName> did
						appear,</l>
					<l n="12">Loose on her neck fell her divided hair;</l>
					<l n="13">Loose as her flowing gown, that wanton'd in the air.</l>
					<l n="14">In such a garb, with such a grace and mien,</l>
					<l n="15">To her rich bed came the Assyrian queen;</l>
					<l n="16">So Lais looked when all the youth of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName></l>
					<l n="17">With adoration did her charms confess.</l>
					<l n="18">Her envious gown to pull away I tried,</l>
					<l n="19">But she resisted still, and still denied;</l>
					<l n="20">But so resisted that she seem'd to be</l>
					<l n="21">Unwilling to obtain the victory;</l>
					<l n="22">So I at last an easy conquest had,</l>
					<l n="23">Whilst my fair combatant herself betray'd.</l>
					<l n="24">But when she naked stood before my eyes,</l>
					<l n="25">Gods, with what charms did she my soul surprise!</l>
					<l n="26">What snowy arms did I both see and feel!</l>
					<l n="27">With what rich globes did her soft bosom swell!</l>
					<l n="28">Plump as ripe clusters rose each glowing breast,</l>
					<l n="29">Courting the hand, and suing to be press'd!</l>
					<l n="30">What a smooth plain was on her belly spread,</l>
					<l n="31">Where thousand little loves and graces play'd!</l>
					<l n="32">What thighs! what legs ! but why strive I in vain,</l>
					<l n="33">Each limb, each grace, each feature to explain</l>
					<l n="34">One beauty did through her whole body shine;</l>
					<l n="35">I saw, admir'd, and press'd it close to mine</l>
					<l n="36">The rest who knows not? Thus entranc'd we lay,</l>
					<l n="37">Till in each other's arms we died away;</l>

					<l n="3">Unbar the wicket, and a friend admit;</l>
					<l n="4">The trouble is not much, nor favour great.</l>
					<l n="5">I ask thee not to spread the foldings wide;</l>
					<l n="6">Keep it at jar,-I'll softly by thee slide.</l>
					<l n="7">I to love's labours have so long been us'd,</l>

					<l n="15">I wonder'd men could wander in the gloom,</l>

					<l n="22">The streets a-nights, and grew in peril bold.</l>
					<l n="23">Thee only do I fear, and trembling stand</l>
					<l n="24">To wait the motions of thy tardy hand:</l>

					<l n="29">Remember, when thou for the lash wert stripp'd</l>
					<l n="30">Who sav'd thee, at whose suit thou wert not whipp'd.</l>
					<l n="31">Did not I sooth thy angry lady's mind,</l>
					<l n="32">And make thy peace? Be thou to me as kind.</l>
					<l n="33">Think what soft things to move her soul I said,</l>
					<l n="34">And let them in a lover's favour plead.</l>
					<l n="35">But ah! the tender things that made her kind,</l>

					<l n="42">May she to loose thy hateful chains incline,</l>
					<l n="43">And stead of water, be thy portion wine.</l>
					<l n="44">But what avail my soothing words? Thy ear</l>
					<l n="45">Is deaf, inhuman! to my moving pray'r.</l>
					<l n="46">Your gates with posts of pond'rous oak are barr'd,</l>
					<l n="47">As if your house was for a siege prepar'd;</l>
					<l n="48">Why all this fence? what foe have you to fear?</l>
					<l n="49">And why in peace do you provide for war?</l>
					<l n="50">Thus rudely if your lady's friends you treat,</l>
					<l n="51">What usage must her foes expect to meet?</l>
					<l n="52">Unlock the gate,-the morning will not stay;</l>
					<l n="53">Unlock the gate, and give my love its way.</l>
					<l n="54">Or is it sloth or is it sleep that brings,</l>
					<l n="55">This let to love, and pinions down his wings!</l>
					<l n="56">Why else do I in vain repeat my prayer,</l>
					<l n="57">Is it, thou dost not, or thou wilt not hear?</l>
					<l n="58">When first I waited at thy gate, and thought</l>
					<l n="59">To 'scape thy care, I was at midnight caught.</l>
					<l n="60">With over-dilligence thou then look'st out,</l>
					<l n="61">To spy what lover was upon the scout.</l>
					<l n="62">These are wild guesses, thou'rt perhaps employ'd</l>
					<l n="63">More sweetly, and enjoy'st what I enjoy'd.</l>
					<l n="64">And while I'm waiting with impatience here,</l>
					<l n="65">Thy envied fortune's with the faithless fair.</l>
					<l n="66">Oh, for thy pleasure, give me all thy pains,</l>
					<l n="67">Let us change chances, and be mine thy chains.</l>
					<l n="68">Unlock the gate, the morning will not stay,</l>
					<l n="69">Unlock the gate, and kindness past repay.</l>
					<l n="70">Hark: or I dream, or on the hinge I hear</l>
					<l n="71">The wicket turn, or bolts unloosen'd jar.</l>
					<l n="72">I dream, indeed, the bolts as they were laid,</l>
					<l n="73">Stand fix'd: the noise was by my fancy made.</l>
					<l n="74">But all, alas! is hush'd, I hear no sound,</l>
					<l n="75">All in the silence of the night is drown'd.</l>
					<l n="76">Here, hopeless of admittance, I attend,</l>
					<l n="77">While on my head the pearly dews descend.</l>
					<l n="78">Unlock the gate, the morning will not stay,</l>
					<l n="79">Unlock the gate, I will no longer pray,</l>
					<l n="80">But force by sword and fire my readier way.</l>
					<l n="81">What need of fire or sword? myself alone,</l>
					<l n="82">More pow'rful, than or sword or fire am grown.</l>
					<l n="83">Around your heads shall flaming torches fly,</l>
					<l n="84">And Jove the house shall burn, as well as I.</l>
					<l n="85">Night, love, and wine encourage and inflame:</l>
					<l n="86">These triumph over fear, and that o'er shame.</l>
					<l n="87">All ways I've tried, but all successless prove,</l>
					<l n="88">Nor threats can fright thee, nor entreaties move;</l>
					<l n="89">Deaf to my pray'rs as to my tears thou'rt blind,</l>
					<l n="90">Thy gate is less obdurate than thy mind.</l>
					<l n="91">But see, the ruddy morn begins to rise,</l>
					<l n="92">And paints with rosy streaks the eastern skies,</l>
					<l n="93">While crowing cocks the lab'rer's sloth revile,</l>
					<l n="94">And summon wretches to their daily toil.</l>
					<l n="95">Throw then, fond man, thy fragrant chaplet by,</l>
					<l n="96">And let it at thy lady's threshold lie.</l>
					<l n="97">When in the morn thy faded flow'rs she spies,</l>
					<l n="98">Kind thoughts of me may in her bosom rise,</l>
					<l n="99">Perhaps she may resent her porter's crime,</l>
					<l n="100">And grieve that here so ill I spent my time.</l>
					<l n="101">Against me though thou shut'st thy lady's gate,</l>
					<l n="102">I cannot one, that serves my mistress, hate.</l>
					<l n="103">You both who did against my hopes rebel,</l>
					<l n="104">Ah, porter; and ah, cruel gate, farewell. </l>

					<l n="7">Then I had broke the most religious ties,</l>

					<l n="3">Her youth and beauty, craft and guile supply,</l>

					<l n="15">Her ready tongue ne'er wants a useful lie,</l>
					<l n="16">Soft moving words, nor charming flattery.</l>
					<l n="17">Thus I o'erheard her to my <placeName key="tgn,2075531">Lucia</placeName>

					<l n="22">If to the plays, he thinks the air would kill.</l>
					<l n="23">The other day he gaz'd upon thy face,</l>
					<l n="24">As he would grow a statue in the place;</l>
					<l n="25">And who indeed does not? like a new star,</l>

					<l n="27">Alas! methinks thou art ill-dress'd to-night;</l>
					<l n="28">This point's too poor; thy necklace is not right;</l>
					<l n="29">This gown was by some botching tailor made,</l>
					<l n="30">It spoils thy shape; this fucus is ill laid.</l>
					<l n="31">Hear me, and be as happy as thou'rt fair:</l>
					<l n="32">Damon is rich, and what thou wanst, can spare.</l>
					<l n="33">Like thine his face, like thine his eyes are thought.</l>

					<l n="38">And she is best belov'd that best is paid;</l>
					<l n="39">The sun-burnt Latins, in old Tatius' reign,</l>
					<l n="40">Did to one man perhaps their love restrain:</l>
					<l n="41"><placeName key="tgn,2096104">Venus</placeName> in her Aeneas' city rules,</l>

					<l n="46">Ere the true use or worth of them be known.</l>
					<l n="47">Things long neglected, of themselves decay;</l>
					<l n="48">What we forbear, time rudely makes his prey.</l>
					<l n="49">Beauty is best preserv'd by exercise,</l>

					<l n="65">No empty lover in; murmur sometimes,</l>
					<l n="66">And at first hurt, reproach him with thy crimes.</l>
					<l n="67">Seem jealous, when thou'st been thyself to blame;</l>

					<l n="71">Whilst lie is with thee, let some woman bring</l>
					<l n="72">Some Indian stuff or foreign precious thing;</l>
					<l n="73">Which thou must say thou want'st, and he must buy,</l>
					<l n="74">Though for it six months hence in gaol he lie.</l>
					<l n="75">Thy mother, sister, brother, and thy nurse,</l>
					<l n="76">Must have a pull each at thy lover's purse.</l>
					<l n="77">Let him from rivals never be secure,</l>
					<l n="78">That hope once gone, love will not long endure;</l>
					<l n="79">Show him the presents by those rivals sent,</l>
					<l n="80">So shall his bounty thy request prevent.</l>
					<l n="81">When he will give no more, ask him to lend:</l>

					<l n="85">Practise these rules, thou'lt find the benefit!</l>
					<l n="86">I lost my beauty ere I got this wit."</l>
					<l n="87">I at that word step'd from behind the door,</l>
					<l n="88">And scarce my nails from her thin cheeks forbore.</l>
					<l n="89">Her few gray hairs in rage I vow'd to pull,</l>
					<l n="90">And thrust her drunken eyes into her skull.</l>

					<head>Elegy IX: Of Love and War. By Henry Cromwell.</head>
					<l n="1">Trust me, my Atticus, in love are wars;</l>
					<l n="2">And Cupid has his camp, as well as <placeName key="tgn,2090583">Mars</placeName>:</l>
					<l n="3">The age that's fit for war best suits with love,</l>
					<l n="4">The old in both unserviceable prove,</l>
					<l n="5">Infirm in war, and impotent in love.</l>
					<l n="6">The soldiers which a general does require,</l>
					<l n="7">Are such as ladies would in bed desire:</l>
					<l n="8">Who but a soldier, and a lover, can</l>
					<l n="9">Bear the night's cold, in show'rs of hail and rain?</l>
					<l n="10">One in continual watch his station keeps,</l>
					<l n="11">Or on the earth in broken slumbers sleeps;</l>
					<l n="12">The other takes his still repeated round</l>
					<l n="13">By mistress' house — then lodges on the ground.</l>
					<l n="14">Soldiers, and lovers, with a careful eye,</l>
					<l n="15">Observe the motions of the enemy:</l>
					<l n="16">One to the walls makes his approach in form,</l>
					<l n="17">Pushes the siege, and takes the town by storm:</l>
					<l n="18">The other lays his close to Celia's fort,</l>
					<l n="19">Presses his point, and gains the wish'd-for port.</l>
					<l n="20">As soldiers, when the foe securely lies</l>
					<l n="21">In sleep, and wine dissolv'd, the camp surprise;</l>
					<l n="22">So when the jealous to their rest remove,</l>
					<l n="23">And all is hush'd, — the other steals to love.</l>
					<l n="24">You then, who think that love's an idle fit,</l>
					<l n="25">Know, that it is the exercise of wit.</l>
					<l n="26">In flames of love the fierce Achilles burns,</l>
					<l n="27">And, quitting arms, absent Briseis mourns:</l>
					<l n="28">From the embraces of Andromache</l>
					<l n="29">Went Hector arm'd for war, and victory.</l>
					<l n="30">As Agamemnon saw Cassandra pass</l>
					<l n="31">With hair dishevell'd, and disorder'd dress,</l>
					<l n="32">H' admir'd the beauties of the prophetess:</l>
					<l n="33">The god of war was caught in th' act of love;</l>
					<l n="34">A story know to all the court above.</l>
					<l n="35">Once did I pass my hours in sloth and ease,</l>
					<l n="36">Cool shades and beds of down could only please;</l>
					<l n="37">When a commanding beauty rais'd my mind,</l>
					<l n="38">I left all little trifling thoughts behind,</l>
					<l n="39">And to her service all my heart resign'd:</l>
					<l n="40">Since, like an active soldier, have I spent</l>
					<l n="41">My time in toils of war, in beauty's tent:</l>
					<l n="42">And for so sweet a pay all dangers underwent.</l>

					<l n="29">Pray her, when she has read it, to indite</l>

					<l n="35">But why should I her pretty fingers tire?</l>

					<head>Elegy XIII: To the Morning, not to make haste. By an unknown hand.</head>
					<l n="1">Aurora, rising from old Tithon's bed,</l>
					<l n="2">Does o'er the eastern skies her roses spread:</l>
					<l n="3">Stay, beauteous morn, awhile thy chariot stay,</l>
					<l n="4">Awhile with lagging wheels retard the day.</l>
					<l n="5">So may young birds, as often as the spring</l>
					<l n="6">Renews the year, o'er Memnon's ashes sing.</l>
					<l n="7">Now I lie folded in <placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName>'s
						arms,</l>
					<l n="8">And all her soul is mine, and all her charms;</l>
					<l n="9">I now am to her panting bosom press'd,</l>
					<l n="10">And now, if ever lover was, am bless'd.</l>
					<l n="11">As yet sweet sleep sits heavy on our eyes,</l>
					<l n="12">And warbling birds forbid, as yet to rise.</l>
					<l n="13">Stay, beauteous morning, for to love-sick maids</l>
					<l n="14">And youths, how grateful are these dusky shades!</l>
					<l n="15">All stay, and do not, from the blushing east,</l>
					<l n="16">With dawning glories break our balmy rest.</l>
					<l n="17">When night's black mantle does those glories hide,</l>
					<l n="18">The pilot by the stars his ship can guide,</l>
					<l n="19">And in mid-sea a certain course pursue,</l>
					<l n="20">As safe as when he has the sun in view.</l>
					<l n="21">What pleasure in thy light should mortals take?</l>
					<l n="22">Thou dost the weary traveller awake;</l>
					<l n="23">Though to the down his heavy head reclines,</l>
					<l n="24">Up he must lift it for the morning shines.</l>
					<l n="25">The soldier braces on his brazen shield,</l>
					<l n="26">Quits his warm tent, and fits him for the field:</l>
					<l n="27">The lab'ring hind his harrow takes, and now</l>
					<l n="28">The peasant yokes his oxen to the plough:</l>
					<l n="29">The boy half wak'd, and rubbing still his eyes,</l>
					<l n="30">Is loth alike to go to school, or rise;</l>
					<l n="31">While o'er his task he does imperfect nod,</l>
					<l n="32">He fears the ferula, he dreads the rod.</l>
					<l n="33">The bridegroom, starting from his bride's embrace,</l>
					<l n="34">Runs to his lawyer to consult his case;</l>
					<l n="35">A word is wanting in the dower deed,</l>
					<l n="36">And what to save the portion must he plead?</l>
					<l n="37">Now hungry serjeants quit their tempting ease,</l>
					<l n="38">To haunt the crowded courts and pick up fees.</l>
					<l n="39">Thy rise brings labour to the female band,</l>
					<l n="40">And puts the spindle in the spinster's hand:</l>
					<l n="41">Light are these toils, and little is the pain</l>
					<l n="42">To rise to work, and rest at night again;</l>
					<l n="43">But who that e'er knew love's transporting joys,</l>
					<l n="44">Could from the arms of youth and beauty rise?</l>
					<l n="45">Oft have I wish'd that night would keep her ground,</l>
					<l n="46">And all her stars be at thy rising found;</l>
					<l n="47">Oft have I wish'd the winds would stop thy way,</l>
					<l n="48">Repel thy car, or clouds involve the day.</l>
					<l n="49">Dost thou in envy lash each lazy steed,</l>
					<l n="50">And whirl thy chariot with unwonted speed?</l>
					<l n="51">Black was thy son, and in his hue's express'd</l>
					<l n="52">The gloomy passions of his parent's breats;</l>
					<l n="53">He, born of Cephalus, his ravish'd sire,</l>
					<l n="54">Is a known proof of thy adult'rous fire.</l>
					<l n="55">Thou, by his colour, wouldst thy crime conceal;</l>
					<l n="56">Ah, that to Tithon I the tale could tell!</l>
					<l n="57">Search all the records of Heaven's lechers round,</l>
					<l n="58">A fouler story cannot there be found.</l>
					<l n="59">In Cephalus' embraces when you lay,</l>
					<l n="60">And oft by theft renew'd your wanton play;</l>
					<l n="61">When Tithon's impotence you made your sport,</l>
					<l n="62">Did you not think the joyous moments short?</l>
					<l n="63">Lock'd in his arms did you in transports lie,</l>
					<l n="64">Ah! would you not, like me, to Phoebus cry,</l>
					<l n="65">"Stop, stop thy rapid course? Am I to blame</l>
					<l n="66">That Tithon's old, and cannot feel thy flame?</l>
					<l n="67">See how the moon does her Endymion keep</l>
					<l n="68">In night conceal'd, and drown'd in dewy sleep.</l>
					<l n="69">As lovely is the moon, as fair as thou,</l>
					<l n="70">Who freely, where she loves, her favours does bestow.</l>
					<l n="71">Jove, when he rob'd Amphitryon of his joy,</l>
					<l n="72">Did two whole nights in am'rous thefts employ;</l>
					<l n="73">Unknown when in Alcmena's arms he lay,</l>
					<l n="74">The night he doubles and suspends the day."</l>
					<l n="75">The morning heard my railing, and for shame</l>
					<l n="76">Blush'd that by force she must disturb my flame;</l>
					<l n="77">Bright Phoebus rushing forth, the glorious day</l>
					<l n="78">Drove the dear shades, that hid our joys, away. </l>

					<l n="4">And with your hair that trouble too is gone.</l>
					<l n="5">Where are the silken tresses, which adown</l>

					<l n="7">So fine, but, ah! those flowing curls are gone.</l>
					<l n="8">Ah fatal art! ah fatal care, and pains!</l>
					<l n="9">That robb'd me of the dearest of my chains.</l>
					<l n="10">Nor of a black, nor of a golden hue</l>
					<l n="11">They were, but of a dye between the two.</l>
					<l n="12">How could you hurt, or poison with perfume,</l>
					<l n="13">Those curls that were so easy to the comb?</l>
					<l n="14">That to no pains expos'd you, when you set</l>
					<l n="15">Their shining tresses for young hearts a net?</l>
					<l n="16">That ne'er provok'd you with your maids to war,</l>
					<l n="17">For hurting you with your entangled hair?</l>
					<l n="18">You ne'er were urg'd to some indecent fray,</l>
					<l n="19">Nor in a fury snatch'd the comb away.</l>
					<l n="20">The teeth ne'er touch'd you, and her constant care,</l>
					<l n="21">Without ill arts, would have preserv'd your hair.</l>
					<l n="22">Behind your chair I oft have seen her stand,</l>
					<l n="23">And comb and curl it with a gentle hand:</l>
					<l n="24">Oft have I seen it on your shoulders play</l>
					<l n="25">Uncomb'd, as on your purple bed you lay.</l>
					<l n="26">Your artless tresses with more charms appear,</l>
					<l n="27">Than when adorn'd with all your cost and care.</l>

					<l n="36">This rack, with what obedience did it bear?</l>
					<l n="37">"Ah spare," I cried, "thy patient tresses spare!</l>

					<l n="47">Nor canst thou witches' magic charms accuse,</l>
					<l n="48">Nor rival's rage, nor dire enchantment blame,</l>
					<l n="49">Nor envy's blasting tongue, nor fever's flame.</l>
					<l n="50">The mischief by thy own fair hands was wrought;</l>
					<l n="51">Nor dost thou suffer for another's fault.</l>
					<l n="52">How oft I bade thee, but in vain, beware</l>
					<l n="53">The venom'd essence, that destroy'd thy hair?</l>
					<l n="54">Now with new arts thou shalt thy pride amuse,</l>
					<l n="55">And curls, of German captives borrow'd, use.</l>
					<l n="56">Drusus to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> their vanquish'd

					<l n="57">And the fair slave to thee her tresses lends.</l>

					<l n="60">How wilt thou blush, with other charms to please,</l>
					<l n="61">And cry, "How fairer were my locks than these !"</l>
					<l n="62">By heav'ns, to heart she takes her head's disgrace,</l>
					<l n="63">She weeps, and covers with her hands her face.</l>
					<l n="64">She weeps, as in her lap her locks she views;</l>
					<l n="65">What woman would not weep, such locks to lose!</l>
					<l n="66">Ah, that they still did on her shoulders flow,</l>
					<l n="67">Ah, that they now, where once they grew, did grow!</l>
					<l n="68">Take courage, fair <placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName>, never

					<l n="69">Thou shalt not long these borrow'd tresses wear:</l>

					<l n="69">Oh, with what gust as from her soul they came!</l>

					<l n="1">Alas! poor Poll, my Indian talker, dies!</l>
					<l n="2">Go, birds, and celebrate his obsequies;</l>
					<l n="3">Go, birds, and beat your breasts, your faces tear,</l>
					<l n="4">And pluck your gaudy plumes instead of hair;</l>
					<l n="5">Let doleful tunes the frighted forest wound,</l>
					<l n="6">And your sad notes supply the trumpet's sound.</l>
					<l n="7">Why, Philomel, dost mourn the Thracian rage?</l>
					<l n="8">It is enough, thy grief at last assuage;</l>
					<l n="9">His crimson faults are now grown white with age.</l>
					<l n="10">Now mourn this bird; the cause of all thy woe</l>
					<l n="11">Was great, 'tis true, but it was long ago.</l>
					<l n="12">Mourn, all ye wing'd inhabitants of air,</l>
					<l n="13">But you, my turtle, take the greatest share;</l>
					<l n="14">You too liv'd constant friends and free from strife</l>
					<l n="15">Your kindness was entire, and long as life:</l>
					<l n="16">What Pylades to his Orestes vow'd.</l>
					<l n="17">To thee, poor Poll, thy friendly turtle show'd,</l>
					<l n="18">And kept his love as long as fate allow'd.</l>
					<l n="19">But, ah! what did thy faith, thy plumes, and tail,</l>
					<l n="20">And what thy pretty speaking art, avail?</l>
					<l n="21">And what that thou wert giv'n, and pleas'd my miss,</l>
					<l n="22">Since now the bird's unhappy glory dies ?</l>
					<l n="23">A lovely verdant green grac'd ev'ry quill,</l>
					<l n="24">The deepest vivid red did paint thy bill;</l>
					<l n="25">In speaking thou didst ev'ry bird excel,</l>
					<l n="26">None prattled, and none lisp'd the words so well.</l>
					<l n="27">'Twas envy only sent this fierce disease;</l>
					<l n="28">Thou wert averse to war, and liv'dst in peace,</l>
					<l n="29">A talking harmless thing, and lov'dst thine ease.</l>
					<l n="30">The fighting quails still live 'midst all their strife,</l>
					<l n="31">And even that, perhaps, prolongs their life.</l>
					<l n="32">Thy meat was little, and thy prattling tongue</l>
					<l n="33">Would ne'er permit to make thy dinner long:</l>
					<l n="34">Plain fountain water all thy drink allow'd,</l>
					<l n="35">And nut and poppy-seed were all thy food.</l>

					<l n="41">My Poll, my present from the east, is dead.</l>
					<l n="42">Best things are sooner snatch'd by cov'tous fate,</l>
					<l n="43">To worse she freely gives a longer date;</l>
					<l n="44">Thersites brave Achilles' fate surviv'd,</l>
					<l n="45">And <placeName key="tgn,2069653">Hector</placeName> fell, whilst all his

					<l n="46">Why should I tell what vows <placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName>
						made?</l>
					<l n="47">How oft she begg'd thy life, how oft she pray'd ?</l>
					<l n="48">The seventh day came, and now the Fates begin</l>
					<l n="49">To end the thread, they had no more to spin;</l>
					<l n="50">Yet still he talk'd, and when death nearer drew,</l>
					<l n="51">His last breath said, "<placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName>, now
						adieu!"</l>
					<l n="52">There is a shady cypress grove below,</l>
					<l n="53">And thither (if such doubtful things we know)</l>
					<l n="54">The ghosts of pious birds departed go;</l>
					<l n="55">'Tis water'd well, and verdant all the year,</l>
					<l n="56">And birds obscene do never enter there;</l>
					<l n="57">There harmless swans securely take their rest,</l>
					<l n="58">And there the single Phoenix builds her nest;</l>
					<l n="59">Proud peacocks there display their gaudy train,</l>
					<l n="60">And billing turtles coo o'er all the plain:</l>
					<l n="61">To these dark shades my parrot's soul shall go,</l>
					<l n="62">And with his talk divert the birds below;</l>
					<l n="63">Whilst here his bones enjoy a noble grave,</l>
					<l n="64">A little marble, and an epitaph:-</l>

					<l n="14">Enough of love, we'll play the fool no more."</l>
					<l n="15">" Ah, is it then a shame to love?" she cries,</l>
					<l n="16">And chides, and melts me with her weeping eyes.</l>
					<l n="17">Around my neck her snowy arms she throws,</l>
					<l n="18">And to my lips with stifling kisses grows.</l>
					<l n="19">How can I all this tenderness refuse ?</l>
					<l n="20">At once my wisdom, and my will I lose;</l>
					<l n="21">I'm conquer'd, and renounce the glorious train</l>
					<l n="22">Of arms, and war, to sing of love again:</l>
					<l n="23">My themes are acts, which I myself have done,</l>
					<l n="24">And my muse sings no battles but my own.</l>
					<l n="25">Once I confess I did the drama try,</l>
					<l n="26">And ventur'd with success on tragedy;</l>
					<l n="27">My genius with a moving scene agrees,</l>
					<l n="28">And if I ventured further I might please:</l>
					<l n="29">But love my heroics makes a jest,</l>
					<l n="30">And laughs to see me in my buskins drest.</l>
					<l n="31">Asham'd, and weary of this tragic whim,</l>
					<l n="32">For tender thoughts I quitted the sublime.</l>
					<l n="33">My mind my mistress bends another way,</l>
					<l n="34">Her must my muse in all her songs obey;</l>
					<l n="35">Though oft I do not what I write approve,</l>
					<l n="36">Like, or not like it, I must sing of love.</l>
					<l n="37">Whether for <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>'s illustrious
						dame,</l>
					<l n="38">To great Ulysses I a letter frame,</l>
					<l n="39">Or for Oenone tender things indite,</l>
					<l n="40">Or soft complaints for injur'd Phillis write;</l>
					<l n="41">Whether fair Canace's incestuous care</l>
					<l n="42">I sooth, or flatter Dido's fierce despair;</l>
					<l n="43">Whether I fan Medea's raging fire,</l>
					<l n="44">Or for sweet Sappho touch the Lesbian lyre;</l>
					<l n="45">Whether I Phaedra's lawless love relate,</l>
					<l n="46">Or Theseus' flight and Ariadne's fate:</l>
					<l n="47">Oh, that Sabinus, my departed friend,</l>
					<l n="48">Could from all quarters now his answers send!</l>
					<l n="49">Ulysses' hand should to his queen be known,</l>
					<l n="50">And wretched Phaedra hear from Theseus' son;</l>
					<l n="51">Dido Aeneas' answer should receive,</l>
					<l n="52">And Phillis Demophoon's, if alive;</l>
					<l n="53">Jason should to Hypsipyle return</l>
					<l n="54">A sad reply, and Sappho cease to mourn:</l>
					<l n="55">Nor him whom she can ne'er possess, desire,</l>
					<l n="56">But give to Phoebus fane her votive lyre.</l>
					<l n="57">As much as you in lofty epics deal,</l>
					<l n="58">You, Macer, show that you love's passion feel,</l>
					<l n="59">And sensible of beauty's powerful charm,</l>
					<l n="60">You hear their call amid the noise of arms.</l>
					<l n="61">A place for <placeName key="tgn,7008038">Paris</placeName> in your verse we
						find,</l>
					<l n="62">And Helen's to the young adult'rer kind;</l>
					<l n="63">There lovely Laodamia mourns her lord,</l>
					<l n="64">The first that fell by <placeName key="tgn,2069653">Hector</placeName>'s
						fatal sword.</l>
					<l n="65">If well I know you, and your mind can tell,</l>
					<l n="66">The theme's as grateful, and you like as well</l>
					<l n="67">To tune your lyre for Cupid as for <placeName key="tgn,2090583">Mars</placeName>,</l>
					<l n="68">And Thracian combats change for Paphian wars;</l>
					<l n="69">If well I know you, and your works design</l>

					<head>Elegy I: The Poet deliberates with himself whether he should continue
						writing elegies, or attempt tragedy.</head>
					<l n="1">Unhurt by steel, arose an ancient wood,</l>
					<l n="2">A mansion fit for some retiring god;</l>
					<l n="3">With craggy stones a secret grot was hung,</l>
					<l n="4">And in the midst a sacred fountain sprung;</l>
					<l n="5">The courting birds repeating songs of love,</l>
					<l n="6">With soft complainings sweetly fill'd the grove:</l>
					<l n="7">Here wand'ring thoughtful, and intent to choose</l>
					<l n="8">Some theme unsung, to please the busy muse;</l>
					<l n="9">Fair elegy came on with gentle pace,</l>
					<l n="10">Unforc'd her air and easy was her grace.</l>
					<l n="11">Her flaxen hair, in curious tresses wreath'd,</l>
					<l n="12">Ambrosial sweets and heav'nly odours breath'd;</l>
					<l n="13">A simple dress the careless charmer bore,</l>
					<l n="14">And loving looks, and smiles unartful wore.</l>
					<l n="15">Next came the goddess of the tragic scene,</l>
					<l n="16">With stately tread, and proud majestic mien</l>
					<l n="17">Her front severe, with hanging curls was drown'd,</l>
					<l n="18">Her length of robe was full, and swept the ground:</l>
					<l n="19">Her hand held out, a regal sceptre grac'd,</l>
					<l n="20">And Lydian buskins half her legs embrac'd.</l>
					<l n="21">She first; "Must love for ever tune thy voice,</l>
					<l n="22">Fond idle bard, and trifling in thy choice</l>
					<l n="23">Thy wanton songs employ the drunkard's tongue,</l>
					<l n="24">In ev'ry street thy ribald lays are sung;</l>
					<l n="25">The finger marks thee in thy passing by,</l>
					<l n="26">'Behold, where goes the slave of love,' they cry.</l>
					<l n="27">Thy lewd exploits, thou profligate, are grown</l>
					<l n="28">The public theme, and talk of all the town;</l>
					<l n="29">Whilst unconcern'd, and lost to sense of shame,</l>
					<l n="30">Thou still runn'st on nor mind'st thy ruin'd fame.</l>
					<l n="31">Enough thou'st told the plaints of fond desire,</l>
					<l n="32">Now let a nobler inspiration fire;</l>
					<l n="33">Thy matter cramps thy genius, learn to find</l>
					<l n="34">A manly subject, and exert thy mind.</l>
					<l n="35">In songs for girls, fond toys, and idle play,</l>
					<l n="36">Thy muse has wanton'd all her hours away.</l>
					<l n="37">But youth at length has fill'd its measure up;</l>
					<l n="38">My friend, 'tis time to taste of t'other cup.</l>
					<l n="39">Now in my service let thy force be shown,</l>
					<l n="40">Assert my honour, and retrieve thy own;</l>
					<l n="41">Thy sprightly fancy, and inventive wit,</l>
					<l n="42">The lofty style of tragic scenes will fit."</l>
					<l n="43">She said; and proudly rising in her gait,</l>
					<l n="44">Thrice shook her tresses, and display'd her state.</l>
					<l n="45">With open look (nor was my sight beguil'd)</l>
					<l n="46">And joyous eyes her rival sweetly smil'd;</l>
					<l n="47">Sustain'd her hand a myrtle branch upright?</l>
					<l n="48">Or did my fancy form the charming sight?</l>
					<l n="49">"Still so severe, 0, tragedy ! (she cried);</l>
					<l n="50">And canst thou ne'er forego thy sullen pride?</l>
					<l n="51">I not compare my lowly lays to thine;</l>
					<l n="52">Too weak materials for the vast design.</l>
					<l n="53">The style unlabour'd, negligent the dress,</l>
					<l n="54">My verse is humbler, and my matter less.</l>
					<l n="55">Gay, wanton, soft, my business is to move,</l>
					<l n="56">With melting strains, the playful god of love.</l>
					<l n="57">Bereft of me, fair <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName> wants her
						charms,</l>
					<l n="58">I help the goddess, and prepare her arms.</l>
					<l n="59">My luring art, and soothing lays prevail,</l>
					<l n="60">Where lofty port, and tragic buskins fail.</l>
					<l n="61">I more deserve, by making that my care,</l>
					<l n="62">Thy rigid pride allows not thee to bear:</l>
					<l n="63">By me, <placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName> first was taught to
						try</l>
					<l n="64">Tobreak from prison, and deceive the spy;</l>
					<l n="65">I first induc'd the fearful fair to slide</l>
					<l n="66">With tremb'ling caution from her husband's side;</l>
					<l n="67">When to thy arms, all loose, and disarray'd,</l>
					<l n="68">Prepar'd for pleasure, flew the melting maid.</l>
					<l n="69">Fix'd on her door, how oft I've hung on high,</l>
					<l n="70">Expos'd, and patient of each gazing eye !</l>
					<l n="71">How oft, in secret, while the keeper stay'd,</l>
					<l n="72">Within her woman's panting bosom laid !</l>
					<l n="73">Once sent a birthday gift, the cruel dame</l>
					<l n="74">In pieces tore, and gave me to the flame.</l>
					<l n="75">I taught thee first to cultivate thy mind;</l>
					<l n="76">Thy fancy brightened, and thy wit refin'd;</l>
					<l n="77">Thou to my care those merits must allow,</l>
					<l n="78">For which my rival would seduce thee now;"</l>
					<l n="79">They spoke. I answer'd, "Let me both conjure</l>
					<l n="80">To spare a mind with terrors unsecure;</l>
					<l n="81">Nor to my charge, when once pronounc'd, be laid</l>
					<l n="82">As crimes, the words my trembling tongue has said.</l>
					<l n="83">To gain me glory, thy decrees ordain</l>
					<l n="84">The regal sceptre and the tragic strain;</l>
					<l n="85">With painful labour need I toil for fame,</l>
					<l n="86">When easier tasks already raise my name?</l>
					<l n="87">Thou mak'st my love immortal; thee I choose:</l>
					<l n="88">Be thou my queen, and still command my muse.</l>
					<l n="89">Majestic pow'r, forgive my simple choice,</l>
					<l n="90">Thy gentle rival has obtain'd my voice.</l>
					<l n="91">Short is the time in which her palm is won;</l>
					<l n="92">Ere thine is gain'd, the poet's life is done."</l>
					<l n="93">I lowly said: she gracious gave assent,</l>
					<l n="94">And diff'rent ways the parting rivals went.</l>
					<l n="95">Ye gentle loves, complete the work assign'd,</l>
					<l n="96">A greater labour seems to press behind. </l>

					<head>Elegy IV: To a man that locked up his wife. By Sir Charles Sedley</head>
					<l n="1">Vex not thyself and her, vain man, since all</l>
					<l n="2">By their own vice or virtue stand or fall.</l>
					<l n="3">She's truly chaste, and worthy of that name,</l>
					<l n="4">Who hates the ill, as well as fears the shame;</l>
					<l n="5">And that vile woman whom restraint keeps in,</l>
					<l n="6">Tho' she forbear the act, has done the sin.</l>
					<l n="7">Spies, locks, and bolts may keep her brutal part,</l>
					<l n="8">But thou'rt an odious cuckold in her heart.</l>
					<l n="9">They that have freedom use it least, and so</l>
					<l n="10">The power of ill does the design overthrow.</l>
					<l n="11">Provoke not vice by a too harsh restraint;</l>
					<l n="12">Sick men long most to drink, who know they mayn't.</l>
					<l n="13">The fiery courser, whom no art can stay,</l>
					<l n="14">Or rugged force, does oft fair means obey;</l>
					<l n="15">And he that did the rudest arm disdain,</l>
					<l n="16">Submits with quiet to the looser rein.</l>
					<l n="17">A hundred eyes had <placeName key="tgn,2086061">Argus</placeName>, yet the

					<l n="18">One silly maid did all those eyes beguile;</l>
					<l n="19">Danae, tho' shut within a brazen tow'r,</l>
					<l n="20">Felt the male virtue of the golden show'r;</l>
					<l n="21">But chaste Penelope, left to her own will</l>
					<l n="22">And free disposal, never thought of ill;</l>
					<l n="23">She to her absent lord preserv'd her truth,</l>
					<l n="24">For all th' addresses of the smoother youth,</l>
					<l n="25">What's rarely seen, our fancy magnifies;</l>
					<l n="26">Permitted pleasure who does not despise ?</l>
					<l n="27">Thy care provokes beyond her face, and more</l>
					<l n="28">Men strive to make tho cuckold than the whore.</l>
					<l n="29">They're wondrous charms we think, and long to know</l>
					<l n="30">That in a wife enchants a husband so:</l>
					<l n="31">Rage, swear, and curse, no matter, she alone</l>
					<l n="32">Pleases, who sighs, and cries, " I am undone."</l>
					<l n="33">But could thy spies say, " We have kept her chaste,"</l>
					<l n="34">Good servants then, but an ill wife thou hast;</l>
					<l n="35">Who fears to be a cuckold is a clown,</l>
					<l n="36">Not worthy to partake of this lewd town,</l>
					<l n="37">Where it is monstrous to be fair and chaste,</l>
					<l n="38">And not one inch of either sex lies waste.</l>
					<l n="39">Wouldst thou be happy ? with her ways comply,</l>
					<l n="40">And in her case lay points of honour by:</l>
					<l n="41">The friendship she begins, wisely improve,</l>
					<l n="42">And a fair wife gets one a world of love:</l>
					<l n="43">So shalt thou welcome be to ev'ry treat,</l>

					<head>Elegy V: The Dream. By Henry Cromwell.</head>
					<l n="1">'Twas in the midst and silent dead of night,</l>
					<l n="2">When heavy sleep oppos'd my weary sight,</l>
					<l n="3">This vision did my troubled mind affright:-</l>
					<l n="4">To Sol expos'd there stood a rising ground,</l>
					<l n="5">Which cast beneath a spacious shade around;</l>
					<l n="6">A gloomy grove of spreading oaks below,</l>
					<l n="7">And various birds were perch'd on ev'ry bough;</l>
					<l n="8">Just on the margin of a verdant mead,</l>
					<l n="9">Where murm'ring brooks refreshing waters spread</l>
					<l n="10">To shun the heat I sought this cool recess,</l>
					<l n="11">But in this shade I felt my heat no less;</l>
					<l n="12">When browzing o'er the flow'ry grass appear'd</l>
					<l n="13">A lovely cow, the fairest of the herd.</l>
					<l n="14">By spotless white distinguished from the rest,</l>
					<l n="15">Whiter than milk from her own udder press'd;</l>
					<l n="16">Whiter than falling, or the driven snow,</l>
					<l n="17">Before descending mists can make it flow.</l>
					<l n="18">She, with a lusty bull, her happy mate,</l>
					<l n="19">Delighted, on the tender herbage sat;</l>
					<l n="20">There, as he crops the flow'rs, and chews the cud,</l>
					<l n="21">Feasting a second time upon his food,</l>
					<l n="22">His limbs with sudden heaviness oppress'd,</l>
					<l n="23">He bends his head, and sinks to pleasing rest.</l>
					<l n="24">A noisy crow, cleaving the liquid air,</l>
					<l n="25">Thrice with lewd bill pick'd off the heifer's hair;</l>
					<l n="26">The glossy white imbib'd a spreading blot,</l>
					<l n="27">But on her breast appear'd a livid spot.</l>
					<l n="28">The cow rose slowly from her consort's side,</l>
					<l n="29">But when afar the grazing bull she spied,</l>
					<l n="30">Frisk'd to the herd, with an impetuous haste,</l>
					<l n="31">And pleas'd, in new luxuriant soil, her taste.</l>
					<l n="32">Oh, learn'd diviner!</l>
					<l n="33">What may this visionary dream portend,</l>
					<l n="34">If dreams in any future truth can end ?</l>
					<l n="35">The prophet nicely weighs what I relate,</l>
					<l n="36">And thus denounces in the voice of fate:-</l>
					<l n="37">"That heat you tried to shun i' th' shady grove,</l>
					<l n="38">But shunn'd in vain, was the fierce heat of love.</l>
					<l n="39">The cow denotes the nymph, your only care,</l>
					<l n="40">(For white's th' expressive image of the fair,)</l>
					<l n="41">And you the bull, abandon'd to despair.</l>
					<l n="42">The picking crow some busy bawd implies,</l>
					<l n="43">Who with base arts will soon seduce your prim.</l>
					<l n="44">You saw the cow to fresher pasture range,</l>
					<l n="45">So will your nymph for richer lovers change;</l>
					<l n="46">As mixing with the herd you saw her rove,</l>
					<l n="47">So will the fair pursue promiscuous love;</l>
					<l n="48">Soon will you find a foul incestuous blot,</l>
					<l n="49">As on the cow you view'd the livid spot."</l>
					<l n="50">At this my blood retired, with dismal fright,</l>
					<l n="51">And left me pale as death ; my fainting sight</l>

					<l n="53">Such was the maid; the parallel had ran</l>
					<l n="54">Graceful, if I could add, such was the man.</l>
					<l n="55">Some envious deity with vengeance glow'd,</l>
					<l n="56">So sweet a gift had been so ill bestow'd.</l>

					<l n="96">Yet to conceal the joyless night's digrace,</l>

					<l n="55">Me, not the meanest of Apollo's train,</l>
					<l n="56">She hates, and I repeat my verse in vain;</l>
					<l n="57">I sing before her gate; her gate I find</l>
					<l n="58">Is less obdurate than her harden'd mind.</l>
					<l n="59">Forbear your songs, Apollo's sons, forbear,</l>
					<l n="60">And bend your future thoughts to arms and war.</l>
					<l n="61">Instead of inspirations, get commands;</l>

					<l n="65">We ne'er had heard that he had begg'd, or starv'd.</l>
					<l n="66">Of gold the thund'rer show'd the mighty pow'r,</l>
					<l n="67">Descending softly thro' the brazen tow'r,</l>
					<l n="68">And clasping Danae in a golden show'r.</l>
					<l n="69">A thousand bars the virgin fair did hold,</l>
					<l n="70">But what are iron bars to bribes of gold?</l>
					<l n="71">Against this foe her father could not guard;</l>
					<l n="72">Watchmen, and women kept a fruitless ward.</l>
					<l n="73">The damsel, who herself before was coy,</l>
					<l n="74">Melts at the sight, and meets the dazzling joy.</l>
					<l n="75">When peaceful Saturn did heav'n's sceptre sway,</l>
					<l n="76">Deep in earth's womb the fatal metal lay;</l>
					<l n="77">None then their teeming mother's bowels tore,</l>
					<l n="78">In quest of hidden wealth, in various ore;</l>
					<l n="79">Fed with the fruits which bounteous nature yields,</l>
					<l n="80">In painted gardens, and in golden fields,</l>
					<l n="81">From her rich soil are reap'd spontaneous crops,</l>
					<l n="82">And from the forest oak sweet honey drops.</l>
					<l n="83">No hinds as yet did toil their time away,</l>
					<l n="84">Nor with keen clusters wound the parent clay:</l>
					<l n="85">As yet no landmark was by lab'rers set,</l>
					<l n="86">And none had learned to plough the sea as yet</l>
					<l n="87">None as yet knew the use of sails and oars,</l>
					<l n="88">Nor ventur'd voyages beyond their shores.</l>
					<l n="89">The wit of men the race of men destroys,</l>
					<l n="90">And all its pow'rs against itself employs.</l>
					<l n="91">How subtle's human nature to contrive</l>
					<l n="92">Its proper ruin, and itself deceive!</l>
					<l n="93">Why didst thou cities with high walls surround,</l>
					<l n="94">Why arms invent thy jarring sons to wound ?</l>
					<l n="95">What quarrel hast thou with the sea, and why</l>
					<l n="96">Didst thou at first the pathless ocean try ?</l>
					<l n="97">Cannot the land content thy restless pride ?</l>
					<l n="98">Didst thou with Saturn's sons the whole divide,</l>
					<l n="99">Thou wouldst not with three worlds be satisfied.</l>
					<l n="100">'Tis strange thy vast ambition did not fly</l>
					<l n="101">O'er earth, and sea, and air, and scale the sky;</l>
					<l n="102">That man did not aspire to be a god,</l>
					<l n="103">And tread the paths by Indian Bacchus trod,</l>
					<l n="104">To give his name to some distinguish'd star,</l>
					<l n="105">And be what Hercules and Caesar are.</l>
					<l n="106">Instead of yellow harvests, now we seek</l>
					<l n="107">For solid gold, and thro' earth's entrails break;</l>
					<l n="108">The wealth we thus acquire's the soldier's prey,</l>
					<l n="109">And dearly for the blood he spills we pay.</l>
					<l n="110">The courts deny admittance to the poor,</l>
					<l n="111">In vain the needy clients crowd the door;</l>
					<l n="112">The judges to the rich decree the cause,</l>
					<l n="113">And money only gives their force to laws.</l>
					<l n="114">'Tis money makes the judge with looks severe</l>
					<l n="115">Insult the poor, and give the rich his ear;</l>
					<l n="116">'Tis money buys the title, makes the knight,</l>
					<l n="117">And dignifies with quality the cit:</l>
					<l n="118">Let money do all this, and more; the bar</l>
					<l n="119">Let money govern, and direct the war.</l>
					<l n="120">Let peace, as money sets the terms, be made,</l>
					<l n="121">But let it not the rights of love invade.</l>
					<l n="122">Let us enjoy this privilege at least,</l>
					<l n="123">That if we must be poor, we may with love be bless'd:</l>
					<l n="124">For now-a-days there's not a dame in town</l>
					<l n="125">So coy, but if you've money she's your own.</l>
					<l n="126">What tho' her keeper may an <placeName key="tgn,2086061">Argus</placeName> be
						?</l>
					<l n="127">Blind him with money, and he'll nothing see.</l>
					<l n="128">What though her husband should by chance be by?</l>
					<l n="129">He'll leave the house, let you your money fly.</l>
					<l n="130">If there's a god above, to whom belongs</l>
					<l n="131">The cause of love, and slighted lovers wrongs,</l>

					<l n="1">If Memnon's fate bewail'd with constant dew,</l>
					<l n="2">Does, with the day, his mother's grief renew,</l>
					<l n="3">If her son's death mov'd tender Thetis' mind</l>
					<l n="4">To swell with tears the waves, with sighs the wind;</l>
					<l n="5">Sad Cupid now despairs of conqu'ring hearts,</l>
					<l n="6">Throws by his empty quiver, breaks his darts:</l>
					<l n="7">Eases his useless bows from idle strings;</l>
					<l n="8">Nor flies, but humbly creeps with flagging wings.</l>
					<l n="9">He wants, of which he robb'd fond lovers, rest;</l>
					<l n="10">And wounds with furious hands his pensive breast.</l>
					<l n="11">Those graceful curls which wantonly did flow,</l>
					<l n="12">The whiter rivals of the falling snow,</l>
					<l n="13">Forget their beauty, and in discord lie,</l>
					<l n="14">Drunk with the fountain from his melting eye.</l>
					<l n="15">Nor Phoebus, nor the muses' queen, could give</l>
					<l n="16">Their son, their own prerogative, to live.</l>
					<l n="17">Orpheus, the heir of both his parents' skill,</l>
					<l n="18">Tam'd wond'ring beasts, not death's more cruel will.</l>
					<l n="19">Linus' sad strings on the dumb lute do lie. </l>
					<l n="20">In silence forc'd to let their master die.</l>
					<l n="21">His mother weeping does his eyelids close,</l>
					<l n="22">And on his urn, tears, her last gift, bestows.</l>
					<l n="23">His sister too, with hair dishevell'd, bears</l>
					<l n="24">Part of her mother's nature, and her tears.</l>
					<l n="25">With those, two fair, two mournful rivals come,</l>
					<l n="26">And add a greater triumph to his tomb:</l>
					<l n="27">Both hug his urn, both his lov'd ashes kiss,</l>
					<l n="28">And both contend which reap'd the greater bliss.</l>
					<l n="29">Thus <placeName key="tgn,1013136">Delia</placeName> spoke (when sighs no more
						could last)</l>
					<l n="30">Renewing by remembrance pleasures past;</l>
					<l n="31">"When youth with vigour did for joy combine,</l>
					<l n="32">I was Tibullus' life, Tibullus mine;</l>
					<l n="33">1 entertained his hot, his first desire,</l>
					<l n="34">And kept alive, till age, his active fire."</l>
					<l n="35">To her then Nemesis (when groans gave leave)</l>
					<l n="36">"As I alone was lov'd, alone I'll grieve;</l>
					<l n="37">Spare your vain tears, Tibullus' heart was mine,</l>
					<l n="38">About my neck his dying arms did twine:</l>
					<l n="39">I snatch'd his soul, which true to me did prove;</l>
					<l n="40">Age ended yours, death only stopp'd my love."</l>
					<l n="41">If any poor remains survive the flames,</l>
					<l n="42">Except thin shadows, and more empty names;</l>
					<l n="43">Free in Elysium shall Tibullus rove,</l>
					<l n="44">Nor fear a second death should cross his love.</l>
					<l n="45">There shall Catullus, crown'd with bays, impart</l>
					<l n="46">To his far dearer friend his open heart.</l>
					<l n="47">There Gallus (if fame's hundred tongues all lie)</l>
					<l n="48">Shall, free from censure, no more rashly die.</l>
					<l n="49">Such shall our poet's bless'd companions be,</l>
					<l n="50">And in their deaths, as in their lives, agree.</l>
					<l n="51">But thou, rich urn, obey my strict commands,</l>
					<l n="52">Guard thy great charge from sacrilegious hands.</l>
					<l n="53">Thou, earth, Tibullus' ashes gently use,</l>

					<l n="20">Content let me the present pain endure,</l>
					<l n="21">For the sharp medicine is the patient's cure.</l>
					<l n="22">How oft you have expos'd me to the cold,</l>
					<l n="23">While in your arms you did my rival hold!</l>
					<l n="24">How like a slave have I been forc'd to wait</l>
					<l n="25">All weathers, and how oft have watched the gate!</l>
					<l n="26">As if your house was trusted to my care</l>

					<l n="31">Was that he there the waiting fool should find.</l>
					<l n="32">That aggravated most the cruel curse;</l>
					<l n="33">I would not wish my greatest foe a worse.</l>

					<l n="54">To cover all your failings with my love;</l>
					<l n="55">Of this I might remind you, and much more,</l>
					<l n="56">But what avails it now; th' affair is o'er:</l>
					<l n="57">A fond you found me, and a patient man,</l>
					<l n="58">And get you such another if you can.</l>
					<l n="59">I fear not now your frowns; my bark defies</l>

					<l n="66">Fierce love and hate contend within my breast;</l>
					<l n="67">My soul they thus divide, but love, I fear,</l>
					<l n="68">Will prove too strong, and get the mast'ry there;</l>
					<l n="69">I'll strive to hate her, but if that should prove</l>
					<l n="70">A fruitless strife, in spite of me I'll love.</l>
					<l n="71">The bull does not affect the yoke, but still</l>
					<l n="72">He bears the thing he hates against his will</l>
					<l n="73">I hate, I fly the faithless fair in vain,</l>
					<l n="74">Her beauty ever brings me back again;</l>
					<l n="75">She always in my heart will have a place,</l>
					<l n="76">I hate her humour, but I love her face;</l>
					<l n="77">No rest I to my tortur'd soul can give,</l>
					<l n="78">Nor with her nor without her can I live.</l>
					<l n="79">Oh ! that thy mind we in thy face did view,</l>
					<l n="80">Less lovely that thou wert, or else more true.</l>
					<l n="81">How diffrent are thy manners and thy sight!</l>
					<l n="82">Thy deeds forbid us and thy eyes invite.</l>
					<l n="83">Thy actions shock us, and thy beauty moves,</l>
					<l n="84">And he who hates thy faults, thy person loves.</l>
					<l n="85">Happy, ah ! ever happy should I be,</l>

					<l n="90">To whom thou art forsworn, but most by Love,</l>
					<l n="91">By thy fair face, which I as much adore</l>
					<l n="92">As all those gods, and own as much its pow'r,</l>
					<l n="93">Forgive me this offence, and I'll offend no more.</l>
					<l n="94">Be what thou wilt, thy humour good or ill,</l>
					<l n="95">I'll love thee, thou shalt be my mistress still</l>

					<l n="98">But rather let me sail before the wind.</l>
					<l n="99">Ah, let thy wishes with my will agree,</l>
					<l n="100">Since surely I thy slave must ever be;</l>

					<l n="44">The wolf's fierce form, the dog's, or curling snake's;</l>
					<l n="45">Serpents for hair, in ancient song we meet,</l>
					<l n="46">And man and horse with wings instead of feet.</l>
					<l n="47">Huge Tityon from the skies the poets flung,</l>
					<l n="48">Encelladus's wars with Jove they sung;</l>
					<l n="49">How by her spells, and by her voice, to beasts,</l>
					<l n="50">The doubtful virgin chang'd her wretched guests;</l>
					<l n="51">How Eolus did for <placeName key="tgn,2093866">Ulysses</placeName> keep</l>
					<l n="52">The winds in bottles while he plough'd the deep:</l>
					<l n="53">How Cerberus, three headed, guarded hell;</l>
					<l n="54">And from his car the son of Phoebus fell:</l>
					<l n="55">How thirsty Tantalus attempts to sip</l>
					<l n="56">The stream in vain, that flies his greedy lip:</l>
					<l n="57">How Niobe in marble drops a tear,</l>
					<l n="58">And a bright nymph was turn'd into a bear:</l>
					<l n="59">How Progne, now a swallow, does bemoan</l>
					<l n="60">Her sister nightingale, and pheasant son.</l>
					<l n="61">In Leda, Danae, and Europa's rapes,</l>
					<l n="62">They sing the king of gods in various shapes;</l>
					<l n="63">A swan he lies on ravish'd Leda's breast,</l>
					<l n="64">And Danae by a golden show'r compress'd;</l>
					<l n="65">A bull does o'er the waves Europa bear,</l>
					<l n="66">And Proteus any form he pleases wear.</l>
					<l n="67">How oft do we the Theban wonders read,</l>
					<l n="68">Of serpent's teeth transform'd to human seed!</l>
					<l n="69">Of dancing woods, and moving rocks, that throng</l>
					<l n="70">To hear sweet Orpheus, and <placeName key="tgn,2132474">Amphion</placeName>'s
						song ?</l>
					<l n="71">How oft do the Heliades bemoan,</l>
					<l n="72">In tears of gum, the fall of Phaeton!</l>
					<l n="73">The sun from Atreus' table frightened flies,</l>
					<l n="74">And backward drives his chariot in the skies.</l>
					<l n="75">Those now are nymphs that lately were a fleet;</l>
					<l n="76">Poetic license ever was so great.</l>
					<l n="77">But none did credit to these fictions give,</l>
					<l n="78">Or for true history such tales receive,</l>
					<l n="79">And though <placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName> in my songs is
						fair,</l>
					<l n="80">Let none conclude she's like her picture there.</l>
					<l n="81">The fable she with hasty faith receiv'd,</l>
					<l n="82">And what, so very well she lik'd, believ'd.</l>
					<l n="83">But since so ill she does the poet use,</l>

					<head>Elegy XIII: Of Juno's Feast.</head>
					<l n="1">My wife, a native of Phaliscan plains,</l>
					<l n="2">Where the rich soils enrich the lab'ring swains,</l>
					<l n="3">Where purple grapes and golden apples grow,</l>
					<l n="4">A conquest we to great <placeName key="tgn,2068320">Camillus</placeName>
						owe.</l>
					<l n="5">When once to <placeName key="tgn,2075297">Juno</placeName>'s feast she
						thither went,</l>
					<l n="6">My mind to know the secret rites was bent:</l>
					<l n="7">The pious priests the solemn sports prepare,</l>
					<l n="8">And purify the fane with holy care.</l>
					<l n="9">A heifer of the place they sacrifice,</l>
					<l n="10">But ne'er to men expose their mysteries,</l>
					<l n="11">I mark'd the hidden way my consort went,</l>
					<l n="12">And follow'd down the deep and dark descent.</l>
					<l n="13">To an old wood at last I came, whose shade</l>
					<l n="14">Impress'd a horror on the gloom it made,</l>
					<l n="15">And ev'ry step with trembling feet I trod,</l>
					<l n="16">Profan'd, I thought, the dwelling of a god.</l>
					<l n="17">An altar there was rais'd by hands divine,</l>
					<l n="18">And fragrant incense flam'd around the shrine.</l>
					<l n="19">Chaste matrons there their vow'd oblations pay,</l>
					<l n="20">And celebrate with joyful hymns the day.</l>
					<l n="21">Soon as the fife the signal gives, they move</l>
					<l n="22">In long procession through the sacred grove</l>
					<l n="23">Branches and flow'rs are with devotion spread</l>
					<l n="24">O'er all the way, and priestly vestments laid.</l>
					<l n="25">Next after these, through loud acclaims, they lead</l>
					<l n="26">A cow milk white, and of Phaliscan breed;</l>
					<l n="27">Then a young steer, whose forehead ne'er had borne</l>
					<l n="28">The crooked honours of the butting horn.</l>
					<l n="29">The least of all the victims was a swine,</l>
					<l n="30">And then a ram whose horns around his temples twine.</l>
					<l n="31">A goat, whom most the goddess hates, comes last;</l>
					<l n="32">The present feels her vengeance for the past.</l>
					<l n="33">When in a wood to hide herself she tried,</l>
					<l n="34">She by the bleating of a goat was spied;</l>
					<l n="35">For this the beast is by the boys pursu'd;</l>
					<l n="36">For this she's ever greedy of its blood,</l>
					<l n="37">And he, who first the letcher wounds in play,</l>
					<l n="38">Claims by her law, and hears the prize away.</l>
					<l n="39">The tender youth, and tim'rous virgin strow</l>
					<l n="40">With robes the ground the goddess is to go.</l>
					<l n="41">The virgins' locks with golden fillets bound,</l>
					<l n="42">And sparkling diamonds glitt'ring all around;</l>
					<l n="43">Buskins embroider'd on their feet they wear,</l>
					<l n="44">And spreading trains with pride uneasy bear.</l>
					<l n="45">Here, as in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> the custom was of
						old,</l>
					<l n="46">The image of the goddess we behold</l>
					<l n="47">Borne on the heads of maidens, and behind</l>
					<l n="48">The priestesses in beauteous rank you find.</l>
					<l n="49">An awful silence reigns : the goddess last</l>
					<l n="50">Approaches, and with her the pomp is past.</l>
					<l n="51">The dress was Greek, and such Halesus wore,</l>
					<l n="52">When in a fright he fled the Grecian shore;</l>
					<l n="53">His father kill'd, an <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> ship he
						fraught,</l>
					<l n="54">And to this coast the royal treasure brought.</l>
					<l n="55">Much peril had he past, much labour known,</l>
					<l n="56">O'er lands and seas, before he reach'd our own,</l>
					<l n="57">And landing built, with happy hand, the town,</l>
					<l n="58">Where first he did this festival revive,</l>
					<l n="59">And its Greek rules to the Phaliscans give;</l>
					<l n="60">The rites and sacrifices first he show'd,</l>
					<l n="61">As practis'd now within this ancient wood.</l>
					<l n="62">Ah, may these rites to all propitious be,</l>
					<l n="63">No more to those that serv'd them than to me. </l>

					<l n="3">Act what you please, yet study to disguise</l>
					<l n="4">The wanton scenes from my deluded eyes.</l>

					<l n="9">Tho' bought to be enjoy'd, a common whore</l>
					<l n="10">Ere she begins will shut the chamber door:</l>
					<l n="11">And will you turn debauch'd, then vainly own</l>
					<l n="12">How lewd you are, to this malicious town?</l>
					<l n="13">At least seem virtuous, and tho' false you be,</l>
					<l n="14">Say you are honest, and I'll credit thee.</l>
					<l n="15">Conceal your actions, and while I am by,</l>

					<l n="23">There without blushes you may naked lie,</l>
					<l n="24">Clasping his body with your tender thigh;</l>
					<l n="25">Shoot your moist dart into his mouth, to show</l>
					<l n="26">The sense you have of what he acts below;</l>
					<l n="27">Try all the ways, your pliant bodies twine,</l>
					<l n="28">In folds more strange than those of Aretine:</l>
					<l n="29">With melting looks fierce joys you may excite,</l>
					<l n="30">And with thick dying accents urge delight.</l>
					<l n="31">But when you're dress'd, then look as innocent</l>
					<l n="32">As if you knew not what such matters meant;</l>
					<l n="33">Cozen the prying town, and put a cheat</l>
					<l n="34">On it and me, I'll favour the deceit.</l>
					<l n="35">False as thou art, why must I daily see</l>
					<l n="36">Th' intriguing billet-doux he sends to thee ?</l>
					<l n="37">The wanton sonnet, or soft elegy ?</l>
					<l n="38">Why does your bed all tumbled seem to say,</l>
					<l n="39">See what they've done, see where the lovers lay!</l>
					<l n="40">Why do your locks and rumpled head-clothes show</l>
					<l n="41">'Tis more than usual sleep that made 'em so?</l>
					<l n="42">Why are the kisses which he gave, betray'd</l>
					<l n="43">By the impression which his teeth had made ?</l>
					<l n="44">Yet say you're chaste, and I'll be still deceived;</l>
					<l n="45">What much is wish'd for, is with ease believ'd.</l>
					<l n="46">But when you own what a lewd wretch thou art,</l>
					<l n="47">My blood grows cold and freezes at my heart,</l>
					<l n="48">Then do I curse thee, and thy crimes reprove,</l>
					<l n="49">But curse in vain, for still I find I love;</l>
					<l n="50">"Since she is false," oft to myself I cry,</l>
					<l n="51">"Would I were dead,"-yet 'tis with thee I'd die</l>
					<l n="52">I will not see your maid, to let me know</l>
					<l n="53">Who visits you, where, and with whom you go;</l>
					<l n="54">Nor by your lodging send my boy to scout,</l>
					<l n="55">And bring me word who passes in and out.</l>
					<l n="56">Enjoy the pleasure of the present times,</l>
					<l n="57">But let not me be knowing of your crimes.</l>
