					<head>Elegy I: By Dryden</head>
					<l>For mighty wars I thought to tune my lute,</l>
					<l>And make my measures to my subject suit.</l>
					<l>Six feet for ev'ry verse the muse design'd,</l>
					<l>But Cupid laughing, when he saw my mind,</l>
					<l>From ev'ry second verse a foot purloin'd.</l>
					<l>"Who gave thee, boy, this arbitrary sway,</l>
					<l>On subjects, not thy own, commands to lay,</l>
					<l>Who Phoebus only, and his laws obey ?</l>
					<l>'Tis more absurd, than if the queen of love</l>
					<l>Should in Minerva's arms to battle move;</l>
					<l>Or manly Pallas from that queen should take</l>
					<l>Her torch, and o'er the dying lover shake.</l>
					<l>In fields as well may Cynthia sow the corn,</l>
					<l>Or <placeName key="tgn,1092955">Ceres</placeName> wind in woods the
						bugle-horn;</l>
					<l>As well may Phoebus quit the trembling string,</l>
					<l>For sword and shield; and Mars may learn to sing.</l>
					<l>Already thy dominions are too large;</l>
					<l>Be not ambitious of a foreign charge.</l>
					<l>If thou wilt reign o'er all, and ev'ry where,</l>
					<l>The god of music for his harp may fear.</l>
					<l>Thus when with soaring wings I seek renown,</l>
					<l>Thou pluck'st my pinions, and I flutter down.</l>
					<l>Could I on such mean thoughts my muse employ,</l>
					<l>I want a mistress, or a blooming boy."</l>
					<l>Thus I complain'd; his bow the stripling bent,</l>
					<l>And chose an arrow fit for his intent.</l>
					<l>The shaft his purpose fatally pursues;</l>
					<l>" Now, poet, there's a subject for thy muse,"</l>
					<l>He said: (too well, alas, he knows his trade,)</l>
					<l>For in my breast a mortal wound he made.</l>
					<l>Far hence ye proud Hexameters remove,</l>
					<l>My verse is pac'd, and tramell'd into love.</l>
					<l>With myrtle wreaths my thoughtful brows enclose,</l>
					<l>While in unequal verse I sing my woes. </l>

					<head>Elegy II: By Creech</head>
					<l>Ah me! why am I so uneasy grown?</l>
					<l>Ah! why so restless on my bed of down?</l>
					<l>Why do I wish to sleep, but wish in vain?</l>
					<l>Why am I all the tedious night in pain?</l>
					<l>What cause is this, that ease, that rest denies?</l>
					<l>And why my words break forth in gentle sighs?</l>
					<l>Sure I should know if love had fix'd his dart;</l>
					<l>Or creeps he softly in with treacherous art,</l>
					<l>And then grows tyrant, there and wounds the heart?</l>
					<l>'Tis so, the shaft sticks deep, and galls my breast;</l>
					<l>'Tis tyrant love, that robs my thoughts of rest!</l>
					<l>Well, shall I tamely yield, or must I fight?</l>
					<l>I'll yield; 'tis patience makes a burden light:</l>
					<l>A shaken torch grows fierce, and sparks arise;</l>
					<l>But, if unmov'd, the fire looks pale and dies.</l>
					<l>The hard-mouth'd horse smarts for his fierce disdain</l>
					<l>The gentle's ridden with a looser rein.</l>
					<l>Love smooths the gentle, but the fierce reclaims;</l>
					<l>He fires their breasts, and fills their souls with flames.</l>
					<l>I yield; great Love, my former crimes forgive,</l>
					<l>Forget my rebel thoughts, and let me live;</l>
					<l>No need of force: I willingly obey,</l>
					<l>And now unarm'd, shall prove no glorious prey.</l>
					<l>Go take thy mother's doves, thy myrtle crown,</l>
					<l>And for thy chariot, Mars shall lend his own;</l>
					<l>There thou shalt sit in thy triumphant pride,</l>
					<l>And, whilst glad shouts resound on ev'ry side,</l>
					<l>Thy gentle hands thy mother's doves shall guide.</l>
					<l>And there to make thy glorious pomp and state,</l>
					<l>A train of sighing youths, and maids shall wait,</l>
					<l>Yet none complain of an unhappy fate.</l>
					<l>There newly conquer'd I, still fresh my wound,</l>
					<l>Will march along, my hands with myrtle bound;</l>
					<l>There modesty, with veils thrown o'er her face,</l>
					<l>Now doubly blushing at her own disgrace;</l>
					<l>There sober thoughts, and whatso'er disdains</l>
					<l>Love's rules, shall feel his power, and bear his chains:</l>
					<l>Then all shall fear, all bow, yet all rejoice;</l>
					<l>"Io triumphe" be the public voice.</l>
					<l>Thy constant guards, soft fancy, hope and fear,</l>
					<l>Anger, and soft caresses shall be there:</l>
					<l>By these strong guards are men and gods o'erthrown;</l>
					<l>These conquer for thee, Love, and these alone,</l>
					<l>Thy mother, from the sky thy pomp shall grace,</l>
					<l>And scatter sweetest roses in thy face:</l>
					<l>There glorious Love shall ride, profusely dress'd</l>
					<l>With all the richest jewels of the east:</l>
					<l>Rich gems thy quiver, and thy wheels infold,</l>
					<l>And hide the poorness of the baser gold.</l>
					<l>Then thou shalt conquer many, then.thy darts</l>
					<l>Shall scatter thousand wounds on tender hearts:</l>
					<l>Thy shafts themselves will fly, thy neighb'ring fire</l>
					<l>Will catch mens' breasts, and kindle warm desire.</l>
					<l>Thus conqu'ring <placeName key="tgn,2097807">Bacchus</placeName> looks in
						Indian groves,</l>
					<l>He drawn by tigers, thou by murm'ring doves.</l>
					<l>Well then, since I too can increase thy train,</l>
					<l>Spend not thy force on me, and rage in vain;</l>
					<l>Look on thy kinsman Caesar's happy slaves,</l>
					<l>The same victorious arm that conquers, saves. </l>

					<head>Elegy III: To His Mistress. By Charles Hopkins.</head>
					<l>Be just, dear maid, an equal passion prove,</l>
					<l>Or show me cause why I should ever love.</l>
					<l>I do not at your cold disdain repine,</l>
					<l>Nor ask your love, do you but suffer mine.</l>
					<l>I dare not aim at more exalted bliss,</l>
					<l>And Venus will bestow her vot'ry this.</l>
					<l>Take hin, who will for endless ages serve:</l>
					<l>Take him whose faithful flame will never swerve</l>
					<l>Though no illustrious names my race adorn;</l>
					<l>Who am but of equestrian order born;</l>
					<l>Though a few ploughs serve my paternal fields,</l>
					<l>Nor my small table many dishes yields;</l>
					<l>Yet Bacchus, Phoebus, and the tuneful nine,</l>
					<l>Are all my friends, and to my side incline,</l>
					<l>And love's great god, at last, will make me thine.</l>
					<l>Heav'n knows, dear maid, I love no other fair;</l>
					<l>In thee lives all my love, my heav'n lies there.</l>
					<l>Oh! may I by indulgent Fate's decree,</l>
					<l>With thee lead all my life, and die with thee.</l>
					<l>Thy beauties yield me my transporting theme;</l>
					<l>And while I celebrate thy charming name,</l>
					<l>My verse shall be as sacred as my flame.</l>
					<l>Jove's sev'ral rapes, his injur'd Io's wrongs,</l>
					<l>Are made immortal in his poet's songs.</l>
					<l>Verse still reveals where Leda's flames began,</l>
					<l>Rais'd by the secret godhead in the swan,</l>
					<l>The story of the rape Europa bore,</l>
					<l>Shall last while winds shall rage, or waters roar.</l>
					<l>Your name shall live like theirs, while verse endures,</l>
					<l>And mine be ever writ, and read with yours. </l>

					<head>Elegy IV: To His Mistress, whose husband is invited to a feast with him.
						The poet instructed her how to behave herself in his company. By <placeName
							key="tgn,1014723">Dryden</placeName>.</head>
					<l>Your husband will be with us at the treat,</l>
					<l>May that be the last supper he shall eat.</l>
					<l>And am poor I, a guest invited there,</l>
					<l>Only to see, while he may touch the fair?</l>
					<l>To see you kiss, and hug your nauseous lord,</l>
					<l>While his lewd hand descends below the board?</l>
					<l>No wonder that Hippodamia's charms,</l>
					<l>At such a sight, the Centaurs urg'd to arms:</l>
					<l>That in a rage, they threw their cups aside,</l>
					<l>Assail'd the bridegroom, and would force the bride.</l>
					<l>I am not half a horse, (I would I were :)</l>
					<l>Yet hardly can from you my hands forbear.</l>
					<l>Take, then, my counsel; which observ'd, may be,</l>
					<l>Of some importance both to you and me.</l>
					<l>Be sure to come before your man be there,</l>
					<l>There's nothing can be done, but come howe'er.</l>
					<l>Sit next him, (that belongs to decency;)</l>
					<l>But tread upon my foot in passing by.</l>
					<l>Read in my looks what silently they speak,</l>
					<l>And slily, with your eyes, your answer make.</l>
					<l>My lifted eye-brow shall declare my pain,</l>
					<l>My right hand to his fellow shall complain;</l>
					<l>And on the back a letter shall design,</l>
					<l>Beside a note that shall be writ in wine.</l>
					<l>Whene'er you think upon our last embrace,</l>
					<l>With your fore-finger gently touch your face.</l>
					<l>If any word of mine offend my dear,</l>
					<l>Pull with your hand the velvet of your ear;</l>
					<l>If you are pleas'd with what I do or say,</l>
					<l>Handle your rings, or vith your fingers play.</l>
					<l>As suppliants use at altars, hold the board,</l>
					<l>Whene'er you wish the devil may take your lord.</l>
					<l>When he fills for you, never touch the cup,</l>
					<l>But bid th' officious cuckold drink it up:</l>
					<l>The waiter on those services employ;</l>
					<l>Drink you, and I will snatch it from the boy,</l>
					<l>Watching the part where your sweet mouth hath been,</l>
					<l>And thence, with eager lips, will suck it in.</l>
					<l>If he, with clownish manners, thinks it fit</l>
					<l>To taste, and offer you the nasty bit,</l>
					<l>Reject his greasy kindness, and restore</l>
					<l>Th' unsav'ry morsel he had chew'd before.</l>
					<l>Nor let his arms embrace your neck, nor rest</l>
					<l>Your tender cheek upon his hairy breast;</l>
					<l>Let not his hand within your bosom stray,</l>
					<l>And rudely with your pretty bubbies play.</l>
					<l>But, above all, let him no kiss receive,</l>
					<l>That's an offence I never can forgive;</l>
					<l>Do not, oh! do not that sweet mouth resign,</l>
					<l>Lest I rise up in arms, and cry 'tis mine.</l>
					<l>I shall thrust in betwixt, and void of fear</l>
					<l>The manifest adult'rer will appear.</l>
					<l>These things are plain to sight, but more I doubt</l>
					<l>What you conceal beneath your petticoat;</l>
					<l>Take not his leg between your tender thighs,</l>
					<l>Nor with your hand provoke my foe to rise.</l>
					<l>How many love inventions I deplore,</l>
					<l>Which I myself have practis'd all before !</l>
					<l>How oft have I been forc'd the robe to lift</l>
					<l>In company; to make a homely shift</l>
					<l>For a bare bout, ill huddled o'er in haste,</l>
					<l>While o'er my side the fair her mantle cast!</l>
					<l>You to your husband shall not be so kind,</l>
					<l>But lest you should, your mantle leave behind.</l>
					<l>Encourage him to tope, but kiss him not,</l>
					<l>Nor mix one drop of water in his pot.</l>
					<l>If he be fuddled well, and snores apace,</l>
					<l>Then we may take advice from time and place.</l>
					<l>When all depart, while compliments are loud,</l>
					<l>Be sure to mix among the thickest crowd;</l>
					<l>There I will be, and there we cannot miss,</l>
					<l>Perhaps to grubble, or at least to kiss.</l>
					<l>Alas, what length of labor I employ,</l>
					<l>Just to secure a short and transient joy!</l>
					<l>For night must part us, and when night is come</l>
					<l>Tuck'd underneath his arm, he leads you home.</l>
					<l>He locks you in, I follow to the door,</l>
					<l>His fortune envy, and my own deplore;</l>
					<l>He kisses you, he more than kisses too,</l>
					<l>Th' outrageous cuckold thinks it all his due.</l>
					<l>But add not to his joy by your consent,</l>
					<l>And let it not be given, but only lent;</l>
					<l>Return no kiss, nor move in any sort,</l>
					<l>Make it a dull and a malignant sport.</l>
					<l>Had I my wish he should no pleasure take,</l>
					<l>But slubber o'er your bus'ness for my sake;</l>
					<l>And whate'er fortune shall this night befall,</l>
					<l>Coax me to morrow by forswearing all. </l>

					<head>Elegy V: By Duke</head>
					<l>'Twas noon when I, scorch'd with the double fire</l>
					<l>Of the hot sun and my more hot desire,</l>
					<l>Stretch'd on my downy couch at ease was laid,</l>
					<l>Big with expectance of the lovely maid.</l>
					<l>The curtains but half drawn, a light let in</l>
					<l>Such as in shades of thickest groves is seen,</l>
					<l>Such as remains when the sun flies away,</l>
					<l>Or when night's gone, and yet it is not day.</l>
					<l>This light to modest maids must be allow'd,</l>
					<l>Where shame may hope its guilty head to shroud.</l>
					<l>And now my love <placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName> did
						appear,</l>
					<l>Loose on her neck fell her divided hair;</l>
					<l>Loose as her flowing gown, that wanton'd in the air.</l>
					<l>In such a garb, with such a grace and mien,</l>
					<l>To her rich bed came the Assyrian queen;</l>
					<l>So Lais looked when all the youth of <placeName key="tgn,1000074"
							>Greece</placeName></l>
					<l>With adoration did her charms confess.</l>
					<l>Her envious gown to pull away I tried,</l>
					<l>But she resisted still, and still denied;</l>
					<l>But so resisted that she seem'd to be</l>
					<l>Unwilling to obtain the victory;</l>
					<l>So I at last an easy conquest had,</l>
					<l>Whilst my fair combatant herself betray'd.</l>
					<l>But when she naked stood before my eyes,</l>
					<l>Gods, with what charms did she my soul surprise!</l>
					<l>What snowy arms did I both see and feel!</l>
					<l>With what rich globes did her soft bosom swell!</l>
					<l>Plump as ripe clusters rose each glowing breast,</l>
					<l>Courting the hand, and suing to be press'd!</l>
					<l>What a smooth plain was on her belly spread,</l>
					<l>Where thousand little loves and graces play'd!</l>
					<l>What thighs! what legs ! but why strive I in vain,</l>
					<l>Each limb, each grace, each feature to explain</l>
					<l>One beauty did through her whole body shine;</l>
					<l>I saw, admir'd, and press'd it close to mine</l>
					<l>The rest who knows not? Thus entranc'd we lay,</l>
					<l>Till in each other's arms we died away;</l>
					<l>0 give me such a noon, ye gods, to ev'ry day! </l>

					<head>Elegy VI: To His Mistress's Porter, to open the gate to him. By an unknown
						hand.</head>
					<l>Slave, if thou worthy of thy chains wouldst be,</l>
					<l>A grateful office do to love and me.</l>
					<l>Unbar the wicket, and a friend admit;</l>
					<l>The trouble is not much, nor favour great.</l>
					<l>I ask thee not to spread the foldings wide;</l>
					<l>Keep it at jar,-I'll softly by thee slide.</l>
					<l>I to love's labours have so long been us'd,</l>
					<l>My shapes are to a lath's lank size reduc'd.</l>
					<l>The smallest crevice will my bus'ness do,</l>
					<l>It cannot be so straight but I'll slip through.</l>
					<l>Love guides me when by night I walk the street,</l>
					<l>And when I grope my way directs my feet.</l>
					<l>By night I was a youth afraid to walk,</l>
					<l>Frighted by children and old nurses' talk;</l>
					<l>I wonder'd men could wander in the gloom,</l>
					<l>And kept, for fear of spirits, close at home.</l>
					<l>Love and his mother, when they knew my care,</l>
					<l>Cried, "Fool, thou shalt not long these phantoms fear."</l>
					<l>Nor fear'd I long, for love my heart possess'd;</l>
					<l>Those visions vanish'd, and my terrors ceas'd:</l>
					<l>Nor ghosts nor scourers did I dread, but stroll'd</l>
					<l>The streets a-nights, and grew in peril bold.</l>
					<l>Thee only do I fear, and trembling stand</l>
					<l>To wait the motions of thy tardy hand:</l>
					<l>With soft request thy succour I implore,</l>
					<l>Nor sue to Jove nor dread the Thund'rer more.</l>
					<l>See how the gate is moistened with my tears!</l>
					<l>What marks of my impatient love it bears!</l>
					<l>Remember, when thou for the lash wert stripp'd</l>
					<l>Who sav'd thee, at whose suit thou wert not whipp'd.</l>
					<l>Did not I sooth thy angry lady's mind,</l>
					<l>And make thy peace? Be thou to me as kind.</l>
					<l>Think what soft things to move her soul I said,</l>
					<l>And let them in a lover's favour plead.</l>
					<l>But ah! the tender things that made her kind,</l>
					<l>Work no such wonders on thy cruel mind.</l>
					<l>Wouldst thou my friendly offices repay,</l>
					<l>Fate throws a fair occasion in thy way;</l>
					<l>Unlock the gate, the morning will not stay.</l>
					<l>Unlock the gate; and as thou'rt kind to me,</l>
					<l>So may thy gentle lady prove to thee;</l>
					<l>May she to loose thy hateful chains incline,</l>
					<l>And stead of water, be thy portion wine.</l>
					<l>But what avail my soothing words? Thy ear</l>
					<l>Is deaf, inhuman! to my moving pray'r.</l>
					<l>Your gates with posts of pond'rous oak are barr'd,</l>
					<l>As if your house was for a siege prepar'd;</l>
					<l>Why all this fence? what foe have you to fear?</l>
					<l>And why in peace do you provide for war?</l>
					<l>Thus rudely if your lady's friends you treat,</l>
					<l>What usage must her foes expect to meet?</l>
					<l>Unlock the gate,-the morning will not stay;</l>
					<l>Unlock the gate, and give my love its way.</l>
					<l>Or is it sloth or is it sleep that brings,</l>
					<l>This let to love, and pinions down his wings!</l>
					<l>Why else do I in vain repeat my prayer,</l>
					<l>Is it, thou dost not, or thou wilt not hear?</l>
					<l>When first I waited at thy gate, and thought</l>
					<l>To 'scape thy care, I was at midnight caught.</l>
					<l>With over-dilligence thou then look'st out,</l>
					<l>To spy what lover was upon the scout.</l>
					<l>These are wild guesses, thou'rt perhaps employ'd</l>
					<l>More sweetly, and enjoy'st what I enjoy'd.</l>
					<l>And while I'm waiting with impatience here,</l>
					<l>Thy envied fortune's with the faithless fair.</l>
					<l>Oh, for thy pleasure, give me all thy pains,</l>
					<l>Let us change chances, and be mine thy chains.</l>
					<l>Unlock the gate, the morning will not stay,</l>
					<l>Unlock the gate, and kindness past repay.</l>
					<l>Hark: or I dream, or on the hinge I hear</l>
					<l>The wicket turn, or bolts unloosen'd jar.</l>
					<l>I dream, indeed, the bolts as they were laid,</l>
					<l>Stand fix'd: the noise was by my fancy made.</l>
					<l>But all, alas! is hush'd, I hear no sound,</l>
					<l>All in the silence of the night is drown'd.</l>
					<l>Here, hopeless of admittance, I attend,</l>
					<l>While on my head the pearly dews descend.</l>
					<l>Unlock the gate, the morning will not stay,</l>
					<l>Unlock the gate, I will no longer pray,</l>
					<l>But force by sword and fire my readier way.</l>
					<l>What need of fire or sword? myself alone,</l>
					<l>More pow'rful, than or sword or fire am grown.</l>
					<l>Around your heads shall flaming torches fly,</l>
					<l>And Jove the house shall burn, as well as I.</l>
					<l>Night, love, and wine encourage and inflame:</l>
					<l>These triumph over fear, and that o'er shame.</l>
					<l>All ways I've tried, but all successless prove,</l>
					<l>Nor threats can fright thee, nor entreaties move;</l>
					<l>Deaf to my pray'rs as to my tears thou'rt blind,</l>
					<l>Thy gate is less obdurate than thy mind.</l>
					<l>But see, the ruddy morn begins to rise,</l>
					<l>And paints with rosy streaks the eastern skies,</l>
					<l>While crowing cocks the lab'rer's sloth revile,</l>
					<l>And summon wretches to their daily toil.</l>
					<l>Throw then, fond man, thy fragrant chaplet by,</l>
					<l>And let it at thy lady's threshold lie.</l>
					<l>When in the morn thy faded flow'rs she spies,</l>
					<l>Kind thoughts of me may in her bosom rise,</l>
					<l>Perhaps she may resent her porter's crime,</l>
					<l>And grieve that here so ill I spent my time.</l>
					<l>Against me though thou shut'st thy lady's gate,</l>
					<l>I cannot one, that serves my mistress, hate.</l>
					<l>You both who did against my hopes rebel,</l>
					<l>Ah, porter; and ah, cruel gate, farewell. </l>

					<l>What more did Ajax in his fury do,</l>
					<l>When all the sacred grazing herd he slew?</l>
					<l>Or he<note anchored="true" place="foot" resp="ed">Orestes</note> who spared
						not her who gave him breath?</l>
					<l>So ill the son reveng'd his father's death!</l>
					<l>Then I had broke the most religious ties,</l>
					<l>Both to my parents and the deities:</l>
					<l>I tore (0 heav'ns!) her finely braided hair,</l>
					<l>How charming then look'd the disorder'd fair.</l>
					<l>So Atalanta in her chaise is drawn,</l>
					<l>Where the <placeName key="tgn,2136419">Arcadian</placeName> beasts her empire
						own:</l>
					<l>So Ariadne, left upon the shore,</l>
					<l>Does all alone her lost estate deplore.</l>
					<l>Who would not then have rail'd and talk'd aloud</l>
					<l>(Which to the helpless sex might be allowed.)</l>
					<l>She only did upbraid me with her eye,</l>
					<l>Whose speaking tears did want of words supply.</l>
					<l>0, that some merciful superior pow'r</l>
					<l>Had struck me lame before that fatal hour,</l>
					<l>And not have suffer'd me to pierce my heart</l>
					<l>So deeply, in the best and tend'rest part;</l>
					<l>To make a lady that subjection own,</l>
					<l>Which is not to the meanest Roman known.</l>
					<l>'Twas Diomede, who first a goddess struck,</l>
					<l>I from his hand that curs'd example took;</l>
					<l>But he was far less criminal than I,</l>
					<l>I was a lover, he an enemy.</l>
					<l>March like a conqueror in triumph now,</l>
					<l>With laurel wreaths encompassing your brow,</l>
					<l>And render to the mighty gods your vow:</l>
					<l>So, as you pass, th' attending gazing crowd,</l>
					<l>By their applause shall speak your courage loud:</l>
					<l>Let your sad captive in the front appear,</l>
					<l>With streaming cheeks, and with dishevell'd hair.</l>
					<l>Such lips were form'd for kinder words than these,</l>
					<l>Wounds made by lovers' furious ecstasies.</l>
					<l>Though like a torrent I was hurried on,</l>
					<l>A slave to passion which I could not shun,</l>
					<l>I might have only pierc'd her tender ear</l>
					<l>With threatening language, such as virgins fear.</l>
					<l>Fear having chill'd the current of her blood,</l>
					<l>She pale as Parian marble statue stood;</l>
					<l>Tears, which suspense did for a while restrain,</l>
					<l>Gush'd forth, and down her cheeks the deluge ran.</l>
					<l>As when the sun does by a powerful beam</l>
					<l>Dissolve the frost, it runs into a stream.</l>
					<l>The lamentable objects struck me dead,</l>
					<l>And tears of blood to quench those tears I shed;</l>
					<l>Thrice at her feet the prostrate suppliant fell,</l>
					<l>And thrice did she repulse the criminal.</l>
					<l>What would I not your anger to abate,</l>
					<l>Redeem your favour, or remove your hate?</l>
					<l>To your revenge no means or method spare;</l>
					<l>Revenge, alas! is easy to the fair. </l>

					<l>There is a bawd renown'd in <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName>'

					<l>Aud dreadful still with honorable scars;</l>
					<l>Her youth and beauty, craft and guile supply,</l>
					<l>Sworn foe to all degrees of chastity.</l>
					<l>Dypsas, who first taught love-sick maids the way</l>
					<l>To cheat the bridegroom on the wedding-day,</l>
					<l>And then a hundred subtle tricks devis'd,</l>
					<l>Wherewith the am'rous theft might be disguis'd;</l>
					<l>Of herbs and spells she tries the guilty force,</l>
					<l>The poison of a mare that goes to horse.</l>
					<l>Cleaving the midnight air upon a switch,</l>
					<l>Some for a bawd, most take her for a witch.</l>
					<l>Each morning sees her reeling to her bed,</l>
					<l>Her native blue o'ercome with drunken red:</l>
					<l>Her ready tongue ne'er wants a useful lie,</l>
					<l>Soft moving words, nor charming flattery.</l>
					<l>Thus I o'erheard her to my <placeName key="tgn,2075531">Lucia</placeName>
						speak:</l>
					<l>"Young <placeName key="tgn,2274809">Damon</placeName>'s heart wilt thou for

					<l>He long has lov'd thee, and by me he sends</l>
					<l>To learn thy motions, which he still attends;</l>
					<l>If to the park thou go'st, the plays are ill;</l>
					<l>If to the plays, he thinks the air would kill.</l>
					<l>The other day he gaz'd upon thy face,</l>
					<l>As he would grow a statue in the place;</l>
					<l>And who indeed does not? like a new star,</l>
					<l>Beauty like thine strikes wonder from afar.</l>
					<l>Alas! methinks thou art ill-dress'd to-night;</l>
					<l>This point's too poor; thy necklace is not right;</l>
					<l>This gown was by some botching tailor made,</l>
					<l>It spoils thy shape; this fucus is ill laid.</l>
					<l>Hear me, and be as happy as thou'rt fair:</l>
					<l>Damon is rich, and what thou wanst, can spare.</l>
					<l>Like thine his face, like thine his eyes are thought.</l>
					<l>Would he not buy, he might himself be bought."</l>
					<l>Fair <placeName key="tgn,2075531">Lucia</placeName> blush'd. "It is a sign of
						grace,</l>
					<l>(Dypsas replied,) that red becomes thy face.</l>
					<l>All lovers now by what they give are weighed,</l>
					<l>And she is best belov'd that best is paid;</l>
					<l>The sun-burnt Latins, in old Tatius' reign,</l>
					<l>Did to one man perhaps their love restrain:</l>
					<l><placeName key="tgn,2096104">Venus</placeName> in her Aeneas' city rules,</l>
					<l>And all adore her deity but fools.</l>
					<l>Go on, ye fair, chaste only let such live</l>
					<l>As none will ask, and know not how to give.</l>
					<l>Life steals away, and our best hours are gone</l>
					<l>Ere the true use or worth of them be known.</l>
					<l>Things long neglected, of themselves decay;</l>
					<l>What we forbear, time rudely makes his prey.</l>
					<l>Beauty is best preserv'd by exercise,</l>
					<l>Nor for that task can one or few suffice.</l>
					<l>Wouldst thou grow rich, thou must from many take:</l>
					<l>From one 'twere hard continually to rake.</l>
					<l>Without new gowns and coaches, who can live ?</l>
					<l>What does thy poet but new verses give?</l>
					<l>A poet, the last thing that earth does breed,</l>
					<l>Whose wit, for sixpence, any one may read.</l>
					<l>Hang the poor lover, and his pedigree;</l>
					<l>The thriving merchant, or fat judge, give me.</l>
					<l>Love truly none, but seem in love with all,</l>
					<l>And at old friends to thy new lovers rail.</l>
					<l>Sometimes deny, 'twill appetite procure;</l>
					<l>The sharp-set hawks will stoop to any lure.</l>
					<l>Then grant again, lest he a habit get</l>
					<l>Of living from thee; but be sure thou let</l>
					<l>No empty lover in; murmur sometimes,</l>
					<l>And at first hurt, reproach him with thy crimes.</l>
					<l>Seem jealous, when thou'st been thyself to blame;</l>
					<l>'Twill stop his mouth, if thou the first complain.</l>
					<l>All thou hast done be ready to forswear:</l>

					<l>Whilst lie is with thee, let some woman bring</l>
					<l>Some Indian stuff or foreign precious thing;</l>
					<l>Which thou must say thou want'st, and he must buy,</l>
					<l>Though for it six months hence in gaol he lie.</l>
					<l>Thy mother, sister, brother, and thy nurse,</l>
					<l>Must have a pull each at thy lover's purse.</l>
					<l>Let him from rivals never be secure,</l>
					<l>That hope once gone, love will not long endure;</l>
					<l>Show him the presents by those rivals sent,</l>
					<l>So shall his bounty thy request prevent.</l>
					<l>When he will give no more, ask him to lend:</l>
					<l>If he wants money, find a trusting friend.</l>
					<l>Get hangings, cabinets, and looking-glass,</l>
					<l>Or any thing for which his word will pass.</l>
					<l>Practise these rules, thou'lt find the benefit!</l>
					<l>I lost my beauty ere I got this wit."</l>
					<l>I at that word step'd from behind the door,</l>
					<l>And scarce my nails from her thin cheeks forbore.</l>
					<l>Her few gray hairs in rage I vow'd to pull,</l>
					<l>And thrust her drunken eyes into her skull.</l>
					<l>"Poor in a dungeon's bottom may'st thou rot,</l>

					<head>Elegy IX: Of Love and War. By Henry Cromwell.</head>
					<l>Trust me, my Atticus, in love are wars;</l>
					<l>And Cupid has his camp, as well as <placeName key="tgn,2090583"
							>Mars</placeName>:</l>
					<l>The age that's fit for war best suits with love,</l>
					<l>The old in both unserviceable prove,</l>
					<l>Infirm in war, and impotent in love.</l>
					<l>The soldiers which a general does require,</l>
					<l>Are such as ladies would in bed desire:</l>
					<l>Who but a soldier, and a lover, can</l>
					<l>Bear the night's cold, in show'rs of hail and rain?</l>
					<l>One in continual watch his station keeps,</l>
					<l>Or on the earth in broken slumbers sleeps;</l>
					<l>The other takes his still repeated round</l>
					<l>By mistress' house — then lodges on the ground.</l>
					<l>Soldiers, and lovers, with a careful eye,</l>
					<l>Observe the motions of the enemy:</l>
					<l>One to the walls makes his approach in form,</l>
					<l>Pushes the siege, and takes the town by storm:</l>
					<l>The other lays his close to Celia's fort,</l>
					<l>Presses his point, and gains the wish'd-for port.</l>
					<l>As soldiers, when the foe securely lies</l>
					<l>In sleep, and wine dissolv'd, the camp surprise;</l>
					<l>So when the jealous to their rest remove,</l>
					<l>And all is hush'd, — the other steals to love.</l>
					<l>You then, who think that love's an idle fit,</l>
					<l>Know, that it is the exercise of wit.</l>
					<l>In flames of love the fierce Achilles burns,</l>
					<l>And, quitting arms, absent Briseis mourns:</l>
					<l>From the embraces of Andromache</l>
					<l>Went Hector arm'd for war, and victory.</l>
					<l>As Agamemnon saw Cassandra pass</l>
					<l>With hair dishevell'd, and disorder'd dress,</l>
					<l>H' admir'd the beauties of the prophetess:</l>
					<l>The god of war was caught in th' act of love;</l>
					<l>A story know to all the court above.</l>
					<l>Once did I pass my hours in sloth and ease,</l>
					<l>Cool shades and beds of down could only please;</l>
					<l>When a commanding beauty rais'd my mind,</l>
					<l>I left all little trifling thoughts behind,</l>
					<l>And to her service all my heart resign'd:</l>
					<l>Since, like an active soldier, have I spent</l>
					<l>My time in toils of war, in beauty's tent:</l>
					<l>And for so sweet a pay all dangers underwent.</l>
					<l>You see, my Atticus, by what I prove,</l>
					<l>Who would not live in idleness-must love. </l>

					<l>Like thee no lady's woman in the town</l>
					<l>Can forward an intrigue, or pin a gown;</l>
					<l>No maid than thee can boast a quicker eye,</l>
					<l>Nor sooner the sour husband's coming spy.</l>
					<l>Here, Nape, take this billet-doux, and bear</l>
					<l>My soul's soft wishes to the absent fair.</l>
					<l>If I can guess, thy heart is not of flint,</l>
					<l>Nor is there the least vein of iron in't;</l>
					<l>I something in thy looks and manners see</l>
					<l>Above the rudeness of thy low degree;</l>
					<l>A softer turn, to pity more inclined,</l>
					<l>Than vulgar souls, a more complacent mind;</l>
					<l>Thou feel'st, if I can guess, an equal flame,</l>
					<l>And thine and my distemper is the same.</l>
					<l>If how I do, she asks, do thou reply,</l>
					<l>For the dear night, and night's dear joys, I die.</l>
					<l>Tell her the letter will the rest explain,</l>
					<l>And does my soul, and all its hopes contain.</l>
					<l>But time, while I am speaking, flies: be sure</l>
					<l>To give the billet in a leisure hour:</l>
					<l>Don't be content with her imperfect view,</l>
					<l>But make her, when she has it, read it through.</l>
					<l>I charge thee, as she reads, observe her eyes,</l>
					<l>Catch, if thou canst, her gentle looks and sighs;</l>
					<l>As these are sure presages of my joy,</l>
					<l>So frowns and low'rs my flattering hopes destroy.</l>
					<l>Pray her, when she has read it, to indite</l>
					<l>An answer, and a long epistle write.</l>
					<l>I hate a billet, where at once I view</l>
					<l>A page all empty, but a line or two.</l>
					<l>Let her without a margin fill it up,</l>
					<l>And crowd it from the bottom to the top.</l>
					<l>But why should I her pretty fingers tire?</l>
					<l>A word's enough, and all that I desire.</l>
					<l>Ah, Nape, let her only bid me come;</l>
					<l>The page is large, which for that word has room.</l>

					<l>And now, if ever lover was, am bless'd.</l>
					<l>As yet sweet sleep sits heavy on our eyes,</l>
					<l>And warbling birds forbid, as yet to rise.</l>
					<l>Stay, beauteous morning, for to love-sick maids</l>
					<l>And youths, how grateful are these dusky shades!</l>
					<l>All stay, and do not, from the blushing east,</l>
					<l>With dawning glories break our balmy rest.</l>
					<l>When night's black mantle does those glories hide,</l>
					<l>The pilot by the stars his ship can guide,</l>
					<l>And in mid-sea a certain course pursue,</l>

					<l>Quits his warm tent, and fits him for the field:</l>

					<l>A word is wanting in the dower deed,</l>
					<l>And what to save the portion must he plead?</l>
					<l>Now hungry serjeants quit their tempting ease,</l>
					<l>To haunt the crowded courts and pick up fees.</l>
					<l>Thy rise brings labour to the female band,</l>

					<l>Light are these toils, and little is the pain</l>
					<l>To rise to work, and rest at night again;</l>
					<l>But who that e'er knew love's transporting joys,</l>
					<l>Could from the arms of youth and beauty rise?</l>
					<l>Oft have I wish'd that night would keep her ground,</l>
					<l>And all her stars be at thy rising found;</l>
					<l>Oft have I wish'd the winds would stop thy way,</l>

					<l>Dost thou in envy lash each lazy steed,</l>
					<l>And whirl thy chariot with unwonted speed?</l>

					<l>He, born of Cephalus, his ravish'd sire,</l>

					<l>In Cephalus' embraces when you lay,</l>
					<l>And oft by theft renew'd your wanton play;</l>
					<l>When Tithon's impotence you made your sport,</l>
					<l>Did you not think the joyous moments short?</l>
					<l>Lock'd in his arms did you in transports lie,</l>
					<l>Ah! would you not, like me, to Phoebus cry,</l>
					<l>"Stop, stop thy rapid course? Am I to blame</l>

					<l>How wilt thou blush, with other charms to please,</l>
					<l>And cry, "How fairer were my locks than these !"</l>
					<l>By heav'ns, to heart she takes her head's disgrace,</l>
					<l>She weeps, and covers with her hands her face.</l>
					<l>She weeps, as in her lap her locks she views;</l>
					<l>What woman would not weep, such locks to lose!</l>
					<l>Ah, that they still did on her shoulders flow,</l>
					<l>Ah, that they now, where once they grew, did grow!</l>
					<l>Take courage, fair <placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName>, never

					<l>Thou shalt not long these borrow'd tresses wear:</l>
					<l>Time for your beauty shall this loss repair</l>

					<head>Elegy III: To a Eunuch, who had the keeping of his mistress</head>
					<l>How hard's my hap, to have my fair consign'd</l>

					<l>To one, who ne'er can have the pow'r to prove</l>
					<l>As woman, or as man, the mutual joys of love!</l>
					<l>Who practis'd first on boys the cutting steel,</l>
					<l>Deserv'd himself the fatal wound to feel.</l>
					<l>Couldst thou be capable of Cupid's fires,</l>
					<l>Or the least sensible of love's desires,</l>
					<l>Some pity thou wouldst have on me, and grant</l>
					<l>Thy aid, for what thou canst not know I want.</l>
					<l>Ill suits thee now, the warrior's lance to wield,</l>
					<l>To mount the manag'd horse, or lift the brazen shield:</l>
					<l>Arms are for men, and not for such as thee,</l>
					<l>Who shouldst from ev'ry manly thought be free.</l>
					<l>No banner shouldst thou, but thy lady's bear,</l>

					<l>Much it behoves thee then to strive to gain</l>
					<l>Her favour, and thou need'st not strive in vain.</l>
					<l>Consult her pleasure, and her will obey,</l>
					<l>To favour that's the sure, the ready way:</l>
					<l>Without it, how unhappy wilt thou be!</l>
					<l>Life is without it of no use to thee.</l>
					<l>Thou'rt beautiful, and mayst thy prime enjoy,</l>
					<l>And well thy beauty and thy youth employ.</l>
					<l>Study to serve thy gentle mistress well,</l>
					<l>And merit her good graces by thy zeal;</l>
					<l>Watch as thou wilt, the trouble thou mayst spare,</l>
					<l>She'll easily deceive thy utmost care.</l>
					<l>When two fond lovers are agreed to meet,</l>
					<l>Canst thou their well-concerted plot defeat?</l>
					<l>The ways of kindness thou shouldst rather use;</l>
					<l>By being civil thou wilt nothing lose;</l>
					<l>And when an opportunity is fail,</l>
					<l>For thy own sake be friendly to our pray'r.</l>

					<head>Elegy IV: That he loves all sorts of women.</head>
					<l>Vice by my verse I never will defend,</l>
					<l>Nor by false arms to fence my own pretend.</l>
					<l>Frankly my failings I with shame confess;</l>
					<l>To hide my errors would not make them less.</l>
					<l>My faults, whate'er I suffer by't, I own,</l>
					<l>That others, if they please, those faults may shun</l>
					<l>I hate myself, my follies, and would fain</l>
					<l>Be, were it in my pow'r, another man.</l>
					<l>How difficult it is, ye righteous Gods,</l>
					<l>Against our wills to bear such heavy loads.</l>
					<l>I have not strength to guard myself from ill,</l>
					<l>And, as I wish, to rule my wicked will.</l>
					<l>I'm hurry'd on, as by the boistrous sea</l>
					<l>The driving bark is swiftly borne away.</l>
					<l>No certain form inflames my am'rous breast,</l>
					<l>All beauty is alike to me the best;</l>
					<l>A hundred causes kindle my desires,</l>
					<l>And love ne'er wants a torch to light my fires.</l>
					<l>When on the earth the modest virgin looks,</l>
					<l>That very modesty of hers provokes;</l>
					<l>And if I chance to meet a forward fair,</l>
					<l>I'm taken with her frank and easy air:</l>
					<l>I figure to myself a thousand charms,</l>
					<l>A thousand raptures in her wanton arms.</l>
					<l>If, like the damsels of the <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName>
						race,</l>
					<l>She's rude, I look upon it as grimace;</l>
					<l>That sullen as she seems at first, 'tis art,</l>
					<l>That I the more may prize the conquest or her heart.</l>
					<l>New joys, if she's a wit, I hope to find;</l>
					<l>And with her body, to possess her mind:</l>
					<l>If foolish, I in that can see no harm,</l>
					<l>And in her very folly find a charm.</l>
					<l>I know a maid so very fond, and dull,</l>
					<l>To me she thinks Callimachus a fool.</l>
					<l>I soon am pleas'd with one that's pleas'd with me,</l>
					<l>Alike we in our taste and wish agree:</l>
					<l>But if the fair my verses don't approve,</l>
					<l>I bragging tell her, she will like my love;</l>
					<l>If with her tongue, or with her heel she's brisk,</l>
					<l>Her prattle pleases, and her gamesome frisk;</l>
					<l>But if she's heavy, I suppose at night</l>
					<l>She'll change, and prove, as I would have her, light,</l>
					<l>The fair that sings, enchants me with her voice;</l>
					<l>Oh, what a gust it gives a lover's joys!</l>
					<l>When her shrill shakes afresh his bosom wound,</l>
					<l>And from her lips he kisses off the sound;</l>
					<l>When her soft fingers touch the silver strings,</l>
					<l>And sweetly to the sounding lute she sings;</l>
					<l>Who can resist such strong redoubled charms?</l>
					<l>Her music melts me, as her beauty warms</l>
					<l>If in the dance the nimble nymph I find,</l>
					<l>And view how she her pliant limbs does wind,</l>
					<l>How artfully she to the music moves,</l>
					<l>I cry, "How happy is the man she loves!"</l>
					<l>My humour, in a word, is plainly this,</l>
					<l>All objects please, and nothing comes amiss.</l>
					<l>To love, and be belov'd my sole employ:</l>
					<l>Dispos'd to be enjoy'd, and to enjoy.</l>
					<l>This lady for her length I like, her spread</l>
					<l>Will swell my arms, and fill the joyous bed;</l>
					<l>She's like the lusty heroines of old,</l>
					<l>And with a strong embrace her lover will enfold.</l>
					<l>This lass, because she's little, I approve;</l>
					<l>The least are lightest in the sports of love.</l>
					<l>With every size my passion does agree,</l>
					<l>And tall and short are both alike to me.</l>
					<l>I fancy, when undress'd I find the fair,</l>
					<l>'Tis less her want of charms, than want of care.</l>
					<l>If with her dishabille, I cry, " I'm pleas'd,"</l>
					<l>How beauteous would she be if she were dress'd</l>
					<l>And when she does her best apparel wear,</l>
					<l>I think her riches in her pride appear.</l>
					<l>The fair, the olive, are to me the same,</l>
					<l>Alike the swarthy, and the sandy dame.</l>
					<l>When her black curls adown her shoulders flow,</l>
					<l>Such Leda's were, her skin as white as snow;</l>
					<l>And when her golden locks her head adorn,</l>
					<l>I straight compare her to the saffron morn.</l>
					<l>My love with no complexion disagrees,</l>
					<l>But all alike my ready passion please.</l>
					<l>The younger by their bloom my heart secure,</l>
					<l>The elder win it as they're more mature;</l>
					<l>And though the younger may excel in charms,</l>
					<l>The elder clasp you with experienc'd arms</l>
					<l>What all the city like, is liked by me,</l>
					<l>And I with them and all my loves agree.</l>
					<l>I'm proud to be the rival of the town,</l>
					<l>And to their taste will still conform my own. </l>

					<head>Elegy V: To His False Mistress. By Eusden.</head>
					<l>Cupid, be gone! I can for beauty sigh,</l>
					<l>But not be forc'd to wish each hour to die;</l>
					<l>For so I wish whene'er my restless thoughts</l>
					<l>Dwell on her falsehoods and repeated faults.</l>
					<l>All other plagues know sometimes to be civil,</l>
					<l>But woman is a sure, perpetual evil.</l>
					<l>No pimp I bribe to prove thy perjur'd vows,</l>
					<l>Nor intercepted once thy billet-doux.</l>
					<l>0, cou dst thou but my arguments disprove!</l>
					<l>A cause so good is here unwish'd in love.</l>
					<l>Happy, who dares t' avow his censur'd flame,</l>
					<l>And vindicate the secret tripping dame.</l>
					<l>Blushless, tho' guilty, with uplifted eyes,</l>
					<l>"'Tis false, my life, by yon bright Heaven," she cries.</l>
					<l>Himself he fools, and madly feeds his grief,</l>
					<l>Who from conviction seeks the sad relief.</l>
					<l>Wretched I saw thy wantonness unsought,</l>
					<l>By thee in sleep secure and eyeless thought;</l>
					<l>With glances on each other how you hung!</l>
					<l>How ev'ry nod had more than half a tongue!</l>
					<l>How roll'd thy glowing eyes! how lewd they spoke!</l>
					<l>E'en from thy artful fingers language broke;</l>
					<l>While writing on the board with pens they vied,</l>
					<l>And the spilt wine the want of ink supplied.</l>
					<l>The silent speech too well I understood,</l>
					<l>For to deceive a lover yet who could?</l>
					<l>Tho' thou didst write in a laconic hand,</l>
					<l>And words for sentences were taught to stand.</l>
					<l>Now ended was the treat, and ev'ry guest</l>
					<l>Indulg'd his ease, and lay compos'd to rest:</l>
					<l>Your close, lascivious kisses then I spied,</l>
					<l>And something more than lips to lips applied;</l>
					<l>Such from a sister brothers ne'er receive,</l>
					<l>But yielding fair ones to warm lovers give.</l>
					<l>Not so <placeName key="tgn,2118015">Diana</placeName> would to Phoebus
						press,</l>
					<l>But Cytherea so her <placeName key="tgn,2090583">Mars</placeName> would
						bless.</l>
					<l>Too far provok'd, at last I cried aloud,</l>
					<l>"On whom are pleasures, due to me, bestow'd?</l>
					<l>I must not, will not, cannot bear this sight;</l>
					<l>'Tis lawful, sure, to seize upon my right.</l>
					<l>These raptures to us both in common are,</l>
					<l>But whence, ye furies, claims a third his share?"</l>
					<l>Enrag'd I spoke, and o'er her cheeks were spread</l>
					<l>Swift newborn glories in a sudden red;</l>
					<l>Such blushes on the bridal night adorn</l>
					<l>The trembling virgin; such the rising morn.</l>
					<l>So sweet a hue the lab'ring <placeName key="tgn,2056258">Cynthia</placeName>
						shows,</l>
					<l>Or the fair lily damask'd by the rose;</l>
					<l>Or iv'ry, which time's yellow taint defies,</l>
					<l>When twice enrich'd with proud Assyrian dies:</l>
					<l>Such were her looks, and a diviner grace</l>
					<l>Had never brighten'd that enchanting face.</l>
					<l>She cast her eyes down on the humble ground;</l>
					<l>Her eyes, so cast, an unknown sweetness found.</l>
					<l>Mournful her looks; her mournful looks became</l>
					<l>Shining thro' grief, and beautiful in shame.</l>
					<l>I rush'd, resolv'd her golden locks to tear,</l>
					<l>And with mad violence disrobe the fair;</l>
					<l>But as I viewed her face, th' extended hand</l>
					<l>Shrunk back, nor hearken'd to the harsh command.</l>
					<l>Others protection seek by dint of arms,</l>
					<l>Her only safeguard was -- her wondrous charms.</l>
					<l>I, who but late look'd insolently brave,</l>
					<l>Fell from my height, and couch'd a suppliant slave:</l>
					<l>I rav'd no longer at another's bliss,</l>
					<l>But begg'd the transport of as sweet a kiss.</l>
					<l>Smiling she said, " How grateful thy request!</l>
					<l>If e'er my kisses please thee, take the best."</l>
					<l>Oh, with what gust as from her soul they came!</l>
					<l>Such might melt Jove, and stop the vengeful flame;</l>
					<l>I fear'd my rival too enjoy'd the same.</l>
					<l>These, better than from me she learn'd I thought,</l>
					<l>Something taught new, alas! I wish'd untaught;</l>
					<l>What most gave pleasure, that now stings the most;</l>
					<l>Why were our darting tongues entirely lost?</l>
					<l>Nor fret I thou in kissing shouldst excel,</l>
					<l>And yet 'tis strange to know to kiss so well;</l>
					<l>But ah! such lectures only could be read</l>
					<l>By youthful tutors, and imbib'd abed.</l>
					<l>That sage who'er these large improvements made,</l>

					<l>Alas! poor Poll, my Indian talker, dies!</l>
					<l>Go, birds, and celebrate his obsequies;</l>
					<l>Go, birds, and beat your breasts, your faces tear,</l>
					<l>And pluck your gaudy plumes instead of hair;</l>
					<l>Let doleful tunes the frighted forest wound,</l>
					<l>And your sad notes supply the trumpet's sound.</l>
					<l>Why, Philomel, dost mourn the Thracian rage?</l>
					<l>It is enough, thy grief at last assuage;</l>
					<l>His crimson faults are now grown white with age.</l>
					<l>Now mourn this bird; the cause of all thy woe</l>
					<l>Was great, 'tis true, but it was long ago.</l>
					<l>Mourn, all ye wing'd inhabitants of air,</l>
					<l>But you, my turtle, take the greatest share;</l>
					<l>You too liv'd constant friends and free from strife</l>
					<l>Your kindness was entire, and long as life:</l>
					<l>What Pylades to his Orestes vow'd.</l>
					<l>To thee, poor Poll, thy friendly turtle show'd,</l>
					<l>And kept his love as long as fate allow'd.</l>
					<l>But, ah! what did thy faith, thy plumes, and tail,</l>
					<l>And what thy pretty speaking art, avail?</l>
					<l>And what that thou wert giv'n, and pleas'd my miss,</l>
					<l>Since now the bird's unhappy glory dies ?</l>
					<l>A lovely verdant green grac'd ev'ry quill,</l>
					<l>The deepest vivid red did paint thy bill;</l>
					<l>In speaking thou didst ev'ry bird excel,</l>
					<l>None prattled, and none lisp'd the words so well.</l>
					<l>'Twas envy only sent this fierce disease;</l>
					<l>Thou wert averse to war, and liv'dst in peace,</l>
					<l>A talking harmless thing, and lov'dst thine ease.</l>
					<l>The fighting quails still live 'midst all their strife,</l>
					<l>And even that, perhaps, prolongs their life.</l>
					<l>Thy meat was little, and thy prattling tongue</l>
					<l>Would ne'er permit to make thy dinner long:</l>
					<l>Plain fountain water all thy drink allow'd,</l>
					<l>And nut and poppy-seed were all thy food.</l>
					<l>The preying vultures and the kites remain,</l>
					<l>And the unlucky crow still caws for rain;</l>
					<l>The chough still lives 'midst fierce <placeName key="tgn,2070580"

					<l>And scarce nine hundred years conclude her fate;</l>
					<l>But my poor Poll now hangs his sickly head,</l>
					<l>My Poll, my present from the east, is dead.</l>
					<l>Best things are sooner snatch'd by cov'tous fate,</l>
					<l>To worse she freely gives a longer date;</l>
					<l>Thersites brave Achilles' fate surviv'd,</l>
					<l>And <placeName key="tgn,2069653">Hector</placeName> fell, whilst all his

					<l>Why should I tell what vows <placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName>
						made?</l>
					<l>How oft she begg'd thy life, how oft she pray'd ?</l>
					<l>The seventh day came, and now the Fates begin</l>
					<l>To end the thread, they had no more to spin;</l>
					<l>Yet still he talk'd, and when death nearer drew,</l>
					<l>His last breath said, "<placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName>, now

					<l>There is a shady cypress grove below,</l>
					<l>And thither (if such doubtful things we know)</l>
					<l>The ghosts of pious birds departed go;</l>
					<l>'Tis water'd well, and verdant all the year,</l>
					<l>And birds obscene do never enter there;</l>
					<l>There harmless swans securely take their rest,</l>
					<l>And there the single Phoenix builds her nest;</l>
					<l>Proud peacocks there display their gaudy train,</l>
					<l>And billing turtles coo o'er all the plain:</l>
					<l>To these dark shades my parrot's soul shall go,</l>
					<l>And with his talk divert the birds below;</l>
					<l>Whilst here his bones enjoy a noble grave,</l>

					<l>O Love! how cold and slow to take my part,</l>
					<l>Thou idle wanderer about my heart!</l>
					<l>Why thy old faithful soldier wilt thou see</l>
					<l>Oppress'd in thy own tents? they murder me;</l>
					<l>Thy flames consume, thy arrows pierce thy friends;</l>
					<l>Rather on foes pursue more noble ends.</l>
					<l>Achilles' sword would certainly bestow</l>
					<l>A cure as certain as it gave the blow.</l>
					<l>Hunters, who follow flying game, give o'er</l>
					<l>When the prey's caught, hope still leads on before;</l>
					<l>We, thine own slaves, feel thy tyrannic blows.</l>
					<l>While thy tame hand's unmov'd against thy foes.</l>
					<l>On men disarm'd, how can you gallant prove ?</l>
					<l>And I was long ago disarm'd by love.</l>
					<l>Millions of dull men live, and scornful maids;</l>
					<l>We'll own love valiant when he these invades.</l>
					<l><placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> from each corner of the wide

					<l>A laurel, or't had been to this day thatch'd;</l>
					<l>But the old soldier has his resting-place,</l>
					<l>And the good batter'd horse is turn'd to grass:</l>
					<l>The harass'd whore, who liv'd a wretch to please,</l>
					<l>Has leave to be a bawd, and take her ease.</l>
					<l>For me then, who have truly spent my blood,</l>
					<l>Love, in thy service, and so boldly stood</l>
					<l>In <placeName key="tgn,2087042">Celia</placeName>'s trenches, were't not
						wisely done,</l>
					<l>E'en to retire, and live at peace at home ?</l>
					<l>No-might I gain a godhead to disclaim</l>
					<l>My glorious title to my endless flame,</l>
					<l>Divinity with scorn I would forswear,</l>
					<l>Such sweet, dear, tempting devils women are.</l>
					<l>Whene'er those flames grow faint, I quickly find</l>
					<l>A fierce black storm pour down upon my mind;</l>
					<l>Headlong I'm hurl'd like horsemen who in vain</l>
					<l>Their fury-flaming coursers would restrain.</l>
					<l>As ships, just when the harbour they attain,</l>
					<l>Are snatch'd by sudden blasts to sea again,</l>
					<l>So Love's fantastic storms reduce my heart,</l>
					<l>Half rescu'd, and the god resumes his dart.</l>
					<l>Strike here, this undefended bosom wound,</l>
					<l>And for so brave a conquest be renown'd.</l>
					<l>Shafts fly so fast to me from ev'ry part,</l>
					<l>You'll scarce discern the quiver from my heart.</l>
					<l>What wretch can bear a livelong night's dull rest,</l>
					<l>Or think himself in lazy slumbers blest?</l>
					<l>Fool-is not sleep the image of pale death?</l>
					<l>There's time for rest when fate has stopp'd your breath.</l>
					<l>Me may my soft deluding dear deceive,</l>
					<l>I'm happy in my hopes, while I believe:</l>
					<l>Now let her flatter, then as fondly chide,</l>
					<l>Often may I enjoy, oft be denied.</l>
					<l>With doubtful steps the god of war does move,</l>
					<l>By thy example, in ambiguous love.</l>
					<l>Blown to and fro, like down from thy own wing,</l>
					<l>Who knows when joy or anguish thou wilt bring?</l>
					<l>Yet at thy mother's and thy slave's request,</l>
					<l>Fix an eternal empire in my breast;</l>
					<l>And let th' inconstant charming sex,</l>
					<l>Whose wilful scorn does lovers vex,</l>
					<l>Submit their hearts before thy throne;</l>
					<l>The vassal world is then thy own. </l>

					<head>Elegy X: <placeName key="tgn,2071526">Ovid</placeName> tells Graecinus,

					<l>What you affirm'd, my friend, is prov'd untrue,</l>
					<l>That none at once could madly dote on two.</l>
					<l>Deceiv'd, unarm'd, we Cupid soon o'ercame,</l>
					<l>And I glow shameless with a double flame.</l>
					<l>They both are fair, both dress'd so nicely well,</l>
					<l>That the pre-eminence is hard to tell.</l>
					<l>Sometimes for this, sometimes for that I burn,</l>
					<l>And each more beauteous sparkles in her turn.</l>
					<l>Each claims my passion, and my heart divides</l>
					<l>As to and fro the doubtful galliot rides.</l>
					<l>Here driven by winds, and there redriven by tides.</l>
					<l>Why doubly chain'd ? was not a single fair</l>
					<l>Enough to load me with perpetual care?</l>
					<l>Why are more leaves brought to the shady wood,</l>
					<l>Stars to the sky, or waters to the flood ?</l>
					<l>Yet better so than not to love at all;</l>
					<l>Still on my foes may such dull blessings fall.</l>
					<l>May they, insipidly supine, be spread</l>
					<l>Along the middle of a widowed bed;</l>

					<l>Stretch'd out for something far more sweet than sleep.</l>
					<l>Others from ruin fly, to mine I run,</l>
					<l>To be by women pleasingly undone,</l>
					<l>Longing for two, since undestroy'd by one.</l>
					<l>Still let my slender limbs for love suffice;</l>
					<l>I want no nerves, but want the bulky size.</l>
					<l>My limbs, tho' lean are not in vain display'd;</l>
					<l>From me no female ever rose a maid.</l>
					<l>Oft have I, when a luscious night was spent,</l>
					<l>Saluted morn, nor cloy'd nor impotent.</l>
					<l>Happy, who gasps in love his latest breath;</l>
					<l>Give me, ye gods, so softly sweet a death !</l>
					<l>Let the rough warriors grapple on the plain,</l>
					<l>And with their blood immortal honour gain;</l>
					<l>Let the vile miser plough for wealth the deep,</l>
					<l>And, shipwrek'd in the unfatbom'd waters, sleep</l>
					<l>May <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName> grant me but my last

					<head>Elegy XVII: He tells <placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName> he
						will always be her slave</head>
					<l>If there's a wretch, who thinks it is a shame,</l>
					<l>To serve a lovely and a loving dame:</l>
					<l>If such a slave he loads with infamy,</l>
					<l>I'm willing he should judge as hard of me;</l>
					<l>I'm willing all the world should know my shame</l>
					<l>If <placeName key="tgn,2081683">Venus</placeName> will abate my raging
						flame.</l>
					<l>Let me a fair and gentle mistress have,</l>
					<l>And then proclaim aloud that I'm her slave.</l>
					<l>Beauty is apt to swell a maiden's mind,</l>
					<l>And thus <placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName> is to pride
						inclin'd:</l>
					<l>But as she is above all maiden's fair,</l>
					<l>What's pride in them is insolence in her;</l>
					<l>Less fair I wish she was, or knew it less;</l>
					<l>How learnt she, she is lovely by her face!</l>
					<l>Her mirror tells her so, she often tries</l>
					<l>Her mirror, and believes her charming eyes.</l>
					<l>The looks she then puts on, are still her best,</l>
					<l>And she ne'er uses it but when she's dress'd.</l>
					<l>Though wide the empire of your beauties spread,</l>
					<l>Beauty to draw my am'rous glances made:</l>
					<l>Compare your servant's merit with your eyes,</l>
					<l>You'll find no cause his service to dispise.</l>
					<l>Don't think I press upon your pride too hard.</l>
					<l>For little things may be with great compar'd:</l>
					<l>We're told Calypso, an immortal pow'r,</l>
					<l>Detain'd a mortal in th' Ogygian pow'r,</l>
					<l>And when her pray'r to stay he would not grant,</l>
					<l>So strong her love, she kept him by constraint.</l>
					<l>A Nereid took the Pythian to her arms.</l>
					<l>And <placeName key="tgn,2033144">Numa</placeName> knew divine <placeName

					<l><placeName key="tgn,2094117">Vulcan</placeName> though lame, and of a form

					<l>Was oft made happy by the Paphian queen;</l>
					<l>She matter'd not his limping, but approv'd</l>
					<l>His flame, and saw no faults in him she lov'd</l>
					<l>My verses are unequal like his feet,</l>
					<l>Yet the long kindly with the shorter meet.</l>
					<l>As they with them, why shouldst thou not with me</l>
					<l>Comply, my life and my divinity !</l>
					<l>Myself, when I am in thy arms, I'll own</l>
					<l>Thy subject, and the bed shall be thy throne;</l>
					<l>Thou there, my lovely queen, shall give me laws,</l>
					<l>Nor in my absence, to rejoice have cause,</l>
					<l>Nor ever shall my services be blam'd</l>
					<l>Nor shalt thou of thy servant be asham'd.</l>
					<l>My poetry's my purse, my fortun's there,</l>
					<l>I have no other way to win the fair;</l>
					<l>Nor is that way the worst; the brightest dames</l>
					<l>Would in my verse immortalize their names.</l>
					<l>My muse the place of an estate supplies,</l>
					<l>And none that know her worth, her wealth despise.</l>
					<l>Some tempted by <placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName>'s spreading
						fame,</l>
					<l>In envy rob her, and usurp her name;</l>
					<l>What would they give, d'ye think, to be the same ?</l>
					<l>But neither could Eurotas, nor the Po,</l>
					<l>With poplar shaded, in one channel flew;</l>
					<l>By diff'rent, and by distant banks they glide,</l>
					<l>Are rivers both, but various in their tide.</l>
					<l>There are more beauties, but there's none like thine,</l>
					<l>There are more versed, but thou hast only mine;</l>
					<l>No other charms can e'er inspire my muse,</l>

					<head>Elegy XVIII: To Macer, blaming him for not writing of love as he

					<l>While, Macer, you Achilles' choler sing,</l>
					<l>And <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> before the walls of
							<placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName> bring;</l>
					<l>While feats of arms in Phrygian fields you tell,</l>
					<l>And how old Tory by Grecion vengeance fell;</l>
					<l>I my soft hours in softer songs employ,</l>
					<l>And all my leisure give to love and joy.</l>
					<l>When to high acts, my voice I strive to raise,</l>
					<l>Love laughs at my attempt, and mocks my lays;</l>
					<l>"Begone!" I often to my mistress cry,</l>
					<l>But have not courage, yet, myself to fly.</l>
					<l>Whene'er she sees me in this sullen fit,</l>
					<l>She fondles me, and, on my knee will sit:</l>
					<l>"Enough of this (say I), for shame give o'er,</l>
					<l>Enough of love, we'll play the fool no more."</l>
					<l>" Ah, is it then a shame to love?" she cries,</l>
					<l>And chides, and melts me with her weeping eyes.</l>
					<l>Around my neck her snowy arms she throws,</l>
					<l>And to my lips with stifling kisses grows.</l>
					<l>How can I all this tenderness refuse ?</l>
					<l>At once my wisdom, and my will I lose;</l>
					<l>I'm conquer'd, and renounce the glorious train</l>
					<l>Of arms, and war, to sing of love again:</l>
					<l>My themes are acts, which I myself have done,</l>
					<l>And my muse sings no battles but my own.</l>
					<l>Once I confess I did the drama try,</l>
					<l>And ventur'd with success on tragedy;</l>
					<l>My genius with a moving scene agrees,</l>
					<l>And if I ventured further I might please:</l>
					<l>But love my heroics makes a jest,</l>
					<l>And laughs to see me in my buskins drest.</l>
					<l>Asham'd, and weary of this tragic whim,</l>
					<l>For tender thoughts I quitted the sublime.</l>
					<l>My mind my mistress bends another way,</l>
					<l>Her must my muse in all her songs obey;</l>
					<l>Though oft I do not what I write approve,</l>
					<l>Like, or not like it, I must sing of love.</l>
					<l>Whether for <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>'s illustrious
						dame,</l>
					<l>To great Ulysses I a letter frame,</l>
					<l>Or for Oenone tender things indite,</l>
					<l>Or soft complaints for injur'd Phillis write;</l>
					<l>Whether fair Canace's incestuous care</l>
					<l>I sooth, or flatter Dido's fierce despair;</l>
					<l>Whether I fan Medea's raging fire,</l>
					<l>Or for sweet Sappho touch the Lesbian lyre;</l>
					<l>Whether I Phaedra's lawless love relate,</l>
					<l>Or Theseus' flight and Ariadne's fate:</l>
					<l>Oh, that Sabinus, my departed friend,</l>
					<l>Could from all quarters now his answers send!</l>
					<l>Ulysses' hand should to his queen be known,</l>
					<l>And wretched Phaedra hear from Theseus' son;</l>
					<l>Dido Aeneas' answer should receive,</l>
					<l>And Phillis Demophoon's, if alive;</l>
					<l>Jason should to Hypsipyle return</l>
					<l>A sad reply, and Sappho cease to mourn:</l>
					<l>Nor him whom she can ne'er possess, desire,</l>
					<l>But give to Phoebus fane her votive lyre.</l>
					<l>As much as you in lofty epics deal,</l>
					<l>You, Macer, show that you love's passion feel,</l>
					<l>And sensible of beauty's powerful charm,</l>
					<l>You hear their call amid the noise of arms.</l>
					<l>A place for <placeName key="tgn,7008038">Paris</placeName> in your verse we
						find,</l>
					<l>And Helen's to the young adult'rer kind;</l>
					<l>There lovely Laodamia mourns her lord,</l>
					<l>The first that fell by <placeName key="tgn,2069653">Hector</placeName>'s
						fatal sword.</l>
					<l>If well I know you, and your mind can tell,</l>
					<l>The theme's as grateful, and you like as well</l>
					<l>To tune your lyre for Cupid as for <placeName key="tgn,2090583"

					<head>Elegy XIX: By Dryden.</head>
					<l>If for thyself thou wilt not watch thy whore,</l>

					<l>What comes with ease we nauseously receive,</l>
					<l>Who but a sot would scorn to love with leave?</l>
					<l>With hopes and fears my flames are blown up higher;</l>
					<l>Make me despair, and then I can desire.</l>
					<l>Give me a jilt to tease my jealous mind;</l>
					<l>Deceits are virtues in the female kind.</l>
					<l><placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName> my fantastic humour

					<l>Play'd trick for trick, and kept herself still new;</l>
					<l>She, that next night I might the sharper come,</l>
					<l>Fell out with me, and sent me fasting home.</l>
					<l>Or some pretence to lie alone would take ;</l>
					<l>Whene'er she pleas'd her head and teeth would ache:</l>
					<l>Till having won me to the highest strain,</l>
					<l>She took occasion to be sweet again.</l>
					<l>With what a gust, ye gods, we then embrac'd!</l>
					<l>How ev'ry kiss was dearer than the last!</l>
					<l>Thou whom I now adore, be edified,</l>
					<l>Take care that I may often be denied;</l>
					<l>Forget the promis'd hour, or feign some fright,</l>
					<l>Make me lie rough on bulks each other night.</l>
					<l>These are the arts that best secure thy reign,</l>
					<l>And this the food that must my fires maintain.</l>
					<l>Gross easy love does, like gross diet, pall;</l>
					<l>In squeasy stomachs honey turns to gall.</l>
					<l>Had Danae not been kept in brazen tow'rs,</l>

					<l>Pluck leaves from trees, and drink the common shore.</l>
					<l>The jilting harlot strikes the surest blow,</l>
					<l>A truth which I by sad experience know;</l>
					<l>The kind, poor, constant creature we despise,</l>
					<l>Man but pursues the quarry while it flies.</l>
					<l>But thou dull husband of a wife too fair,</l>
					<l>Stand on thy guard, and watch the precious ware;</l>
					<l>If creaking doors, or barking dogs, thou hear,</l>
					<l>Or windows scratch'd, suspect a rival there.</l>
					<l>An orange wench would tempt thy wife abroad;</l>
					<l>Kick her, for she's a letter-bearing bawd.</l>
					<l>In short, be jealous as the devil in hell,</l>
					<l>And set my wit on work to cheat thee well.</l>
					<l>The sneaking city-cuckold is my foe;</l>
					<l>I scorn to strike but when he wards the blow.</l>
					<l>Look to thy hits and leave off thy conniving,</l>
					<l>I'll be no drudge to any wittol living;</l>

					<l>In hope thou wouldst not pocket up thy wrong:</l>

					<head>Elegy I: The Poet deliberates with himself whether he should continue
						writing elegies, or attempt tragedy.</head>
					<l>Unhurt by steel, arose an ancient wood,</l>
					<l>A mansion fit for some retiring god;</l>
					<l>With craggy stones a secret grot was hung,</l>
					<l>And in the midst a sacred fountain sprung;</l>
					<l>The courting birds repeating songs of love,</l>
					<l>With soft complainings sweetly fill'd the grove:</l>
					<l>Here wand'ring thoughtful, and intent to choose</l>
					<l>Some theme unsung, to please the busy muse;</l>
					<l>Fair elegy came on with gentle pace,</l>
					<l>Unforc'd her air and easy was her grace.</l>
					<l>Her flaxen hair, in curious tresses wreath'd,</l>
					<l>Ambrosial sweets and heav'nly odours breath'd;</l>
					<l>A simple dress the careless charmer bore,</l>
					<l>And loving looks, and smiles unartful wore.</l>
					<l>Next came the goddess of the tragic scene,</l>
					<l>With stately tread, and proud majestic mien</l>
					<l>Her front severe, with hanging curls was drown'd,</l>
					<l>Her length of robe was full, and swept the ground:</l>
					<l>Her hand held out, a regal sceptre grac'd,</l>
					<l>And Lydian buskins half her legs embrac'd.</l>
					<l>She first; "Must love for ever tune thy voice,</l>
					<l>Fond idle bard, and trifling in thy choice</l>
					<l>Thy wanton songs employ the drunkard's tongue,</l>
					<l>In ev'ry street thy ribald lays are sung;</l>
					<l>The finger marks thee in thy passing by,</l>
					<l>'Behold, where goes the slave of love,' they cry.</l>
					<l>Thy lewd exploits, thou profligate, are grown</l>
					<l>The public theme, and talk of all the town;</l>
					<l>Whilst unconcern'd, and lost to sense of shame,</l>
					<l>Thou still runn'st on nor mind'st thy ruin'd fame.</l>
					<l>Enough thou'st told the plaints of fond desire,</l>
					<l>Now let a nobler inspiration fire;</l>
					<l>Thy matter cramps thy genius, learn to find</l>
					<l>A manly subject, and exert thy mind.</l>
					<l>In songs for girls, fond toys, and idle play,</l>
					<l>Thy muse has wanton'd all her hours away.</l>
					<l>But youth at length has fill'd its measure up;</l>
					<l>My friend, 'tis time to taste of t'other cup.</l>
					<l>Now in my service let thy force be shown,</l>
					<l>Assert my honour, and retrieve thy own;</l>
					<l>Thy sprightly fancy, and inventive wit,</l>
					<l>The lofty style of tragic scenes will fit."</l>
					<l>She said; and proudly rising in her gait,</l>
					<l>Thrice shook her tresses, and display'd her state.</l>
					<l>With open look (nor was my sight beguil'd)</l>
					<l>And joyous eyes her rival sweetly smil'd;</l>
					<l>Sustain'd her hand a myrtle branch upright?</l>
					<l>Or did my fancy form the charming sight?</l>
					<l>"Still so severe, 0, tragedy ! (she cried);</l>
					<l>And canst thou ne'er forego thy sullen pride?</l>
					<l>I not compare my lowly lays to thine;</l>
					<l>Too weak materials for the vast design.</l>
					<l>The style unlabour'd, negligent the dress,</l>
					<l>My verse is humbler, and my matter less.</l>
					<l>Gay, wanton, soft, my business is to move,</l>
					<l>With melting strains, the playful god of love.</l>
					<l>Bereft of me, fair <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName> wants her
						charms,</l>
					<l>I help the goddess, and prepare her arms.</l>
					<l>My luring art, and soothing lays prevail,</l>
					<l>Where lofty port, and tragic buskins fail.</l>
					<l>I more deserve, by making that my care,</l>
					<l>Thy rigid pride allows not thee to bear:</l>
					<l>By me, <placeName key="tgn,2044648">Corinna</placeName> first was taught to
						try</l>
					<l>Tobreak from prison, and deceive the spy;</l>
					<l>I first induc'd the fearful fair to slide</l>
					<l>With tremb'ling caution from her husband's side;</l>
					<l>When to thy arms, all loose, and disarray'd,</l>
					<l>Prepar'd for pleasure, flew the melting maid.</l>
					<l>Fix'd on her door, how oft I've hung on high,</l>
					<l>Expos'd, and patient of each gazing eye !</l>
					<l>How oft, in secret, while the keeper stay'd,</l>
					<l>Within her woman's panting bosom laid !</l>
					<l>Once sent a birthday gift, the cruel dame</l>
					<l>In pieces tore, and gave me to the flame.</l>
					<l>I taught thee first to cultivate thy mind;</l>
					<l>Thy fancy brightened, and thy wit refin'd;</l>
					<l>Thou to my care those merits must allow,</l>
					<l>For which my rival would seduce thee now;"</l>
					<l>They spoke. I answer'd, "Let me both conjure</l>
					<l>To spare a mind with terrors unsecure;</l>
					<l>Nor to my charge, when once pronounc'd, be laid</l>
					<l>As crimes, the words my trembling tongue has said.</l>
					<l>To gain me glory, thy decrees ordain</l>
					<l>The regal sceptre and the tragic strain;</l>
					<l>With painful labour need I toil for fame,</l>
					<l>When easier tasks already raise my name?</l>
					<l>Thou mak'st my love immortal; thee I choose:</l>
					<l>Be thou my queen, and still command my muse.</l>
					<l>Majestic pow'r, forgive my simple choice,</l>
					<l>Thy gentle rival has obtain'd my voice.</l>
					<l>Short is the time in which her palm is won;</l>
					<l>Ere thine is gain'd, the poet's life is done."</l>
					<l>I lowly said: she gracious gave assent,</l>
					<l>And diff'rent ways the parting rivals went.</l>
					<l>Ye gentle loves, complete the work assign'd,</l>
					<l>A greater labour seems to press behind. </l>

					<l>Jove to his votaries is most severe;</l>
					<l>Temples nor altars does his lightning spare.</l>

					<head>Elegy IV: To a man that locked up his wife. By Sir Charles Sedley</head>
					<l>Vex not thyself and her, vain man, since all</l>
					<l>By their own vice or virtue stand or fall.</l>
					<l>She's truly chaste, and worthy of that name,</l>
					<l>Who hates the ill, as well as fears the shame;</l>
					<l>And that vile woman whom restraint keeps in,</l>
					<l>Tho' she forbear the act, has done the sin.</l>
					<l>Spies, locks, and bolts may keep her brutal part,</l>
					<l>But thou'rt an odious cuckold in her heart.</l>
					<l>They that have freedom use it least, and so</l>
					<l>The power of ill does the design overthrow.</l>
					<l>Provoke not vice by a too harsh restraint;</l>
					<l>Sick men long most to drink, who know they mayn't.</l>
					<l>The fiery courser, whom no art can stay,</l>
					<l>Or rugged force, does oft fair means obey;</l>
					<l>And he that did the rudest arm disdain,</l>
					<l>Submits with quiet to the looser rein.</l>
					<l>A hundred eyes had <placeName key="tgn,2086061">Argus</placeName>, yet the
						while</l>
					<l>One silly maid did all those eyes beguile;</l>
					<l>Danae, tho' shut within a brazen tow'r,</l>
					<l>Felt the male virtue of the golden show'r;</l>
					<l>But chaste Penelope, left to her own will</l>
					<l>And free disposal, never thought of ill;</l>
					<l>She to her absent lord preserv'd her truth,</l>
					<l>For all th' addresses of the smoother youth,</l>
					<l>What's rarely seen, our fancy magnifies;</l>
					<l>Permitted pleasure who does not despise ?</l>
					<l>Thy care provokes beyond her face, and more</l>
					<l>Men strive to make tho cuckold than the whore.</l>
					<l>They're wondrous charms we think, and long to know</l>
					<l>That in a wife enchants a husband so:</l>
					<l>Rage, swear, and curse, no matter, she alone</l>
					<l>Pleases, who sighs, and cries, " I am undone."</l>
					<l>But could thy spies say, " We have kept her chaste,"</l>
					<l>Good servants then, but an ill wife thou hast;</l>
					<l>Who fears to be a cuckold is a clown,</l>
					<l>Not worthy to partake of this lewd town,</l>
					<l>Where it is monstrous to be fair and chaste,</l>
					<l>And not one inch of either sex lies waste.</l>
					<l>Wouldst thou be happy ? with her ways comply,</l>
					<l>And in her case lay points of honour by:</l>
					<l>The friendship she begins, wisely improve,</l>
					<l>And a fair wife gets one a world of love:</l>
					<l>So shalt thou welcome be to ev'ry treat,</l>
					<l>Live high, not pay, and never run in debt. </l>

					<head>Elegy V: The Dream. By Henry Cromwell.</head>
					<l>'Twas in the midst and silent dead of night,</l>
					<l>When heavy sleep oppos'd my weary sight,</l>
					<l>This vision did my troubled mind affright:-</l>
					<l>To Sol expos'd there stood a rising ground,</l>
					<l>Which cast beneath a spacious shade around;</l>
					<l>A gloomy grove of spreading oaks below,</l>
					<l>And various birds were perch'd on ev'ry bough;</l>
					<l>Just on the margin of a verdant mead,</l>
					<l>Where murm'ring brooks refreshing waters spread</l>
					<l>To shun the heat I sought this cool recess,</l>
					<l>But in this shade I felt my heat no less;</l>
					<l>When browzing o'er the flow'ry grass appear'd</l>
					<l>A lovely cow, the fairest of the herd.</l>
					<l>By spotless white distinguished from the rest,</l>
					<l>Whiter than milk from her own udder press'd;</l>
					<l>Whiter than falling, or the driven snow,</l>
					<l>Before descending mists can make it flow.</l>
					<l>She, with a lusty bull, her happy mate,</l>
					<l>Delighted, on the tender herbage sat;</l>
					<l>There, as he crops the flow'rs, and chews the cud,</l>
					<l>Feasting a second time upon his food,</l>
					<l>His limbs with sudden heaviness oppress'd,</l>
					<l>He bends his head, and sinks to pleasing rest.</l>
					<l>A noisy crow, cleaving the liquid air,</l>
					<l>Thrice with lewd bill pick'd off the heifer's hair;</l>
					<l>The glossy white imbib'd a spreading blot,</l>
					<l>But on her breast appear'd a livid spot.</l>
					<l>The cow rose slowly from her consort's side,</l>
					<l>But when afar the grazing bull she spied,</l>
					<l>Frisk'd to the herd, with an impetuous haste,</l>
					<l>And pleas'd, in new luxuriant soil, her taste.</l>
					<l>Oh, learn'd diviner!</l>
					<l>What may this visionary dream portend,</l>
					<l>If dreams in any future truth can end ?</l>
					<l>The prophet nicely weighs what I relate,</l>
					<l>And thus denounces in the voice of fate:-</l>
					<l>"That heat you tried to shun i' th' shady grove,</l>
					<l>But shunn'd in vain, was the fierce heat of love.</l>
					<l>The cow denotes the nymph, your only care,</l>
					<l>(For white's th' expressive image of the fair,)</l>
					<l>And you the bull, abandon'd to despair.</l>
					<l>The picking crow some busy bawd implies,</l>
					<l>Who with base arts will soon seduce your prim.</l>
					<l>You saw the cow to fresher pasture range,</l>
					<l>So will your nymph for richer lovers change;</l>
					<l>As mixing with the herd you saw her rove,</l>
					<l>So will the fair pursue promiscuous love;</l>
					<l>Soon will you find a foul incestuous blot,</l>
					<l>As on the cow you view'd the livid spot."</l>
					<l>At this my blood retired, with dismal fright,</l>
					<l>And left me pale as death ; my fainting sight</l>
					<l>Was quite o'ercast in dusky shades of night. </l>

					<head>Elegy VI: To a River, as he was going to his mistress. By Rhymer.</head>
					<l>Thy course, thy noble course a while forbear,</l>
					<l>I am in haste now going to my dear!</l>
					<l>Thy banks how rich, thy stream how worthy praise</l>
					<l>Alas, my haste ! sweet river, let me pass.</l>
					<l>No bridges here, no ferry, not an oar,</l>
					<l>Or rope to haul me to the farther shore !</l>
					<l>I have remember'd thee a little one,</l>
					<l>Who now with all this flood com'st blund'ring down.</l>
					<l>Did I refuse my sleep, my wine, my friend,</l>
					<l>To spur along, and must I here attend ?</l>
					<l>No art to help me to my journey's end!</l>
					<l>Ye Lapland powers, make me so far a witch,</l>
					<l>I may astride get over on a switch.</l>
					<l>Or, for some griffin, or that flying horse,</l>
					<l>Or any monster to assist my course;</l>
					<l>I wish his art that mounted to the moon,</l>
					<l>In shorter journey would my job be done.</l>
					<l>Why rave I for what crack-brain'd bards devise,</l>
					<l>Or name their lewd unconscionable lies ?</l>
					<l>Good river, let me find thy courtesy,</l>
					<l>Keep within bounds, and mayst thou ne'er be dry.</l>
					<l>Thou canst not think it such a mighty boast,</l>
					<l>A torrent has a gentle lover cross'd.</l>
					<l>Rivers should rather take the lover's side,</l>
					<l>Rivers themselves love's wondrous power have tried.</l>
					<l>'Twas on this score Inachus, pale and wan,</l>

					<l>Dog-flood, what art to me ? or why dost check</l>

					<l>What wouldst, if thee indeed some noble race,</l>

					<l>When of no ancient house or certain seat,</l>
					<l>(Nor, known before this time, untimely, great)</l>
					<l>Rais'd by some sudden thaw thus high and proud,</l>
					<l>No holding thee, ill-manner'd upstart flood ;</l>

					<l>Thou--zounds, thou art a -- river for a horse.</l>
					<l>Thou hadst no fountain, but from bears wert pist,</l>
					<l>From snows, and thaws, or Scotch unsav'ry mist.</l>
					<l>Thou crawl'st along, in winter foul and poor,</l>

					<head>Elegy VII: Ovid laments his imperfect enjoyments. By an unknown
						hand.</head>
					<l>Was she not heavenly fair, and rich attir'd ?</l>
					<l>Was she not that which all my soul desir'd ?</l>
					<l>Yet were these arms around her idly spread,</l>
					<l>And with an useless load I press'd the bed.</l>
					<l>E'en to my wishes was the power denied,</l>
					<l>When with my wishes the kind nymph complied</l>
					<l>I lay without life's animated spring,</l>
					<l>A dull, enervate, worthless, lumpish thing.</l>
					<l>My neck she folded with a soft embrace,</l>
					<l>Now kissed my eyes, now wanton'd o'er my face,</l>
					<l>Now lov'd to dart her humid tongue to mine,</l>
					<l>Now would her pliant limbs around me twine,</l>
					<l>And sooth, by thousand ways, the sweet design.</l>
					<l>The moving blandishments of sound she tried,</l>
					<l>And, " My dear life, my soul, my all," she cried.</l>
					<l>In vain, alas ! the nerves are slacken'd still,</l>
					<l>And I prov'd only potent in my will;</l>
					<l>A poor inactive sign of man I made,</l>
					<l>And might as well for use have been a shade.</l>
					<l>If old I live, how shall I old prevail,</l>
					<l>When in my youth I thus inglorious fail?</l>
					<l>The bloom of years becomes my shameful moan,</l>
					<l>Now in full growth the ripen'd man is shown,</l>
					<l>But not the strength of man to her was known.</l>
					<l>Untouched by brothers, sisters thus retire,</l>
					<l>Or vestals rise to watch th' eternal fire;</l>
					<l>Yet many a nymph whom I forbear to name,</l>
					<l>Rave kindly yielded, and indulg'd my flame</l>
					<l>Nor could the vigour of their 0vid blame.</l>
					<l>Corinna knows when numb'ring the delight,</l>
					<l>Not less than nine full transports crown'd the night.</l>
					<l>Is verse or herbs the source of present harms ?</l>
					<l>Am I a captive to Thessalian charms ?</l>
					<l>Has some enchantress this confusion brought,</l>
					<l>And in soft wax my tortur'd image wrought</l>
					<l>Deep in the liver is the needle fix'd ?</l>
					<l>Plagues she by numbers, or by juices mix'd?</l>
					<l>By numbers sudden the ripe harvest die,</l>
					<l>And fruitful urns no more their streams supply;</l>
					<l>Oaks shed, unshook, their acorns at the call,</l>
					<l>And the vine wonders why her clusters fall.</l>
					<l>Why may not magic act on me the same,</l>
					<l>Unstring the nerves, and quite untune the frame!</l>
					<l>Gall'd at the heart, and longing to perform,</l>
					<l>I rais'd indeed, but rais'd an empty storm;</l>
					<l>Most disappointed when the most propense,</l>
					<l>And shame was second cause of impotence.</l>
					<l>What limbs I touch'd ! and only touch'd ! oh, fie!</l>
					<l>Where was the blissful touch ? her shift can vie</l>
					<l>In feasts like these, and touch as well as I.</l>
					<l>Yet to touch her e'en Nestor might grow young,</l>
					<l>And centuries, like twenty-one, be strung.</l>
					<l>Such was the maid; the parallel had ran</l>
					<l>Graceful, if I could add, such was the man.</l>
					<l>Some envious deity with vengeance glow'd,</l>
					<l>So sweet a gift had been so ill bestow'd.</l>
					<l>I burn to clasp her naked in my arms,</l>
					<l>Did she not freely open all her charms ?</l>
					<l>What boots good fortune, if we want the pow'r</l>
					<l>To snatch the pleasures of the favour'd hour?</l>
					<l>I, like a miser, only could behold,</l>
					<l>And brooded o'er an useless mine of gold;</l>
					<l>So Tantalus with fruit untouch'd is curst,</l>
					<l>And dies amid the gliding stream of thirst;</l>
					<l>So rises early from th' untasted fair,</l>
					<l>The grave old prelate, and kneels down to pray'r,</l>
					<l>Were yet her melting kisses misenploy'd?</l>
					<l>Did she strive vainly to be well enjoy'd ?</l>
					<l>Sure she has beauties might deaf rocks enchant,</l>
					<l>Bend the proud oak, and soften adamant;</l>
					<l>She would have mov'd a man tho' almost dead,</l>
					<l>But with my manhood the whole life was fled.</l>
					<l>If none should lend an ear, why is the song,</l>
					<l>Or painted nymphs shown to a blinded throng !</l>
					<l>Ye gods ! what joys did not my fancy raise !</l>
					<l>I curl'd in folds of love a thousand ways.</l>
					<l>Strong were my thoughts, but ah ! my body lay</l>
					<l>Languid as roses pluck'd off yesterday.</l>
					<l>Now all the blood the circling spirits fire,</l>
					<l>And the lost field impertinent require;</l>
					<l>Begone untimely nerves! I trust no more,</l>
					<l>Such was the promise of your strength before.</l>
					<l>Could you the fair one balk of her delight,</l>
					<l>Disgrace your master by so base a fright,</l>
					<l>And want the courage for so sweet a fight?</l>
					<l>Did she not kindly too your stay demand,</l>
					<l>And tempt it softly with a soothing hand ?</l>
					<l>But when solicitings no life could gain,</l>
					<l>And inspirations, tho' from her, were vain;</l>
					<l>"Who bade thee thus thyself to me to bring !</l>
					<l>Go for a silly unperforming thing:</l>
					<l>Art thou a wretch by some curs'd spell destroy'd,</l>
					<l>Or here com'st fribbling with past pleasure cloy'd?"</l>
					<l>She spoke, and springing from the bed she flew,</l>
					<l>And secret beauties so disclos'd to view;</l>
					<l>Yet to conceal the joyless night's digrace,</l>
					<l>She called for water with a smiling face,</l>
					<l>And wash'd a nameless unpolluted place. </l>

					<l>Wealth now is worth, whatever 'twas of old,</l>
					<l>And merit valu'd by its weight in gold.</l>
					<l>With male and female, this is now the rule,</l>
					<l>And he that's poor, of course must be a fool.</l>
					<l>The dame to read my am'rous verse delights,</l>
					<l>My writings likes, but scorns the man that writes;</l>
					<l>They freely on her privacy presume,</l>
					<l>And find admittance where I must not come;</l>
					<l>Me when she does her haunted house exclude,</l>
					<l>To them she's civil, as to me she's rude.</l>
					<l>Me she exposes to a thousand harms,</l>
					<l>To walk the streets, while they are in her arms.</l>
					<l>For whom does she my passion disregard ?</l>
					<l>And who has intercepted my reward ?</l>
					<l>Why is the beau with so much joy embrac'd ?</l>
					<l>His pockets full, it seems, his coat is lac'd:</l>
					<l>He won her with his military air</l>
					<l>Which cheats as often as it charms the fair.</l>
					<l>Could she her longing eyes forbear to fix</l>
					<l>On his fine feather, and his coach and six!</l>
					<l>Enrich'd by plunder, he could never miss</l>
					<l>The favour, who would buy the venal bliss.</l>
					<l>No matter how he got his wealth, by war,</l>
					<l>And blood: she cares not, if she has her share.</l>
					<l>The upstart forward was, 'tis said, in fight,</l>
					<l>And in the field of battle made a knight:</l>
					<l>But had his honour come without his gold,</l>
					<l>His, sure, had been like my reception, cold.</l>
					<l>To men of merit how could she be coy,</l>
					<l>Yet to a murd'rer prostitute the joy?</l>
					<l>That head which lolls upon your panting breast,</l>
					<l>Was lately cover'd with a plumy crest.</l>
					<l>Can you the bully to your bed admit ?</l>
					<l>Are his hard limbs for ladies' dalliance fit ?</l>
					<l>His hands in your embrace you'll find embru'd</l>
					<l>With clotted, and perhaps with guiltless blood;</l>
					<l>How awkward must it be for you to feel,</l>
					<l>Near yours, his thigh that late was cas'd with steel</l>
					<l>That ring, the token of his pride and state,</l>
					<l>Was with a heavy gauntlet hid of late:</l>
					<l>Canst thou have commerce with a thing so foul!</l>
					<l>Where's now the boasted niceness of thy soul?</l>
					<l>What pleasure canst thou in his roughness find?</l>
					<l>Thou that wert once the softest of thy kind!</l>
					<l>Behold what marks of brutal rage he bears,</l>
					<l>And how he's mangled with dishonest scars.</l>
					<l>Yet to these scars, dishonest as they are,</l>
					<l>His wealth he owes, his fortunes with the fair.</l>
					<l>No doubt, he makes a merit of his guilt,</l>
					<l>And brags what blood he has in battle spilt.</l>
					<l>Fine courtship this, to win a gentle dame;</l>
					<l>Thou shar'st his money, and must share his shame.</l>
					<l>Me, not the meanest of Apollo's train,</l>
					<l>She hates, and I repeat my verse in vain;</l>
					<l>I sing before her gate; her gate I find</l>
					<l>Is less obdurate than her harden'd mind.</l>
					<l>Forbear your songs, Apollo's sons, forbear,</l>
					<l>And bend your future thoughts to arms and war.</l>
					<l>Instead of inspirations, get commands;</l>
					<l>To murder, and to rapine use your hands,</l>
					<l>And you with ease reduce the female bands.</l>

					<l>A thousand bars the virgin fair did hold,</l>
					<l>But what are iron bars to bribes of gold?</l>
					<l>Against this foe her father could not guard;</l>
					<l>Watchmen, and women kept a fruitless ward.</l>
					<l>The damsel, who herself before was coy,</l>
					<l>Melts at the sight, and meets the dazzling joy.</l>
					<l>When peaceful Saturn did heav'n's sceptre sway,</l>

					<l>Fed with the fruits which bounteous nature yields,</l>
					<l>In painted gardens, and in golden fields,</l>
					<l>From her rich soil are reap'd spontaneous crops,</l>
					<l>And from the forest oak sweet honey drops.</l>
					<l>No hinds as yet did toil their time away,</l>
					<l>Nor with keen clusters wound the parent clay:</l>
					<l>As yet no landmark was by lab'rers set,</l>
					<l>And none had learned to plough the sea as yet</l>
					<l>None as yet knew the use of sails and oars,</l>

					<l>How subtle's human nature to contrive</l>
					<l>Its proper ruin, and itself deceive!</l>
					<l>Why didst thou cities with high walls surround,</l>
					<l>Why arms invent thy jarring sons to wound ?</l>
					<l>What quarrel hast thou with the sea, and why</l>
					<l>Didst thou at first the pathless ocean try ?</l>
					<l>Cannot the land content thy restless pride ?</l>
					<l>Didst thou with Saturn's sons the whole divide,</l>

					<l>The wealth we thus acquire's the soldier's prey,</l>

					<head>Elegy IX: Upon the Death of Tibullus. By <placeName key="tgn,2693739"
							>Stepney</placeName>.</head>
					<l>If Memnon's fate bewail'd with constant dew,</l>
					<l>Does, with the day, his mother's grief renew,</l>
					<l>If her son's death mov'd tender Thetis' mind</l>
					<l>To swell with tears the waves, with sighs the wind;</l>
					<l>Sad Cupid now despairs of conqu'ring hearts,</l>
					<l>Throws by his empty quiver, breaks his darts:</l>
					<l>Eases his useless bows from idle strings;</l>
					<l>Nor flies, but humbly creeps with flagging wings.</l>
					<l>He wants, of which he robb'd fond lovers, rest;</l>
					<l>And wounds with furious hands his pensive breast.</l>
					<l>Those graceful curls which wantonly did flow,</l>
					<l>The whiter rivals of the falling snow,</l>
					<l>Forget their beauty, and in discord lie,</l>
					<l>Drunk with the fountain from his melting eye.</l>
					<l>Nor Phoebus, nor the muses' queen, could give</l>
					<l>Their son, their own prerogative, to live.</l>
					<l>Orpheus, the heir of both his parents' skill,</l>
					<l>Tam'd wond'ring beasts, not death's more cruel will.</l>
					<l>Linus' sad strings on the dumb lute do lie. </l>
					<l>In silence forc'd to let their master die.</l>
					<l>His mother weeping does his eyelids close,</l>
					<l>And on his urn, tears, her last gift, bestows.</l>
					<l>His sister too, with hair dishevell'd, bears</l>
					<l>Part of her mother's nature, and her tears.</l>
					<l>With those, two fair, two mournful rivals come,</l>
					<l>And add a greater triumph to his tomb:</l>
					<l>Both hug his urn, both his lov'd ashes kiss,</l>
					<l>And both contend which reap'd the greater bliss.</l>
					<l>Thus <placeName key="tgn,1013136">Delia</placeName> spoke (when sighs no more
						could last)</l>
					<l>Renewing by remembrance pleasures past;</l>
					<l>"When youth with vigour did for joy combine,</l>
					<l>I was Tibullus' life, Tibullus mine;</l>
					<l>1 entertained his hot, his first desire,</l>
					<l>And kept alive, till age, his active fire."</l>
					<l>To her then Nemesis (when groans gave leave)</l>
					<l>"As I alone was lov'd, alone I'll grieve;</l>
					<l>Spare your vain tears, Tibullus' heart was mine,</l>
					<l>About my neck his dying arms did twine:</l>
					<l>I snatch'd his soul, which true to me did prove;</l>
					<l>Age ended yours, death only stopp'd my love."</l>
					<l>If any poor remains survive the flames,</l>
					<l>Except thin shadows, and more empty names;</l>
					<l>Free in Elysium shall Tibullus rove,</l>
					<l>Nor fear a second death should cross his love.</l>
					<l>There shall Catullus, crown'd with bays, impart</l>
					<l>To his far dearer friend his open heart.</l>
					<l>There Gallus (if fame's hundred tongues all lie)</l>
					<l>Shall, free from censure, no more rashly die.</l>
					<l>Such shall our poet's bless'd companions be,</l>
					<l>And in their deaths, as in their lives, agree.</l>
					<l>But thou, rich urn, obey my strict commands,</l>
					<l>Guard thy great charge from sacrilegious hands.</l>
					<l>Thou, earth, Tibullus' ashes gently use,</l>
					<l>And be as soft and easy as his muse. </l>

					<l>Man's chief delight, and why disturb his joy ?</l>
					<l>The world esteems you bountiful and good,</l>
					<l>You led us from the field and from the wood,</l>

					<l>Her love, 'tis too well known to be denied:</l>
					<l>She saw young Jasius in the Cretan grove</l>

					<l>She then perceived when first she felt the fire,</l>

					<l>Harrow'd his fields, and broke his clods, and sow'd,</l>
					<l>No corn appear'd, none to reward his pain,</l>

					<l>Well then, since then 'twas hard for you to lie</l>

					<head>Elegy XI: To his Mistress, that he cannot help loving her.</head>
					<l>So much I've suffer'd, and so long, no more</l>
					<l>I'll bear the wrongs which I have borne before.</l>
					<l>Begone, vile Cupid, I'll no more endure</l>
					<l>Thy slavish labors, and fatigues impure;</l>
					<l>From hence, I'll put an end to all the pains</l>
					<l>Thou'st cost me, and from hence shake off thy chains.</l>
					<l>I hate the liv'ry I with pleasure wore,</l>
					<l>And blush at bonds, which once with pride I bore:</l>
					<l>But this, methinks, should have been done before.</l>
					<l>To leave my wicked courses I begin,</l>
					<l>As years deprive me of the gust of sin.</l>
					<l>On Cupid's neck I should have trod when young,</l>
					<l>And vanquish'd him when my desires were strong.</l>
					<l>In that there had been virtue; now there's none,</l>
					<l>The world will say so; let the world say on.</l>
					<l>Much opposition I shall meet; perhaps,</l>
					<l>The lewd will laugh, and threaten a relapse.</l>
					<l>To bear reproaches I must be prepar'd,</l>
					<l>Easy's the end, when the beginning's hard;</l>
					<l>Content let me the present pain endure,</l>
					<l>For the sharp medicine is the patient's cure.</l>
					<l>How oft you have expos'd me to the cold,</l>
					<l>While in your arms you did my rival hold!</l>
					<l>How like a slave have I been forc'd to wait</l>
					<l>All weathers, and how oft have watched the gate!</l>
					<l>As if your house was trusted to my care</l>
					<l>And I, your sentinel, did duty there.</l>
					<l>Oft have I seen your sated lover come</l>
					<l>With looks, as if he long'd to be at home.</l>
					<l>But what most grated on my jealous mind,</l>
					<l>Was that he there the waiting fool should find.</l>
					<l>That aggravated most the cruel curse;</l>
					<l>I would not wish my greatest foe a worse.</l>
					<l>How oft have I attended you abroad,</l>
					<l>Or in the city, cirque, or on the road ?</l>
					<l>They took me for your husband by my care,</l>
					<l>Or that your guardian or your slave I were.</l>
					<l>I by the people's glances, and your own,</l>
					<l>Observ'd you were acquainted with the town;</l>
					<l>That of your love if I possess'd a part,</l>
					<l>'Twas plain I shared with many more your heart.</l>
					<l>What need I of your perjuries bring proof,</l>
					<l>Suppose the common talk was not enough!</l>
					<l>What do your ogles and your gestures mean,</l>
					<l>Your carriage at th' assembly and the scene ?</l>
					<l>There's scarce a fop you meet with in your way,</l>
					<l>To whom you have not something soft to say;</l>
					<l>Some token which you either understand</l>
					<l>By mystic words or motion of the hand.</l>
					<l>They tell me you are sick; I run to see,</l>
					<l>And find, as ill as you pretend to be,</l>
					<l>It is not for my rival, but for me.</l>
					<l>I seldom told you of your faults, but strove</l>
					<l>To cover all your failings with my love;</l>
					<l>Of this I might remind you, and much more,</l>
					<l>But what avails it now; th' affair is o'er:</l>
					<l>A fond you found me, and a patient man,</l>
					<l>And get you such another if you can.</l>
					<l>I fear not now your frowns; my bark defies</l>
					<l>The storm of words, and tempest of your eyes;</l>
					<l>No coaxing now, your hardest phrases use,</l>
					<l>Your looks, your language, all their terrors lose;</l>
					<l>I am not such a fool as I have been,</l>
					<l>To dread your spirit, and to sooth your spleen.</l>
					<l>But, ah! by diff'rent passions I'm oppress'd,</l>
					<l>Fierce love and hate contend within my breast;</l>
					<l>My soul they thus divide, but love, I fear,</l>
					<l>Will prove too strong, and get the mast'ry there;</l>
					<l>I'll strive to hate her, but if that should prove</l>
					<l>A fruitless strife, in spite of me I'll love.</l>
					<l>The bull does not affect the yoke, but still</l>
					<l>He bears the thing he hates against his will</l>
					<l>I hate, I fly the faithless fair in vain,</l>
					<l>Her beauty ever brings me back again;</l>
					<l>She always in my heart will have a place,</l>
					<l>I hate her humour, but I love her face;</l>
					<l>No rest I to my tortur'd soul can give,</l>
					<l>Nor with her nor without her can I live.</l>
					<l>Oh ! that thy mind we in thy face did view,</l>
					<l>Less lovely that thou wert, or else more true.</l>
					<l>How diffrent are thy manners and thy sight!</l>
					<l>Thy deeds forbid us and thy eyes invite.</l>
					<l>Thy actions shock us, and thy beauty moves,</l>
					<l>And he who hates thy faults, thy person loves.</l>
					<l>Happy, ah ! ever happy should I be,</l>
					<l>If I no charms or no defects could see.</l>
					<l>Thee I conjure by all our past delights,</l>
					<l>Our cheerful days and our transporting nights,</l>
					<l>By all the imprecated gods above,</l>
					<l>To whom thou art forsworn, but most by Love,</l>
					<l>By thy fair face, which I as much adore</l>
					<l>As all those gods, and own as much its pow'r,</l>
					<l>Forgive me this offence, and I'll offend no more.</l>
					<l>Be what thou wilt, thy humour good or ill,</l>
					<l>I'll love thee, thou shalt be my mistress still</l>
					<l>Ah, let my passion ever favour find,</l>
					<l>Or be it with, or be't against my mind,</l>
					<l>But rather let me sail before the wind.</l>
					<l>Ah, let thy wishes with my will agree,</l>
					<l>Since surely I thy slave must ever be;</l>
					<l>In thee since I have centred all my joys,</l>
					<l>Oh Venus ! let my love be still my choice. </l>

					<l>Serpents for hair, in ancient song we meet,</l>
					<l>And man and horse with wings instead of feet.</l>
					<l>Huge Tityon from the skies the poets flung,</l>

					<l>How Eolus did for <placeName key="tgn,2093866">Ulysses</placeName> keep</l>
					<l>The winds in bottles while he plough'd the deep:</l>

					<l>And from his car the son of Phoebus fell:</l>
					<l>How thirsty Tantalus attempts to sip</l>
					<l>The stream in vain, that flies his greedy lip:</l>
					<l>How Niobe in marble drops a tear,</l>
					<l>And a bright nymph was turn'd into a bear:</l>
					<l>How Progne, now a swallow, does bemoan</l>
					<l>Her sister nightingale, and pheasant son.</l>
					<l>In Leda, Danae, and Europa's rapes,</l>

					<l>My wife, a native of Phaliscan plains,</l>
					<l>Where the rich soils enrich the lab'ring swains,</l>
					<l>Where purple grapes and golden apples grow,</l>
					<l>A conquest we to great <placeName key="tgn,2068320">Camillus</placeName>
						owe.</l>
					<l>When once to <placeName key="tgn,2075297">Juno</placeName>'s feast she
						thither went,</l>
					<l>My mind to know the secret rites was bent:</l>
					<l>The pious priests the solemn sports prepare,</l>
					<l>And purify the fane with holy care.</l>
					<l>A heifer of the place they sacrifice,</l>
					<l>But ne'er to men expose their mysteries,</l>
					<l>I mark'd the hidden way my consort went,</l>
					<l>And follow'd down the deep and dark descent.</l>
					<l>To an old wood at last I came, whose shade</l>
					<l>Impress'd a horror on the gloom it made,</l>
					<l>And ev'ry step with trembling feet I trod,</l>
					<l>Profan'd, I thought, the dwelling of a god.</l>
					<l>An altar there was rais'd by hands divine,</l>
					<l>And fragrant incense flam'd around the shrine.</l>
					<l>Chaste matrons there their vow'd oblations pay,</l>
					<l>And celebrate with joyful hymns the day.</l>
					<l>Soon as the fife the signal gives, they move</l>
					<l>In long procession through the sacred grove</l>
					<l>Branches and flow'rs are with devotion spread</l>
					<l>O'er all the way, and priestly vestments laid.</l>
					<l>Next after these, through loud acclaims, they lead</l>
					<l>A cow milk white, and of Phaliscan breed;</l>
					<l>Then a young steer, whose forehead ne'er had borne</l>
					<l>The crooked honours of the butting horn.</l>
					<l>The least of all the victims was a swine,</l>
					<l>And then a ram whose horns around his temples twine.</l>
					<l>A goat, whom most the goddess hates, comes last;</l>
					<l>The present feels her vengeance for the past.</l>
					<l>When in a wood to hide herself she tried,</l>
					<l>She by the bleating of a goat was spied;</l>
					<l>For this the beast is by the boys pursu'd;</l>
					<l>For this she's ever greedy of its blood,</l>
					<l>And he, who first the letcher wounds in play,</l>
					<l>Claims by her law, and hears the prize away.</l>
					<l>The tender youth, and tim'rous virgin strow</l>
					<l>With robes the ground the goddess is to go.</l>
					<l>The virgins' locks with golden fillets bound,</l>
					<l>And sparkling diamonds glitt'ring all around;</l>
					<l>Buskins embroider'd on their feet they wear,</l>
					<l>And spreading trains with pride uneasy bear.</l>
					<l>Here, as in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> the custom was of
						old,</l>
					<l>The image of the goddess we behold</l>
					<l>Borne on the heads of maidens, and behind</l>
					<l>The priestesses in beauteous rank you find.</l>
					<l>An awful silence reigns : the goddess last</l>
					<l>Approaches, and with her the pomp is past.</l>
					<l>The dress was Greek, and such Halesus wore,</l>
					<l>When in a fright he fled the Grecian shore;</l>
					<l>His father kill'd, an <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> ship he
						fraught,</l>
					<l>And to this coast the royal treasure brought.</l>
					<l>Much peril had he past, much labour known,</l>
					<l>O'er lands and seas, before he reach'd our own,</l>
					<l>And landing built, with happy hand, the town,</l>
					<l>Where first he did this festival revive,</l>
					<l>And its Greek rules to the Phaliscans give;</l>
					<l>The rites and sacrifices first he show'd,</l>

					<l>And 'twere unwise to trust the tell-tale light,</l>
					<l>With the dark secrets of the silent night.</l>
					<l>Tho' bought to be enjoy'd, a common whore</l>
					<l>Ere she begins will shut the chamber door:</l>
					<l>And will you turn debauch'd, then vainly own</l>
					<l>How lewd you are, to this malicious town?</l>
					<l>At least seem virtuous, and tho' false you be,</l>
					<l>Say you are honest, and I'll credit thee.</l>
					<l>Conceal your actions, and while I am by,</l>
					<l>Let modest words your looser thoughts belie;</l>
					<l>When to your private chamber you retire,</l>
					<l>Unmask your lust, and vent each warm desire;</l>
					<l>Throw off affected coyness, and remove</l>
					<l>The bold intruder between thee and love:</l>
					<l>Talk not of honour, lay that toy aside,</l>
					<l>In men 'tis folly, and in women pride;</l>
					<l>There without blushes you may naked lie,</l>
					<l>Clasping his body with your tender thigh;</l>
					<l>Shoot your moist dart into his mouth, to show</l>
					<l>The sense you have of what he acts below;</l>
					<l>Try all the ways, your pliant bodies twine,</l>
					<l>In folds more strange than those of Aretine:</l>
					<l>With melting looks fierce joys you may excite,</l>
					<l>And with thick dying accents urge delight.</l>
					<l>But when you're dress'd, then look as innocent</l>
					<l>As if you knew not what such matters meant;</l>
					<l>Cozen the prying town, and put a cheat</l>
					<l>On it and me, I'll favour the deceit.</l>
					<l>False as thou art, why must I daily see</l>
					<l>Th' intriguing billet-doux he sends to thee ?</l>
					<l>The wanton sonnet, or soft elegy ?</l>
					<l>Why does your bed all tumbled seem to say,</l>
					<l>See what they've done, see where the lovers lay!</l>
					<l>Why do your locks and rumpled head-clothes show</l>
					<l>'Tis more than usual sleep that made 'em so?</l>
					<l>Why are the kisses which he gave, betray'd</l>
					<l>By the impression which his teeth had made ?</l>
					<l>Yet say you're chaste, and I'll be still deceived;</l>
					<l>What much is wish'd for, is with ease believ'd.</l>
					<l>But when you own what a lewd wretch thou art,</l>
					<l>My blood grows cold and freezes at my heart,</l>
					<l>Then do I curse thee, and thy crimes reprove,</l>
					<l>But curse in vain, for still I find I love;</l>
					<l>"Since she is false," oft to myself I cry,</l>
					<l>"Would I were dead,"-yet 'tis with thee I'd die</l>
					<l>I will not see your maid, to let me know</l>
					<l>Who visits you, where, and with whom you go;</l>
					<l>Nor by your lodging send my boy to scout,</l>
					<l>And bring me word who passes in and out.</l>
					<l>Enjoy the pleasure of the present times,</l>
					<l>But let not me be knowing of your crimes.</l>
					<l>Do you forswear't, tho' in the act you're caught,</l>
					<l>I'll trust the oath, and think my eyes in fault. </l>

					<l>To mount my muse on some more generous horse,</l>
					<l>And try her courage in some daring course.</l>
					<l>Adieu, my sighing elegies, adieu!</l>
					<l>I'll be no more concern'd with love or you;</l>
