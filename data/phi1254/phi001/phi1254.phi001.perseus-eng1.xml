				in order that like recreation might be provided for my children, when they should have some respite from business affairs and could unbend and divert their minds. But in the arrangement of my material I have adopted the same haphazard order that I had previously followed in collecting it. For whenever I had taken in hand any Greek or Latin book, or had heard anything worth remembering, I used to jot down whatever took my fancy, of any and every kind, without any definite plan or order; and such notes I would lay away as an aid to my memory, like a kind of literary storehouse, so that when the need arose of a word or a subject which I chanced for the moment to have forgotten, and the books from which I had taken it were not at hand, I could readily find and produce it.</p>
			
			<p>It therefore follows, that in these notes there is the same variety of subject that there was in those former brief jottings which I had made without order or arrangement, as the fruit of instruction or reading in various lines. And since, as I have said, I began to amuse myself by assembling these notes during the long winter nights which I spent on a country-place in the land of Attica, I have therefore given them the title of <hi rend="italic">Attic Nights,</hi> making no <pb n="v1.p.xxix"/> attempt to imitate the witty captions which many other writers of both languages have devised for works of the kind. For since they had laboriously gathered varied, manifold, and as it were indiscriminate learning, they therefore invented ingenious titles also, to correspond with that idea. Thus some called their books <quote>The Muses,</quote> others <quote>Woods</quote>
				
				<note><hi rend="italic">Silva,</hi> and its Greek equivalent <hi rend="italic">Hyle</hi> (Suet. <hi rend="italic">Gramm.</hi> x), was used metaphorically of material in a rough form, and of hasty and more or less extempore productions; see Quint. x. 3. 17.</note>
				one used the title <quote>Athena's Mantle,</quote> another <quote>The Horn of Amaltheia,</quote> still another <quote>Honeycomb,</quote> several <quote>Meads,</quote> one <quote>Fruits of my Reading,</quote> another <quote>Gleanings from Early Writers,</quote> another <quote>The Nosegay,</quote> still another <quote>Discoveries.</quote> Some have used the name <quote>Torches,</quote> others <quote>Tapestry,</quote> others <quote>Repertory,</quote> others <quote>Helicon,</quote> <quote>Problems,</quote> <quote>Handbooks</quote> and <quote>Daggers.</quote> One man called his book <quote>Memorabilia,</quote> one <quote>Principia,</quote> one <quote>Incidentals,</quote> another <quote>Instructions.</quote> Other titles are <quote>Natural History,</quote> <quote>Universal History,</quote> <quote>The Field,</quote> <quote>The Fruit-basket,</quote> or <quote>Topics.</quote> Many have termed their notes <quote>Miscellanies,</quote> some <quote>Moral Epistles,</quote> <quote>Questions in Epistolary Form,</quote> or <quote>Miscellaneous Queries,</quote> and there are some other titles that are exceedingly witty and redolent of extreme refinement.
				
				<note>Of the thirty titles cited by Gellius about one-half can be assigned to their authors, many of whom Gellius himself mentions in various parts of his work; see the Index. There are others which he undoubtedly used, but does not cite, such as the <quote><foreign xml:lang="grc">Pantodaph\ Istori/a</foreign></quote> of Favorinus. <quote>The Muses</quote> refers not to Herodotus, the books of whose <quote>History</quote> the grammarians named from the Muses, but to Aurelius Opilius, cited by Gellius in i. 25. 17. The <quote>Silvae</quote> belong either to Valerius Probus (Suet. <hi rend="italic">Gramm.</hi> 24) or to Ateius Philologus (id. 10); the <quote>Silvae</quote> of Statius are of a different character. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Deimw/n</foreign> was used by Pamphilus, by Gellius himself, and by Cicero of a work of a different kind; the Latin equivalent <quote>Pratum</quote> was used by Suetonius For further information see the Index.</note>
				But I, bearing in mind my limitations, gave my work off-hand, without premeditation, and indeed almost in rustic fashion, the caption of <hi rend="italic">Attic Nights,</hi> derived merely from the time and place of  <pb n="v1.p.xxxi"/>  my winter's vigils; I thus fall as far short of all other writers in the dignity too even of my title, as I do in care and in elegance of style.</p>
			
			<p>Neither had I in making my excerpts and notes the same purpose as many of those whom I have mentioned. For all of them, and in particular the Greeks, after wide and varied reading, with a white line, as the saying goes,

				that is with no effort to discriminate, swept together whatever they had found, aiming at mere quantity. The perusal of such collections will exhaust the mind through weariness or disgust, before it finds one or two notes which it is a pleasure to read, or inspiring to have read, or helpful to remember. I myself, on the contrary, having at heart that well-known saying of the famous Ephesian,

				<quote>Much learning does not make a scholar,</quote> did it is true busy and even weary myself in unrolling and running through many a scroll, working without cessation in all the intervals of business whenever I could steal the leisure; but I took few items from them, confining myself to those which, by furnishing a quick and easy short-cut, might lead active and alert minds to a desire for independent learning and to the study of the useful arts, or would save those who are already fully occupied with the other duties of life from an ignorance of words and things which is assuredly shameful and boorish.</p>
			
			<p>Now just because there will be found in these notes some few topics that are knotty and troublesome, either from Grammar or Dialectics or even from Geometry, and because there will also be some  <pb n="v1.p.xxxiii"/>  little material of a somewhat recondite character about augural or pontifical law, one ought not therefore to avoid such topics as useless to know or difficult to comprehend. For I have not made an excessively deep and obscure investigation of the intricacies of these questions, but I have presented the first fruits, so to say, and a kind of foretaste of the liberal arts; and never to have heard of these, or come in contact with them, is at least unbecoming, if not positively harmful, for a man with even an ordinary education. Of those then, if such there be, who may perhaps sometimes have leisure and inclination to acquaint themselves with these lucubrations, I should like to ask and be granted the favour, that in reading of matters which they have known for a long time they shall not scorn them as commonplace and trite; for is there anything in literature so recondite as not to be known to a goodish many? In fact, I am sufficiently flattered if these subjects have not been repeated over and over again in the schools and become the common stock of commentaries. Furthermore, if my readers find anything new and unknown to them, I think it fair that they should not indulge in useless criticism, but should ask themselves whether these observations, slight and trifling though they be, are after all not without power to inspire study, or too dull to divert and stimulate the mind; whether on the contrary they do not contain the germs and the quality to make men's minds grow more vigorous, their memory more trustworthy, their eloquence more effective, their diction purer, or the pleasures of their hours of leisure and recreation more refined. But as to matters which seem too obscure, or not  <pb n="v1.p.xxxv"/>  presented in full enough detail, I beg once again that my readers may consider them written, not so much to instruct, as to give a hint, and that content with my, so to speak, pointing out of the path, they may afterwards follow up those subjects, if they so desire, with the aid either of books or of teachers. But if they find food for criticism, let them, if they have the courage, blame those from whom I drew my material; or if they discover that different statements are made by someone else, let them not at once give way to hasty censure, but rather let them weigh the reasons for the statements and the value of the authorities which those other writers and which I have followed.</p>
			
			<p>For those, however, who have never found pleasure nor busied themselves in reading, inquiring, writing and taking notes, who have never spent wakeful nights in such employments, who have never improved themselves by discussion and debate with rival followers of the same Muse, but are absorbed in the turmoil of business affairs—for such men it will be by far the best plan to hold wholly aloof from these <quote>Nights</quote> and seek for themselves other diversion. There is an old saying:  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>The daw knows naught of the lyre, the hog naught of marjoram ointment.</l>

<p>Plutarch's account of the method of comparison and the calculations which the philosopher Pythagoras used in determining the great height of Hercules, while the hero was living among men.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/> In the treatise

<note>This work, probably entitled <title xml:lang="greek">bi/os )Hrakle/ous,</title> has not survived.</note>
which he wrote on the mental and physical endowment and achievements of Hercules while he was among men, Plutarch says that the philosopher Pythagoras reasoned sagaciously and acutely in determining and measuring the hero's superiority in size and stature. For since it was generally agreed that Hercules paced off the racecourse of the stadium at Pisae, near the temple of Olympian Zeus, and made it six hundred feet long, and since the other courses in the land of Greece, constructed later by other men, were indeed six hundred feet in length, but yet were somewhat shorter than that at Olympia, he readily concluded by a process of comparison that the measured length of Hercules' foot was greater than that of other men in the same proportion as the course at Olympia was longer than the other stadia. Then, having ascertained the size  <pb n="v1.p.5"/>  of Hercules' foot, he made a calculation of the bodily height suited to that measure, based upon the natural proportion of all parts of the body, and thus arrived at the logical conclusion that Hercules was as much taller than other men as the course at Olympia exceeded the others that had been constructed with the same number of feet.

<note>According to Apollodorus, II. iv. 9, Hercules was 4 cubits in height; according to Herodorus, 4 cubits and one foot; see J. Tzetzes, <hi rend="italic">Chilides,</hi> ii. 210. The phrase <hi rend="italic">ex pede Herculem</hi> has become proverbial, along with <hi rend="italic">ex ungue leonem</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ab uno disce ones</hi> (Virg. <hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> ii. 65 f.).</note>

<!--<argument>-->

<p>The apt use made by Herodes Atticus, the ex-consul, in reply to an arrogant and boastful young fellow, a student of philosophy in appearance only, of the passage in which Epictetus the Stoic humorously set apart the true Stoic from the mob of prating triflers who called themselves Stoics.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/> While we were students at Athens, Herodes Atticus, a man of consular rank and of true Grecian eloquence, often invited me to his country houses near that city, in company with the honourable

<note><hi rend="italic">Clarisximus</hi> became a standing title of men of high rank, especially of the senatorial order.</note>
Servilianus and several others of our countrymen who had withdrawn from Rome to Greece in quest of culture. And there at that time, while we were with him at the villa called Cephisia, both in the heat of summer and under the burning autumnal sun, we protected ourselves against the trying temperature by the shade of its spacious groves, its long, soft

<note>Cf. Plin. <hi rend="italic">Epist.</hi> ii. xvii. 15, vinea . . . ndis etiam pedibus mollis et cedens.</note>
promenades, the cool location of the house, its elegant baths with their abundance of sparkling water, and the charm of the villa as a whole, which was everywhere melodious with plashing waters and tuneful birds.</p>  <pb n="v1.p.7"/>

<p>There was with us there at the time a young student of philosophy, of the Stoic school according to his own account, but intolerably loquacious and presuming. In the course of the conversations which are commonly carried on at table after dinner, this fellow often used to prattle unseasonably, absurdly, and at immoderate length, on the principles of philosophy, maintaining that compared with himself all the Greek-speaking authorities, all wearers of the toga, and the Latin race in general were ignorant boors. As he spoke, he rattled off unfamiliar terms, the catchwords of syllogisms and dialectic tricks, declaring that no one but he could unravel the <quote>master,</quote> the <quote>resting,</quote> and the <quote>heap</quote> arguments,

<note>Where there are three propositions, any two of which are at variance with the third, they may be taken in pairs as true, rejecting the third as false. This is called the <quote>master</quote> argument, from <foreign xml:lang="grc">kurieu/w,</foreign> <quote>to be master over</quote>; see Epictetus, ii. 18 and 19. The fallacy is due to the fact that all persons do not hold to the truth of the same pair, and it is impossible to maintain all three propositions at once. The <quote>sorites</quote> raised the question, if one grain at a time were taken from a heap, when it would cease to be a heap; and conversely, if one grain at a time were added, when it would become a heap; see Cic. <hi rend="italic">Acad.</hi> ii. 49. A variant, called the <foreign xml:lang="grc">falakro/s,</foreign> inquired whether a man was bald after the loss of one hair, of two, or of how many. Horace, in <hi rend="italic">Epist.</hi> ii. 1. 45–47, has combined both of these with the story told by Plutarch of Sertorius (<hi rend="italic">Sert.</hi> 16). The <quote>silent,</quote> or <quote>resting</quote> argument consisted in stopping and refusing to answer. It was used to meet the logical fallacy of the <quote>sorites.</quote></note>
and other riddles of the kind. Furthermore, as to ethics, the nature of the human intellect, and the origin of the virtues with their duties and limits, or on the other hand the ills caused by disease and sin, and the wasting and destruction of the soul, he stoutly maintained that absolutely no one else had investigated, understood and mastered all these more thoroughly than himself. Further, he believed that torture, bodily pain and deadly peril could neither injure nor detract from the happy state and condition of life which, in his opinion, he had attained, and that no sorrow could even cloud the serenity of the Stoic's face and expression.</p>  <pb n="v1.p.9"/>

<p>Once when he was puffing out these empty boasts, and already all, weary of his prating, were thoroughly disgusted and longing for an end, Herodes, speaking in Greek as was his general custom, said: <quote>Allow me, mightiest of philosophers, since we, whom you call laymen, cannot answer you, to read from a book of Epictetus, greatest of Stoics, what he thought and said about such big talk as that of yours.</quote> And he bade them bring the first

<note>Actually the second book, ii. 19.</note>
volume of the <hi rend="italic">Discourses of Epictetus,</hi> arranged by Arrian, in which that venerable old man with just severity rebukes those young men who, though calling themselves Stoics, showed neither virtue nor honest industry, but merely babbled of trifling propositions and of the fruits of their study of such elements as are taught to children.</p>

<p>Then, when the book was brought, there was read the passage which I have appended, in which Epictetus with equal severity and humour set apart and separated from the true and genuine Stoic, who was beyond question without restraint or constraint, unembarrassed, free, prosperous and happy, that other mob of triflers who styled themselves Stoics, and casting the black soot of their verbiage before the eves of their hearers, laid false claim to the name of the holiest of sects:  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>"'Speak to me of good and evil.'—Listen:</l> <l>The wind, bearing me from Ilium, drove me to the Cicones.

<note><foreign xml:lang="grc">Ei)pe/</foreign> . . . is the request of the pseudo-philosopher, <foreign xml:lang="grc">)/Akoue</foreign> the answer of Epictetus, who quotes a line of Homer (<hi rend="italic">Odyss.</hi> ix. 39) which is here meaningless, implying that the pretended Stoics quote both poetry and ethics <hi rend="italic">glibly,</hi> but without understanding.</note>
</l></quote> <quote>Of all existing things some are good, some evil, and some indifferent. Now the good things are virtues and what partakes of them, the evil are vice and what partakes of vice, and the indifferent lie  <pb n="v1.p.11"/>  between these: wealth, health, life, death, pleasure, pain.

<note>Some assign this speech— <quote>Of all existing things . . . pain</quote> to Epictetus, quoting the pseudo-Stoic jargon; others to the pseudo-philosopher. The former seems to fit best with what follows.</note>
—'How do you know this?'—Hellanicus says so in his <hi rend="italic">Egyptian Histoy.</hi> For what difference does it make whether you say that, or that it was Diogenes in his <hi rend="italic">Ethics</hi> or Chrysippus or Cleanthes? Have you then investigated any of these matters and formed an opinion of your own? Let me see how you are accustomed to act in a storm at sea. Do you recall this classification when the sail cracks and you cry aloud? If some idle fellow should stand beside you and say: 'Tell me, for Heaven's sake, what you told me before. It isn't a vice to suffer shipwreck, is it? It doesn't partake of vice, does it?' Would you not hurl a stick of wood at him and cry: 'What have we to do with you, fellow? We perish and you come and crack jokes.' But if Caesar should summon you to answer an accusation. . .</quote></p>

<p>On hearing these words, that most arrogant of youths was mute, just as if the whole diatribe had been pronounced, not by Epictetus against others, but against himself by Herodes.</p></div>

<p>The difficult decision which the Lacedaemonian Chilo made to save a friend; and that one should consider scrupulously and anxiously whether one ought ever to do wrong in the interest of friends, with notes and quotations on that subject from the writings of Theophrastus and Marcus Cicero.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>OF Chilo the Lacedaemonian, one of that famous group of sages,

<note>The names of these are variously given. They generally include, in addition to Chilo: Cleobulus of Lindus in Rhodes, Periander of Corinth, Pittacus of Mitylene, Bias of Priene, Thales of Miletus, and Solon of Athens. Plato, <hi rend="italic">Protag.</hi> p. 343 A, gives Myson of Chen in place of Periander.</note>
it is written in the books of those  <pb n="v1.p.13"/>  who have recorded the lives and deeds of distinguished men, that he, Chilo, at the close of his life, when death was already close upon him, thus addressed the friends about his bedside:</p>

<p>"That very little of what I have said and done in the course of a long life calls for repentance, you yourselves may perhaps know. I, at any rate, at such a time as this do not deceive myself in believing that I have done nothing that it troubles me to remember, except for just one thing; and as to that it is not even now perfectly clear to me whether I did right or wrong.</p>

<p><quote>I was judge with two others, and a friend's life was at stake. The law was such that the man must be found guilty. Therefore, either my friend must suffer capital punishment or violence must be done to the law. I considered for a long time how to remedy so difficult a situation. The course which I adopted seemed, in comparison with the alternative, the less objectionable; I myself secretly voted for conviction, but I persuaded my fellow judges to vote for acquittal. Thus I myself in a matter of such moment did my duty both as a judge and as a friend. But my action torments me with the fear that there may be something of treachery and guilt in having recommended to others, in the same case, at the same time, and in a common duty, a course for them contrary to what I thought best for myself.</quote></p>

<p>This Chilo, then, though a man of surpassing wisdom, was in doubt how far he ought to have gone counter to law and counter to equity for the sake of a friend, and that question distressed him even at the very end of his life. So too many subsequent students of philosophy, as appears in their works,  <pb n="v1.p.15"/>  have inquired very carefully and very anxiously, to use their own language, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ei) dei= bohqei=n tw=| fi/lw| para\</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="grc">to\ di/kaion kai\ me/xri po/sou kai\ poi=a.</foreign>

<note>The sentence which follows translates the Greek literally, except that for <foreign xml:lang="grc">to\ di/kaion</foreign> <quote>what is right,</quote> we have in the Latin <hi rend="italic">ius moremve,</hi> <quote>law or precedent.</quote> The Romans laid great stress on the <hi rend="italic">mos maiorum,</hi> the precedent set by their forefathers.</note>
That is to say, they inquired <quote>whether one may sometimes act contrary to law or contrary to precedent in a friend's behalf, and under what circumstances and to what extent.</quote></p>

<p>This problem has been discussed, as I have said, not only by many others, but also with extreme thoroughness by Theophrastus, the most conscientious and learned of the Peripatetic school; the discussion is found, if I remember correctly, in the first book of his treatise <hi rend="italic">On Friendship.</hi> That work Cicero evidently read when he too was composing a work <hi rend="italic">On Friendship.</hi> Now, the other material that Cicero thought proper to borrow from Theophrastus his talent and command of language enabled him to take and to translate with great taste and pertinence; but this particular topic which, as I have said, has been the object of much inquiry, and is the most difficult one of all, he passed over briefly and hurriedly, not reproducing the thoughtful and detailed argument of Theophrastus, but omitting his involved and as it were over-scrupulous discussion and merely calling attention in a few words to the nature of the problem. I have added Cicero's words, in case anyone should wish to verify my statement:

<note><hi rend="italic">De Amicitia,</hi> 61.</note>
<quote>Therefore these are the limits which I think ought to be observed, namely: when the characters of friends are blameless, then there should be complete harmony of opinions and inclinations in everything without any exception;  <pb n="v1.p.17"/>  and, even if by some chance the wishes of a friend are not altogether honourable and require to be forwarded in matters which involve his life or reputation, we should turn aside from the straight path, provided, however, utter disgrace does not follow. For there are limits to the indulgence which can be allowed to friendship.</quote>

<note>Translation by Falconer, <hi rend="italic">L. C. L.</hi></note>
</p>

<p><quote>When it is a question,</quote> he says, <quote>either of a friend's life or good name, we must turn aside from the straight path, to further even his dis-honourable desire.</quote> But he does not tell us what the nature of that deviation ought to be, how far we may go to help him, and how dis-honourable tile nature of the friend's desire may be. But what does it avail me to know that I must turn aside from the straight path in the event of such dangers to my friends, provided I commit no act of utter disgrace, unless he also informs me what he regards as utter disgrace and, once having turned from the path of rectitude, how far I ought to go? <quote>For,</quote> he says, <quote>there are limits to the indulgence which can be allowed to friendship.</quote> But that is the very point on which we most need instruction, but which the teachers make least clear, namely, how far and to what degree indulgence must be allowed to friendship. The sage Chilo, whom I mentioned above, turned from the path to save a friend. But I can see how far lie went; for he gave unsound advice to save his friend. Yet even as to that he was in doubt up to his last hour whether he deserved criticism and censure.</p>

<p><quote>Against one's fatherland,</quote> says Cicero,

<note><hi rend="italic">De Amicitia,</hi> 36; Gellius does not quote verbally from Cicero.</note>
<quote>one must not take up arms for a friend.</quote> That of course everybody knew, and <quote>before The ognis was born,</quote>  <pb n="v1.p.19"/>  as Lucilius says.

<note>952 Marx, who cites for the proverb Plutarch, <hi rend="italic">Cum princip. esse philos.</hi> 2, p. 777, c (C.A.F. iii, p. 495, K) and restores Lucilius' line as: <hi rend="italic">hoc priusquan nasceretur Theognis omnes noveratt.</hi></note>
But what I ask and wish to know is this: when it is that one must act contrary to law and contrary to equity in a friend's behalf, albeit without doing violence to the public liberty and peace; and when it is necessary to turn aside from the path, as he himself puts it, in what way and how much, under what circumstances, and to what extent that ought to be done. Pericles, the great Athenian, a man of noble character and endowed with all honourable accomplishments, declared his opinion— in a single instance, it is true, but yet very clearly. For when a friend asked him to perjure himself in court for his sake, he replied in these words: <quote>One ought to aid one's friends, but only so far as the gods allow.</quote>

<note>That is, so far as one can do so without violating the laws of the gods or breaking an oath which one has taken in the name of a god; cf. Cic. <hi rend="italic">Off.</hi> iii. 44, <hi rend="italic">quae salva fide facere possit.</hi></note>
</p>

<p>Theophrastus, however, in the book that I have mentioned, discusses this very question more exhaustively and with more care and precision than Cicero. But even he in his exposition does not express an opinion about separate and individual action, nor with the corroborative evidence of examples, but treats classes of actions briefly and generally, in about the following terms:</p>

<p><quote>A small and trifling amount of disgrace or infamy,</quote> he says, "should be incurred, if thereby great advantage may be gained for a friend; for the insignificant loss from impairment of honour is repaid and made good by the greater and more substantial honour gained by aiding a friend, and that slight break or rift, so to speak, in one's reputation is repaired by the buttress formed by the advantages  <pb n="v1.p.21"/>  gained for one's friend. Nor ought we," says he, <quote>to be influenced by mere terms, because my fair fame and the advantage of a friend under accusation are not of the same class. For such things must be estimated by their immediate weight and importance, not by verbal terms and the merits of the classes to which they belong. For when the interests of a friend are put into the balance with our own honour in matters of equal importance, or nearly so, our own honour unquestionably turns the scale; but when the advantage of a friend is far greater, but our sacrifice of reputation in a matter of no great moment is insignificant, then what is advantageous to a friend gains in importance in comparison with what is honourable for us, exactly as a great weight of bronze is more valuable than a tiny shred of gold.</quote></p>

<p>On this point I append Theophrastus' own words:

<note>Fr. 81, Wimmer.</note>
<quote>If such and such a thing belongs to a more valuable class, yet it is not true that some part of it, compared with a corresponding part of something else, will be preferable. This is not the case, for example, if gold is more valuable than bronze, and a portion of gold, compared with a portion of bronze of corresponding size, is obviously of more worth; but the number and size of the portions will have some influence on our decision.</quote></p>

<p>The philosopher Favorinus too, somewhat loosening and inclining the delicate balance of justice to suit the occasion, thus defined such an indulgence in favour:

<note>Fr. 102, Marres.</note>
<quote>That which among men is called favour is the relaxing of strictness in time of need.</quote></p>

<p>Later on Theophrastus again expressed himself to about this effect: <quote>The relative importance and insignificance of things, and all these considerations  <pb n="v1.p.23"/>  of duty, are sometimes directed, controlled, and as it were steered by other external influences and other additional factors, so to say, arising from individuals, conditions and exigencies, as well as by the requirements of existing circumstances; and these influences, which it is difficult to reduce to rules, make them appear now justifiable and now unjustifiable.</quote></p>

<p>On these and similar topics Theophrastus wrote very discreetly, scrupulously and conscientiously, yet with more attention to analysis and discussion than with the intention or hope of arriving at a decision, since undoubtedly the variations in circumstances and exigencies, and the minute distinctions and differences, do not admit of a definite and universal rule that can be applied to individual cases; and it is such a rule, as I said at the beginning of this essay, of which we are in search.</p>

<p>Now this Chilo, with whom I began this little discussion, is the author not only of some other wise and salutary precepts, but also of the following, which has been found particularly helpful, since it confines within due limits those two most ungovernable passions, love and hatred. <quote>So love,</quote> said he, <quote>as if you were possibly destined to hate; and in the same way, hate as if you might perhaps afterwards love.</quote>

<note>Cicero, <hi rend="italic">De Amicitia,</hi> 59, attributes this saying to Bias, another of the seven sages, as do also Aristotle, Diogenes Laertius and Valerius Maximus. It has appeared in various forms in later times.</note>
</p>

<p>Of this same Chilo the philosopher Plutarch, in the first book of his treatise <hi rend="italic">On the Soul,</hi> wrote as follows:

<note>vii, p. 19, Bern.</note>
<quote>Chilo of old, having heard a man say that he had no enemy, asked him if he had no friend, believing that enmities necessarily followed and were involved in friendships.</quote></p>

<p>The care and fine taste with which Antonius Julianus examined the artful substitution of one word for another by Marcus Cicero in one of his orations.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THE rhetorician Antonius Julianus had an exceedingly noble and winning personality. He also possessed learning of a delightful and helpful sort, devoting great attention to the refinements of the writers of old and readily recalling them. Moreover, he inspected all the earlier literature with such care, weighing its merits and ferreting out its defects, that you might say that his judgment was perfect.

<note>Lit., <quote>according to a rule or level.</quote></note>
</p>

<p>This Julianus expressed the following opinion of the syllogism which is found in the speech of Marcus Tullius spoken <hi rend="italic">In Defence of Gnaeus Plancius</hi>

<note>§68.</note>
—but first I will quote the exact words on which he passed judgment: "And yet, a debt of money is a different thing from a debt of gratitude. For he who discharges a debt in money ceases forthwith to have that which he has paid, while one who continues in debt keeps what belongs to another. But in the case of a debt of gratitude, he who returns it has it; and he who has it returns it by the mere fact of having it.

<note>The point of this passage depends on the meaning of <hi rend="italic">referre grafiam,</hi> <quote>requite</quote> (<quote>pay</quote> a debt of gratitude), and <hi rend="italic">habere gratiam,</hi> <quote>feel gratitude.</quote> I have followed to some extent the rendering of Watts (<hi rend="italic">L.C.L.</hi>), but with some changes.</note>
In the present instance I shall not cease to be Plancius' debtor if I pay this debt, nor should I be paying him any the less simply by feeling goodwill, if the present unfortunate situation had not occurred"

<note>That is, the prosecution of Plancius, which enabled Cicero to pay his debt by defending his friend.</note>
<quote>Here,</quote> said Julianus, <quote>is to be sure a fine artistry in the way the words are marshalled, something well-rounded that charms tile ear by its mere music; but it must be read with the privilege of a slight change in the meaning of one word in order to  <pb n="v1.p.27"/>  preserve the truth of the proposition. Now the comparison of a debt of gratitude with a pecuniary debt demands the use of the word 'debt' in both instances. For a debt of money and a debt of gratitude will seem to be properly compared, if we may say that both money and gratitude are owed; but let us consider what happens in the owing or paying of money, and on the other hand in the owing and paying of a debt of gratitude, if we retain the word 'debt' in both instances. Now Cicero,</quote> continued Julianus, <quote>having said that a debt of money was a different thing from a debt of gratitude, in giving his reason for that statement applies the word 'owe' to money, but in the case of gratitude substitutes ' has' (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> 'feels') for ' owes'; for this is what he says: ' But in the case of a debt of gratitude, he who returns it has it; and he who has it returns it by the mere fact of having it.' But that word 'has' does not exactly fit the proposed comparison. For it is the owing, and not the having, of gratitude that is compared with money, and therefore it would have been more consistent to say: 'He who owes pays by the mere fact of owing.' But it would be absurd and quite too forced if a debt of gratitude that was not yet paid should be said to be paid by the mere fact that it was owed. Therefore,</quote> said Julianus, <quote>Cicero made a change and substituted a similar word for one which he had dropped, in order to seem to have kept the idea of a comparison of debts, and at the same time retained the careful balance of his period.</quote> Thus it was that Julianus elucidated and criticized passages in the earlier literature, which a select group of young men read under his guidance.</p>

<p>That the orator Demosthenes was criticized because of his care for his person and attire, and taunted with foppishness; and that the orator Hortensius also, because of similar foppishness and the use of theatrical gestures when he spoke, was nicknamed Dionysia the dancing-girl.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>IT is said that Demosthenes in his dress and other personal habits was excessively spruce, elegant and studied. It was for that reason that he was taunted by his rivals and opponents with his <quote>exquisite, pretty mantles</quote> and <quote>soft, pretty tunics</quote> ;

<note>Aeschines, <hi rend="italic">in Tim.</hi> 131.</note>
for that reason, too, that they did not refrain from applying to him foul and shameful epithets, alleging that he was no mall and was even guilty of unnatural vice.</p>

<p>In like manner Quintus Hortensius, quite the most renowned orator of his time with the exception of Marcus Tullius, because he dressed with extreme foppishness, arranged the folds of his toga with great care and exactness, and in speaking used his hands to excess in lively gestures, was assailed with gibes and shameful charges; and many taunts were hurled at him, even while he was pleading in court, for appearing like an actor. But when Sulla was on trial, and Lucius Torquatus, a man of somewhat boorish and uncouth nature, with great violence and bitterness did not stop with calling Hortensius an actor in the presence of the assembled jurors, but said that he was a posturer and a Dionysia—which was the name of a notorious dancing-girl—then Hortensius replied in a soft and gentle tone: <quote>I would rather be a Dionysia, Torquatus, yes, a Dionysia, than like you, a stranger to the Muses, to Venus and to Dionysus.</quote>

<!--<argument>-->

<p>An extract from the speech delivered to the people by Metellus Numidicus when he was censor, urging them to marry; why that speech has been criticized and how on the contrary it has been defended.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A number of learned men were listening to the reading of the speech which Metellus Numidicus,

<note>Metellus Numidicus was censor in 102 B.C. Livy (Periocha 59) attributes a speech on this subject to Q. Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus, censor in 131 B.C., which he says was read to the people by Augustus; cf. Suet. <hi rend="italic">Aug.</hi> lxxxix. Since Suetonius, who gives the name simply as Q. Metellus, cites the speech under the title <hi rend="italic">De Prole</hi> <hi rend="italic">Augenda</hi> and the Periocha says that it was delivered <hi rend="italic">ut co g e re nt</hi> <hi rend="italic">omnes ducere uxores liberorum creandorum causa,</hi> it seems probable that it was not identical with this address of Metellus Numidicus.</note>
an earnest and eloquent man, delivered to the people when he was censor, <hi rend="italic">On Marriage,</hi> urging them to be ready to undertake its obligations. In that speech these words were written: <quote>If we could get on without a wife, Romans, we would all avoid that annoyance; but since nature has ordained that we can neither live very comfortably with them nor at all without them, we must take thought for our lasting well-being rather than for the pleasure of the moment.</quote></p>

<p>It seemed to some of the company that Quintus Metellus, whose purpose as censor was to encourage the people to take wives, ought not to have admitted the annoyance and constant inconveniences of the married state; that to do this was not so much to encourage, as to dissuade and deter them. But they said that his speech ought rather to have taken just the opposite tone, insisting that as a rule there were no annoyances in matrimony, and if after all they seemed sometimes to arise, they were slight, insignificant and easily endured, and were completely forgotten in its greater pleasures and  <pb n="v1.p.33"/>  advantages; furthermore, that even these annoyances did not fall to the lot of all or from any fault natural to matrimony, but as the result of the misconduct and injustice of some husbands and wives. Titus Castricius, however, thought that Metellus had spoken properly and as was altogether worthy of his position. <quote>A censor,</quote> said he, <quote>ought to speak in one way, an advocate in another. It is the orator's privilege to make statements that are untrue, daring, crafty, deceptive and sophistical, provided they have some semblance of truth and can by any artifice be made to insinuate themselves into the minds of the persons who are to be influenced. Furthermore,</quote> he said, <quote>it is disgraceful for an advocate, even though his case be a bad one, to leave anything unnoticed or undefended. But for a Metellus, a blameless man, with a reputation for dignity and sense of honour, addressing the Roman people with the prestige of such a life and course of honours, it was not becoming to say anything which was not accepted as true by himself and by all men, especially when speaking on a subject which was a matter of everyday knowledge and formed a part of the common and habitual experience of life. Accordingly, having admitted the existence of annoyances notorious with all men, and having thus established confidence in his sincerity and truthfulness, he then found it no difficult or uphill work to convince them of what was the soundest and truest of principles, that the State cannot survive without numerous marriages.</quote></p>

<p>This other passage also from the same address of Metellus in my opinion deserves constant reading, not less by Heaven! than the writings of the  <pb n="v1.p.35"/>  greatest philosophers. His words are these: <quote>The immortal gods have mighty power, but they are not expected to be more indulgent to us than our parents. But parents, if their children persist in wrong-doing, disinherit them. What different application of justice then are we to look for from the immortal gods, unless we put an end to our evil ways? Those alone may fairly claim the favour of the gods who are not their own worst enemies.

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>IN the fifth oration of Cicero <hi rend="italic">Against Verres,</hi>

<note>ii. 5. 167. </note>
in a copy of unimpeachable fidelity, since it was the result of Tiro's

<note>Cicero's favourite freedman, who not only aided him in his literary work, but also, after the orator's death, collected, arranged, and published his patron's writings, in particular his correspondence.</note>
careful scholarship, is this passage: <quote>Men of low degree and humble birth sail the seas; they come to places which they had never before visited. They are neither known to those to whom they have come nor can they always find acquaintances to vouch for them, yet because of this mere faith in their citizenship they believe that they will be safe, not only before our magistrates, who are constrained by fear of the  <pb n="v1.p.37"/>  laws and public opinion, and not only among Roman citizens, who are united by the common bond of language, rights, and many interests, but wherever they may come, they hope that this possession will protect them.</quote></p>

<p>It seemed to many that there was an error in the last word. For they thought that <hi rend="italic">futuram</hi> should be written instead of <hi rend="italic">futurum,</hi> and they were sure that the book ought to be corrected, lest like the adulterer in the comedy of Plautus

<note><hi rend="italic">Bacch.</hi> 918.</note>
—for so they jested about the error which they thought they had found—this solecism in an oration of Cicero's should be <quote>caught in the act.</quote></p>

<p>There chanced to be present there a friend of mine, who had become an expert from wide reading and to whom almost all the older literature had been the object of study, meditation and wakeful nights. He, on examining the book, declared that there was no mistake in writing or grammar in that word, but that Cicero had written correctly and in accordance with early usage. <quote>For <hi rend="italic">futurum</hi> is not,</quote> said he, " to be taken with <hi rend="italic">rem,</hi> as hasty and careless readers think, nor is it used as a participle. It is an infinitive, the kind of word which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)pare/mfatos</foreign> or 'indeterminate,' affected neither by number nor gender, but altogether free and independent, such a word as Gaius Gracchus used in the speech entitled <hi rend="italic">On Publius Popilius, delivered in the places of assembly,</hi>

<note>Gracchus delivered two speeches against Popilius, one in the Forum at Rome (<hi rend="italic">pro rostris</hi>), the other <hi rend="italic">circum conciliabula,</hi> in the market-places of various towns of Latium; see Meyer, <hi rend="italic">O. R. F,</hi><hi rend="sup">2</hi> p. 239.</note>
in which we read: 'I suppose that my enemies will say this.' He said <hi rend="italic">dicturum,</hi> not <hi rend="italic">dicturos;</hi> and is it not clear that <hi rend="italic">dicturum</hi> in Gracchus is used according to the same principle  <pb n="v1.p.39"/>  as <hi rend="italic">futurum</hi> in Cicero? Just as in the Greek language, without any suspicion of error, words such as <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)rei=n, poih/sein, e)/sesqai,</foreign> and the like, are used in all genders and all numbers without distinction." He added that in the third book of the <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi> of Claudius Quadrigarius are these words:

<note>Fr. 43, Peter.</note>
<quote>While they were being cut to pieces, the forces of the enemy would be busy there (<hi rend="italic">copias . . . futurum</hi>)</quote> ; and at the beginning of the eighteenth book of the same Quadrigarius:

<note>Fr. 79, Peter.</note>
<quote>If you enjoy health proportionate to your own merit and our good-will, we have reason to hope that the gods will bless the good (<hi rend="italic">deos</hi> . . . <hi rend="italic">facturum</hi>)</quote> ; that similarly Valerius Antias also in his twenty-fourth book wrote: <quote>If those religious rites should be performed, and the omens should be wholly favourable, the soothsayers declared that everything would proceed as they desired (<hi rend="italic">omnia</hi> . . .<hi rend="italic">processurum esse</hi>).</quote>

<note>Fr. 59, Peter.</note>
<quote>Plautus also in the <hi rend="italic">Casina,</hi>

<note>v. 691.</note>
speaking of a girl, used <hi rend="italic">occisurum,</hi> not <hi rend="italic">occisuram</hi> in the following passage:  Has Casina a sword?—Yes, two of them.— Why two?—With one she'd fain the bailiff slay, With t'other you.  So too Laberius in <hi rend="italic">The Twins</hi> wrote:

<note>v. 51, Ribbeck.<hi rend="sup">3</hi></note>
I thought not she would do (<hi rend="italic">facturum</hi>) it. Now, all those men were not unaware of the nature of a solecism, but Gracchus used <hi rend="italic">dicturum,</hi> Quadrigarius <hi rend="italic">futurum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">facturum,</hi> Antias <hi rend="italic">processurum,</hi> Plautus <hi rend="italic">occisurum</hi> and Laberius <hi rend="italic">facturum,</hi> in the infinitive mood, a mood which is not inflected for mood or number or person or tense or gender,  <pb n="v1.p.41"/>  but expresses them all by one and the same form, just as Marcus Cicero did not use <hi rend="italic">fiturum</hi> in the masculine or neuter gender—for that would clearly be a solecism—but employed a form which is independent of any influence of gender.</quote>

<note>Cellius' friend was partly right. Such forms as <hi rend="italic">dicturum</hi> were derived from the second supine <hi rend="italic">dictu</hi> + *<hi rend="italic">erom</hi> (earlier *<hi rend="italic">esom</hi>), the infinitive of <hi rend="italic">sum.</hi> Later, the resulting form <hi rend="italic">dicturum</hi> was looked upon as a participle and declined. In the early writers such infinitives did not change their form, and did not add the tautological <hi rend="italic">esse.</hi></note>
</p>

<p>Furthermore, that same friend of mine used to say that in the oration of that same Marcus Tullius <hi rend="italic">On Pompey's Military Command</hi>

<note>§ 33.</note>
Cicero wrote the following, and so my friend always read it: <quote>Since you know that your harbours, and those harbours from which you draw the breath of life, were in tile power of the pirates.</quote> And he declared that <hi rend="italic">in potestatem fuisse</hi>

<note>That is, for <hi rend="italic">in potestate.</hi></note>
was not a solecism, as the half-educated vulgar think, but he maintained that it was used in accordance with a definite and correct principle, one which the Greeks also followed; and Plautus, who is most choice in his Latinity, said in the Amphitruo:

<note>v. 180. Leo reads <hi rend="italic">num número mi in mentém fruit</hi> <quote>it hasn't just occurred to me, has it?</quote></note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Número mihi in mentém fuit,</l></quote>  not <hi rend="italic">in mente,</hi> as we commonly say.</p>

<p>But besides Plautus, whom my friend used as an example in this instance, I myself have come upon a great abundance of such expressions in the early writers, and I have jotted them down here and there in these notes of mine. But quite apart from that rule and those authorities, the very sound and order of the words make it quite clear that it is more in accordance with the careful attention to diction and the rhythmical style of Marcus Tullius that, either  <pb n="v1.p.43"/>  being good Latin, he should prefer to say <hi rend="italic">potestatem</hi> rather than <hi rend="italic">potestate.</hi> For the former construction is more agreeable to the ear and better rounded, the latter harsher and less finished, provided always that a man has an ear attuned to such distinctions, not one that is dull and sluggish; it is for the same reason indeed that he preferred to say <hi rend="italic">explicavit</hi> rather than <hi rend="italic">explicuit,</hi> which was already coming to be the commoner form.</p>

<p>These are his own words from the speech which he delivered <hi rend="italic">On Pomnpey's Military Command:</hi>

<note>§ 30.</note>
<quote>Sicily is a witness, which, begirt on all sides by many dangers, he freed (<hi rend="italic">explicavit</hi>), not by the threat of war, but by his promptness in decision.</quote> But if lie had said <hi rend="italic">explicuit,</hi> the sentence would halt with weak and imperfect rhythm.

<note>The cadence _u_u was a favourite one with Cicero at the end of a sentence.</note>

<p>An anecdote found in the works of the philosopher Sotion about the courtesan Lais and the orator Demosthenes.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>SOTION was a man of the Peripatetic school, far from unknown. He wrote a book filled with wide and varied information and called it <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ke/ras )Amalqei/as,</foreign>

<note><hi rend="italic">The Horn of Amantheia;</hi> see Greek Index.</note>
which is about equivalent to <hi rend="italic">The Horn of Plenty.</hi></p>

<p>In that book is found the following anecdote about the orator Demosthenes and the courtesan Lais: <quote>Lais of Corinth,</quote> he says, <quote>used to gain a great deal of money by the grace and charm of her beauty, and was frequently visited by wealthy men from all over Greece; but no one was received who did not give what she demanded, and her  <pb n="v1.p.45"/>  demands were extravagant enough.</quote> He says that this was the origin of the proverb common among the Greeks:  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Not every man may fare to Corinth town,

<note>Cf. Horace, <hi rend="italic">Epist.</hi> i. 17. 36.</note>
</l></quote>  for in vain would any man go to Corinth to visit Lais who could not pay her price. <quote>The great Demosthenes approached her secretly and asked for her favours. But Lais demanded ten thousand drachmas</quote> —a sum equivalent in our money to ten thousand denarii.

<note>The drachma and the denarius (about 8<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> or 16 cents) was the average wage of a day-labourer.</note>
<quote>Amazed and shocked at the woman's great impudence and the vast sum of money demanded, Demosthenes turned away, remarking as he left her: 'I will not buy regret at such a price.'</quote> But the Greek words which he is said to have used are neater; he said: <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ou)k</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="grc">w)nou=mai muri/wn draxmw=n metame/leian.</foreign>

<p>What the method and what the order of the Pythagorean training was, and the amount of time which was prescribed and accepted as the period for learning and at the same time keeping silence.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>IT is said that the order and method followed by Pythagoras, and afterwards by his school and his successors, in admitting and training their pupils were as follows: At the very outset he <quote>physiognomized</quote> the young men who presented themselves for instruction. That word means to inquire into the character and dispositions of men by an inference drawn from their facial appearance and  <pb n="v1.p.47"/>  expression, and from the form and bearing of their whole body. Then, when he had thus examined a man and found him suitable, he at once gave orders that he should be admitted to the school and should keep silence for a fixed period of time; this was not the same for all, but differed according to his estimate of the man's capacity for learning quickly. But the one who kept silent listened to what was said by others; he was, however, religiously forbidden to ask questions, if he had not fully understood, or to remark upon what he had heard. Now, no one kept silence for less than two years, and during the entire period of silent listening they were called <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)koustikoi/</foreign> or <quote>auditors.</quote> But when they had learned what is of all things the most difficult, to keep quiet and listen, and had finally begun to be adepts in that silence which is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)xemuqi/a</foreign> or <quote>continence in words,</quote> they were then allowed to speak, to ask questions, and to write down what they had heard, and to express their own opinions. During this stage they were called <foreign xml:lang="grc">maqhmatikoi/</foreign> or <quote>students of science,</quote> evidently from those branches of knowledge which they had now begun to learn and practise; for the ancient Greeks called geometry, gnomonics,

<note>The science of dialling, concerned with the making and testing of sun-dials (<foreign xml:lang="grc">gnw/mones</foreign>).</note>
music and other higher studies <foreign xml:lang="grc">maqh/mata</foreign> or <quote>sciences</quote> ; but the common people apply the term <hi rend="italic">mathematici</hi> to those who ought to be called by their ethnic name, Chaldaeans.

<note><hi rend="italic">Chaldaei</hi> and <hi rend="italic">mathematici</hi> were general terms for astrologers at Rome; see <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> Suet. <hi rend="italic">Dom.</hi> xiv. 1, xv. 3; <hi rend="italic">Tib.</hi> lxix; <hi rend="italic">etc.</hi></note>
Finally, equipped with this scientific training, they advanced to the investigation of the phenomena of the universe and the laws of nature,  <pb n="v1.p.49"/>  and then, and not till then, they were called <foreign xml:lang="grc">fusikoi/</foreign> or <quote>natural philosophers.</quote></p>

<p>Having thus expressed himself about Pythagoras, my friend Taurus continued: "But nowadays these fellows who turn to philosophy on a sudden with unwashed feet,

<note>Proverbial for <quote>without preparation.</quote></note>
not content with being wholly 'without purpose, without learning, and without scientific training,' even lay down the law as to how they are to be taught philosophy. One says, 'first teach me this,' another chimes in,' I want to learn this, I don't want to learn that'; one is eager to begin with the <hi rend="italic">Symposiumn</hi> of Plato because of the revel of Alcibiades,

<note>Ch. 30.</note>
another with the <hi rend="italic">Phaedrus</hi> on account of the speech of Lysias.

<note>Ch. 6.</note>
By Jupiter!" said he, <quote>one man actually asks to read Plato, not in order to better his life, but to deck out his diction and style, not to gain in discretion, but in prettiness.</quote> That is what Taurus used to say, in comparing the modern students of philosophy with the Pythagoreans of old.</p>

<p>But I must not omit this fact either—that all of them, as soon as they had been admitted by Pythagoras into that band of disciples, at once devoted to the common use whatever estate and property they had, and an inseparable fellowship was formed, like the old-time association which in Roman legal parlance was termed an <quote>undivided inheritance.</quote>

<p>The statement of the celebrated writer Thucydides, that the Lacedaemonians in battle used pipes and not trumpets, with a citation of his words on that subject; and the remark of Herodotus that king Alyattes had female lyre-players as part of his military equipment; and finally, some notes on the pipe used by Gracchus when addressing assemblies.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THUCYDIDES, the most authoritative of Greek historians, tells us

<note>v. 70.</note>
that the Lacedaemonians, greatest of warriors, made use in battle, not of signals by horns or trumpets, but of the music of pipes, certainly not in conformity with any religious usage or from any ceremonial reason, nor yet that their courage might be roused and stimulated, which is the purpose of horns and trumpets; but on the contrary that they might be calmer and advance in better order, because the effect of the flute-player's notes is to restrain impetuosity. So firmly were they convinced that in meeting the enemy and beginning battle nothing contributed more to valour and confidence than to be soothed by gentler sounds and keep their feelings under control. Accordingly, when the army was drawn up, and began to advance in battle-array against the foe, pipers stationed in the ranks began to play. Thereupon, by this quiet, pleasant, and even solemn prelude the fierce impetuosity of the soldiers was checked, in conformity with a kind of discipline of military music, so to speak, so that they might not rush forth in straggling disorder.</p>

<p>But I should like to quote the very words of that outstanding writer, which have greater distinction and credibility than my own: <quote>And after this the  <pb n="v1.p.55"/>  attack began. The Argives and their allies rushed forward eagerly and in a rage, but the Lacedaemonians advanced slowly to the music of many flute-players stationed at regular intervals; this not for any religious reason, but in order that they might make the attack while marching together rhythmically, and that their ranks might not be broken, which commonly happens to great armies when they advance to the attack.</quote></p>

<p>Tradition has it that the Cretans also commonly entered battle with the lyre playing before them and regulating their step. Futhermore, Alyattes, king of the land of Lydia, a man of barbaric manners and luxury, when he made war on the Milesians, as Herodotus tells us in his <hi rend="italic">History,</hi>

<note>i. 17.</note>
had in his army and his battle-array orchestras of pipe and lyre-players, and even female flute-players, such as are the delight of wanton banqueters. Homer, however, says

<note><hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> iii. 8.</note>
that the Achaeans entered battle, relying, not on the music of lyres and pipes, but on silent harmony and unanimity of spirit:</p>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>In silence came the Achaeans, breathing rage,</l> <l>Resolved in mind on one another's aid.</l></quote>

<p>What then is the meaning of that soul-stirring shout of the Roman soldiers which, as the annalists have told us, was regularly raised when charging the foe?

<note>This is approved by Julius Caesar, <hi rend="italic">Bell. Civ.</hi> iii. 92. 5.</note>
Was that done contrary to so generally accepted a rule of old-time discipline? Or are a quiet advance and silence needful when an army is marching against an enemy that is far off and visible from a distance, but when they have almost come to blows, then must the foe, already at close quarters, be driven back by a violent assault and terrified by shouting?</p>  <pb n="v1.p.57"/>

<p>But, look you, the Laconian pipe-playing reminds me also of that oratorical pipe, which they say was played for Gaius Gracchus when he addressed the people, and gave him the proper pitch. But it is not at all true, as is commonly stated, that a musician always stood behind him as he spoke, playing the pipe, and by varying the pitch now restrained and now animated his feelings and his delivery. For what could be more absurd than that a piper should play measures, notes, and a kind of series of changing melodies for Gracchus when addressing an assembly, as if for a dancing mountebank? But more reliable authorities declare that the musician took his place unobserved in the audience and at intervals sounded on a short pipe a deeper note, to restrain and calm the exuberant energy of the orator's delivery. And that in my opinion is the correct view, for it is unthinkable that Gracchus' well-known natural vehemence needed any incitement or impulse from without. Yet Marcus Cicero thinks that the piper was employed by Gracchus for both purposes, in order that with notes now soft, now shrill, he might animate his oratory when it was becoming weak and feeble, or check it when too violent and passionate. I quote Cicero's own words:

<note><hi rend="italic">De Orat.</hi> iii. 225.</note>
<quote>And so this same Gracchus, Catulus, as you may hear from your client Licinius, an educated man, who was at that time Gracchus' slave and amanuensis,

<note>The more usual expression for <quote>amanuensis</quote> is (<hi rend="italic">servus</hi>) <hi rend="italic">a manu,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">ad manum</hi> also occurs.</note>
used to have a skilful musician stand behind him in concealment when he addressed an audience, who could quickly breathe a note to arouse the speaker if languid, or recall him from undue vehemence.</quote></p>  <pb n="v1.p.59"/>

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Those who have written about <quote>taking</quote> a Vestal virgin, of whom the most painstaking is Antistius Labeo,

<note><hi rend="italic">De Iure Pontificali,</hi> fr. 21, Huschke; 3, Bremer.</note>
have stated that it is unlawful for a girl to be chosen who is less than six, or more than ten, years old; she must also have both father and mother living; she must be free too from any impediment in her speech, must not have impaired hearing, or be marked by any other bodily defect;  <pb n="v1.p.61"/>  she must not herself have been freed from paternal control,

<note>The Roman father had control over his children (<hi rend="italic">patria potestas</hi>) until he died, or lost his civic rights through some misconduct, or voluntarily <quote>emancipated</quote> them; for a striking example see Suet. <hi rend="italic">Tib.</hi> xv. 2.</note>
nor her father before her, even if her father is still living and she is under the control of her grandfather;

<note>If a man was emancipated after having children born to him, the latter remained under the control of their grand-father (cf. Gains, i. 133) and were legally orphans, hence not <hi rend="italic">patrima et matrimra;</hi> Pruner, <hi rend="italic">Hestia</hi>-<hi rend="italic">Vesta,</hi> p. 273, N. 1.</note>
neither one nor both of her parents may have been slaves or engaged in mean occupations.

<note>Cf. Cic. <hi rend="italic">De Off.</hi> i. 150.</note>
But they say that one whose sister has been chosen to that priesthood acquires exemption, as well as one whose father is a1 flamen or an augur, one of the Fifteen in charge of the Sibylline Books,

<note>The <hi rend="italic">X V viri sacris faciundis,</hi> who had charge of the Sibylline Books. Tarquin appointed <hi rend="italic">IIviri sacris faciundis</hi> for the purpose (Livy, v. 13. 6), but by the Licinian laws of 367 B.C. the number was increased to ten, five patricians and five plebeians. The Fifteen are first mentioned by Cicero (<hi rend="italic">Epist.</hi> viii. 4. 1) in 51 B.C. They were ex-praetors or ex-consuls until a late period, and the priesthood continued to exist until the books were burned by Stilicho in the fourth century. </note>
one of the Seven who oversee the banquets of the gods, or a dancing priest of Mars. Exemption from that priesthood is regularly allowed also to the betrothed of a pontiff and to the daughter of a priest of the tubilustrium.

<note>At the <hi rend="italic">tubilustrium,</hi> on March 23, the trumpets used in sacred rites were purified by the <hi rend="italic">tibicines sacrorum populi Romani;</hi> at the same time the Salii had their third procession in honour of Mars and Nerio; cf. Festus, 482. 27, Lindsay.</note>
Furthermore the writings of Ateius Capito inform us

<note><hi rend="italic">De lure Pontificali, fr.</hi> 11, Huschke; 7, Bremer.</note>
that the daughter of a man without residence in Italy must not be chosen, and that the daughter of one who has three children must be excused.</p>

<p>Now, as soon as the Vestal virgin is chosen, escorted to the House of Vesta and delivered to the pontiffs, she immediately passes from the control of her father without the ceremony of emancipation or loss of civil rights, and acquires the right to make a will.</p>

<p>But as to the method and ritual for choosing a Vestal, there are, it is true, no ancient written records,  <pb n="v1.p.63"/>  except that the first to be appointed was chosen by Numa. There is, however, a Papian law,

<note>The date of this law is unknown; it is not identical with the lex Papia-Poppaea of 250 B.C.</note>
which provides that twenty maidens be selected from the people at the discretion of the chief pontiff, that a choice by lot be made from that number in the assembly,

<note>The <hi rend="italic">comitia calata;</hi> see xv. 27. l. ff.</note>
and that the girl whose lot is drawn be <quote>taken</quote> by the chief pontiff and become Vesta's. But that allotment in accordance with the Papian law is usually unnecessary at present. For if any man of respectable birth goes to the chief pontiff and offers his daughter for the priesthood, provided consideration may be given to her candidacy without violating any religious requirement, the senate grants him exemption from the Papian law.</p>

<p>Now the Vestal is said to be <quote>taken,</quote> it appears, because she is grasped by the hand of the chief pontiff and led away from the parent under whose control she is, as if she had been taken in war. In the first book of Fabius Pictor's <hi rend="italic">History</hi>

<note>Fr. 4, Huschke; 1, Bremer.</note>
the formula is given which the chief pontiff should use in choosing a Vestal. It is this: <quote>I take thee, Amata, as one who has fulfilled all the legal requirements, to be priestess of Vesta, to perform the rites which it is lawful for a Vestal to perform for the Roman people, the Quirites.</quote></p>

<p>Now, many think that the term <quote>taken</quote> ought to be used only of a Vestal. But, as a matter of fact, the flamens of Jupiter also, as well as the augurs, were said to be <quote>taken.</quote> Lucius Sulla, in the second book of his <hi rend="italic">Autobiography,</hi>

<note>Fr. 2, Peter.</note>
wrote as follows: <quote>Publius Cornelius, the first to receive the surname Sulla, was taken to be flamen of Jupiter.</quote> Marcus  <pb n="v1.p.65"/>  Cato, in his accusation of Servius Galba, says of the Lusitanians:

<note>The title of the oration is variously given as <hi rend="italic">Contra Servium Galbam</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pro Direptis Lusitanis;</hi> perhaps the two titles were combined in one. See Jordan's <hi rend="italic">Cato,</hi> p. 27.</note>
<quote>Yet they say that they wished to revolt. I myself at the present moment wish a thorough knowledge of the pontifical law; shall I therefore be taken as chief pontiff? If I wish to understand the science of augury thoroughly, shall anyone for that reason take me as augur?</quote></p>

<p>Furthermore, in the <hi rend="italic">Commentaries on the Twelve Tables</hi> compiled by Labeo

<note>Fr. 24, Huschke; 2, Bremer. The comment quoted by Gellius is on <hi rend="italic">Twelve Tables</hi> V. 1.</note>
we find this passage: <quote>A Vestal virgin is not heir to any intestate person, nor is anyone her heir, should she die without making a will, but her property, they say, reverts to the public treasury. The legal principle involved is an unsettled question.</quote></p>

<p>The Vestal is called <quote>Amata</quote> when taken by the chief pontiff, because there is a tradition that the first one who was chosen bore that name.

<note>Various other reasons have been given, of which perhaps the most attractive is that it is from an original <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)dama/ta,</foreign> <hi rend="italic">inwedded.</hi> According to Pruner, <hi rend="italic">Hestia-Vesta,</hi> p. 276, followed by Rossbach in Pauly-Wissowa, <hi rend="italic">s.v., amata</hi> is not a proper name, but means <quote>beloved.</quote></note>

<p>On the philosophical question, what would be more proper on receipt of an order-to do scrupulously what was commanded, or sometimes even to disobey, in the hope that it would be more advantageous to the giver of the order; and an exposition of varying views on that subject.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>IN interpreting, evaluating and weighing the obligations which the philosophers call <foreign xml:lang="grc">kaqh/konta,</foreign> or <quote>duties,</quote> the question is often asked, when some task has been assigned to you and exactly what was to be done has been defined, whether you ought to do anything contrary to instructions, if by so doing  <pb n="v1.p.67"/>  it might seem that the outcome would be more successful and more advantageous to the one who imposed the task upon you. It is a difficult question which has been answered both ways by wise men. For several have taken a position on the one side and expressed the decided belief that when a matter has once for all been determined, after due deliberation, by the one whose business and right are concerned, nothing should be done contrary to his order, even if some unlooked for occurrence should promise a better way of accomplishing the end in view; for fear that, if the expectation were not realized, the offender would be liable to blame and inexorable punishment for his insubordination. If, on the other hand, the affair chanced to result more favourably, thanks would indeed be due the gods, but nevertheless a precedent would seem to have been established, which might ruin well-laid plans by weakening the binding force of a command. Others have thought that the disadvantages to be feared, in case the order was not strictly obeyed, should carefully be weighed in advance against the advantage looped for, and if the former were comparatively light and trivial, while on the contrary a greater and more substantial advantage was confidently to be expected, then they judged that one might go counter to instructions, to avoid losing a providential opportunity for successful action; and they did not believe that a precedent for disobedience was to be feared, provided always that considerations of such a kind could be urged. But they thought that particular regard should be paid to the temperament and disposition of the person whose business and command were involved: he must not be stern,  <pb n="v1.p.69"/>  hard, autocratic and implacable, as in the case of the orders of a Postumius and a Manlius.

<note>Titus Manlius Torquatus had his own son executed for disobedience to his father's command; see ix. 13. 29. A similar story is told of Postumius; see xvii. 21. 17; cf. Otto, <hi rend="italic">Sprichw.</hi> p. 209.</note>
For if an account must be rendered to such a commander, they recommended that nothing be done contrary to the letter of his order.</p>

<p>I think that this question of obedience to commands of such a nature will be more clearly defined, if I <hi rend="italic">add</hi> the example set by Publius Crassus Mucianus, a distinguished and eminent man. This Crassus is said by Sempronius Asellio

<note>Fr. 8, Peter.</note>

allies and friends of the Romans, to have the larger of two masts which he had seen in their city sent him. Then the chief engineer on learning the purpose for which Crassus wanted the mast, did not send him the larger, as had been ordered, but the smaller, which he thought was more suitable, and better adapted for  <pb n="v1.p.71"/>  making a ram, besides being easier to transport. Crassus ordered him to be summoned, asked why he had not sent the mast which had been ordered, and ignoring the excuses and reasons which the man urged, caused him to be stripped and soundly beaten with rods; for he thought that all the authority of a commander was weakened and made of no effect, if one might reply to orders which he received, not with due obedience, but with an unsolicited plan of his own.</p></div>

<p>What a tiresome and utterly hateful fault is vain and empty loquacity, and how often it has been censured in deservedly strong language by the greatest Greek and Latin writers.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THE talk of empty-headed, vain and tiresome babblers, who with no foundation of solid matter let out a stream of tipsy, tottering words, has justly been thought to come from the lips and not from the heart. Moreover, men say that the tongue ought not to be unrestrained and rambling, but guided and, so to speak, steered by cords connected with the heart and inmost breast. Yet you may see some men spouting forth words with no exercise of judgment, but with such great and profound assurance that many of them in the very act of speaking are evidently unaware that they are talking. Ulysses, on the contrary, a man gifted with sagacious eloquence, spoke, not from his lips but from his heart, as Hommer says—a remark which applies less to the sound and quality of his utterance than to the depth of the thoughts inwardly conceived; and the poet went on to say, with great aptness, that the teeth form a rampart to check wanton words, in order that reckless speech may not only be restrained by that watchful sentry the heart, but also hedged in by a kind of outpost, so to speak, stationed at the lips.</p>  <pb n="v1.p.75"/>

<p>The words of Homer which I mentioned above are these:

<note><hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> iii. 221.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>When from his breast his mighty voice went forth</l></quote>  and:

<note><hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> iv. 350, etc.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>What a word has passed the barrier of your teeth.</l></quote>  I have added also a passage from Marcus Tullius, in which he expresses his strong and just hatred of silly and unmeaning volubility. He says:

<note><hi rend="italic">De Orat.</hi> iii. 142.</note>
<quote>Provided this fact be recognized, that neither should one commend the dumbness of a man who knows a subject, but is unable to give it expression in speech, nor the ignorance of one who lacks knowledge of his subject, but abounds in words; yet if one must choose one or the other alternative, I for my part would prefer tongue-tied knowledge to ignorant loquacity.</quote> Also in the first book of the <hi rend="italic">De Oratore</hi>

<note>i. 51.</note>
he wrote as follows: <quote>For what is so insane as the empty sound of words, however well-chosen and elegant, if there be no foundation of sense or sagacity?</quote> But Marcus Cato in particular is a relentless assailant of this fault. For in the speech entitled <hi rend="italic">If Caelius, tribune of the commons, should have summoned him,</hi>

<note>See Jordan's <hi rend="italic">Cato,</hi> xl. 1. The meaning of the title, which is uncertain, is discussed in his <hi rend="italic">Prolegomena,</hi> p. lxix f. <hi rend="italic">Se</hi> refers to Cato himself. By some the speech is regarded as identical with the one mentioned by Fronto, vol. i, p. 117, <hi rend="italic">L.C.L.,</hi> and by Plutarch, <hi rend="italic">Cato</hi> ix. 7, vol. ii, p. 329, <hi rend="italic">L. C.L.</hi></note>
he says: <quote>That man is never silent who is afflicted with the disease of talking, as one in a lethargy is afflicted with that of drinking and sleeping. For if you should not come together when he calls an assembly, so eager is he to talk that he would hire someone to listen. And so you hear him, but you do not listen, just as if he were a quack. For a quack's words are heard, but no one trusts himself  <pb n="v1.p.77"/>  to him when he is sick.</quote> Again Cato, in the same speech,

<note>xl. 2, Jordan.</note>
upbraiding the same Marcus Caelius, tribune of the commons, for the cheapness at which not only his speech but also his silence could be bought, says: <quote>For a crust of bread he can be hired either to keep silence or to speak.</quote> Most deservedly too does Homer call Thersites alone of all the Greeks <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)metroeph/s,</foreign> <quote>of measureless speech,</quote> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)krito/muqos,</foreign>

for what else does <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)kolw/a</foreign> (<quote>he chattered</quote> ) mean? There is also a line of Eupolis most pointedly aimed at men of that kind:

<note>Fr. 95, Koch.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>In chatter excellent, unable quite to speak,</l></quote>  and our countryman Sallust, wishing to imitate this, writes:

<note><hi rend="italic">Hist.</hi> iv. 43, Maur.</note>
<quote>Talkative rather than eloquent.</quote> It is for the same reason that Hesiod, wisest of poets, says

<note><hi rend="italic">Works and Days,</hi> 719.</note>
that the tongue should not be vulgarly exposed but hidden like a treasure, and that it is exhibited with best effect when it is modest, restrained and musical. His own words are:  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>The greatest of man's treasures is the tongue,</l> <l>Which wins most favour when it spares its words</l> <l part="I">And measured is of movement.</l></quote>  The following verse of Epicharmus is also to the point:

<note>Fr. 272, Kaib.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Thou art not skilled in speech, yet silence cannot keep,</l></quote>  and it is from this line surely that the saying arose: <quote>Who, though he could not speak, could not be silent.</quote></p>  <pb n="v1.p.79"/>

<p>I once heard Favorinus say that the familiar lines of Euripides:

<note><hi rend="italic">Bacch.</hi> 386.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Of unrestrained mouth</l> <l>And of lawless folly</l> <l>Is disaster the end,</l></quote>  ought not to be understood as directed only at those who spoke impiously or lawlessly, but might even with special propriety be used also of men who prate foolishly and immoderately, whose tongues are so extravagant and unbridled that they ceaselessly flow and seethe with the foulest dregs of language, the sort of persons to whom the Greeks apply the highly significant term <foreign xml:lang="grc">kata/glwssoi,</foreign> or <quote>given to talk.</quote> I learned from a friend of his, a man of learning, that the famous grammarian Valerius Probus, shortly before his death, began to read Sallust's well-known saying,

<note><hi rend="italic">Cat.</hi> v. 4.</note>
<quote>a certain amount of eloquence but little discretion,</quote> as <quote>abundant talkativeness, too little discretion,</quote> and that he insisted that Sallust left it in that form, since the word <hi rend="italic">loquentia</hi> was very characteristic of Sallust, an innovator in diction,

<note>It is true that Sallust was fond of new words, but the best MSS. of Sallust are unanimous for <hi rend="italic">eloquentiae.</hi> Besides this passage of Gellius, L. and S. cite <hi rend="italic">loquentia</hi> only in Plin. <hi rend="italic">Epist.</hi> v. 20. 5, <hi rend="italic">Iulius Cordus</hi> . . . <hi rend="italic">solet dicere aliud esse eloquentiam, aliud loquentiam.</hi></note>
while <hi rend="italic">eloquentia</hi> was not at all consistent with lack of discretion.</p>

<p>Finally, loquacity of this kind and a disorderly mass of empty grandiloquence is scored with striking epithets by Aristophanes, wittiest of poets, in the following lines:

<note>Varro's Menippean Satires, in 150 books, based to some extent on the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Speudoge/loion</foreign> of Menippus, a Cynic philosopher of the third century B.C., treated in a mixture of prose and verse a great variety of moral and serious topics in a playful and sometimes jocose manner. For other titles see Index under (M.) Terentius Varro, and for the fragments, Bücheler's <hi rend="italic">Petronius,</hi> 3d. ed., Berlin, 1882, pp. 161 ff.</note>
which he entitled <hi rend="italic">On the Duty of a Husband:</hi>

<note>Fr 83, Bücheler.</note>
<quote>A wife's faults must be either put down or put up with. He who puts down her faults, makes his wife more agreeable; he who puts up with them, improves himself.</quote> Varro contrasted the two words <hi rend="italic">tollere</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ferre</hi> very cleverly,

<note>For a similar play on two meanings of <hi rend="italic">tollere,</hi> cf. Suet. <hi rend="italic">Aug.</hi> xii.</note>
to be sure,  <pb n="v1.p.87"/>  but he obviously uses <hi rend="italic">tollere</hi> in the sense of <quote>correct.</quote> It is evident too that Varro thought that if a fault of that kind in a wife cannot be corrected, it should be tolerated, in so far of course as a man may endure it honourably; for faults are less serious than crimes.</p></div>

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>IN the fourteenth book of his <hi rend="italic">Divine Antiquities</hi>

<note>Fr. 99, Agahd. In the <hi rend="italic">lemma,</hi> or chapter heading, Varro's statement is wrongly referred to the <hi rend="italic">Antiquities of Man,</hi> the other division of his great work <hi rend="italic">Antiquitatum</hi> <hi rend="italic">Libri XLI,</hi> treating the political and religious institutions of the Romans. Only scanty fragments have survived.</note>
Marcus Varro shows that Lucius Aelius, the most learned Roman of his time, went astray and followed a false etymological principle in separating an old Greek word which had been taken over into the Roman language into two Latin words, just as if it were of Latin origin.</p>

<p>I quote Varro's own words on the subject: <quote>In this regard our countryman Lucius Aelius, the most gifted man of letters within my memory, was sometimes misled. For he gave false derivations of several early Greek words, under the impression that they were native to our tongue. We do not use the word <hi rend="italic">lepus</hi> ('hare') because the animal is <hi rend="italic">levipes</hi> ('light-footed'), as he asserts, but because it is an old Greek word. Many of the early words of that people are unfamiliar, because to-day the Greeks use other words in their place; and it may not be generally known that among these are <hi rend="italic">Graecus,</hi> for which they now use <foreign xml:lang="grc">(/Ellhn,</foreign> <hi rend="italic">puteus</hi> ('well') which  <pb n="v1.p.89"/>  they call <foreign xml:lang="grc">fre/ar,</foreign> and <hi rend="italic">lepus,</hi> which they call <foreign xml:lang="grc">lagwo/s.</foreign> But as to this, far from disparaging Aelius' ability, I commend his diligence; for it is good fortune that brings success, endeavour that deserves praise.</quote></p>

<p>Tis is what Varro wrote in the first part of his book, with great skill in the explanation of words, with wide knowledge of the usage of both languages, and marked kindliness towards Aelius himself. But in the latter part of the same book he says that <hi rend="italic">fur</hi> is so called because the early Romans used <hi rend="italic">furvus for</hi> <hi rend="italic">ater</hi> (<quote>black</quote> ), and thieves steal most easily in the night, which is black. Is it not clear that Varro made the same mistake about <hi rend="italic">fur</hi> that Aelius did about <hi rend="italic">lepus.</hi> For what the Greeks now call <foreign xml:lang="grc">kle/pths,</foreign> or <quote>thief,</quote> in the earlier Greek language was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">fw/r.</foreign> Hence, owing to the similarity in sound, he who in Greek is <foreign xml:lang="grc">fw/r,</foreign> in Latin is <hi rend="italic">fur.</hi> But whether that fact escaped Varro's memory at the time, or on the other hand he thought that <hi rend="italic">fur</hi> was more appropriately and consistently named from <hi rend="italic">furvus,</hi> that is, <quote>black,</quote> as to that question it is not for me to pass judgment on a man of such surpassing learning.</p></div>

<p>The story of king Tarquin the Proud and the Sibylline Books.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>IN ancient annals we find this tradition about the Sibylline Books. An old woman, a perfect stranger, came to king Tarquin the Proud, bringing nine books; she declared that they were oracles of the gods and that she wished to sell them. Tarquin inquired the price; the woman demanded an <pb n="v1.p.91"/> immense and exorbitant sum: the king laughed her to scorn, believing her to be in her dotage. Then she placed a lighted brazier before him, burned three of the books to ashes, and asked whether he would buy the remaining six at the same price. But at this Tarquin laughed all the more and said that there was now no doubt that the old woman was crazy. Upon that the woman at once burned up three more books and again calmly made the same request, that he would buy the remaining three at the original figure. Tarquin now became serious and more thoughtful, and realising that such persistence and confidence were not to be treated lightly, he bought the three books that were left at as high a price as had been asked for all nine. Now it is a fact that after then leaving Tarquin, that woman was never seen again anywhere. The three books were deposited in a shrine

<note>In the temple of Jupiter on the Capitol. Augustus transferred them to the temple of Apollo on the Palatine; see Suet. <hi rend="italic">Aug.</hi> xxxi. 1.</note>
and called <quote>Sibylline</quote> ;

<note>Because the old woman was regarded as a Sibyl. Although the books came to Tarquin by way of Cumae, the origin of the Sibylline books was probably Asia Minor. There were several Sibyls (Varro enumerates ten), of whom the Erythraean, from whom the books apparently came, was the most important; see Marquardt, <hi rend="italic">Stautsverew.</hi> 1112. 350 ff.</note>

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>OF the figures which the geometers call <foreign xml:lang="grc">sxh/mata</foreign> there are two kinds, <quote>plane</quote> and <quote>solid.</quote> These the Greeks themselves call respectively <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)pi/pedos</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">stereo/s.</foreign> A <quote>plane</quote> figure is one that has all its lines in two dimensions only, breadth and length; for  <pb n="v1.p.93"/>  example, triangles and squares, which are drawn on a flat surface without height. We have a <quote>solid</quote> figure, when its several lines do not produce merely length and breadth in a plane, but are raised so as to produce height also; such are in general the triangular columns which they call <quote>pyramids,</quote> or those which are bounded on all sides by squares, such as the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ku/boi,</foreign>

<p>Pythagoras declared that the cube of the number three controls the course of the moon, since the moon passes through its orbit in twenty-seven days, and the <hi rend="italic">ternio,</hi> or <quote>triad,</quote> which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">tria/s,</foreign> when cubed makes twenty-seven.</p>

<p>Furthermore, our geometers apply the term <hi rend="italic">linea,</hi> or <quote>line,</quote> to what the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">grammh/.</foreign> This is defined by Marcus Varro as follows:

<note>But the bitterness of the sensation will distort the testers' soured mouths.</note>
</l></quote>  and this reading has commended itself, not to Hyginus alone, but also to some other learned men, because it seems absurd to say <quote>the taste will distort with its bitter sensation.</quote> <quote>Since,</quote> they say, <quote>taste itself is a sensation, it cannot have another sensation in itself, but it is exactly as if one should say, 'the sensation will distort with a bitter sensation.'</quote> Moreover, when I had read Hyginus' note to Favorinus, and the strangeness and harshness of the phrase <quote>sensu torquebit amaro</quote> at once had displeased him,  <pb n="v1.p.97"/>  he said with a laugh: <quote>I am ready to swear by Jupiter and the stone,

<note>This much discussed oath is best taken as equivalent to <hi rend="italic">per lovem et lapidem;</hi> see Fowler, <hi rend="italic">Roman Festivals,</hi> p. 231; Nettleship, <hi rend="italic">Essays,</hi> p. 35, and others.

which is considered the most sacred of oaths, that Virgil never wrote that, but I believe that Hyginus is right. For Virgil was not the first to coin that word arbitrarily, but he found it in the poems of Lucretius and made use of it, not disdaining to follow the authority of a poet who excelled in talent and power of expression.</quote> The passage, from the fourth book of Lucretius, reads as follows:

<p>Whether it is correct Latin for counsel for the defence to say <hi rend="italic">superesse se,</hi> <quote>that he is appearing for</quote> those whom he is defending; and the proper meaning of <hi rend="italic">superesse.</hi></p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>AN incorrect and improper meaning of a word has been established by long usage, in that we use the expression <hi rend="italic">hic illi superest</hi> when we wish to say that anyone appears as another's advocate and pleads his cause. And this is not merely the language of the streets and of the common people, but is used in the forum, the comitium and the courts. Those, however, who have spoken language undefiled have  <pb n="v1.p.99"/>  for the most part used <hi rend="italic">superesse</hi> in the sense of <quote>to overflow, be superfluous, or exceed the required amount.</quote> Thus Marcus Varro, in the satire entitled <quote><hi rend="italic">You know not what evening may bring,</hi></quote>

<note>Fr. 340, Bücheler.</note>
uses <hi rend="italic">superfuisse</hi> in the sense of having exceeded the amount proper for the occasion. These are his words: <quote>Not everything should be read at a dinner party, but preferably such works as are at the same time improving and diverting, so that this feature of the entertainment also may seem not to have been neglected, rather than overdone.</quote></p>

<p>I remember happening to be present in the court of a praetor who was a man of learning, and that on that occasion an advocate of some repute pleaded in such fashion that he wandered from the subject and did not touch upon the point at issue. Thereupon the praetor said to the man whose case was before him: <quote>You have no counsel.</quote> And when the pleader protested, saying <quote>I am present (<hi rend="italic">supersum</hi>) for the honourable gentleman,</quote> the praetor wittily retorted: <quote>You surely present too much, but you do not represent your client.</quote>

<note>It is difficult to reproduce the word-play on <hi rend="italic">superesse,</hi> <quote>be present for</quote> and <quote>be superfluous.</quote> There is a pun also on <hi rend="italic">adesse,</hi> <quote>be present</quote> and <quote>help, assist.</quote></note>
</p>

<p>Marcus Cicero, too, in his book entitled <hi rend="italic">On Reducing the Civil Law to a System</hi>

<note>Fr. 2, p. 980, Orelli<hi rend="sup">2</hi>; Fr. 1, Huschke, and Bremer.</note>
wrote these words: <quote>Indeed Quintus Aelius Tubero did not fall short of his predecessors in knowledge of the law, in learning he even outstripped them.</quote> In this passage <hi rend="italic">superfuit</hi> seems to mean <quote>he went beyond, surpassed and excelled his predecessors in his learning, which, however, was excessive and overabundant</quote> ;

<note>It was superfluous in being more than he needed for the practice of his profession.</note>
for Tubero was thoroughly versed in Stoic dialectics.  <pb n="v1.p.101"/>  Cicero's use of the word in the second book

<note>An error of Gellius; the reference is iii. 32.</note>
of the <hi rend="italic">Republic</hi> also deserves attention. This is the passage in question: <quote>I should not object, Laelius, if I did not think that these friends wished, and if I myself did not desire, that you should take some part in this discussion of ours, especially since you yourself said yesterday that you would give us even more than enough (<hi rend="italic">te superfuturum</hi>). But that indeed is impossible: we all ask you not to give us less than enough (<hi rend="italic">ne desis</hi>).</quote></p>

<p>Now Julius Paulus, the most learned man within my recollection, used to say witll keenness and understanding that <hi rend="italic">superesse</hi> and its Greek equivalent had more than one meaning: for he declared that the Greeks used <foreign xml:lang="grc">perisso/n</foreign> both ways, either of what was superfluous and unnecessary or of what was too abundant, overflowing and excessive; that in the same way our earlier writers also employed <hi rend="italic">superesse</hi> sometimes of what was superfluous, idle and not wholly necessary, a sense which we have just cited from Varro, and sometimes, as in Cicero, of that which indeed surpassed other things in copiousness and plentifulness, yet was immoderate and too extensive, and gushed forth more abundantly than was sufficient. Therefore one who says <hi rend="italic">superesse se</hi> with reference to a man whom he is defending tries to convey none of these meanings, but uses <hi rend="italic">superesse</hi> in a sense that is unknown and not in use. And he will not be able to appeal even to the authority of Virgil, who in his <hi rend="italic">Georgics</hi> wrote as follows:

<note>iii. 10.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>I will be first to bear, so but my life still last (<hi rend="italic">supersit</hi>),</l> <l part="I">Home to my native land . . .</l></quote>  <pb n="v1.p.103"/>  For in this place Virgil seems to have used that word somewhat irregularly in giving <hi rend="italic">supersit</hi> the sense of <quote>be present for a longer or more extended period,</quote> but on the contrary his use of the word in the following line is more nearly the accepted one:

<note>iii. 126.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l part="F">They cut him tender grass,</l> <l>Give corn and much fresh water, that his strength</l> <l>Be more than equal to (<hi rend="italic">superesse</hi>) the pleasing toil.</l></quote>  for here <hi rend="italic">superesse</hi> means to be more than equal to the task and not to be crushed by it.</p>

<p>I also used to raise the question whether the ancients used <hi rend="italic">superesse</hi> in the sense of <quote>to be left and be lacking for the completion of an act.</quote> For to express that idea Sallust says, not <hi rend="italic">superesse,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">superare.</hi> These are his words in the <hi rend="italic">Jugurtha:</hi>

<note>lxx. 2.</note>
<quote>This man was in the habit of exercising a command independently of the king, and of attending to all business which had been left undone (<hi rend="italic">superaverant</hi>) by Jugurtha when he was weary or engaged in more important affairs.</quote> But we find in the third book of Ennius' <hi rend="italic">Annals:</hi>

<note>v. 158, Vahlen<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Then he declares one task's left over (<hi rend="italic">super esse</hi>) for him,</l></quote>  that is, is left and remains undone; but there <hi rend="italic">superesse</hi> must be divided and read as if it were not one part of speech, but two, as in fact it is. Cicero, however, in his second <hi rend="italic">Oration against Antony</hi>

<note><hi rend="italic">Phil.</hi> ii. 71, cum praescrtim belli pars tanta restaret.</note>
expresses <quote>what is left</quote> by <hi rend="italic">restare,</hi> not by <hi rend="italic">superesse.</hi></p>

<p>Besides these uses we find <hi rend="italic">superesse</hi> with the meaning <quote>survive.</quote> For it is so employed in the book of letters of Marcus Cicero to Lucius Plancus,

<note>The tenth book of the <hi rend="italic">Epist. ad Fam.</hi> contains numerous letters of Cicero to Plancus and of Plancus to Cicero.</note>
as  <pb n="v1.p.105"/>  well as in a letter of Marcus Asinius Pollio to Cicero,

<note><hi rend="italic">Ad Fam.</hi> x. 33.5. It should be Gaius Asinius Pollio.</note>
as follows: <quote>For I wish neither to fail the commonwealth nor to survive it (<hi rend="italic">superesse</hi>),</quote> meaning that if the commonwealth should be destroyed and perish, he does not wish to live. Again in the <hi rend="italic">Asinaria</hi> of Plautus that same force is still more evident in these, the first verses of that comedy:

<note>v. 16.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>As you would hope to have your only son</l> <l>Survive (<hi rend="italic">superesse</hi>) you and be ever sound and hale.</l></quote></p>

<p>Thus we have to avoid, not merely an improper use of the word, but also the evil omene, in case an older man, acting as advocate for a youth, should say that he <quote>survives</quote> him.</p></div>

<p>Who Papirius Praetextatus was; the reason for that surname; and the whole of the entertaining story about that same Papirius.</p><!--</argument>-->

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THE story of Papirius Praetextatus was told and committed to writing in the speech which Marcus Cato made <hi rend="italic">To the soldiers against Galba,</hi>

<note>xxxix, Jordan.</note>
with great charm, brilliance and elegance of diction. I should have included Cato's own words in this very commentary, if I had had access to the book at the time when I dictated this extract. But if you would like to hear the bare tale, without the noble and dignified language, the incident was about as follows: It was formerly the custom at Rome for senators to enter the House with their sons under age.

<note>The <hi rend="italic">toga praetexta,</hi> with a purple border, was worn by senators and also by boys of free birth until they assumed the <hi rend="italic">toga virlis.</hi></note>
In those days, when a matter of considerable importance  <pb n="v1.p.107"/>  had been discussed and was postponed to the following day, it was voted that no one should mention the subject of the debate until the matter was decided. The mother of the young Papirius, who had been in the House with his father, asked her son what the Fathers had taken up in the senate. The boy replied that it was a secret and that he could not tell. The woman became all the more eager to hear about it; the secrecy of the matter and the boy's silence piqued her curiosity; she therefore questioned him more pressingly and urgently. Then the boy, because of his mother's insistence, resorted to a witty and amusing falsehood. He said that the senate had discussed the question whether it seemed more expedient, and to the advantage of the State, for one man to have two wives or one woman to have two husbands. On hearing this, she is panic-stricken, rushes excitedly from the house, and carries the news to the other matrons. Next day a crowd of matrons came to the senate, imploring with tears and entreaties that one woman might have two husbands rather than one man two wives. The senators, as they entered the House, were wondering at this strange madness of the women and the meaning of such a demand, when young Papirius, stepping forward to the middle of the House, told in detail what his mother had insisted on hearing, what he himself had said to her, in fact, the whole story exactly as it had happened. The senate paid homage to the boy's cleverness and loyalty, but voted that thereafter boys should not enter the House with their fathers, save only this Papirius; and the boy was henceforth honoured with the  <pb n="v1.p.109"/>  surname Praetextatus, because of his discretion in keeping silent and in speaking, while he was still young enough to wear the purple-bordered gown.</p></div>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THERE are three epitaphs of famous poets, Gnaeus Naevius, Plautus and Marcus Pacuvius, composed by themselves and left to be inscribed upon their tombs, which I have thought ought to be included among these notes, because of their distinction and charm.</p>

<p>The epitaph of Naevius, although full of Campanian

<note>This has been regarded as evidence that Naevius was a native of Campania; but Campanian arrogance was proverbial.</note>
arrogance, might have been regarded as a just estimate, if he had not written it himself:

<note>The authorship of all these epitaphs is questioned: Gudeman thought they came from Varro's <hi rend="italic">Imagines;</hi> see <hi rend="italic">Trans. Amer Phil. Assoc.</hi> xxv, 150 ff.; cf p. 296. 3, Bährens.</note>

<p>We should be inclined to doubt whether the epitaph of Plautus was really by his own hand, if it had not been quoted by Marcus Varro in the first book of his work <hi rend="italic">On Poets:</hi>

defines <hi rend="italic">indutiae</hi> (a truce) in two ways. <quote>A truce,</quote> he says, <quote>is peace for a few days in camp;</quote> and again in another place, <quote>A truce is a holiday in war.</quote> But each of these definitions seems to be wittily and happily concise rather than clear or satisfactory. For a truce is not a peace—since war continues, although fighting ceases—nor is it restricted to a camp or to a few days only. For what are we to say if a truce is made for some months, and the  <pb n="v1.p.113"/>  troops withdraw from camp into the towns? Have we not then also a truce? Again, if a truce is to be defined as only lasting for a few days, what are we to say of the fact, recorded by Quadrigarius in the first book of his <hi rend="italic">Annals,</hi> that Gaius Pontius the Samnite asked the Roman dictator for a truce of six hours?

<note>Fr. 21, Peter.</note>
The definition <quote>a holiday in war,</quote> too, is rather happy than clear or precise.</p>

<p>Now the Greeks, more significantly and more pointedly, have called such an agreement to cease from fighting <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)kexeiri/a,</foreign> or <quote>a staying of hands,</quote> substituting for one letter of harsher sound a smoother one.

<note>That is, <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)kexeiri/a</foreign> instead of an original <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)xexeiri/a,</foreign> from <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)/xw</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">xei/r,</foreign> the first <foreign xml:lang="grc">x</foreign>, an aspirate, being reduced to the smooth mute <foreign xml:lang="grc">k,</foreign> since in Greek an aspirate may not begin two successive syllables.</note>
For since there is no fighting at such a time and their hands are withheld, they called it <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)kexeiri/a.</foreign> But it surely was not Varro's task to define a truce too scrupulously, and to observe all the laws and canons of definition; for he thought it sufficient to give an explanation of the kind which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">tu/poi</foreign> (<quote>typical</quote> ) and <foreign xml:lang="grc">u(pografai/</foreign> (<quote><hi rend="italic">outline</hi></quote> ), rather than <foreign xml:lang="grc">o(rismoi/</foreign> (<quote>exact definition</quote> ).</p>

<p>I have for a long time been inquiring into the derivation of <hi rend="italic">indutiae,</hi> but of the many explanations which I have either heard or read this which I am going to mention seems most reasonable. I believe that <hi rend="italic">indutiae</hi> is made up of <hi rend="italic">inde uti iam</hi> (<quote>that from then on</quote> ). The stipulation of a truce is to this effect, that there shall be no fighting and no trouble up to a fixed time, but that after that time all the laws of war shall again be in force. Therefore, since a definite date is set and an agreement is  <pb n="v1.p.115"/>  made that before that date there shall be no fighting but when that time comes, <quote>that from then on,</quote> fighting shall be resumed: by uniting (as it were) and combining those words which I have mentioned the term <hi rend="italic">indutiae</hi> is formed.

<note>The correct derivation seems to be from <hi rend="italic">*in-du-tus</hi> (cf. <hi rend="italic">duellum</hi> for <hi rend="italic">bellum</hi>), <quote>not in a state of war.</quote></note>
</p>

<p>But Aurelius Opilius, in the first book of his work entitled <hi rend="italic">The Muses,</hi> says:

<note>p. 88, Fun.</note>
<quote>It is called a truce when enemies pass back and forth from one side to another safely and without strife; from this the name seems to be formed, as if it were <hi rend="italic">initiae,</hi>

<note>This derivation is clearer from the older form <hi rend="italic">induitiae;</hi> see the critical note.</note>
that is, an approach and entrance.</quote> I have not omitted this note of Aurelius, for fear that it might appear to some rival of these <hi rend="italic">Nights</hi> a more elegant etymology, merely because he thought that it had escaped my notice when I was investigating the origin of the word.</p></div>

<p>The answer of the philosopher Taurus, when I asked him whether a wise man ever got angry.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I ONCE asked Taurus in his lecture-room whether a wise man got angry. For after his daily discourses he often gave everyone the opportunity of asking whatever questions he wished. On this occasion he first discussed the disease or passion of anger seriously and at length, setting forth what is to be fund in the books of the ancients and in his own commentaries; then, turning to me who had asked  <pb n="v1.p.117"/>  the question, he said: <quote>This is what I think about getting angry, but it will not be out of place for you to hear also the opinion of my master Plutarch, a man of great learning and wisdom. Plutarch,</quote> said he, <quote>once gave orders that one of his slaves, a worthless and insolent fellow, but one whose ears had been filled with the teachings and arguments of philosophy, should be stripped of his tunic for some offence or other and flogged. They had begun to beat him, and the slave kept protesting that he did not deserve the flogging; that he was guilty of no wrong, no crime. Finally, while the lashing still went on, he began to shout, no longer uttering complaints or shrieks and groans, but serious reproaches. Plutarch's conduct, he said, was unworthy of a philosopher; to be angry was shameful: his master had often descanted on the evil of anger and had even written an excellent treatise <foreign xml:lang="grc">Peri\ )Aorghsi/as</foreign>;

<note><hi rend="italic">On Freedom from Anger;</hi> the work has not survived.</note>
it was in no way consistent with all that was written in that book that its author should fall into a fit of violent rage and punish his slave with many stripes. Then Plutarch calmly and mildly made answer: ' What makes you think, scoundrel, that I am now angry with you. Is it from my expression, my voice, my colour, or even my words, that you believe me to be in the grasp of anger? In my opinion my eyes are not fierce, my expression is not disturbed, I am neither shouting madly nor foaming at the mouth and getting red in the face; I am saying nothing to cause me shame or regret; I am not trembling at all from anger or making violent gestures. For all these actions, if you did but know it, are the usual signs of angry passions.' And with these words, turning to the man who was plying the lash,  <pb n="v1.p.119"/>  he said: 'In the meantime, while this fellow and I are arguing, do you keep at it.'</quote></p>

<p>Now the sum and substance of Taurus' whole disquisition was this: he did not believe that <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)orghsi/a</foreign> or <quote>freedom from anger,</quote> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)nalghsi/a,</foreign> or <quote>lack of sensibility,</quote> were identical; but that a mind not prone to anger was one thing, a spirit <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)na/lghtos</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)nai/sqhtos,</foreign> that is, callous and unfeeling, quite another. For as of all the rest of the emotions which the Latin philosophers call <hi rend="italic">affects</hi> or <hi rend="italic">affectiones,</hi> and the Greeks <foreign xml:lang="grc">pa/qh,</foreign> so of the one which, when it becomes a cruel desire for vengeance, is called <quote>anger,</quote> he did not recommend as expedient a total lack, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ste/rhsis</foreign> as the Greeks say, but a moderate amount, which they call <foreign xml:lang="grc">metrio/ths.</foreign></p>  </div>

<p>How Socrates used to train himself in physical endurance; and of the temperate habits of that philosopher.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Among voluntary tasks and exercises for strengthening his body for any chance demands upon its endurance we are told that Socrates habitually practised this one: he would stand, so the story goes, in one fixed position, all day and all night, from early dawn until the next sunrise, open-eyed, motionless, in his very tracks and with face and eyes riveted to the same spot in deep meditation, as if his mind and soul had been, as it were, withdrawn from his body. When Favorinus in his discussion of the man's fortitude and his many other virtues had reached this point, he said: <quote>He often stood from sun to sun, more rigid than the tree trunks.</quote>

<note>Fr. 66. Marres.</note>
</p>

<p>His temperance also is said to have been so great, that he lived almost the whole period of his life with health unimpaired. Even amid the havoc of that plague which, at the beginning of the Peloponnesian war, devastated Athens with a deadly species of disease, by temperate and abstemious habits he is said to have avoided the ill-effects of indulgence and retained his physical vigour so completely, that he was not at all affected by the calamity common to all.</p>

<p>What rules of courtesy should be observed by fathers and sons in taking their places at able, keeping their seats, and similar matters at home and elsewhere, when the sons are magistrates and the fathers private citizens; and a discourse of the philosopher Taurus on this subject, with an illustration taken from Roman history.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THE governor of the province of Crete, a man of senatorial rank, had come to Athens for the purpose of visiting and becoming acquainted with the philosopher Taurus, and in company with this same governor was his father. Taurus, having just dismissed his pupils, was sitting before the door of his room, and we stood by his side conversing with him. In came the governor of the province and with him his father. Taurus arose quietly, and after salutations had been exchanged, sat down again. Presently the single chair that was at hand was brought and placed near them, while others were being fetched. Taurus invited the governor's father to be seated; to which he replied: <quote>Rather let this man take the seat, since he is a magistrate of the Roman people.</quote> <quote>Without prejudicing the case,</quote> said Taurus, <quote>do you meanwhile sit down, while we look into the matter and inquire whether it is more proper for you, who are the father, to sit, or your son, who is a magistrate.</quote> And when the father had seated himself, and another chair had been placed near by for his son also, Taurus discussed the question with what, by the gods! was a most excellent valuation of honours and duties.</p>

<p>The substance of the discussions was this: In public places, functions and acts the rights of fathers,  <pb n="v1.p.127"/>  compared with tile authority of sons who are magistrates, give way somewhat and are eclipsed; but when they are sitting together unofficially in the intimacy of home life, or walking about, or even reclining at a dinner-party of intimate friends, then the official distinctions between a son who is a magistrate and a father who is a private citizen are at an end, while those that are natural and inherent come into play. <quote>Now, your visit to me,</quote> said he, <quote>our present conversation, and this discussion of duties are private actions. Therefore enjoy the same priority of honours at my house which it is proper for you to enjoy in your own home as the older man.</quote></p>

<p>These remarks and others to the same purport were made by Taurus at once seriously and pleasantly. Moreover, it has seemed not out of place to add what I have read in Claudius about the etiquette of father and son under such circumstances. I therefore quote Quadrigarius' actual words, transcribed from the sixth book of his <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi>

<note>Fr. 57. Peter.</note>
"The consuls then elected were Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus for the second time and Quintus Fabius Maximus, son of the Maximus who had been consul the year before. The father, at the time proconsul, mounted upon a horse met his son the consul, and because lie was his father, would not dismount, nor did the lictors, who knew that the two men lived in the most perfect harmony, presume to order him to do so. As the father drew near, the consul said: <quote>What next?</quote> The lictor in attendance quickly understood and ordered Maximus the proconsul to dismount. Fabius obeyed the order and warmly commended his son for asserting the authority which he had as the gift of the people."</p>

<!--<argument>-->

<p>For what reason our forefathers inserted the aspirate <hi rend="italic">h</hi> in certain verbs and nouns.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THE letter <hi rend="italic">h</hi> (or perhaps it should be called a breathing rather than a letter) was added by our forefathers to give strength and vigour to the pronunciation of many words, in order that they might have a fresher and livelier sound; and this they seem to have done from their devotion to the Attic language, and under its influence. It is well known that the people of Attica, contrary to the usage of the other Greek races, pronounced <foreign xml:lang="grc">i(xqu/s</foreign> (fish), <foreign xml:lang="grc">i(/ppos</foreign> (horse), and many other words besides, with a rough breathing on the first letter.

<note>I find no authority for this. Brugmann in Müller's <hi rend="italic">Handbuch,</hi> II, 61 (end) cites <foreign xml:lang="grc">i(/ppos</foreign> as a word which originally had a smooth breathing and acquired the rough from the combination <foreign xml:lang="grc">o( i)/ppos</foreign>. Since the <foreign xml:lang="grc">i</foreign> in <foreign xml:lang="grc">i)xqu/s</foreign> is prosthetic, <foreign xml:lang="grc">i(xqu/s,</foreign> if it existed must have had the same origin, but Brugmann does not cite it. See also <hi rend="italic">Indoger. Forsch.</hi> xxii, p. 197 (gives some additional information).</note>
In the same way our ancestors said <hi rend="italic">lachrumae (tears), sepulchrum</hi> (burial-place), <hi rend="italic">ahenum</hi> (of bronze), <hi rend="italic">vehemens</hi> (violent), <hi rend="italic">incohare</hi> (begin), <hi rend="italic">helluari</hi> (gormandize), <hi rend="italic">hallucinari</hi> (dream), <hi rend="italic">honera</hi> (burdens), <hi rend="italic">honustum</hi> (burdened). For in all these words there seems to be no reason for that letter, or breathing, except to increase the force and vigour of the sound by adding certain sinews, so to speak.</p>

<p>But apropos of the inclusion of <hi rend="italic">ahenum</hi> among my examples, I recall that Fidus Optatus, a grammarian of considerable repute in Rome, showed me a remarkably old copy of the second book of the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid,</hi> bought in the Sigillaria

<note>A street or quarter in Rome where the little images were sold which were given as presents at the festival of the Sigillaria; this was on Dec. 21 and 22, an extension of the Saturnalia, although not a religious holiday. The <hi rend="italic">aureus</hi> was the standard gold coin of the Romans, of the value of 100 sesterces; its weight varied at different periods.</note>
for twenty pieces of gold, which was believed to have belonged to  <pb n="v1.p.131"/>  Virgil himself. In that book, although the following two lines were written thus:

<note>ii. 469 f. </note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Before the entrance-court, hard by the gate,</l> <l>With sheen of brazen (<hi rend="italic">aena</hi>) arms proud Pyrrhus gleams,</l></quote>  we observed that the letter <hi rend="italic">h</hi> had been added above the line, changing <hi rend="italic">aena</hi> to <hi rend="italic">ahena.</hi> So too in the best manuscripts we find this verse of Virgil's written as follows:

<!--<argument>-->

<p>The reason given by Gavius Bassus for calling a certain kind of judicial inquiry <hi rend="italic">divitiatio;</hi> and the explanation that others have given of the same term.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>WHEN inquiry is made about the choice of a prosecutor, and judgment is rendered on the question to which of two or more persons the prosecution of a defendant, or a share in the prosecution, is to be entrusted, this process and examination by jurors is called <hi rend="italic">divinatio.</hi>

<note>Cf. Cicero's <hi rend="italic">Divinatio in Caecilium,</hi> preliminary to the prosecution of Verres.</note>
The reason for the use of this term is a matter of frequent inquiry.</p>

<p>Gavius Bassus, in the third book of his work <hi rend="italic">On the Origin of Terms,</hi> says:

<note>Fr. I. Fun.</note>
<quote>This kind of trial is called <hi rend="italic">divinatio</hi> because the juror ought in a sense to divine what verdict it is proper for him to give.</quote> The explanation offered in these words of Gavius Bassus is far from complete, or rather, it is inadequate and meagre. But at least he seems to be trying to show that <hi rend="italic">divinatio</hi> is used because in  <pb n="v1.p.133"/>  other trials it is the habit of the juror to be influenced by what he has heard and by what has been shown by evidence or by witnesses; but in this instance, when a prosecutor is to be selected, the considerations which can influence a juror are very few and slight, and therefore he must, so to speak, <quote>divine</quote> what man is the better fitted to make the accusation.</p>

<p>Thus Bassus. But some others think that the <hi rend="italic">divinatio</hi> is so called because, while prosecutor and defendant are two things that are, as it were, related and connected, so that neither can exist without the other, yet in this form of trial, while there is already a defendant, there is as yet no prosecutor, and therefore the factor which is still lacking and unknown—namely, what man is to be the prosecutor—must be supplied by divination.</p></div>

<!--<argument>-->

<p>On some words which Virgil is asserted to have used carelessly and negligently; and the answer to be made to those who bring this false charge.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>SOME grammarians of an earlier time, men by no means without learning and repute, who wrote <pb n="v1.p.135"/> commentaries on Virgil, and among them Annaeus Cornutus, criticize the poet's use of a word in the following verses

<note><hi rend="italic">Eel.</hi> vi. 75. ff.</note>
as careless and negligent:  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>That, her white waist with howling monsters girt,</l> <l>Dread Scylla knocked about (<hi rend="italic">vexasse</hi>) Ulysses' ships</l> <l>Amid the swirling depths, and, piteous sight!</l> <l>The trembling sailors with her sea-dogs rent.</l></quote>  They think, namely, that <hi rend="italic">vexasse</hi> is a weak word, indicating a slight and trivial annoyance, and not adapted to such a horror as the sudden seizing and rending of human beings by a ruthless monster.</p>

<p>They also criticize another word in the following:

<note><hi rend="italic">Georg.</hi> iii. 4</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l part="F">Who has not heard</l> <l>Of king Eurystheus' pitiless commands</l> <l>And altars of Busiris, the unpraised (<hi rend="italic">inlaudati</hi>)?</l></quote>  <hi rend="italic">Inlaudati,</hi> they say, is not at all a suitable world, but is quite inadequate to express abhorrence of a wretch who, because he used to sacrifice guests from all over the world, was not merely <quote>undeserving of praise,</quote> but rather deserving of the abhorrence and execration of the whole human race.</p>

<p>They have criticized still another word in the verse:

<note><hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> x. 314.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Through tunic rough (<hi rend="italic">squalentem</hi>) with gold the sword drank from his pierced side,</l></quote>  on the ground that it is out of place to say <hi rend="italic">auro squalentem,</hi> since the filth of squalor is quite opposed to the brilliance and splendour of gold.</p>

<p>Now as to the word <hi rend="italic">vexasse,</hi> I believe the following answer may be made: <hi rend="italic">vexasse</hi> is an intensive verb, and is obviously derived from <hi rend="italic">ve-</hi>  <pb n="v1.p.137"/>  <hi rend="italic">here,</hi> in which there is already some notion of compulsion by another; for a man who is carried is not his own master. But <hi rend="italic">vexare,</hi> which is derived from <hi rend="italic">vehere,</hi> unquestionably implies greater force and impulse. For <hi rend="italic">vexare</hi> is properly used of one who is seized and carried away, and dragged about hither and yon; just as <hi rend="italic">taxare</hi> denotes more forcible and repeated action than <hi rend="italic">tangere,</hi> from which it is undoubtedly derived; and <hi rend="italic">iactare</hi> a much fuller and more vigorous action than <hi rend="italic">iacere,</hi> from which it comes; and <hi rend="italic">quassare</hi> something severer and more violent than <hi rend="italic">quatere.</hi> Therefore, merely because <hi rend="italic">vexare</hi> is commonly used of the annoyance of smoke or wind or dust is no reason why the original force and meaning of the word should be lost; and that meaning was preserved by the earlier writers who, as became them, spoke correctly and clearly.</p>

<p>Marcus Cato, in the speech which he wrote <hi rend="italic">On the Achaeans,</hi>

<note>xxxv. Jordan.</note>
has these words: <quote>And when Hannibal was rending and harrying (<hi rend="italic">vexaret</hi>) the land of Italy.</quote> 'hat is to say, Cato used <hi rend="italic">vexare</hi> of the effect on Italy of Hannibal's conduct, at a time when no species of disaster, cruelty or savagery could be imagined which Italy did not suffer from his hands. Marcus Tullius, in his fourth <hi rend="italic">Oration against Verres,</hi> wrote: <quote>This

<note>The temple of Artemis at Syracuse; § 122.</note>
was so pillaged and ravaged by that wretch, that it did not seem to have been laid waste (<hi rend="italic">vexata</hi>) by an enemy who in the heat of war still felt some religious scruple and some respect for customary law, but by barbarous pirates.</quote></p>

<p>But concerning <hi rend="italic">inlaudatus</hi> it seems possible to give two answers. One is of this kind: There is absolutely no one who is of so perverted a character  <pb n="v1.p.139"/>  as not sometimes to do or say something that can be commended (<hi rend="italic">laudari</hi>.) And therefore this very ancient line has become a familiar proverb:  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Oft-times even a fool expresses himself to the purpose.</l></quote>  But one who, on the contrary, in his every act and at all times, deserves no praise (<hi rend="italic">laude</hi>) at all is <hi rend="italic">inlaudatus,</hi> and such a man is the very worst and most despicable of all mortals, just as freedom from all reproach makes one <hi rend="italic">inculpatus</hi> (blameless). Now <hi rend="italic">inculpatus</hi> is the synonym for perfect goodness; therefore conversely <hi rend="italic">inlaudatus</hi> represents the limit of extreme wickedness. It is for that reason that Homer usually bestows high praise, not by enumerating virtues, but by denying faults; for example:

<note><hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> iv. 366, 768, etc.</note>
<quote>And not unwillingly they charged,</quote> and again:

<note><hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> iv. 223.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Not then would you divine Atrides see</l> <l>Confused, inactive, nor yet loath to fight.</l></quote>  Epicurus too in a similar way defined the greatest pleasure as the removal and absence of all pain, in these words:

<note><hi rend="italic">Sent.</hi> iii. p. 72, Ussing.</note>
<quote>The utmost height of pleasure is the removal of all that pains.</quote> Again Virgil on the same principle called the Stygian pool <quote>unlovely.</quote>

<note><hi rend="italic">Georg.</hi> iv. 479; <hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> vi. 438.</note>
For just as he expressed abhorrence of the <quote>unpraised</quote> man by the denial of praise, so he abhorred the <quote>unlovable</quote> by the denial of love. Another defence of <hi rend="italic">inlaudatus</hi> is this: <hi rend="italic">laudare</hi> in early Latin means <quote>to name</quote> and <quote>cite.</quote> Thus in civil actions they use <hi rend="italic">laudare</hi> of an authority, when he is cited. Conversely, the <hi rend="italic">inlaudatus</hi> is the same as  <pb n="v1.p.141"/>  the <hi rend="italic">inlaudabilis,</hi> namely, one who is worthy neither of mention nor remembrance, and is never to be named; as, for example, in days gone by the common council of Asia decreed that no one should ever mention the name of the man who had burned the temple of Diana at Ephesus.

<note>He is said to have set fire to the temple in order to make himself notorious for all time; see Val. Max. viii. 14. <hi rend="italic">Exb. 5.</hi> His name, Herostratus, was preserved by Theopompus.</note>
</p>

<p>There remains the third criticism, his use of the expression <quote>a tunic rough with gold.</quote> But <hi rend="italic">squalentem</hi> signifies a quantity or thick layer of gold, laid on so as to resemble scales. For <hi rend="italic">squalere</hi> is used of the thick, rough scales (<hi rend="italic">squamae</hi>) which are to be seen on the skins of fish or snakes. This is made clear both by others and indeed by this same poet in several passages; thus:

<note><hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> xi. 770.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>A skin his covering was, plumed with brazen scales (<hi rend="italic">squamis</hi>)</l> <l part="I">And clasped with gold.</l></quote>  and again:

<note><hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> xi. 487.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>And now has he his flashing breastplate donned,</l> <l>Bristling with brazen scales (<hi rend="italic">squamis</hi>).</l></quote>  Accius too in the <hi rend="italic">Pelopidae</hi> writes thus:

<note>v. 517, Ribbeck<hi rend="sup">3</hi>.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>This serpent's scales (<hi rend="italic">squamae</hi>) rough gold and purple wrought.</l></quote>  Thus we see that <hi rend="italic">squalere</hi> was applied to whatever was overloaded and excessively crowded with anything, in order that its strange appearance might strike terror into those who looked upon it. So too on neglected and scaly bodies the deep layer of dirt was called <hi rend="italic">squalor,</hi> and by long and continued use in that sense the entire word has become so corrupted, that finally <hi rend="italic">squalor</hi> has come to be used of nothing but filth.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>IT is a frequent subject of discussion with philosophers, whether a father should always be obeyed, whatever the nature of his commands. As to this question writers <hi rend="italic">On Duty,</hi> both Greeks and our own countrymen, have stated that there are three opinions to be noticed and considered, and these they have differentiated with great acuteness The first is, that all a father's commands must be obeyed; the second, that in some he is to be obeyed, in others not; the third, that it is not necessary to yield to and obey one's father in anything.</p>

<p>Since at first sight this last opinion is altogether shameful, I shall begin by stating what has been said on that point. <quote>A father's command,</quote> they say, <quote>is either right or wrong. If it is right, it is not to be obeyed because it is his order, but the thing must be done because it is right that it be done. If his command is wrong, surely that should on no account be done which ought not to be done.</quote> Thus they arrive at the conclusion that a father's command should never be obeyed. But I have neither heard that this view has met with approval —for it is a mere quibble, both silly and foolish, as I shall presently show—nor can the opinion which we stated first, that all a father's commands are to be obeyed, be regarded as true and acceptable. For what if he shall command treason to one's country, a mother's murder, or some other base or impious  <pb n="v1.p.145"/>  deed? The intermediate view, therefore, has seemed best and safest, that some commands are to be obeyed and others not. But yet they say that commands which ought not to be obeyed must nevertheless be declined gently and respectfully, without excessive aversion or bitter recrimination, and rather left undone than spurned.</p>

<p>But that conclusion from which it is inferred, as has been said above, that a father is never to be obeyed, is faulty, and may be refuted and disposed of as follows: All human actions are, as learned men have decided, either honourable or base. Whatever is inherently right or honourable, such as keeping faith, defending one's country, loving one's friend's, ought to be done whether a father commands it or not; but whatever is of the opposite nature, and is base and altogether evil, should not be done even at a father's order. Actions, however, which lie between these, and are called by the Greeks now <foreign xml:lang="grc">me/sa,</foreign> or <quote>neutral,</quote> and now <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)dia/fora,</foreign> or <quote>indifferent,</quote> such as going to war, tilling the fields, seeking office, pleading causes, marrying a wife, going when ordered, coming when called; since these and similar actions are in themselves neither honourable nor base, but are to be approved or disapproved exactly according to the manner in which we perform them: for this reason they believe that in every kind of action of this description a father should be obeyed; as for instance, if he should order his son to marry a wife or to plead for the accused. For since each of these acts, in its actual nature and of itself, is neither honourable nor base, if a father should command it, he ought to be obeyed. But if he should order his son to  <pb n="v1.p.147"/>  marry a woman of ill repute, infamous and criminal, or to speak in defence of a Catiline, a Tubulus,

<note>Catiline and Clodius are too notorious to require comment. L. Hostilius Tubulus, praetor in 142 B. C., accepted bribes when presiding at a trial for murder. Cic., <hi rend="italic">De Nal. Deorum</hi> i. 63 and elsewhere, cites him as an example of iniquity. </note>
or a Publius Clodius, of course he ought not to be obeyed, since by the addition of a certain degree of evil these acts cease to be inherently neutral and indifferent. Hence the premise of those who say that <quote>the commands of a father are either honourable or base</quote> is incomplete, and it cannot be considered what the Greeks call <quote>sound and regular disjunctive proposition.</quote> For that disjunctive premise lacks the third member, <quote>or are neither honourable nor base.</quote> If this be added, the conclusion cannot be drawn that a father's command must never be obeyed.</p></div>

<p>The unfairness of Plutarch's criticism of Epicurus' knowledge of the syllogism.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>PLUTARCH, in the second book of his essay <hi rend="italic">On Homer,</hi>

<note>vii, p. 100, Bern.</note>
asserts that Epicurus made use of an incomplete, perverted and faulty syllogism, and he quotes Epicurus' own words:

<note><hi rend="italic">Sent.</hi> II, p. 71, Ussing.</note>
<quote>Death is nothing to us, for what is dissolved is without perception, and what is without perception is nothing to us.</quote> <quote>Now Epicurus,</quote> says Plutarch, "omitted what he ought to have stated as his major premise, that death is a dissolution of body and soul, and then, to prove something else, he goes on to use the very premise that he had omitted, as if it had been stated and conceded. But this syllogism," says Plutarch, <quote>cannot advance, unless that premise be first presented.</quote></p>  <pb n="v1.p.149"/>

<p>What Plutarch wrote as to the form and sequence of a syllogism is true enough; for if you wish to argue and reason according to the teaching of the schools, you ought to say: <quote>Death is the dissolution of soul and body; but what is dissolved is without perception; and what is without perception is nothing to us.</quote> But we cannot suppose that Epicurus, being the man he was, omitted that part of the syllogism through ignorance, or that it was his intention to state a syllogism complete in all its members and limitations, as is done in the schools of the logicians; but since the separation of body and soul by death is self-evident, he of course did not think it necessary to call attention to what was perfectly obvious to everyone. For the same reason, too, he put the conclusion of the syllogism, not at the end, but at the beginning; for who does not see that this also was not due to inadvertence?</p>

<p>In Plato too you will often find syllogisms in which the order prescribed in the schools is disregarded and inverted, with a kind of lofty disdain of criticism.</p></div>

<note>p. 199, Bipont.</note>
that he recalled that Quintus Catulus, when in charge of the restoration of the Capitol,

in order that the ascent to the temple might have more steps and that the podium might be higher, to correspond with the elevation and size of the pediment

<note>Sulla and Catulus in their restorations of the Capitoline temple used columns that were taller than those of the earlier building. Catulus wished to make the podium (or elevated platform) higher, to correspond with the greater elevation and size of the pediment (or gable). This he could have done most easily by lowering the area about the temple.</note>

These, he said, were certain underground chambers and cisterns in the area, in which  <pb n="v1.p.153"/>  it was the custom to store ancient statues that had fallen from the temple, and some other consecrated objects from among the votive offerings. And then Varro goes on to say in the same letter, that he had never found any explanation of the term <hi rend="italic">favisae</hi> in literature, but that Quintus Valerius Soranus used to assert that what we called by their Greek name <hi rend="italic">thesauri</hi> (treasuries) the early Latins termed <hi rend="italic">favisae,</hi> their reason being that there was deposited in them, not uncoined copper and silver, but stamped and minted money.

<note>For original <hi rend="italic">flavisae,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">flare.</hi> Minted or coined money had to be softened or melted before being cast or struck, and for this process the word <hi rend="italic">isflare;</hi> hence the directors of the mint were called Triumviri Auro Argento Aere Flando Feriundo, where <hi rend="italic">aere</hi> is of course an old dative. <hi rend="italic">Favisa</hi> is apparently for <hi rend="italic">*fovisa</hi> and cognate with <hi rend="italic">forea,</hi> <quote>pit.</quote></note>

<p>A law of Solon, the result of careful thought and consideration, which at first sight seems unfair and unjust, but on close examination is found to be altogether helpful and salutary.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>AMONG those very early laws of Solon which were inscribed upon wooden tablets at Athens, and which, promulgated by him, the Athenians ratified by penalties and oaths, to ensure their permanence, Aristotle says

<note>Cf. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Pol. )Aqhn.</foreign> 8.</note>
that there was one to this effect: <quote>If because of strife and disagreement civil dissension shall ensue and a division of the people into two parties, and if for that reason each side, led by their angry feelings, shall take up arms and fight, then if anyone at that time, and in such a condition of civil discord, shall not ally himself with one or the other faction, but by himself and apart shall hold aloof from the common calamity of the State, let hint be deprived of his home, his country, and all his property, and be an exile and an outlaw.</quote></p>  <pb n="v1.p.157"/>

<p>When I read this law of Solon, who was a man of extraordinary wisdom, I was at first filled with something like great amazement, and I asked myself why it was that those who had held themselves aloof from dissension and civil strife were thought to be deserving of punishment. Then those who had profoundly and thoroughly studied the purpose and meaning of the law declared that it was designed, not to increase, but to terminate, dissension. And that is exactly so. For if all good men, who have been unequal to checking the dissension at the outset, do not abandon the aroused and frenzied people, but divide and ally themselves with one or the other faction, then the result will be, that when they have become members of the two opposing parties, and, being men of more than ordinary influence, have begun to guide and direct those parties, harmony can best be restored and established through the efforts of such men, controlling and soothing as they will the members of their respective factions, and desiring to reconcile rather than destroy their opponents.</p>

<p>The philosopher Favorinus thought that this same course ought to be adopted also with brothers, or with friends, who are at odds; that is, that those who are neutral and kindly disposed towards both parties, if they have had little influence in bringing about a reconciliation because they have not made their friendly feelings evident, should then take sides, some one and some the other, and through this manifestation of devotion pave the way for restoring harmony. <quote>But as it is,</quote> said he, <quote>most of the friends of both parties make a merit of abandoning the two disputants, leaving them to the tender  <pb n="v1.p.159"/>  mercies of ill-disposed or greedy advisers, who, animated by hatred or by avarice, add fuel to their strife and inflame their passions.</quote></p></div>

<p>To what extent in ancient days it was to old age in particular that high honours were paid; and why it was that later those same honours were extended to husbands and fathers; and in that connection some provisions of the seventh section of the Julian law.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>AMONG the earliest Romans, as a rule, neither birth nor wealth was more highly honoured than age, but older men were reverenced by their juniors almost like gods and like their own parents, and everywhere and in every kind of honour they were regarded as first and of prior right. From a dinner-party, too, older men were escorted home by younger men, as we read in the records of the past, a custom which, as tradition has it, the Romans took over from the Lacedaemonians, by whom, in accordance with the laws of Lycurgus, greater honour on all occasions was paid to greater age.</p>

<p>But after it came to be realised that progeny were a necessity for the State, and there was occasion to add to the productivity of the people by premiums and other inducements, then in certain respects greater deference was shown to men who had a wife, and to those who had children, than to older  <pb n="v1.p.163"/>  men who had neither wives nor children. Thus in chapter seven of the Julian law

<note>In 18 B.C. Augustus proposed a law <hi rend="italic">de maritandis ordinibus,</hi>imposing liabilities on the unmarried and offering rewards to those who married and reared children. It was violently opposed, but was finally passed in a modified form. See Suet. <hi rend="italic">Aug.</hi> xxxiv. In A.D. 9 the lex Papia Poppaea, called from the consules suffecti of the year, was added. The combined <hi rend="italic">Lex Iulia et Papia Poppaea</hi> contained at least 35 chapters (<hi rend="italic">Dig.</hi> 23. 2. 19). </note>
priority in assuming the emblems of power is given, not to the elder of the consuls, but to him who either has more children tinder his control than his colleague, or has lost them in war. But if both have an equal number of children, the one who has a wife, or is eligible for marriage, is preferred. If, however, both are married and are fathers of the same number of children, then the standard of honour of early times is restored, and the elder is first to assume the rods. But when both consuls are without wives and have the same number of sons, or are husbands but have no children, there is no provision in that law as to age. However, I hear that it was usual for those who had legal priority to yield the rods for the first month to colleagues who were either considerably older than they, or of much higher rank, or who were entering upon a second consulship.</p></div>

<p>Sulpicius Apollinaris' criticism of Caesellius Vindex for his explanation of a passage in Virgil. </p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>VIRGIL has the following lines in the sixth book:

<note>760 ff.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Yon princeling, thou beholdest leaning there</l> <l>Upon a bloodless

<note>See note 1, p. 155.</note>
lance, shall next emerge</l> <l>Into the realms of day. He is the first</l> <l>Of half-Italian strain, thy last-born heir,</l> <l>To thine old age by fair Lavinia given,</l>  <pb n="v1.p.165"/>  <l>Called Silvius, a royal Alban name</l> <l>(Of sylvan birth and sylvan nurture he),</l> <l>A king himself and sire of kings to come,</l> <l>By whom our race in Alba Longa reign.</l></quote></p>

<p>It appeared to Caesellius that there was utter inconsistency between  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>thy last-born heir</l></quote>  and  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>To thine old age by fair Lavinia given,</l> <l part="I">Of sylvan birth.</l></quote>  For if, as is shown by the testimony of almost all the annals, this Silvius was born after the death of Aeneas, and for that reason was given the forename Postumus, with what propriety does Virgil add:  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>To thine old age by fair Lavinia given,</l> <l part="I">Of sylvan birth?</l></quote>  For these words would seem to imply that while Aeneas was still living, but was already an old man, a son Silvius was born to him and was reared. Therefore Caesellius, in his <hi rend="italic">Notes on Early Readings,</hi> expressed the opinion that the meaning of the words was as follows: <quote><hi rend="italic">Postuma proles,</hi></quote> said he, <quote>does not mean a child born after the death of his father, but the one who was born last; this applies to Silvius, who was born late and after the usual time, when Aeneas was already an old man.</quote> But Caesellius names no adequate authority for this version, while that Silvius was born, as I have said, after Aeneas' death, has ample testimony.</p>

<p>Therefore Sulpicius Apollinaris, among other criticisms of Caesellius, notes this statement of his as  <pb n="v1.p.167"/>  an error, and says that the cause of the error is the phrase <hi rend="italic">quem tibi longaevo. <quote>Longaevo,</quote></hi> he says, <quote>does not mean 'when old,' for that is contrary to historical truth, but rather ' admitted into a life that is now long and unending, and made immortal.' For Anchises, who says this to his son, knew that after Aeneas had ended his life among men he would be immortal and a local deity, and enjoy a long and everlasting existence.</quote> Thus Apollinaris, ingeniously enough. But yet a <quote>long life</quote> is one thing, and an <quote>unending life</quote> another, and the gods are not called <quote>of great age,</quote> but <quote>immortal.</quote></p></div>

<p>Marcus Cicero's observations on the nature of certain prepositions; to which is added a discussion of the particular matter which Cicero had observed.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>AFTER careful observation Marcus Tullius noted that the prepositions <hi rend="italic">in</hi> and <hi rend="italic">con,</hi> when prefixed to nouns and verbs, are lengthened and prolonged when they are followed by the initial letters of <hi rend="italic">sapiens</hi> and <hi rend="italic">felix;</hi> but that in all other instances they are pronounced short.</p>

<p>Cicero's words are:

<note><hi rend="italic">Orator,</hi> § 159.</note>
<quote>Indeed, what can be more elegant than this, which does not come about from a natural law, but in accordance with a kind of usage? we pronounce the first vowel in <hi rend="italic">indoctus</hi> short, in <hi rend="italic">insanus</hi> long; in <hi rend="italic">immanis</hi> short, in <hi rend="italic">infelix</hi> long; in brief, in compound words in which the first letters are those which begin <hi rend="italic">sapiens</hi> and <hi rend="italic">felix</hi> the prefix is pronounced long, in all others short; thus we have conposuit but cōnsuevit, cŏncrepuit  <pb n="v1.p.169"/>  but <hi rend="italic">cōnficit.</hi> Consult the rules of grammar and they will censure your usage; refer the matter to your ears and they will approve. Ask why it is so; they will say that it pleases them. And language ought to gratify the pleasure of the ear.</quote></p>

<p>In these words of which Cicero spoke it is clear that the principle is one of euphony, but what are we to say of the preposition <hi rend="italic">pro?</hi> For although it is often shortened or lengthened, yet it does not conform to this rule of Marcus Tullius. For it is not always lengthened when it is followed by the first letter of the word <hi rend="italic">fecit,</hi> which Cicero says has the effect of lengthening the prepositions <hi rend="italic">in</hi> and <hi rend="italic">con.</hi> For we pronounce <hi rend="italic">prŏficisci, prŏfugere, prŏfundere, prŏfannu</hi> and <hi rend="italic">prŏfestumn</hi> with the first vowel short, but <hi rend="italic">prōferre, prōfligare</hi> and <hi rend="italic">prōficere</hi> with that syllable long. Why is it then that this letter, which, according to Cicero's observation, has the effect of lengthening, does not have the same effect by reason of rule or of euphony in all words of the same kind,

<note>That is beginning with <hi rend="italic">f.</hi></note>
but lengthens the vowel in one word and shortens it in another.</p>

<p>Nor, as a matter of fact, is the particle <hi rend="italic">con</hi> lengthened only when followed by that letter which Cicero mentioned: for both Cato and Sallust say <quote xml:lang="la">faenoribus copertus est.</quote>

<note>He is loaded with debt; Fr. 50, Jordan; Sail <hi rend="italic">Hist.</hi> iv. 52, Maurenbrecher.</note>
Moreover <hi rend="italic">cōligatus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cōnexus</hi> are pronounced long.</p>

<p>But after all, in these cases which I have cited one can see that this particle is lengthened because the letter <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is dropped; for the loss of a letter is compensated by the lengthening of the syllable. This principle is observed also in the word <hi rend="italic">cōgo;</hi> and it is no contradiction that we pronounce <hi rend="italic">cŏegi</hi>  <pb n="v1.p.171"/>  short; for this form cannot be derived from <hi rend="italic">cōgo</hi> without violation of the principle of analogy.

<note>For <quote>analogy</quote> in this sense of <quote>regularity,</quote> see ii. 25. Gellius thought that <hi rend="italic">coegi</hi> was an irregular form because <hi rend="italic">oē</hi> did not contract, as <hi rend="italic">oi</hi> did in <hi rend="italic">cogo;</hi> but contraction of unlike vowels did not take place when the second was long; cf. <hi rend="italic">coāctus.</hi> Cicero's rule is correct, because a vowel is naturally long before <hi rend="italic">ns</hi> and <hi rend="italic">nf.</hi> The case of <hi rend="italic">pro</hi> is quite different. The <hi rend="italic">ō</hi> in <hi rend="italic">cōpertus</hi> is due to contraction from <hi rend="italic">co-opertus. Cōligatus</hi> is a very rare form; Skutsch, quoted by Hosius, thought it might come from <hi rend="italic">co-alligatus.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">ō</hi> in <hi rend="italic">cogo</hi> is also due to contraction (<hi rend="italic">co-ago, co-igo</hi>), which does not apply to the perfect <hi rend="italic">coegi.</hi> Compensatory lengthening takes place usually when an <hi rend="italic">s</hi> is lost, as in <hi rend="italic">cōnecto</hi> for <hi rend="italic">co-snecto,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">n</hi> before <hi rend="italic">s</hi> and <hi rend="italic">f;</hi> less commonly when <hi rend="italic">nc</hi> is lost before n.</note>

in those satires which others call <quote>Cynic,</quote> but he himself, <quote>Menippean.</quote>

<note>See note 1, p. 85.</note>
</p>  <pb n="v1.p.173"/>

<p>Besides these, Pompylus, the slave of the Peripatetic Theophrastus, and the slave of the Stoic Zeno who was called Persaeus, and the slave of Epicurus whose name was Mys, were philosophers of repute.

<note>I. 438, Arn. </note>
</p>

<p>Diogenes the Cynic also served as a slave, but he was a freeborn man, who was sold into slavery. When Xeniades of Corinth wished to buy him and asked whether he knew any trade, Diogenes replied: <quote>I know how to govern free men.</quote>

<note>The word for free men and children is the same (<hi rend="italic">liberi</hi>), but it seems impossible to reproduce the word play in English.</note>
Then Xeniades, in admiration of his answer, bought him, set him free, and entrusting to him his own children, said: <quote>Take my children to govern.</quote></p>

<p>But as to the well-known philosopher Epictetus, the fact that he too was a slave is too fresh in our memory to need to be committed to writing, as if it had been forgotten.</p></div>

<p>On the nature of the verb <hi rend="italic">rescire;</hi> and its true and distinctive meaning.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I HAVE observed that the verb <hi rend="italic">rescire</hi> has a peculiar force, which is not in accord with the general meaning of other words compounded with that same preposition; for we do not use <hi rend="italic">rescire</hi> in the same way that we do <hi rend="italic">rescribere</hi> (write in reply), <hi rend="italic">relegere</hi> (reread), <hi rend="italic">restituere</hi> (restore), . . . and <hi rend="italic">substituere</hi> (put in the place of);

<note>As <hi rend="italic">substituere</hi> does not contain <hi rend="italic">re-,</hi> it seems clear that there is a lacuna before that word, but it seems impossible to fill the gap.</note>
but <hi rend="italic">rescire</hi> is properly said of one who learns of something that is hidden, or unlooked for and unexpected.</p>  <pb n="v1.p.175"/>

<p>But why the particle <hi rend="italic">re</hi> has this special force in this one word alone, I for my part am still inquiring. For I have never yet found that <hi rend="italic">rescivi</hi> or <hi rend="italic">rescire</hi> was used by those who were careful in their diction, otherwise than of things which were purposely concealed, or happened contrary to anticipation and expectation; although <hi rend="italic">scire</hi> itself is used of everything alike, whether favourable or unfavourable, unexpected or expected. Thus Naevius in the <hi rend="italic">Triphallus</hi> wrote:

<note>v. 96, Ribbeck<hi rend="sup">3</hi></note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>If ever I discover (<hi rend="italic">rescivero</hi>) that my son</l> <l>Has borrowed money for a love affair,</l> <l>Straightway I'll put you where you'll spit no more.

<note>Literally, <quote>spit down</quote> into one's bosom, referring to he wooden fork about the slave's neck which would prevent his, and to spitting as a charm for averting evil.</note>

<quote>When the Lucanians discovered (<hi rend="italic">resciverunt</hi> ) that they had been deceived and tricked.</quote> And again in the same book Quadrigarius uses that word of something sad and unexpected:

<note>Fr. 19, Peter. </note>
<quote>When this became known to the relatives (<hi rend="italic">rescierunt provinqui</hi>) of the hostages, who, as I have pointed out above, had been delivered to Pontius, their parents and relatives rushed into the street with hair in disarray.</quote> Marcus Cato writes in the fourth book of the <hi rend="italic">Origins:</hi>

<p>That for what we commonly call <hi rend="italic">virvaria</hi> the earlier writers did not use that term; and what Publius Scipio used for this word in his speech to the people, and afterwards Marcus Varro in his work <hi rend="italic">On Farming.</hi></p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>IN the third book of his treatise <hi rend="italic">On Farming,</hi>

<note>iii. 3. 1.</note>
Marcus Varro says that the name <hi rend="italic">leporaria</hi> is given to certain enclosures, now called <hi rend="italic">vivaria,</hi> in which wild animals are kept alive and fed. I have appended Varro's own words: <quote>There are three means of keeping animals on the farm—bird houses, <hi rend="italic">leporaria</hi> (warrens), and fish-ponds. I am now using the term <hi rend="italic">ornithones</hi> of all kinds of birds that are ordinarily kept within the walls of the farmhouse. <hi rend="italic">Leporaria</hi> I wish you to understand, not in the sense in which our remote ancestors used the word, of places in which only hares are kept, but of all enclosures which are connected with a farm-house and contain live animals that are fed.</quote> Farther on in the same book Varro writes:

<note>iii. 3. 8.</note>
<quote>When you bought the farm at Tusculum from Marcus Piso, there were many wild boars in the <hi rend="italic">leporarium.</hi></quote></p>

<p>But the word <hi rend="italic">vivaria,</hi> which the common people now use—the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">para\de/isoi</foreign>

<note>The word means an enclosed park, handsomely laid ou and stocked with game; also, a garden, and in Septuagint <hi rend="italic">Gen.</hi> 2. 8, the garden of Eden, Paradise.</note>
and Varro's <hi rend="italic">leporaria</hi>—I do not recall meeting anywhere in the older literature. But as to the word <hi rend="italic">roboraria,</hi> which we find in the writings of Scipio, who used the purest diction of any man of his time, I have heard several learned men at Rome assert that this means what we call <hi rend="italic">vivaria</hi> and that the name came from the <quote>oaken</quote> planks of which the enclosures were made, a kind of enclosure which we see in many places in Italy. This is the passage  <pb n="v1.p.179"/>  from Scipio's fifth oration <hi rend="italic">Against Claudius Asellus:</hi>

<note><hi rend="italic">Orato. Rom. Frag.</hi> p. 184, Myer<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
<quote>When he had seen the highly-cultivated fields and well-kept farmhouses, he ordered them to set up a measuring rod on the highest spot in that district; and from there to build a straight road, in some places through the midst of vineyards, in others through the <hi rend="italic">roborarium</hi> and the fish-pond, in still others through the farm buildings.</quote></p>

<p>Thus we see that to pools or ponds of water in which live fish are kept in confinement, they gave their own appropriate name of <hi rend="italic">piscinae,</hi> or <quote>fishponds.</quote></p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Apiaria</hi> too is the word commonly used of places in which bee-hives are set; but I recall almost no one of those who have spoken correctly who has used that word either in writing or speaking. But Marcus Varro, in the third book of his treatise <hi rend="italic">On Farming,</hi> remarks:

<note>iii. 16. 12.</note>
<quote>This is the way to make <foreign xml:lang="grc">melissw=nes,</foreign> which some call <hi rend="italic">mellaria,</hi> or 'places for storing honey.'</quote> But this word which Varro used is Greek; for they say <foreign xml:lang="grc">melissw=nes,</foreign> just as they do <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)mpelw=nes</foreign> (vineyards) and <foreign xml:lang="grc">dafnw=nes</foreign> (laurel groves).</p></div>

<p>About the constellation which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">a(/maca</foreign> and the Romans <hi rend="italic">septentriones;</hi> and as to the origin and meaning of both those words.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>SEVERAL of us, Greeks and Romans, who were pursuing the same studies, were crossing in the same boat from Aegina to the Piraeus. It was night, the sea was calm, the time summer, and the sky  <pb n="v1.p.181"/>  bright and clear. So we all sat together in the stern and watched the brilliant stars. Then those of our company who were acquainted with Grecian lore discussed with learning and acumen such questions as these: what the <foreign xml:lang="grc">a(/maca,</foreign> or <quote>Wain,</quote> was, and what Boötes, which was the Great, and which the Little Bear and why they were so called; in what direction that constellation moved in the course of the advancing night, and why Homer says

<note><hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> xviii. 489; <hi rend="italic">Odyss.</hi> v. 275 <foreign xml:lang="grc">)/Arkton</foreign> . . . <foreign xml:lang="grc">oi)/h d'</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)/mmoro/s e)sti loetrw=n )Wkeanoi=o.</foreign></note>
that this is the only constellation that does not set, in view of the fact that there are some other stars that do not set.</p>

<p>Thereupon I turned to our compatriots and said: <quote>Why don't you barbarians tell me why we give the name of <hi rend="italic">septentriones</hi> to what the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">a(/maca.</foreign> Now ' because we see seven stars' is not a sufficient answer, but I desire to be informed at some length,</quote> said I, <quote>of the meaning of the whole idea which we express by the word <hi rend="italic">septentriones.</hi></quote></p>

<p>Then one of them, who had devoted himself to ancient literature and antiquities, replied: "The common run of grammarians think that the word <hi rend="italic">septentriones</hi> is derived solely from the number of stars. For they declare that <hi rend="italic">triones</hi> of itself has no meaning, but is a mere addition to the word; just as in our word <hi rend="italic">quinquatrus,</hi> so called because five is the number of days after the Ides,

<note>The <hi rend="italic">quinquatrtus,</hi> or festival of Minerva, was so called because it came on the fifth day after the Ides (fifteenth) of March.</note>
<hi rend="italic">atrus</hi> means nothing. But for my part, I agree with Lucius Aelius

<note>Fr. 42, Fun.</note>
and Marcus Varro,

<note><hi rend="italic">De Ling. Lat.</hi> vii. 4. 74.</note>
who wrote that oxen were called <hi rend="italic">triones,</hi> a rustic term it is true, as if they were <hi rend="italic">terriones,</hi>

<note>A word made up from <hi rend="italic">terra,</hi> <quote>earth</quote> ; the derivation is a fanciful one. <hi rend="italic">Triones</hi> is connected with <hi rend="italic">tero,</hi> <quote>rub, tread,</quote> etc.</note>
that is to say, adapted to  nominibus regionibusque docere nos ipse vellet,  <pb n="v1.p.183"/>  ploughing and cultivating the earth. Therefore this constellation, which the early Greeks called <foreign xml:lang="grc">a(/maca</foreign> merely from its form and position, because it seemed to resemble a wagon, the early men also of our country called <hi rend="italic">septentriones,</hi> from oxen yoked together, that is, seven stars by which yoked oxen (<hi rend="italic">triones</hi>) seem to be represented. After giving this opinion, Varro further added," said he, <quote>that he suspected that these seven stars were called <hi rend="italic">triones</hi> rather for the reason that they are so situated that every group of three neighbouring stars forms a triangle, that is to say, a three-sided figure.</quote></p>

<p>Of these two reasons which he gave, the latter seemed the neater and the more ingenious; for as we looked at that constellation, it actually appeared to consist of triangles.

<note>This is true, whatever the origin of the name.</note>

<!--<argument>-->

<p>Information about the wind called Iapyx and about the names and quarters of other winds, derived from the discourses of Favorinus.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>AT Favorinus' table, when he dined with friends, there was usually read either an old song of one of the lyric poets, or something from history, now in Greek and now in Latin. Thus one day there was read there, in a Latin poem,

<note>Perhaps Horace, <hi rend="italic">Odes,</hi> i. 3. 4 or iii. 27. 20. Gellius mentions Horace by name only once, in § 25, below.</note>
the word <hi rend="italic">Iapyx,</hi> the name of a wind, and the question was asked what wind this was, from what quarter it blew, and what was the origin of so rare a term; and we also asked Favorinus to be so good as to inform us about the names and quarters of the other winds,  <pb n="v1.p.185"/>  since there was no general agreement as to their designations, positions or number.</p>

<p>Then Favorinus ran on as follows: <quote>It is well known,</quote> said he, " that there are four quarters and regions of the heavens—east, west, south and north. East and west are movable and variable points;

<note>Since the Latin terms for <quote>east</quote> and <quote>west</quote> mean the sun's <quote>rising</quote> and <quote>setting.</quote></note>
south and north are permanently fixed and unalterable. For the sun does not always rise in exactly the same place, but its rising is called either <hi rend="italic">equinoctial</hi> when it runs the course which is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">i)shmerino/s</foreign> (with equal days and nights), or <hi rend="italic">solsticial,</hi> which is equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="grc">qerinai\ tropai/</foreign> (summer turnings), or <hi rend="italic">brumal,</hi> which is the same as <foreign xml:lang="grc">xeimerinai\ tropai/,</foreign> or 'winter turnings.' So too the sun does not always set in the same place; for in the same way its setting is called <hi rend="italic">equinoctial, solstitial,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">brumal.</hi> Therefore the wind which blows from the sun's spring, or <hi rend="italic">equinoctial,</hi> rising is called <hi rend="italic">eurus,</hi> a word derived, as your etymologists say, from the Greek which means ' that which flows from the east.' This wind is called by the Greeks by still another name, <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)fhliw/ths,</foreign> or 'in the direction of the sun'; and by the Roman sailors, <hi rend="italic">subsolanus</hi> (lying beneath the sun). But the wind that comes from the summer and solstitial point of rising

<note>This at the summer solstice would be far to the north.</note>
is called in Latin <hi rend="italic">aquilo,</hi> in Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">bore/as,</foreign> and some say it was for that reason that Homer called

<note><hi rend="italic">Odyss.</hi> v. 296.</note>
it <foreign xml:lang="grc">ai)qrhgene/ths,</foreign> or 'ether-born'

<note>That is, from the clear, bright sky, often attending the sunrise.</note>
; but <hi rend="italic">boreas,</hi> they think, is so named <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)po\ th=s boh=s,</foreign> 'from the loud shout,' since its blast is violent and noisy. To the third wind, which blows from the point of the winter rising—the Romans call it <hi rend="italic">volturnus</hi>—many of the Greeks give a compound name, <foreign xml:lang="grc">eu)ro/notos,</foreign> because it is between <hi rend="italic">eurus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">notus.</hi> These  <pb n="v1.p.187"/>  then are the three east winds: <hi rend="italic">aquilo, volturnus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">curus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">eurus</hi> lies between the other two. Opposite to and facing these are three other winds from the west: <hi rend="italic">caurus,</hi> which the Greeks commonly call <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)rgesth/s</foreign>

<note>From <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)rgh/s,</foreign> <quote>white, brilliant.</quote> The Latin equivalent was <hi rend="italic">argestis,</hi> which, according to Isidor (<hi rend="italic">Orig.</hi> xiii. 11. 10), the common people corrupted into <hi rend="italic">agrestis.</hi></note>
or 'clearing'; this blows from the quarter opposite <hi rend="italic">aquilo.</hi> There is a second, <hi rend="italic">favonius,</hi>

<note>Perhaps connected with <hi rend="italic">foveo,</hi> as a mild, pleasant wind; see <hi rend="italic">Thes. Ling. Lat., s. v.</hi> Or with <hi rend="italic">faveo, Faunus,</hi> Walde, <hi rend="italic">Etym. Lat. Dict.</hi></note>
which in Greek is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ze/furos,</foreign> blowing from the point opposite to <hi rend="italic">eurus;</hi> and a third, <hi rend="italic">Africus,</hi> which in Greek is <foreign xml:lang="grc">li/y,</foreign>

<note>From <foreign xml:lang="grc">lei/bw,</foreign> Lat. <hi rend="italic">libo,</hi> <quote>pour, pour out.</quote></note>
or 'wet-bringing,' blows in opposition to <hi rend="italic">volturnus.</hi> These two opposite quarters of the sky, east and west, have, as we see, six winds opposite to one another. But the south, since it is a fixed and invariable point, has but one single south wind; this in Latin is termed <hi rend="italic">auster,</hi> in Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">no/tos,</foreign> because it is cloudy and wet, for <foreign xml:lang="grc">noti/s</foreign> is the Greek for 'moisture."

<note>'The derivation of <hi rend="italic">auster</hi> is uncertain; see <hi rend="italic">Thes. Ling. Lat., s. v.</hi> Walde connects it with words meaning <quote>east</quote> and <quote>eastern,</quote> adding <quote>Merkwiirdig ist die Bedeutung 'Sudwind,' nicht 'Ostwind'; doch ist auch in der Vogelschau die Richtung gegen Osten teilweise durch die Richtung nach Sūden abgelost.</quote> But Thurneysen (<hi rend="italic">T. L. L.</hi>) remarks:  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l><quote>Sed ab his Latini nominis significatus nimium distat.</quote> </l></quote></note>
The north too, for the same reason, has but one wind. This, called in Latin <hi rend="italic">septentrionarius,</hi> in Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)parkti/as,</foreign> or 'from the region of the Bear,' is directly opposite to <hi rend="italic">auster.</hi> From this list of eight winds some subtract four, and they declare that they do so on the authority of Homer,

<note><hi rend="italic">Odyss.</hi> v. 295, 331.</note>
who knows only four winds: <hi rend="italic">eurus, auster, aquilo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">favonius,</hi> blowing from the four quarters of the heaven which we have named primary, so to speak; for they regard the east and west as broader, to be sure, but nevertheless single and not divided into three parts. There are others, on the contrary, who make twelve winds instead of eight, by inserting a third group  <pb n="v1.p.189"/>  of four in the intervening space about the south and north, in the same way that the second four are placed between the original two at east and west.</p>

<p>"There are also some other names of what might be called special winds, which the natives have coined each in their own districts, either from the designations of the places in which they live or from some other reason which has led to the formation of the word. Thus our Gauls

<note>That is, the Gauls of Gallia Narbonensis. Favorinus was a native of Arelate, the modern Aries.</note>
call the wind which blows from their land, the most violent wind to which they are exposed, <hi rend="italic">circius,</hi> doubtless from its whirling and stormy character; the Apulians give the name <hi rend="italic">Iapyx</hi>—the name by which they themselves are known (<hi rend="italic">Iapzyges</hi>)—to the wind that blows from the mouth of <foreign xml:lang="grc">)Iapugi/a</foreign> itself, from its inmost recesses, as it were.

<note>Text and meaning are very uncertain. No satisfactory explanation of <hi rend="italic">ore</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sinibus</hi> has been offered, so far as I know. Apuleius, <hi rend="italic">De Mundo</hi> 14, says: Apuli <quote>Iapagem</quote> eum venture ) ex Iapygae sinu, id est ex ipso Gargano venientem (appellant).</note>
This is, I think, about the same as <hi rend="italic">caurus;</hi> for it is a west wind and seems to blow from the quarter opposite <hi rend="italic">eurus.</hi> Therefore Virgil says

<note><hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> viii. 709.</note>
that Cleopatra, when fleeing to Egypt after the sea-fight, was borne onward by Iapyx, and he called

<note><hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> xi. 678.</note>
an Apulian horse by the same name as the wind, that is, Iapyx. There is also a wind named <hi rend="italic">caecias,</hi> which, according to Aristotle

<note><hi rend="italic">Meteor.</hi> ii. 6; <hi rend="italic">Prob.</hi> xxvi. 29.</note>
blows in such a way as not to drive away clouds, but to attract them. This, he says, is the origin of the proverbial line:

<note>Trag. fr. adesp. 75, Nauck.<hi rend="sup">2</hi></note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Attracting to oneself, as <hi rend="italic">caecias</hi> does the clouds.</l></quote></p>

<p>Moreover, besides these which I have mentioned there are in various places other names of winds, of new coinage and each peculiar to its own region,  <pb n="v1.p.191"/>  for example the <hi rend="italic">Atabulus</hi> of Horace;

<note><hi rend="italic">Serm.</hi> i. 5. 78. The wind corresponds to the sirocco. Porphyrio, <hi rend="italic">ad loc.</hi> gives the fanciful derivation, <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)po\ tou= e)s</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="grc">th\n a)/thn ba/llein pa/nta.</foreign> The <hi rend="italic">Thes. Ling. Lat.</hi> connects it with <hi rend="italic">Atabuli,</hi> the name of an Aethiopian tribe.</note>
these too I intended to discuss; I would also have added those which are called <hi rend="italic">etesiae</hi>

<note><quote>Periodic,</quote> or <quote>trade</quote> winds, referring especially to the Egyptian monsoon, which blow from the north-west during the whole summer (Herodotus, ii, 20); used also of winds which blow from the north in the Aegean for forty days after the rising of the Dog-star.</note>
and <hi rend="italic">prodromi,</hi>

<note><quote>Preceding</quote> the <hi rend="italic">etesiae,</hi> and blowing north-north-east for eight days before the rising of the Dog-star.</note>
which at a fixed time of year, namely when the dog-star rises, blow from one or another quarter of the heavens; and since I have drunk a good bit, I would have rated on about the meaning of all these terms, had I not already done a deal of talking while all of you have been silent, as if I were delivering 'an exhibition speech.' But for one to do all the talking at a large dinner-party," said he, <quote>is neither decent nor becoming.</quote></p>

<p>This is what Favorinus recounted to us at his own table at the time I mentioned, with extreme elegance of diction and in a delightful and graceful style throughout. But as to his statement that the wind which blows from the land of Gaul is called <hi rend="italic">circius,</hi> Marcus Cato in his <hi rend="italic">Origins</hi>

<note>Fr. 93, Peter.</note>
calls that wind, not <hi rend="italic">circius,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">cercius.</hi> For writing about the Spaniards who dwell on this side the Ebro, he set down these words: <quote>But in this district are the finest iron and silver mines, also a great mountain of pure salt; the more you take from it, the more it grows. The <hi rend="italic">cercius</hi> wind, when you speak, fills your mouth; it overturns an armed man or a loaded wagon.</quote></p>

<p>In saying above that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)thsi/ai</foreign> blow from one or another quarter of the heavens, although following the opinion of many, I rather think I spoke hastily.

<note>Gellius, as he sometimes does elsewhere, refers to Favorinus' statement as if it were his own. Gronovius' proposed change to <hi rend="italic">dixit</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dixerit</hi> is unnecessary.</note>
<pb n="v1.p.193"/>  For in the second book of Publius Nigidius' treatise <hi rend="italic">On Wind</hi> are these words:

<note>Fr. 104, Swoboda.</note>
<quote>Both the <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)thsi/ai</foreign> and the annual south winds follow the sun.</quote> We ought therefore to inquire into the meaning of <quote>follow the sun.</quote></p></div>

<p>A discussion and comparison of passages taken from the comedy of Menander and that of Caecilius, entitled Plocium.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I OFTEN read comedies which our poets have adapted and translated from the Greeks—Menander or Posidippus, Apollodorus or Alexis, and also some other comic writers. And while I am reading them, they do not seem at all bad; on the contrary, they appear to be written with a wit and charm which you would say absolutely could not be surpassed. But if you compare and place beside them the Greek originals from which they came, and if you match individual passages, reading them together alternately with care and attention, the Latin versions at once begin to appear exceedingly commonplace and mean; so dimmed are they by the wit and brilliance of the Greek comedies, which they were unable to rival.</p>

<p>Only recently I had an experience of this kind. I was reading the <hi rend="italic">Plocium</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Necklace</hi> of Caecilius, much to the delight of myself and those who were present. The fancy took us to read also the <hi rend="italic">Plocium</hi> of Menander, from which Caecilius had translated the said comedy. But after we took Menander in hand, good Heavens! how dull and lifeless, and how different from Menander did Caecilius appear!  <pb n="v1.p.195"/>  Upon my word, the armour of Diomedes and of Glaucus were not more different in value.

<note>Homer (<hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> vi. 234 ff) tells us that Diomedes proposed to exchange armour with Glaucus in token of friendship. Diomedes' arms of bronze cost nine oxen; those of Glaucus, inlaid with gold, a hundred. Hence <quote>gold for bronze</quote> became proverbial.</note>
Our reading had reached the passage where the aged husband was complaining of his rich and ugly wife, because he had been forced to sell his maid-servant, a girl skilled at her work and very good looking, since his wife suspected her of being his mistress. I shall say nothing of the great difference; but I have had the lines of both poets copied and submitted to others for their decision. This is Menander:

<note>Fr. 402, Kock; p. 428, <hi rend="italic">L.C.L.</hi></note>

<note>vv. 142ff., Ribbeck<hi rend="sup">3</hi>.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>In very truth is he a wretched man,</l> <l>Who cannot hide his woe away from home;</l>  <pb n="v1.p.197"/>  <l>And that my wife makes me by looks and acts:</l> <l>If I kept still, I should betray myself</l> <l>No less.

<p>Now, not to mention the charm of subject matter and diction, which is by no means the same in the two books, I notice this general fact—that some of Menander's lines, brilliant, apt and witty, Caecilius has not attempted to reproduce, even where lie might have done so; but he has passed them by as if they were of no value, and has dragged in some other farcical stuff; and what Menander took from actual life, simple, realistic and delightful, this for some reason or other Caecilius has missed. For example, that same old husband, talking with another old man, a neighbour of his, and cursing the arrogance of his rich wife, says:

<note>Fr. 403, Kock; p. 428, <hi rend="italic">L. C. L.</hi></note>
<pb n="v1.p.199"/>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>I have to wife an heiress ogress, man!</l> <l>I did not tell you that? What, really? no?</l> <l>She is the mistress of my house and lands,</l> <l>Of all that's hereabout. And in return</l> <l>I have by Zeus! the hardest of hard things.</l> <l>She scolds not only me, but her son too,</l> <l>Her daughter most of all.—You tell a thing</l> <l>There's no contending with.—I know it well.</l></quote>  But in this passage Caecilius chose rather to play the buffoon than to be appropriate and suitable to the character that he was representing. For this is the way he spoiled the passage:

<note>vv. 158 ff., Ribbeck<hi rend="sup">3</hi>. </note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>But tell me, sir; is your wife captious, pray?—</l> <l>How can you ask?—But in what manner, then?—</l> <l>I am ashamed to tell. When I come home</l> <l>And sit beside her, she with fasting

<note>That is, <quote>nauseous.</quote></note>
breath</l> <l>Straight kisses me.—There's no mistake in that.</l> <l>She'd have you spew up what you've drunk abroad.</l></quote></p>

<p>It is clear what your judgment ought to be about that scene also, found in both comedies, which is about of the following purport: The daughter of a poor man was violated during a religious vigil. This was unknown to her father, and she was looked upon as a virgin. Being with child as the result of that assault, at the proper time she is in labour. An honest slave, standing before the door of the house, knowing nothing of the approaching delivery of his master's daughter, and quite unaware that violence had been offered her, hears the groans and prayers of the girl labouring in childbirth; he gives expression to his fear, anger, suspicion, pity and grief. In the Greek comedy all these emotions and  <pb n="v1.p.201"/>  feelings of his are wonderfully vivid and clear, but in Caecilius they are all dull and without any grace and dignity of expression. Afterwards, when the same slave by questioning has found out what has happened, in Menander he utters this lament:

<note>Fr. 404, Kock; p. 430, <hi rend="italic">L. C. L.</hi></note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Alas! thrice wretched he who weds, though poor,</l> <l>And children gets. How foolish is the man</l> <l>Who keeps no watch o'er his necessities,</l> <l>And if he luckless be in life's routine,</l> <l>Can't use his wealth as cloak, but buffeted</l> <l>By ev'ry storm, lives helpless and in grief.</l> <l>All wretchedness he shares, of blessings none,</l> <l>Thus sorrowing for one I'd all men warn.</l></quote>  Let us consider whether Caecilius was sufficiently inspired to approach the sincerity and realism of these words. These are the lines of Caecilius, in which he gives some mangled fragments from Menander, patching them with the language of tragic bombast:

<note>vv. 169 ff., Ribbeck.<hi rend="sup">2</hi></note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Unfortunate in truth the man, who poor,</l> <l>Yet children gets, to share his poverty.</l> <l>His fortune and his state at once are clear;</l> <l>The ill fame of the rich their set conceals.</l></quote></p>

<p>Accordingly, as I said above, when I read these passages of Caecilius by themselves, they seem by no means lacking in grace and spirit, but when I compare and match them with the Greek version, I feel that Caecilius should not have followed a guide with whom he could not keep pace.</p>

<p>On the ancient frugality; and on early sumptuary laws.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>FRUGALITY among the early Romans, and moderation in food and entertainments were secured not only by observance and training at home, but also by public penalties and the inviolable provisions of numerous laws. Only recently I read in the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi>

<note>Fr. 5, Huschke; 6, Bremer.</note>
of Ateius Capito an old decree of the senate, passed in the consulship of Gaius Fannius and Marcus Valerius Messala,

<note>161 B.C.</note>
which provides that the leading citizens, who according to ancient usage <quote>interchanged</quote> at the Melagesian games

<note>The Megalensian or Megalesian festival, on April 4. The games eventually extended from the 4th to the 10th inclusive. Only the nobles gave dinner parties on the 4th; the plebeians celebrated at the Cerealia, April 19.</note>
(that is, acted as host to one another in rotation), should take oath before the consuls in set terms, that they would not spend on each dinner more than one hundred and twenty asses in addition to vegetables, bread and wine; that they would not serve foreign, but only native, wine, nor use at table more than one hundred pounds' weight of silverware.</p>

<p>But subsequent to that decree of the senate the law of Fannius was passed, which allowed the expenditure of one hundred asses a day at the Roman and the plebeian games,

<note>The <hi rend="italic">ludi Romani</hi> in Cicero's time extended from Sept. 5 to 19; the <hi rend="italic">ludi plebei,</hi> at first probably held on one day, finally lasted from Nov. 4 to 17.</note>
at the Saturnalia,

<note>Originally on Dec. 17; extended to seven days, of which five (under Augustus, three) were legal holidays.</note>
and on certain other days; of thirty asses on ten additional days each month; but on all other days of only ten. This is the law to which the poet Lucilius alludes when he says:

<note>1172, Marx.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>The paltry hundred pence of Fannius.</l></quote>  <pb n="v1.p.205"/>  In regard to this some of the commentators on Lucilius have been mistaken in thinking that Fannius' law authorized a regular expenditure of a hundred asses on every kind of day. For, as I have stated above, Fannius authorized one hundred asses on certain holidays which he expressly named, but for all other days he limited the daily outlay to thirty asses for some days and to ten for others.</p>

<p>Next the Licinian law was passed

<note>Probably in 103 B.C.</note>
which, while allowing the outlay of one hundred asses on designated days, as did the law of Fannius, conceded two hundred asses for weddings and set a limit of thirty for other days; however, after naming a fixed weight of dried meat and salted provisions for each day, it granted the indiscriminate and unlimited use of the products of the earth, vine and orchard. This law the poet Laevius mentions in his <hi rend="italic">Erotopaegnia.</hi>

<note>Fr. 23, Bährens, <hi rend="italic">Fray. Poet. Rom.,</hi> p. 292. <hi rend="italic">Erotopaegnia</hi> means <quote>Playful Verses about Love</quote> ; a sixth book is cited by Charisius (i. 204 K). One fragment indicates that Laevius was a contemporary of Varro. His brief and scanty fragments show great variety in metre (cf. Prisc. ii. 258 K), and innovations in diction (Gell. xix. 7.)</note>
These are the words of Laevius, by which he means that a kid that had been brought for a feast was sent away and the dinner served with fruit and vegetables, as the Licinian law had provided:  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>The Licinian law is introduced,</l> <l>The liquid light to the kid restored.</l></quote>  Lucilius also has the said law in mind in these words:  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Let us evade the law of Licinius.

<note>1200, Marx.</note>
</l></quote></p>

<p>Afterwards, when these laws were illegible from the rust of age and forgotten, when many men of abundant means were gormandizing, and recklessly  <pb n="v1.p.207"/>  pouring their family and fortune into an abyss of dinners and banquets, Lucius Sulla in his dictatorship proposed a law to the people, which provided that on the Kalends, Ides and Nones, on days of games, and on certain regular festivals, it should be proper and lawful to spend three hundred sesterces on a dinner, but on all other days no more than thirty.</p>

<p>Besides these laws we find also an Aemilian law,

<note>78 B. C. Another Aemilian sumptuary law was passed in 115 B.C.</note>
setting a limit not on the expense of dinners, but on the kind and quantity of food.</p>

<p>Then the law of Antius,

<note>Passed a few years after the Aemilian law.</note>
besides curtailing outlay, contained the additional provision, that no magistrate or magistrate elect should dine out anywhere, except at the house of stipulated persons.</p>

<p>Lastly, the Julian law came before the people during the principate of Caesar Augustus,

<note>Cf. Suet. <hi rend="italic">Aug.</hi> xxxiv, 1.</note>
by which on working days two hundred sesterces is the limit, on the Kalends, Ides and Nones and some other holidays, three hundred, but at weddings and the banquets following them, a thousand.</p>

<p>Ateius Capito says

<note>Fr, 6, Huschke; 7, Bremer.</note>
that there is still another Edict—but whether of the deified Augustus or of Tiberius Caesar I do not exactly remember—by which the outlay for dinners on various festal days was increased from three hundred sesterces to two thousand, to the end that the rising tide of luxury night be restrained at least within those limits.</p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>IN the Latin language, just as in Greek, some have thought that the principle of <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)nalogi/a</foreign> should be followed, others that of <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)nwmali/a.</foreign> is the similar inflection of similar words, which some call in Latin <hi rend="italic">proportio,</hi> or <quote>regularity.</quote> <foreign xml:lang="grc">)Anwmali/a</foreign> is irregularity in inflection, following usage.

<note>That is, <hi rend="italic">pransus, potus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cenatus</hi> are used in an active sense; see Cic. <hi rend="italic">pro Mil.</hi> 56, adde inscitiam pransi, poti, oscitantis ducis, and Priscian (ii. 665. 17, Keil) ut <quote>cenatus sum</quote> . . pro <quote>cenavi.</quote></note>

<note>Charisius (i. 217. 8, Keil), cites <hi rend="italic">rare</hi> from Cicero, Cato and Plautus, but the modern texts do not admit the form.</note>

<p>Discourses of Marcus Fronto and the philosopher Favorinus on the varieties of colours and their Greek and Latin names: and incidentally, the nature of the colour <hi rend="italic">spadix.</hi></p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>WHEN the philosopher Favorinus was on his way to visit the exconsul Marcus Fronto, who was ill with the gout, he wished me also to go with him. And when there at Fronto's, where a number of learned men were present, a discussion took place about colours and their names, to the effect that the shades of colours are manifold, but the names for them are few and indefinite, Favorinus said: "More distinctions of colour are detected by the eye than are expressed by words and terms. For leaving out of account other incongruities, your simple colours, red (<hi rend="italic">rufus</hi>) and green <hi rend="italic">viridiss</hi>), have single names, but many different shades. And that poverty in names I find more pronounced in Latin than in Greek. For the colour red <hi rend="italic">Rufuss</hi>) does in fact get its name from redness, but although fire is one kind of red, blood  <pb n="v1.p.213"/>  another, purple another, saffron another, and gold still another, yet the Latin tongue does not indicate these special varieties of red by separate and individual words, but includes them all under the one term <hi rend="italic">rubor,</hi> except in so far as it borrows names from the things themselves, and calls anything ' fiery,' ' flaming,' 'blood-red,' 'saffron' 'purple' and 'golden.' For <hi rend="italic">russus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rubber</hi> are no doubt derived from <hi rend="italic">rufus,</hi> and do not indicate all its special varieties, but <foreign xml:lang="grc">canqo/s</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)ruqro/s</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">purro/s</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">kirro/s</foreign>

<note><foreign xml:lang="grc">kirro/s</foreign> <quote>tawny, orange-tawny</quote> designates a shade between <foreign xml:lang="grc">canqo/s,</foreign> <quote>yellow,</quote> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">purro/s,</foreign> <quote>flame-coloured.</quote></note>
and <foreign xml:lang="grc">foi=nic</foreign> seem to mark certain differences in the colour red, either intensifying it or making it lighter, or qualifying it by the admixture of some shade."</p>

<p>Then Fronto, replying to Favorinus, said: "I do not deny that the Greek language, which you seem to prefer, is richer and more copious than ours; but nevertheless in naming these colours of which you have just spoken we are not quite so badly off as you think. For <hi rend="italic">russus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ruber,</hi> which you have just mentioned, are not the only words that denote the colour red, but we have others also, more numerous than those which you have quoted from the Greek. For fihlvus, flavus, rubidus, poeniceus, <hi rend="italic">rutilus, luteus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">spadix</hi> are names of the colour red, which either brighten it (making it fiery, as it were), or combine it with green, or darken it with black, or make it luminous by a slight addition of gleaming white. For <hi rend="italic">poeniceus,</hi> which you call <foreign xml:lang="grc">foi=nic</foreign> in Greek, belongs to our language, and <hi rend="italic">rutilus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">spadix,</hi> a synonym of <hi rend="italic">poeniceus</hi> which is taken over into Latin from the Greek, <pb n="v1.p.215"/> indicate a rich, gleaming shade of red like that of the fruit of the palm-tree when it is not fully ripened by the sun. And from this <hi rend="italic">spadix</hi> and <hi rend="italic">poeniceus</hi> get their name; for <hi rend="italic">spadix</hi> in Doric is applied to a branch torn from a palm-tree along with its fruit. But the colour <hi rend="italic">fulvus</hi> seems to be a mixture of red and green, in which sometimes green predominates, sometimes red. Thus the poet who was most careful in his choice of words applies <hi rend="italic">fulvus</hi> to an eagle,

<note>Virg. <hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> xi. 751.</note>
to jasper,

<note><hi rend="italic">id.</hi> iv. 261. </note>
to fur caps,

<note><hi rend="italic">id.</hi> vii. 688.</note>
to gold,

<note><hi rend="italic">id.</hi> vii. 279, <hi rend="italic">etc.</hi> </note>
to sand,

<note><hi rend="italic">id.</hi> v. 374, <hi rend="italic">etc.</hi></note>
and to a lion;

<note>ii. 722, <hi rend="italic">etc.</hi></note>
and so Ennius in his <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi> uses <hi rend="italic">fulvus</hi> of air.

<note>454 Vahlen.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Ennius has <hi rend="italic">fulva;</hi> and is so quoted by Gellius in xiii. 21. 14.</note>
<hi rend="italic">Flavus</hi> on the other hand seems to be compounded of green and red and white; thus Virgil speaks of golden hair as <hi rend="italic">flava</hi>

<note><hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> iv. 590.</note>
and applies that adjective also to the leaves of the olive,

<note><hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> v. 309.</note>
which I see surprises some; and thus, much earlier, Pacuvius called water <hi rend="italic">flava</hi> and dust <hi rend="italic">fulvus.</hi>

<note>v. 244, Ribbeck.<hi rend="sup">2</hi></note>
I am glad to quote his verses, for they are most charming:  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Give me thy foot, that with the same soft hands</l> <l>With which oft times I did Ulysses soothe</l> <l>I may with golden (<hi rend="italic">flavis</hi>) waters wash away</l> <l>The tawny (<hi rend="italic">fulvum</hi>) dust and heal thy weariness.</l></quote>"</p>

<p><quote>Now, <hi rend="italic">rubidus</hi> is a darker red and with a larger admixture of black; <hi rend="italic">luteus,</hi> on the other hand, is a more diluted red, and from this dilution its name too seems to be derived. Therefore, my dear Favorinus,</quote> said he, "the shades of red have no more names in Greek than with us. But neither  <pb n="v1.p.217"/>  is the colour green expressed by more terms in your language, and Virgil, when he wished to indicate the green colour of a horse, could perfectly well have called the horse <hi rend="italic">caerulus</hi> rather than <hi rend="italic">glaucus,</hi> but he preferred to use a familiar Greek word, rather than one which was unusual in Latin.

<note><hi rend="italic">Georg.</hi> iii. 82, <hi rend="italic">honest spadices glaucique.</hi> We should use <quote>grey,</quote> rather than <quote>green.</quote> <hi rend="italic">Glaucus</hi> was a greyish green or a greenish grey. Since <hi rend="italic">caerulus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">caeruleus</hi> are not unusual words, Gellius probably means <quote>unusual</quote> as applied to a horse. Ovid, <hi rend="italic">Fasti</hi> iv. 446, uses <hi rend="italic">caeruleus</hi> of the horses of Pluto, but in the sense of <quote>dark, dusky.</quote></note>
Moreover, our earlier writers used <hi rend="italic">caesia</hi> as the equivalent of the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">glaukw=pis,</foreign> as Nigidius says,

<note>Fr. 72, Swoboda.</note>
from the colour of the sky, as if it were originally <hi rend="italic">caelia."</hi></p>

<p>After Fronto had said this, Favorinus, enchanted with his exhaustive knowledge of the subject and his elegant diction, said: <quote>Were it not for you, and perhaps for you alone, the Greek language would surely have come out far ahead; but you, my deal Fronto, exemplify Homer's line:

<note><hi rend="italic">Iiad,</hi> xxiii. 382.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Thou would'st either have won or made the result indecisive.</l></quote>  But not only have I listened with pleasure to all your learned remarks, but in particular in describing the diversity of the colour <hi rend="italic">flavus</hi> you have made me understand these beautiful lines from the fourteenth book of Ennius' <hi rend="italic">Annalns</hi>

<note>v. 384 f., Vahlen 2, who reads <hi rend="italic">placide</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sale.</hi></note>
which before I did not in the least comprehend:  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>The calm sea's golden marble now they skim;</l> <l>Ploughed by the thronging craft, the green seas foam;</l></quote>  for 'the green seas' did not seem to correspond with 'golden marble.' But since, as you have said, <hi rend="italic">flavus</hi> is a colour containing an admixture of green and white, Ennius with the utmost elegance called the foam of the green sea 'golden marble.'</quote></p>

<p>The criticism of Titus Castricius passed upon passages from Sallust and Demosthenes, in which the one described Philip, the other Sertorius.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THIS is Demosthenes' striking and brilliant description of king Philip:

<note><hi rend="italic">De Cor.</hi> 67.</note>
<quote>I saw that Philip himself, with whom we were struggling, had in his desire for empire and absolute power had one eye knocked out, his collar-bone broken, his hand and leg maimed, and was ready to resign any part of his body that fortune chose to take from him, provided that with what remained he might live in honour and glory.</quote> Sallust, desiring to rival this description, in his <hi rend="italic">Histories</hi> thus wrote of the leader Sertorius

<note>i. 88, Maurenbrecher.</note>
: <quote>He won great glory in Spain, while military tribune under the command of Titus Didius, rendered valuable service in the Marsic war in providing troops and arms; but he got no credit for much that was then done under his direction and orders, at first because of his low birth and afterwards through unfriendly historians; but during his lifetime his appearance bore testimony to these deeds, in many scars on his breast, and in the loss of an eye. Indeed, he rejoiced greatly in his bodily disfigurement, caring nothing for what he had lost, because he kept the rest with greater glory.</quote></p>

<p>In his estimate of these words of the two writers Titus Castricius said: <quote>Is it not beyond the range of human capability to rejoice in bodily disfigurement? For rejoicing is a certain exaltation of spirit, delighting in the realization of something greatly desired. How much truer, more natural, and more  <pb n="v1.p.221"/>  in accordance with human limitations is this: ' Giving up whatever part of his body fortune chose to take.' In these words,</quote> said he, <quote>Philip is shown, not like Sertorius, rejoicing in bodily disfigurement, which,</quote> he said, <quote>is unheard of and extravagant, but as a scorner of bodily losses and injuries in his thirst for honour and glory, who in exchange for the fame which he coveted would sacrifice his limbs one by one to the attacks of fortune.</quote></p></div>

<p>That it is uncertain to which deity sacrifices ought to be offered when there is an earthquake.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>WHAT is to be regarded as the cause of earthquakes is not only not obvious to the ordinary understanding and thought of mankind, but it is not agreed even among the natural philosophers whether they are due to the mighty winds that gather in the caverns and hollow places of the earth, or to the ebb and flow of subterranean waters in its hollows, as seems to have been the view of the earliest Greeks, who called Neptune <quote>the Earth Shaker</quote> ; or whether they are the result of something else or due to the divine power of some other god—all this, I say, is not yet a matter of certain knowledge. For that reason the Romans of old, who were not only exceedingly scrupulous and careful in discharging all the other obligations of life, but also in fulfilling religious duties and venerating the immortal gods, whenever they felt an earthquake or received report of one, decreed a holy day on that account, but forbore to declare and specify in the decree, as is commonly  <pb n="v1.p.223"/>  done, the name of the god in whose honour the holy day was to be observed; for fear that by naming one god instead of another they might involve the people in a false observance. If anyone had desecrated that festival, and expiation was therefore necessary, they used to offer a victim <quote>to either the god or goddess,</quote> and Marcus Varro tells us

<note>Fr. 1, p. cliii, Merkel.</note>
that this usage was established by a decree of the pontiffs, since it was uncertain what force, and which of the gods or goddesses, had caused the earthquake.</p>

<p>But in the case of eclipses of the sun or moon they concerned themselves no less with trying to discover the causes of that phenomenon. However, Marcus Cato, although a man with a great interest in investigation, nevertheless on this point expressed himself indecisively and superficially. His words in the fourth book of his <hi rend="italic">Origins</hi> are as follows:

<note>Fr. 77, Peter.</note>

<p>A fable of the Phrygian Aesop, which is well worth telling.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>AESOP, the well-known fabulist from Phrygia, has justly been regarded as a wise man, since he taught what it was salutary to call to mind and to recommend, not in an austere and dictatorial manner, as is the way of philosophers, but by inventing witty and  <pb n="v1.p.225"/>  entertaining fables he put into men's minds and hearts ideas that were wholesome and carefully considered, while at the same time he enticed their attention. For example, this fable of his

<note>A shorter version, of 19 choliambic lines, is given by Babrius, 88; cf. <hi rend="italic">Fabulae Aesopiae,</hi> 210 Halm, and Avianus, 21, (14 elegiac verses).</note>
about the little nest of a birdlet with delightful humour warns us that in the case of things which one can do, hope and confidence should never be placed in another, but in one's own self. <quote>There is a little bird,</quote> he says, <quote>it is called the lark. It lives in the grain-fields, and generally builds its nest at such a time that the harvest is at hand exactly when the young birds are ready to be fledged. Such a lark chanced to have built her nest in a field which had been sown rather early in the year; therefore when the grain was turning yellow, the fledglings were still unable to fly. Accordingly, when the mother went off in search of food for her young, she warned them to notice whether anything unusual was said or done there, and to tell it to her on her return. A little later the owner of that grain-field calls his young son and says: ' Do you not see that this is ripe and already calls for hands? To-morrow then, as soon as it is light, see that you go to our friends and ask them to come and exchange work with us, and help us with this harvest.' So saying, he at once went away. And when the lark returned, the chicks, frightened and trembling, twittered about their mother and implored her to make haste and at once carry them off to some other place; 'for,' said they, 'the master has sent to ask his friends to come at daybreak and reap.' The mother bids them be easy in mind. ' For if the master,' said she, ' has turned the harvesting over to his friends, the field will not be reaped to-morrow, and I need not take you away  <pb n="v1.p.227"/>  to-day.' On the following day the mother flies off to get food. The master waits for those whom he had summoned. The sun grows hot and nothing is done. The day advances and no friends come. Then he says again to his son: 'Those friends of ours are a lot of slackers. why not rather go and ask our relatives and kinsfolk to come to reap early tomorrow?' This, too, the frightened chicks tell their mother. She urges them once again to be without fear and without worry, saying that hardly any relatives and kinsfolk are so obliging as to undertake labour without any delay and to obey a summons at once. 'But do you,' she said, 'observe whether anything more is said.' Next day at dawn the bird left to forage. The relatives and kinsfolk neglected the work which they were asked to do. So finally the owner said to his son: ' Enough of friends and relatives. Bring two scythes at daybreak; I myself will take one and you yourself the other, and tomorrow we ourselves will reap the grain with our own hands.' When the mother heard from her brood that the farmer had said this, she cried: ' It is time to get out and be off; for this time what he said surely will be done. For now it depends on the very man whose business it is, not on another who is asked to do it.' And so the lark moved her nest, the owner harvested his crop.</quote></p>

<p>This then is Aesop's fable, showing that trust in friends and relatives is usually idle and vain. But what different warning do the more highly revered books of the philosophers give us, than that we should rely on ourselves alone, and regard everything else that is outside us and beyond our control as helpful neither to our affairs nor to ourselves? This parable  <pb n="v1.p.229"/>  of Aesop has been rendered in tetrameter verse by Quintus Ennius in his <hi rend="italic">Saturae</hi> most cleverly and gracefully.

<p>An observation on the waves of the sea, which take one form when the wind is from the south, and another when it is from the north.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>IT has often been observed in the motion of the waves caused by the north winds or by any current of air from that quarter of the heaven [that it is different from that caused by] the south and southwest winds. For the waves raised by the blowing of the north wind are very high and follow hard upon one another, but as soon as the wind has ceased, they flatten out and subside, and soon there are no waves at all. But it is not the same when the wind blows from the south or southwest; for although these have wholly ceased to blow, still the waves that they have caused continue to swell, and though they have long been undisturbed by wind, yet the sea keeps continually surging. The reason of this is inferred to be, that the winds from the north, falling upon the sea from a higher part of the sky, are borne straight down, as it were headlong, into the depths of ocean, making waves that are not driven forward, but are set in motion from within; and these, being turned up from beneath, roll only so long as the force of that wind which blows in  <pb n="v1.p.231"/>  from above continues. The south and southwest winds, on the contrary, forced down to the southern zone and the lowest part of the heavens, are lower and flatter, and as they blow over the surface of the sea, they push forward

<note>That is, away from, or before, the wind, so that they are flattened and do not rise in surges.</note>
the waves rather than raise them up. Therefore the waters are not struck from above but are forced forward, and even after the wind has fallen they retain for some time the motion given by the original impulse. Moreover, this very suggestion of mine may be supported by the following lines of Homer, if one reads them carefully. For he wrote thus of the blasts of the south wind:

<note><hi rend="italic">Odyss.</hi> iii. 295.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Then Notus drives huge waves against the western cliff,</l></quote>  but on the other hand he speaks in a different way of boreas, which we call aquilo:

<note><hi rend="italic">Odyss.</hi> v. 296.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>And Boreas aetherborn, uprolling a great wave.</l></quote>  For he means that the waves stirred up by the north winds, which are high and blow from above, are so to speak rolled downward, but that by the south winds, which are lower than these, they are driven forward in an upward direction by a somewhat greater force and pushed up. For that is the meaning of the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">w)qei=,</foreign> as also in another passage:

<note><hi rend="italic">Odyss.</hi> xi. 596.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>The stone toward the hilltop pushed he up.</l></quote></p>

<p>This also has been observed by the most learned investigators of nature, that when the south winds blow, the sea becomes blue and bright, but, under the north winds, darker and more gloomy. I noted the cause of this when I was making excerpts from the <hi rend="italic">Problems</hi> of Aristotle.

<p>A discussion of the question why Sallust said that avarice rendered effeminate, not only a manly soul, but also the very body itself.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>WHEN winter was already waning, we were walking with the philosopher Favorinus in the court of the Titian baths,

<note>Otherwise unknown. The Baths of Titus were <hi rend="italic">Thermae</hi> and the adj. is <hi rend="italic">Titianae.</hi></note>
enjoying the mild warmth of the sun; and there, as we walked, Sallust's <hi rend="italic">Catiline</hi> was being read, a book which Favorinus had seen in the hands of a friend and had asked him to read. The following passage from that book had been recited:

<note>xi. 3.</note>
<quote>Avarice implies a desire for money, which no wise man covets; steeped as it were with noxious poisons, it renders the most manly body and soul effeminate; it is ever unbounded, nor can either plenty or want make it less.</quote> Then Favorinus looked at me and said: <quote>How does avarice make a man's body effeminate? For I seem to grasp in general the meaning of his statement that it has that effect on a manly soul, but how it also makes his body effeminate I do not yet comprehend.</quote> <quote>I too,</quote> said I, <quote>have for a long time been putting myself that question, and if you had not anticipated me, I should of my own accord have asked you to answer it.</quote></p>

<p>Scarcely had I said this with some hesitation, when one of the disciples of Favorinus, who seemed  <pb n="v1.p.237"/>  to be an old hand in the study of literature, broke in: <quote>I once heard Valerius Probus say that Sallust here used a kind of poetic circumlocution, and meaning to say that a man was corrupted by avarice, spoke of his body and soul, the two factors which indicate a man; for man is made up of body and soul.</quote> <quote>Never,</quote> replied Favorinus, <quote>at least, so far as I know, was our Probus guilty of such impertinent and bold subtlety as to say that Sallust, a most skilful artist in conciseness, used poetic paraphrases.</quote></p>

<p>There was with us at the time in the same promenade a man of considerable learning. He too, on being asked by Favorinus whether he had anything to say on the subject, answered to this effect: <quote>We observe that almost all those whose minds are possessed and corrupted by avarice and who have devoted themselves to the acquisition of money from any and every source, so regulate their lives, that compared with money they neglect manly toil and attention to bodily exercise, as they do everything else. For they are commonly intent upon indoor and sedentary pursuits, in which all their vigour of mind and body is enfeebled and, as Sallust says, 'rendered effeminate.'</quote></p>

<p>Then Favorinus asked to have the same words of Sallust read again, and when they had been read, he said: <quote>How then are we to explain the fact, that it is possible to find many men who are greedy for money, but nevertheless have strong and active bodies?</quote> To this the man replied thus: <quote>Your answer is certainly to the point. Whoever,</quote> said he, <quote>is greedy for money, but nevertheless has a body that is strong and in good condition, must necessarily be possessed either by an interest in, or devotion to,  <pb n="v1.p.239"/>  other things as well, and cannot be equally niggardly in his care of himself. For if extreme avarice, to the exclusion of everything else, lay hold upon all a man's actions and desires, and if it extend even to neglect of his body, so that because of that one passion he has regard neither for virtue nor physical strength, nor body, nor soul—then, and then only, can that vice truly be said to cause effeminacy both of body and of soul, since such men care neither for themselves nor for anything else except money.</quote> Then said Favorinus: <quote>Either what you have said is reasonable, or Sallust, through hatred of avarice, brought against it a heavier charge than he could justify.</quote>

<note>The reading of the MSS., <hi rend="italic">potuit,</hi> might perhaps be supported by such expressions as Catull. lxxvi. 16, <hi rend="italic">hocfacias, sire id non pote, sive pole.</hi></note>

<p>Which was the birthday, according to Marcus Varro, of those born before the sixth hour of the night, or after it and in that connection, concerning the duration and limits of the days that are termed <quote>civil</quote> and are reckoned differently all over the world; and in addition, what Quintus Mucius wrote about that woman who claimed freedom from her husband's control illegally, because she had not taken account of the civil year.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>IT is often inquired which day should be considered and called the birthday of those who are born in the third, the fourth, or any other hour of the night; that is, whether it is the day that preceded, or the day that followed, that night. Marcus Varro, in that book of his <hi rend="italic">Human Antiquities</hi> which he wrote <hi rend="italic">On Days,</hi> says:

<note>xiii. Frag. 2, Mirsch.</note>
<quote>Persons who are born during the  <pb n="v1.p.241"/>  twenty-four hours between one midnight and the next midnight are considered to have been born on one and the same day.</quote> From these words it appears that he so apportioned the reckoning of the days, that the birthday of one who is born after sunset, but before midnight, is the day after which that night began; but that, on the other hand, one who is born during the last six hours of the night is considered to have been born on the day which dawned after that night.</p>

<p>However, Varro also wrote in that same book

<note>xiii. Frag. 3, Mirsch.</note>
that the Athenians reckon differently, and that they regard all the intervening time from one sunset to the next as one single day. That the Babylonians counted still differently; for they called by the name of one day the whole space of time between sunrise and the beginning of the next sunrise; but that in the land of Umbria many said that from midday to the following midday was one and the same day. <quote>But this,</quote> he said, <quote>is too absurd. For the birthday of one who is born among the Umbrians at mid-day on the first of the month will have to be considered as both half of the first day of the month and that part of the second day which comes before midday.</quote>

<note>That is, according to the Roman reckoning. By the alleged Umbrian reckoning, the first day of the month would begin at midday and end at the next midday.</note>
</p>

<p>But it is shown by abundant evidence that the Roman people, as Varro said, reckoned each day from midnight to the next midnight. The religious ceremonies of the Romans are performed in part by day, others by night; but those which take place by night are appointed for certain days, not for nights; accordingly, those that take place during the last six hours of the night are said to take place on the day which dawns immediately after that night. <pb n="v1.p.243"/> Moreover, the ceremony and method of taking the auspices point to the same way of reckoning; for the magistrates, whenever they must take the auspices, and transact the business for which they have taken the auspices, on the same day, take the auspices after midnight and transact tile business after midday, when the sun is high, and they are then said to have taken the auspices and acted on the same day. Again, when the tribunes of the commons, who are not allowed to be away from Rome for a whole day, leave the city after midnight and return after the first lighting of the lamps on the following day, but before midnight, they are not considered to have been absent for a whole day, since they returned before the completion of the sixth hour of the night, and were in the city of Rome for some part of that day.</p>

<p>I have read that Quintus Mucius, the jurist, also used to say

<note>Fr. 7, Huschke; <hi rend="italic">Jur. Civ.</hi> iv. 2, Bremer.</note>
that a woman did not become her own mistress who, after entering upon marriage relations with a man on the day called the Kalends of January, left him, for the purpose of emancipating herself, on the fourth day before the Kalends of the following January;

<note>Dec. 27th; December at that time had twenty-nine days.</note>
for the period of three nights, during which the <hi rend="italic">Twelve Tables</hi>

<note>vi. 4.</note>
provided that a woman must be separated from her husband for the purpose of gaining her independence, could not be completed, since the last

<note><hi rend="italic">Posterioris</hi> is nom. pl. See Varro <hi rend="italic">De Ling. Lat.</hi> viii. 66.</note>
six hours of the third night belonged to the next year, which began on the first of January.</p>

<p>Now since I found all the above details about the duration and limits of days, pertaining to the observance and the system of ancient law, in the works of our early writers, I did not doubt that Virgil also  <pb n="v1.p.245"/>  indicated the same thing, not directly and openly, but, as became one treating poetic themes, by an indirect and as it were veiled allusion to ancient observance. He says:

<note><hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> v. 738. </note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>For dewy Night has wheeled her way</l> <l>Far past her middle course; the panting steeds</l> <l>Of orient Morn breathe pitiless on me.</l></quote>  For in these lines he wished to remind us covertly, as I have said, that the day which the Romans have called <quote>civil</quote> begins after the completion of the sixth hour of the night.</p></div>

<!--<argument>-->

<p>On investigating and identifying the comedies of Plautus, since the genuine and the spurious without distinction are said to have been inscribed with his name; and further as to the report that Plautus wrote plays in a bakery and Naevius in prison.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I AM convinced of the truth of the statement which I have heard made by men well trained in literature, who have read a great many plays of Plautus with care and attention: namely, that with regard to the so-called <quote>doubtful</quote> plays they would

<note><hi rend="italic">Crediturum</hi> seems an archaism for <hi rend="italic">credituros;</hi> see i. 7.</note>
trust, not the lists of Aelius or Sedigitus or Claudius or Aurelius or Accius or Manilius, but Plautus himself and the characteristic features of his manner and diction. Indeed, this is the criterion which we find Varro using. For in addition to those one and twenty known as <quote>Varronian,</quote> which he set apart from the rest because they were not questioned but by common consent were attributed to Plautus, he accepted also some others, influenced by the style and humour of their language, which was  <pb n="v1.p.247"/>  characteristic of Plautus; and although these had already been listed under the names of other poets, he claimed them for Plautus: for example, one that I was recently reading, called <hi rend="italic">The Boeotian woman.</hi> For although it is not among those one and twenty and is attributed to Aquilius, still Varro had not the least doubt that it was Plautine, nor will any other habitual reader of Plautus doubt it, even if lie knows only the following verses from that play, which, since they are, to speak in the manner of that famous poet, most Plautine, I recall and have noted down. There a hungry parasite speaks as follows:

<note>Fr. v. 21 Götz; ii, p. 38, Ribbeck. Translation by Thornton and Warner.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>The gods confound the man who first found out</l> <l>How to distinguish hours! Confound him, too,</l> <l>Who in this place set up a sun-dial</l> <l>To cut and hack my days so wretchedly</l> <l>Into small portions! When I was a boy,</l> <l>My belly was my only sun-dial, one more sure,</l> <l>Truer, and more exact than any of them.</l> <l>This dial told me when 'twas proper time</l> <l>To go to dinner, when I had aught to eat;</l> <l>But nowadays, why even when I have,</l> <l>I can't fall to unless the sun gives leave.</l> <l>The town's so full of these confounded dials</l> <l>The greatest part of the inhabitants,</l> <l>Shrunk up with hunger, crawl along the streets.</l></quote></p>

<p>My master Favorinus too, when I was reading the <hi rend="italic">Nervularia</hi> of Plautus, and he had heard this line of the comedy:

<note>Fr. v. 100 Götz; translation by Thornton and Warner.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Old, wheezing, physicky, mere foundered hags</l> <l>With dry, parched, painted hides, shrivell'd and shrunk,</l></quote>  <pb n="v1.p.249"/>  delighted with the wit of the archaic words that describe the ugly defects of harlots, cried: <quote>By heaven! just this one verse is enough to convince one that the play is Plautine.</quote></p>

<p>I myself too a little while ago, when reading the <hi rend="italic">Fretum</hi>—that is the name of a comedy which some think is not Plautine—had no manner of doubt that it was by Plautus and in fact of all his plays the most authentic. From it I copied these two lines,

<note>Fr. v. 76, Götz.</note>
with the intention of looking up the story of the Arretine oracle:

<note>Nothing is known of this oracle. The inferior manuscripts and earlier editors read <hi rend="italic">Arictini</hi> and interpreted it as that of Jupiter Ammon, because that god is sometimes represented as a ram (<hi rend="italic">aries</hi>), or with a ram's head. According to Bicheler, <hi rend="italic">Thes. Ling. Lat.</hi> ii. 636. 9, the reference is to a person, not to the town of Arretium. Text and meaning are most uncertain.</note>
</p>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Now here we have at the great games

<note>According to Bücheler, <hi rend="italic">T.L.L.</hi> ii. 636. 9, the reference is to the <hi rend="italic">ludi Romani,</hi> Sept. 5–19.</note>
the Arretine response:</l> <l>I perish if I don't, and if I do, I'm flogged.</l></quote>

<p>Yet Marcus Varro, in the first book of his <hi rend="italic">Comedies of Plautus,</hi>

<note>Fr. p. 193, Bipont.</note>
quotes these words of Accius:

<note>Didascalica, fr. inc., Müller.</note>
<quote>For not the <hi rend="italic">Twin Panders</hi> nor the <hi rend="italic">Slave-ring</hi> nor the <hi rend="italic">Old Woman</hi> were the work of Plautus, nor were ever the <hi rend="italic">Twice Violated</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Boeotian woman,</hi> nor were the <hi rend="italic">Clownish Rustic</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Partners in, Death</hi> the work of Titus Maccius.</quote>

<note>On this passage see Leo, <hi rend="italic">Plaut. Forsch.,</hi> p. 32, who sees three categories: three plays under the name of Plautus, two under that of Titus Maccius, and two (<hi rend="italic">Agroecus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Boeotia</hi> ) anonymous.</note>
</p>

<p>In that same book of Varro's we are told also that there was another writer of comedies called Plautius. Since his plays bore the title <quote>Plauti,</quote>

<note>The early gen. both of <hi rend="italic">Plautius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Plautus.</hi> 249 </note>
they were accepted as Plautine, although in fact they were not Plautine by Plautus, but Plautinian by Plautius.</p>  <pb n="v1.p.251"/>

<p>Now there are in circulation under the name of Plautus about one hundred and thirty comedies; but that most learned of men Lucius Aelius thought that only twenty-five of them were his.

<note>p. 58. 4, Fun.</note>
However, there is no doubt that those which do not appear to have been written by Plautus but are attached to his name, were the work of poets of old but were revised and touched up by him, and that is why they savour of the Plautine style. Now Varro and several others have recorded that the <hi rend="italic">Saturio,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Addictus,</hi> and a third comedy, the name of which I do not now recall, were written by Plautus in a bakery, when, after losing in trade all the money which he had earned in employments connected with the stage, he had returned penniless to Rome, and to earn a livelihood had hired himself out to a baker, to turn a mill, of the kind which is called a <quote>push-mill.</quote>

<note>

<p>A large mill with two handles, which two men, ordinarily slaves, pushed (<hi rend="italic">truso,</hi> cf. <hi rend="italic">trudo</hi>) upon, in order to turn the mill. Contrasted by Cato (<hi rend="italic">Agr.</hi> x. 4 and xi. 4) with <hi rend="italic">molae asinariae,</hi> which had one handle, to which a horse or an ass was attached and <hi rend="italic">drew</hi> the mill around.</p>

<p>This whole account is discredited by Leo. <hi rend="italic">Plaut., Forsch.,</hi> 70ff., but defended by Marx and others. On this, and on Varro's threefold division of the plays, see Klingelhoefer, <hi rend="italic">Phil. Quart.</hi> iv., pp. 336 ff.</p></note>
</p>

<p>So too we are told of Naevius that he wrote two plays in prison, the <hi rend="italic">Soothsayer</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Leon,</hi> when by reason of his constant abuse and insults aimed at the leading men of the city, after the manner of the Greek poets, he had been imprisoned at Rome by the triumvirs.

<note>The <hi rend="italic">triumviri capitales,</hi> police magistrates, in charge of the public prisons.</note>
And afterwards he was set free by the tribunes of the commons, when he had apologized for his offences and the saucy language with which he had previously assailed many men.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I FOUND it stated in books which I read dealing with the life of Publius Scipio Africanus, that Publius Scipio, the son of Paulus, after he had celebrated a triumph because of his victory over the Carthaginians and had been censor, was accused before the people by Claudius Asellus, tribune of the commons, whom he had degraded from knighthood during his censorship; and that Scipio, although he was under accusation, neither ceased to shave his beard and to wear white raiment nor appeared in the usual garb of those under accusation. But since it is certain that at that time Scipio was less than forty years old, I was surprised at the statement about shaving his beard. I have learned, however, that in those same times the other nobles shaved their beards at that time of life, and that is why we see many busts of early men represented in that way, men who were not very old, but in middle life.

<quote>If,</quote> say they, <quote>you place heavy weights on the wood of the palmtree, and load it so heavily and press it down so hard that the burden is too great to bear, the wood does not give way downward, nor is it made concave, but it rises against the weight and struggles upward and assumes a convex form.

<p>A tale from the annals about Quintus Caedicius, tribune of the soldiers; and a passage from the <hi rend="italic">Origins</hi> of Marcus Cato, in which he likens the valour of Caedicius to that of the Spartan Leonidas.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A GLORIOUS deed, by the Gods! and well worthy of the noble strains of Greek eloquence, is that of  <pb n="v1.p.257"/>  the military tribune Quintus Caedicius, recorded by Marcus Cato in his <hi rend="italic">Origins.</hi>

<note>Fr. 83, Peter.</note>
</p>

<p>The actual account runs about as follows: In the first Punic war the Carthaginian general in Sicily advanced to meet the Roman army and was first to take possession of the hills and strategic points. As the result of this, the Roman soldiers made their way into a place exposed to surprise and extreme danger. The tribune went to the consul and pointed out that destruction was imminent from their unfavourable position and from the fact that the enemy had surrounded them. <quote>My advice is,</quote> said he, <quote>if you want to save the day, that you order some four hundred soldiers to advance to yonder wart</quote> —for that is Cato's term for a high and rough bit of ground—<quote>and command and conjure them to hold it. When the enemy see that, undoubtedly all their bravest and most active men will be intent upon attacking and fighting with them; they will devote themselves to that one task, and beyond a doubt all those four hundred will be slaughtered. Then in the meantime, while the enemy is engaged in killing them, you will have time to get the army out of this position. There is no other way of safety but this.</quote> The consul replied to the tribune that the plan seemed to him equally wise; <quote>but who, pray,</quote> said he, <quote>will there be to lead those four hundred men of yours to that place in the midst of the enemy's troops?</quote> <quote>If you find no one else,</quote> answered the tribune, <quote>you may use me for that dangerous enterprise. I offer this life of mine to you and to my country.</quote> The consul thanked and commended the tribune. The tribune and his four hundred marched forth to death. The  <pb n="v1.p.259"/>  enemy marvelled at their boldness; they were on tiptoe of expectation to see where they would go. But when it appeared that they were on their way to occupy that hill, the Carthaginian commander sent against them the strongest men in his army, horse and foot. The Roman soldiers were surrounded; though surrounded, they resisted; the battle was long and doubtful. At last numbers triumphed. Every man of the four hundred fell, including the tribune, either run through with swords or overwhelmed with missiles. Meanwhile the consul, while the battle was raging there, withdrew to a safe position on high ground.</p>

<p>But what, by Heaven's help, befell that tribune, the leader of the four hundred soldiers, in the battle, I have added, no longer using my own words, but giving those of Cato himself, who says: <quote>The immortal gods gave the tribune good fortune equal to his valour; for this is what happened. Although he had been wounded in many places during the battle, yet his head was uninjured, and they recognized him among the dead, unconscious from wounds and loss of blood. They bore him off the field, he recovered, and often after that rendered brave and vigorous service to his country; and by that act of leading that forlorn hope lie saved the rest of the army. But what a difference it makes where you do the same service!

<note>Cf. Sall. <hi rend="italic">Cat.</hi> viii.</note>
The Laconian Leonidas, who performed a like exploit at Thermopylae, because of his valour won unexampled glory and gratitude from all Greece, and was honoured with memorials of the highest distinction; they showed their appreciation of that deed of his by pictures, statues and honorary inscriptions, in their histories, and in other ways; but the tribune  <pb n="v1.p.261"/>  of the soldiers, who had done the same thing and saved an army, gained small glory for his deeds.</quote></p>

<p>With such high personal testimony did Marcus Cato honour this valorous deed of Quintus Caedicius the tribune. But Claudius Quadrigarius, in the third book of his <hi rend="italic">Annals,</hi>

<note>Fr. 42, Peter.</note>
says that the man's name was not Caedicius, but Laberius.</p></div>

<p>A fine letter of the consuls Gaius Fabricius and Quintus Aemilius to king Pyrrhus, recorded by the historian Quintus Claudius.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>AT the time when king Pyrrhus was on Italian soil and had won one or two battles, when the Romans were getting anxious, and the greater part of Italy had gone over to the king, a certain Timochares, an Ambracian and a friend of king Pyrrhus, came stealthily to the consul Gaius Fabricius and asked a reward, promising that if they could come to terms, he would poison the king. This, he said, could easily be done, since his son was the monarch's cup-bearer. Fabricius transmitted this offer to the senate. The senate sent envoys to the king, instructing them not to reveal anything about Timochares, but to warn the king to act with more caution, and be on his guard against the treachery of those nearest to his own person. This, as I have told it, is the version found in the <hi rend="italic">History</hi> of Valerius Antias.

<note>Fr. 21, Peter.</note>
But Quadrigarius, in his third book,

<note>Fr. 40, Peter.</note>
says that it was not Timochares, but Nicias, that approached the consul; that the embassy was not sent by the senate, but by the consuls; and that Pyrrhus thanked and complimented the Roman people in a  <pb n="v1.p.263"/>  letter, besides clothing and returning all the prisoners that were then in his hands.</p>

<p>The consuls at that time were Gaius Fabricius and Quintus Aemilius.

<note>282 B. C.</note>
The letter which they sent to king Pyrrhus about that matter, according to Claudius Quadrigarius, ran as follows:  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>" The Roman consuls greet king Pyrrhus.</l></quote>  We, being greatly disturbed in spirit because of your continued acts of injustice, desire to war with you as an enemy. But as a matter of general precedent and honour, it has seemed to us that we should desire your personal safety, in order that we may have the opportunity of vanquishing you in the field. Your friend Nicias came to us, to ask for a reward if he should secretly slay you. We replied that we had no such wish, and that he could look for no advantage from such an action; at the same time it seemed proper to inform you, for fear that if anything of the kind should happen, the nations might think that it was done with our connivance, and also because we have no desire to make war by means of bribes or rewards or trickery. As for you, if you do not take heed, you will have a fall."</p></div>

<p>The characteristics of the horse of Seius, which is mentioned in the proverb; and as to the colour of the horses which are called <hi rend="italic">spadices;</hi> and the explanation of that term.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>GAVIUS BASSUS in his <hi rend="italic">Commentaries,</hi>

<note>Frag. 4, Fun.</note>
and Julius Modestus in the second book of his <hi rend="italic">Miscellaneous Questions,</hi>

<note>p. 15, Bunte.</note>
tell the history of the horse of Seius, a  <pb n="v1.p.265"/>  tale wonderful and worthy of record. They say that there was a clerk called Gnaeus Seius, and that he had a horse foaled at Argos, in the land of Greece, about which there was a persistent tradition that it was sprung from the breed of horses that had belonged to the Thracian Diomedes, those which Hercules, after slaying Diomedes, had taken from Thrace to Argos. They say that this horse was of extraordinary size, with a lofty neck, bay in colour, with a thick, glossy mane, and that it was far superior to all horses in other points of excellence; but that same horse, they go on to say, was of such a fate or fortune, that whoever owned and possessed it came to utter ruin, as well as his whole house, his family and all his possessions. Thus, to begin with, that Gnaeus Seius who owned him was condemned and suffered a cruel death at the hands of Marcus Antonius, afterwards one of the triumvirs for setting the State in order.

<note><hi rend="italic">Illviri reipublicae constituendae</hi> was the formal designation of the powers conferred upon Antony, Octavian and Lepidus in 43 B C. by the bill of the tribune P. Titius. The so-called <quote>first triumvirate,</quote> in 60 B. C., was a private arrangement by Caesar, Pompey and Crassus.</note>
At that same time Cornelius Dolabella, the consul, on his way to Syria, attracted by the renown of this horse, turned aside to Argos, was fired with a desire to own the animal, and bought it for a hundred thousand sesterces; but Dolabella in his turn was besieged in Syria during the civil war, and slain. And soon afterwards Gaius Cassius, who had besieged Dolabella, carried off this same horse, which had been Dolabella's. It is notorious too that this Cassius, after his party had been vanquished and his army routed, met a wretched end. Then later, after the death of Cassius, Antonius, who had defeated him, sought for this famous horse of Cassius, and after getting possession of it was himself afterwards defeated and deserted in his turn, and died an ignominious death. Hence the proverb,  <pb n="v1.p.267"/>  applied to unfortunate men, arose and is current:</p>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l><quote>That man has the horse of Seius.</quote> </l></quote>

<p>The meaning is the same of that other old proverb, which I have heard quoted thus: <quote>the gold of Tolosa.</quote> For when the town of Tolosa in the land of Gaul was pillaged by the consul Quintus Caepio, and a quantity of gold was found in the temples of that town, whoever touched a piece of gold from that sack died a wretched and agonizing death.</p>

<p>Gavius Bassus reports that he saw this horse at Argos; that it was of incredible beauty and strength and of the richest possible colouring.</p>

<p>This colour, as I have said, we call <hi rend="italic">poeniceus;</hi> the Greeks sometimes name it <foreign xml:lang="grc">foi=nic,</foreign> at others <foreign xml:lang="grc">spa/dic,</foreign> since the branch of the palm (<foreign xml:lang="grc">foi=nic</foreign>), torn from the tree with its fruit, is called <hi rend="italic">spadix.</hi>

<note>See ii. 26, 10. The colour is a purple-red, or reddish purple.</note>

</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>MARCUS VARRO, in the first book of his work entitled <hi rend="italic">Hebdomades</hi> or <hi rend="italic">On Portraits,</hi> speaks of many varied excellencies and powers of the number seven, which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">e(bdoma/s.</foreign> <quote>For that number,</quote> he says, <quote>forms the Greater and the Lesser Bear in the heavens; also the <hi rend="italic">vergiliae,</hi>

<note>So called (from <hi rend="italic">ver</hi> ) because their rising, from April 22 to May 10, marked the beginning of spring.</note>
which  <pb n="v1.p.269"/>  the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">pleia/des</foreign>; and it is likewise the number of those stars which some call 'wandering,' but Publius Nigidius' wanderers.'</quote>

<note>Fr. 87, Swoboda. The planets of the ancients were Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Saturn and Jupiter, to which they added the moon.</note>
Varro also says that there are seven circles in the heavens, perpendicular to its axis. The two smallest of these, which touch the ends of the axis, he says are called <foreign xml:lang="grc">po/loi,</foreign> or <quote>poles</quote> ; but that because of their small diameter they cannot be represented on what is termed an armillary sphere.

<note>An arrangement of rings (<hi rend="italic">armillae</hi>), all circles of a single sphere, intended to show the relative position of the principal celestial circles. The sphere of Ptolemy has the earth in the centre, that of Copernicus the sun. Since the purpose is to show the apparent motions of the solar system, the former is the one most used.</note>
And the zodiac itself is not uninfluenced by the number seven; for the summer solstice occurs in the seventh sign from the winter solstice, and the winter solstice in the seventh after the summer, and one equinox in the seventh sign after the other. Then too those winter days during which the kingfishers nest on the water he says are seven in number.

<note>That is, seven before, and seven after the winter solstice. During these fourteen <quote>halcyon days</quote> the sea was supposed to be perfectly calm.</note>
Besides this, he writes that the course of the moon is completed in four times seven complete days; <quote>for on the twenty-eighth day,</quote> he says, <quote>the moon returns to the same point from which it started,</quote> and he quotes Aristides

<note>A mistake for Aristarchus.</note>
of Samos as his authority for this opinion. In this case he says that one should not only take note of the fact that the moon finishes its journey in four times seven, that is eight and twenty, days, but also that this number seven, if, beginning with one and going on until it reaches itself, it includes the sum of all the numbers through which it has passed and then adds itself, makes the number eight and twenty, which is the number of days of the revolution of the moon.

<note>That is, the sum of the numbers 1 to 7 inclusive is 28.</note>
He says that the influence of that number  <pb n="v1.p.271"/>  extends to and affects also the birth of human beings. <quote>For,</quote> says he, <quote>when the life-giving seed has been introduced into the female womb, in the first seven days it is compacted and coagulated and rendered fit to take shape. Then afterwards in the fourth hebdomad the rudimentary male organ, the head, and the spine which is in the back, are formed. But in the seventh hebdomad, as a rule, that is, by the forty-ninth day,</quote> says he, <quote>the entire embryo is formed in the womb.</quote> He says that this power also has been observed in that number, that before the seventh month neither male nor female child can be born in health and naturally, and that those which are in the womb the most regular time are born two hundred and seventy-three days after conception, that is, not until the beginning of the fortieth hebdomad. Of the periods dangerous to the lives and fortunes of all men, which the Chaldaeans call <quote>climacterics,</quote> all the gravest are combinations of the number seven. Besides this, he says that the extreme limit of growth of the human body is seven feet. That, in my opinion, is truer than the statement of Herodotus, the story-teller, in the first book of his <hi rend="italic">History,</hi>

<note>i. 68.</note>
that the body of Orestes was found under ground, and that it was seven cubits in height, that is, twelve and a quarter feet; unless, as Homer thought,

<note><hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> v. 302:  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l part="F"><foreign xml:lang="grc">o( de\ xerma/dion la/be xeiri\</foreign></l> <l><foreign xml:lang="grc">Tudei/dhs, me/ga e)/rgon, o(\ ou) du/o g' a)/ndre fe/roien,</foreign></l> <l><foreign xml:lang="grc">Oi(=oi nu=n brotoi/ ei)s': o( de/ min r(e/a pa/lle kai\ oi)=os.</foreign></l></quote> xii. 383; etc.</note>
the men of old were larger and taller of stature, but now, because the world is ageing, as it were, men and things are diminishing in size. The teeth too, he says, appear  <pb n="v1.p.273"/>  in the first seven months seven at a time in each jaw, and fall out within seven years, and the back teeth are added, as a rule, within twice seven years. He says that the physicians who use music as a remedy declare that the veins of men, or rather their arteries, are set in motion according to the number seven,

<note>That is, by the use of the seven-stringed lyre. </note>
and this treatment they call <foreign xml:lang="grc">th\n dia\ tessa/rwn sumfwni/an,</foreign>

<note>The harmony produced by the striking of four different strings.</note>
because it results from the harmony of four tones. He also believes that the periods of danger in diseases have greater violence on the days which are made up of the number seven, and that those days in particular seem to be, as the physicians call them, <foreign xml:lang="grc">krisi/moi</foreign> or <quote>critical</quote> ; namely, the first, second and third hebdomad. And Varro does not fail to mention a fact which adds to the power and influence of the number seven, namely, that those who resolve to die of starvation do not meet their end until the seventh day.</p>

<p>These remarks of Varro about the number seven show painstaking investigation. But he has also brought together in the same place others which are rather trifling: for example, that there are seven wonderful works in the world, that the sages of old were seven, that the usual number of rounds in the races in the circus is seven, and that seven champions were chosen to attack Thebes. Then he adds in that book the further information that he has entered upon the twelfth hebdomad of his age, and that up to that day he has completed seventy hebdomads of books,

<note>Only 39 titles have come down to us, through Hieronymus, <hi rend="italic">De Vir. Ill.</hi> 54, whose catalogue is unfinished and also includes ten <hi rend="italic">libri singulares</hi> under one head. Ritschl estimated Varro's publications as 74 works, comprising 620 books.</note>
of which a considerable number were destroyed when his library was plundered, at the time of his proscription.

<note>By Antony in 43 B. C. Varro was saved from death by Fufius Calenus, and died in 27 B.C., at the age of nearly ninety.</note>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As to the age of Homer and of Hesiod opinions differ. Some, among whom are Philochorus

and Xenophanes,

<note>Poet, Phil. Frag. 13, Diels; Poesis Ludib. fr. 5, p. 191, Wachsmuth.</note>

<note><hi rend="italic">Iliad.</hi> 1. 1.</note>
that Achilles was the son of Peleus, does not inform us who Peleus was; and this he unquestionably would have done, if he did not know that the information had already been given by Hesiod.

<note>Frag. 102, Rzach.</note>
Again, in the case of Cyclops,</quote> says Accius, <quote>he would not have failed to note such a striking characteristic and to make particular mention of the fact that he was oneeyed, were it not that this was equally well known from the poems of his predecessor Hesiod.</quote>

<note><hi rend="italic">Theogony,</hi> 14 2.</note>
</p>

<p>Also as to Homer's native city there is the very greatest divergence of opinion. Some say that he was from Colophon, some from Smyrna; others  <pb n="v1.p.277"/>  assert that he was an Athenian, still others, an Egyptian; and Aristotle declares

<p>Now the point of all this argument, which Varro sets forth acutely, it is true, but somewhat obscurely, is this: <hi rend="italic">dimidiatum</hi> is equivalent to <hi rend="italic">dismediatum,</hi> and means <quote>divided into two parts,</quote> and therefore <hi rend="italic">dimidiatum</hi> cannot properly be used except of the thing itself that is divided; <hi rend="italic">dimidium,</hi> however, is not that which is itself divided, but is one of the parts of what has been divided. Accordingly, when we wish to say that we have read the half part of a book or heard the half part of a play, if we say <hi rend="italic">dimidiam fabulam</hi> or <hi rend="italic">dimidium librum,</hi> we make a mistake; for in that case you are using <hi rend="italic">dimidium</hi> of the whole thing which has been halved and divided. Therefore Lucilius, following this same rule, says:

<note>1342, Marx.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>With one eye and two feet, like halved pig,</l></quote>  and in another place:

<note>1282 f., Marx.</note>
<pb n="v1.p.283"/>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>why not? To sell his trash the huckster lauds</l> <l>(The rascal!) half a shoe, a strigil split.</l></quote>  Again in his twentieth book it is clearer still that Lucilius carefully avoids saying <hi rend="italic">dimidiam horam,</hi> but puts <hi rend="italic">dimidium</hi> in the place of <hi rend="italic">dimnidiam</hi> in the following lines:

<note><hi rend="italic">570,</hi> Marx.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>At its own season and the self-same time,</l> <l>The half an hour and three at least elapsed,</l> <l>At the fourth hour again.

<note>The meaning is very uncertain. Marx thinks that the reference is to the quartam ague, "the attacks of which regularly subside at the same time (<hi rend="italic">eandem ad quartam horam.</hi>), after a minimum duration of three hours and a half.' Lucilius refers, not to the fourth hour of the day (<hi rend="italic">non diei horam dicit</hi>), but to every fourth hour of the period of illness (<hi rend="italic">totius temporis spatii quo aegrotus cubat febri correptus). Dumtaxat</hi> is to be taken with the numeral, as in Plaut. <hi rend="italic">Truc. 445.</hi> For <hi rend="italic">ad quartam</hi> he cites Seneca, <hi rend="italic">Nat. Quaest.</hi> iii. 16. 2, <hi rend="italic">quartana ad horam venit,</hi> and Suet. <hi rend="italic">Aug.</hi> lxxxvii, 1, <hi rend="italic">ad Kalendas Graecas soluturos.</hi></note>
</l></quote>  For while it was natural and easy to say <quote>three and a half elapsed,</quote> he watchfully and carefully shunned an improper term. From this it is quite clear that not even <quote>half an hour</quote> can properly be said, but we must say either <quote>a halved hour</quote> or <quote>the halt part of an hour.</quote> And so Plautus as well, in the <hi rend="italic">Bacchides,</hi>

<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Down to the navel now the halved day is dead.</l></quote>  <pb n="v1.p.285"/>  Marcus Cato, too, in his work <hi rend="italic">On Farming,</hi> writes:

<p>The variations in the period of gestation reported by physicians and philosophers; and incidentally the views also of the ancient poets on that subject and many other noteworthy and interesting particulars; and the words of the physician Hippocrates, quoted verbatim from his book entitled <foreign xml:lang="grc">Peri\ Trofh=s.</foreign>

<note>On Nurture.</note>
</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>BOTH physicians and philosophers of distinction have investigated the duration of the period of gestation in man. The general opinion, now accepted as correct, is that after the womb of a woman has conceived the seed, the child is born rarely in the seventh month, never in the eighth, often in the ninth, more often in the tenth in number; and that the end of the tenth month, not its beginning, is  <pb n="v1.p.289"/>  the extreme limit of human gestation. And this we find the ancient poet Plautus saying in his comedy the <hi rend="italic">Cistellaria,</hi> in these words:

<note>162. </note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>And then the girl whom he did violate</l> <l>Brought forth a daughter when ten months had sped.</l></quote>  That same thing is stated by Menander also, a still older poet and exceedingly well informed as to current opinion; I quote his words on that subject from the play called <hi rend="italic">Plocium</hi> or <hi rend="italic">The Necklace:</hi>

<note>Fr. 413, Kock.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>The woman is ten months with child . . .</l></quote>  But although our countryman Caecilius wrote a play with the same name and of the same plot, and borrowed extensively from Menander, yet in naming the months of delivery he did not omit the eighth, which Menander had passed by. These are the lines from Caecilius:

<note>164, Ribbeck<hi rend="sup">3</hi>.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>And may a child in the tenth month be born?—</l> <l>By Pollux! in the ninth, and seventh, and eighth.</l></quote>  Marcus Varro leads us to believe that Caecilius did not make this statement thoughtlessly or differ without reason from Menander and from the opinions of many men. For in the fourteenth book of his <hi rend="italic">Divine Antiquities</hi> he has left the statement on record that parturition sometimes takes place in the eighth month.

<note>Fr. 12, Agahd.</note>
In this book he also says that sometimes a child may be born even in the eleventh month, and he cites Aristotle

<note><hi rend="italic">Hist. Anim.</hi> vii. 4.</note>
as authority for his statement in regard both to the eighth and the eleventh month. Now, the reason for this disagreement as  <pb n="v1.p.291"/>  to the eighth month may be found in Hippocrates' work entitled <foreign xml:lang="grc">Peri\ Trofh=s,</foreign> or <hi rend="italic">On Nurture,</hi> from which these words are taken

<note>ii. p. 23, Kühn; vol. 1, p. 356, xlii, <hi rend="italic">L.C.L.</hi> The text is not the same as that of Gellius, but the meaning is practically the same.</note>
<quote>Eighth-month's children exist and do not exist.</quote> This statement, so obscure, abrupt, and apparently contradictory, is thus explained by the physician Sabinus, who wrote a very helpful commentary on Hippocrates: <quote>They exist, since they appear to live after the miscarriage; but they do not exist, since they die afterwards; they exist and do not exist therefore, since they live for the moment in appearance, but not in reality.</quote></p>

<p>But Varro says

<note><hi rend="italic">l. c.</hi></note>
that the early Romans did not regard such births as unnatural rarities, but they did believe that a woman was delivered according to nature in the ninth or tenth month, and in no others, and that for this reason they gave to the three Fates names derived from bringing forth, and from the ninth and tenth months. <quote>For <hi rend="italic">Parca,</hi></quote> says he, <quote>is derived from <hi rend="italic">partuis</hi> with the change of one letter, and likewise <hi rend="italic">Nona</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Decima</hi> from the period of timely delivery.</quote>

<note>These are the Roman names of the Fates. The Greek Clotho, Lachesis and Atropos were adopted with the rest of the Greek mythology.</note>
But Caesellius Vindex in his <hi rend="italic">Ancient Readings</hi> says: ' The names of the Fates are three: <quote xml:lang="la">Nona, Decuma, Morta</quote>; and he quotes this verse from the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> of Livius, the earliest of our poets,

<note>Fr. 12, Bährens.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>When will the day be present that Morta has predicted?</l></quote>  But Caesellius, though a man not without learning, took <hi rend="italic">Morta</hi> as a name, when he ought to have taken it as equivalent to Mocra.

<note><hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">Moi=ra,</foreign> Fate.</note>
</p>  <pb n="v1.p.293"/>

<p>Furthermore, besides what I have read in books about human gestation,

<note>XII Tab. iv. 4, Schöll. The fragment is not extant, but it is cited also by Ulpian, <hi rend="italic">Dig.</hi> xxxviii. 16. 3. 11: post decem menses mortis natus non admittetur ad legitimam hereditatem.</note>
also heard of the following case, which occurred in Rome: A woman of good and honourable character, of undoubted chastity, gave birth to a child in the eleventh month after her husband's death, and because of the reckoning of the time the accusation was made that she had conceived after the death of her husband, since the decemvirs had written that a child is born in ten months and not in the eleventh month. The deified Hadrian, however, having heard the case, decided that birth might also occur in the eleventh month, and I myself have read the actual decree with regard to the matter. In that decree Hadrian declares that he makes his decision after looking up the views of the ancient philosophers and physicians.</p>

<p>This very day I chanced to read these words in a satire of Marcus Varro's entitled <hi rend="italic">The Will:</hi>

<note>Fr. 543, Bücheler<hi rend="sup">3</hi>.</note>
<quote>If one or more sons shall be born to me in ten months, let them be disinherited, if they are asses in music;

<note>That is, <quote>stupid,</quote> <quote>half-witted.</quote></note>
but if one be born to me in the eleventh month, according to Aristotle,

<note><hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> as Aristotle says may happen; <hi rend="italic">Hist. Anim.</hi> vii. 4.</note>
let Attius have the same rights under my will as Tettius.</quote> Just as it used commonly to be said of things that did not differ from each other, <quote>let Attius be as Tettius,</quote> so Varro means by this old proverb that children born in ten months and in eleven are to have the same and equal rights.

<note>Attius and Tettius stand for any names like Smith and Jones in English.</note>
</p>

<p>But if it is a fact that gestation cannot be prolonged beyond the tenth month, it is pertinent to ask why Homer wrote that Neptune said to a girl whom he had just violated:

<note><hi rend="italic">Odyss.</hi> xi. 248.</note>
<pb n="v1.p.295"/>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Rejoice, O woman, in this act of love;</l> <l>A year gone by, fair offspring shall be thine,</l> <l>For not unfruitful is a god's embrace.</l></quote></p>

<p>When I had brought this matter to the attention of several scholars, some of them argued that in Homer's time, as in that of Romulus, the year consisted, not of twelve months, but of ten; others, that it was in accord with Neptune and his majesty that a child by him should develop through a longer period than usual; and others gave other nonsensical reasons. But Favorinus tells me that <foreign xml:lang="grc">periplome/nou</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)niautou=</foreign> does not mean <quote>when the year is ended</quote> (<hi rend="italic">confectus</hi>), but <quote>when it is nearing its end</quote> (<hi rend="italic">ad fectus</hi>.)</p>

<p>In this instance Favorinus did not use the word <hi rend="italic">adfectus</hi> in its popular signification (but yet correctly); for as it was used by Marcus Cicero and the most polished of the early writers, it was properly applied to things which had advanced, or been carried, not to the very end, but nearly to the end. Cicero gives the word that meaning in the speech <hi rend="italic">On the Consular Provinces.</hi>

<note>§ 19, <hi rend="italic">bellum adfectum videmus ct, vere ut dicam, paene cawfectum</hi>; cf. § 29.</note>
</p>

<p>Moreover, Hippocrates, in that book of which I wrote above, when he mentioned the number of days within which the embryo conceived in the womb is given form, and had limited the time of gestation itself to the ninth or tenth month, but had said that this nevertheless was not always of the same duration, but that delivery occurred sometimes more quickly, sometimes later, finally used these words: <quote>In these cases there are longer and shorter periods, both wholly and in part; but the longer are not much longer or the shorter much shorter.</quote>

<note>See note 1, p. 291. Here Gellius' text is followed.</note>
By this he means that whereas a birth  <pb n="v1.p.297"/>  sometimes takes place more quickly, yet it occurs not much more quickly, and when later, not much later.</p>

<p>I recall that this question was carefully and thoroughly investigated at Rome, an inquiry demanded by a suit at law of no small moment at the time, whether, namely, a child that had been born alive in the eighth month but had died immediately, satisfied the conditions of the <hi rend="italic">ius trium liberorrum,</hi>

<note>The fathers of three children were granted certain privileges and immunities.</note>
since it seemed to some that the untimely period of the eighth month made it an abortion and not a birth.</p>

<p>But since I have told what I have learned about a birth after a year in Homer and about the eleventh month, I think I ought not to omit what I read in the seventh book of the <hi rend="italic">Natural Histoy</hi> of Plinius Secundus. But because that story might seem to be beyond belief, I have quoted Pliny's own words:

<note>vii. 40.</note>
<quote>Masurius makes the statement

<note>Fr. 24, Huschke; <hi rend="italic">Memor.</hi> 21, <hi rend="italic">Jur. Civ.</hi> 31, Bremer.</note>
that the praetor Lucius Papirius, when an heir in the second degree

<note>The heir or heirs in the second degree inherited only in case the heirs in the first degree died, or were otherwise incompetent.</note>
brought suit for the possession of an inheritance, decided against him, although the mother

<note>That is, the mother of the heir in the first degree.</note>
said that she had been pregnant for thirteen months; and the reason for his decision was that it seemed to him that no definite period of gestation had been fixed by law.</quote> In the same book of Plinius Secundus are these words:

<note>vii. 42.</note>
<quote>Yawning during childbirth is fatal, just as to sneeze after coition produces abortion.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THERE are many who think that those senators were called <hi rend="italic">pedarii</hi> who did not express their opinion in words, but agreed with the opinion of others by stepping to their side of the House. How then? Whenever a decree of the senate was passed by division, did not all the senators vote in that manner?

<note>Frag. 7, Fun.</note>
that in the time of our forefathers senators who had held a curule magistracy used to ride to the House in a chariot, as a mark of honour; that in that chariot there was a seat on which they sat, which for that reason was called <hi rend="italic">curulis;</hi>

<note>For <hi rend="italic">currulis,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">currus.</hi> This derivation is given by Thurneysen, <hi rend="italic">T.L.L. s.v.,</hi> with the suggestion that the name, as well as the seat itself, was of Etruscan origin.</note>
but that those senators who had not yet held a curule magistracy went on foot to the House: and that therefore the senators who had not yet held the higher magistracies were called <hi rend="italic">pedarii.</hi> Marcus Varro, however, in the <hi rend="italic">Menippean Satire</hi> entitled <foreign xml:lang="grc">(Ippoku/wn,</foreign> says

<note>Frag. 220, Büchcler. </note>
that some knights were called <hi rend="italic">pedarii,</hi> and he seems to mean those who, since they had not yet been enrolled in the senate by the censors, were not indeed senators, but because they had held offices by vote of the people, used to come into the senate and had the right of voting. In fact, even those who had filled curule magistracies, if they had not  <pb n="v1.p.303"/>  yet been added by the censors to the list of senators, were not senators, and as their names came among the last, they were not asked their opinions, but went to a division on the views given by the leading members.

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>AT the dinners of the philosopher Favorinus, after the guests had taken their places and the serving of the viands began, a slave commonly stood by his table and began to read something, either from Grecian literature or from our own. For example, one day when I was present the reading was from the treatise of the learned Gavius Bassus <hi rend="italic">On the Origin of Verbs and Substantives.</hi> In it this passage occurred:

<note>Frag. 6, Fun.</note>
<quote><hi rend="italic">Parcus</hi> is a compound word, made up  <pb n="v1.p.305"/>  of <hi rend="italic">par arcae,</hi> that is 'like a strong-box;' for just as all valuables are put away in a strong-box and preserved and kept under its protection, just so a man who is close and content to spend little keeps all his property guarded and hidden away, as in a strong-box. For that reason he is called <hi rend="italic">parcus,</hi> as if it were <hi rend="italic">par arcus.</hi></quote>

<note>That is, he is like a strong-box. </note>
</p>

<p>Then Favorinus, on hearing these words, said: <quote>That fellow Gavius Bassus has made up and contrived an origin for that word in an unnatural, altogether laboured and repellent manner, rather than explained it. For if it is permissible to draw on one's imagination, why would it not seem more reasonable to believe that a man is called <hi rend="italic">parcus</hi> for the reason that he forbids and prevents tile spending of money, as if he were <hi rend="italic">pecuniarcus.</hi> Why not rather,</quote> he continued, <quote>adopt an explanation which is simpler and nearer the truth? For <hi rend="italic">parcus</hi> is derived neither from <hi rend="italic">arca</hi> nor from <hi rend="italic">arceo,</hi> but from <hi rend="italic">parum and parvum.</hi></quote>

; and that this same definition has been criticized and rejected.</p><!--</argument>-->

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>IN the entrance hall of the palace on the Palatine a large number of men of almost all ranks had gathered together, waiting an opportunity to pay their respects to Caesar.

<note>Doubtless Antoninus Pius, since Gellius always refers to <hi rend="italic">Divus Hadrianus.</hi></note>
And there in a group of scholars, in the presence of the philosopher Favorinus, a man who thought himself unusually rich in grammatical lore was airing trifles worthy of the schoolroom, discoursing on the genders and cases of nouns with raised eyebrows and an exaggerated gravity of voice and expression, as if he were the interpreter and sovereign lord of the Sibyl's oracle. Then, looking at Favorinus, although as yet he was hardly acquainted with him, he said: <hi rend="italic">"Penus</hi> too is used in different genders and is variously declined. For the early writers used to say <hi rend="italic">hoc penus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">haec penus,</hi> and in the genitive <hi rend="italic">peni</hi> and <hi rend="italic">penoris;</hi> Lucilius in his sixteenth satire also used the word <hi rend="italic">mundus,</hi> which describes women's ornaments, not in the masculine gender, as other writers do, but in the neuter, in these words:

For what difference does it make to me and the one with whom I am speaking in what gender I use <hi rend="italic">penus,</hi> or with what endings I inflect it, provided no one of us does this too barbarously? But this is clearly what I need to know, what <hi rend="italic">penus</hi> is, and how far that word may be employed, so that I may not call a thing in everyday use by the wrong name, as those do who begin to speak their Latin in the slave-market.</quote>"</p>

<p><quote>Your question is not at all difficult,</quote> replied the man. <quote>Who indeed does not know that <hi rend="italic">penus</hi> is wine, wheat, oil, lentils, beans, and the other things of that kind?</quote> <quote>Is not <hi rend="italic">penus</hi> also,</quote> said Favorinus, <quote>millet, panic-grass,

acorns and barley? for these too are almost of the same sort;</quote> and when the man hesitated and did not answer, he continued: <quote>I do not want you to trouble yourself further about the question whether those things which I have mentioned are called <hi rend="italic">penus.</hi> But can you not, instead of telling me some essential part of <hi rend="italic">penus,</hi> rather define the meaning of the word by stating its genus and adding its species?</quote> <quote>Good Heavens!</quote> said he, <quote>I don't understand  <pb n="v1.p.313"/>  what you mean by genus and species.</quote> <quote>You ask,</quote> replied Favorinus, <quote>to have a matter which has been stated clearly stated still more clearly, which is very difficult; for it is surely a matter of common knowledge that every definition consists of genus and species. But if you ask me to predigest it for you, as they say, I will certainly do that too, for the sake of showing you honour.</quote></p>

<p>And then Favorinus began in this wise: <quote>If,</quote> said he, <quote>I should now ask you to tell me, and as it were to define in words, what a man is, you would not, I suppose, reply that you and I are men. For that is to show who is a man, not to tell what a man is. But if, I say, I should ask you to define exactly what a man is, you would undoubtedly tell me that a man is a mortal living being, endowed with reason and knowledge, or you would define him in some other manner which would differentiate him from all other animals. Similarly, then, I now ask you to tell what <hi rend="italic">penus</hi> is, not to name some example of <hi rend="italic">penus.</hi></quote> Then that boaster, now in humble and subdued tones, said: <quote>I have never learned philosophy, nor desired to learn it, and if I do not know whether barley is included under <hi rend="italic">penus,</hi> or in what words <hi rend="italic">penus</hi> is defined, I am not on that account ignorant also of other branches of learning.</quote></p>

<p><quote>To know what <hi rend="italic">penus</hi> is,</quote> said Favorinus, who was now laughing, <quote>is not more a part of my philosophy than of your grammar. For you remember, I suppose, that it is often inquired whether Virgil said <hi rend="italic">penum struere longam</hi> or <hi rend="italic">longo ordine;</hi>

<note><hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> i. 704 f.: <hi rend="italic">Quinquaginta intus famulae, quibus ordine longo cura penum struere et flammis adolere Penates.</hi> The MSS. and Servius have <hi rend="italic">longo;</hi> Charisius, <hi rend="italic">longam.</hi></note>
for you surely know that both readings are current. But to make you feel easier in mind, let me say that not even those old masters of the law who  <pb n="v1.p.315"/>  were called 'wise men' are thought to have defined <hi rend="italic">penus</hi> with sufficient accuracy. For I hear that Quintus Scaevola used the following words to explain <hi rend="italic">penus:</hi>

<note><hi rend="italic">Jur. Civ.</hi> fr. 1, Huschke; II. 5a, Bremer.</note>
<hi rend="italic">Penus,'</hi> said he, 'is what is to be eaten or drunk, which is prepared for the use of the father of the family himself; or the mother of the family, or the children of the father, or the household which he has about him or his children and which is not engaged in work

<note>If the reading is correct, <hi rend="italic">opus</hi> must mean <hi rend="italic">field-work,</hi> the reference being to the <hi rend="italic">household</hi> servants of the <hi rend="italic">paterfamilies</hi> and his children.</note>
. . . as

<note>There is a lacuna in the text.</note>
Mucius says ought to be regarded as <hi rend="italic">penus.</hi> For articles which are prepared for eating and drinking day by day, for luncheon or dinner, are not <hi rend="italic">penus;</hi> but rather the articles of that kind which are collected and stored up for use during a long period are called <hi rend="italic">penus,</hi> because they are not ready at hand, but are kept in the innermost part of the house.'

<note><hi rend="italic">Penitus,</hi> like <hi rend="italic">Penates,</hi> is connected with <hi rend="italic">penus</hi> in the sense of an inner chamber. <hi rend="italic">Penus</hi> is derived by some from the root <hi rend="italic">pa-</hi> of <hi rend="italic">pasco, pabulum,</hi> etc.; by others it is connected with <foreign xml:lang="grc">pe/nomai</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">po/nos,</foreign> as the fruit of labour. Walde, <hi rend="italic">Lat. Etym. Wörterb. s.v.,</hi> separates <hi rend="italic">penus,</hi> an inner chamber, from <hi rend="italic">penus,</hi> a store of provisions, connecting the latter with <hi rend="italic">pasco,</hi> the former with <hi rend="italic">penes, penetro</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Penates.</hi></note>
This information,</quote> said Favorinus, although I had devoted myself to philosophy, I yet did not neglect to acquire; since for Roman citizens speaking Latin it is no less disgraceful not to designate a thing by its proper word than it is to call a man out of his own name.</p>

<p>Thus Favorinus used to lead ordinary conversations of this kind from insignificant and trivial topics to those which were better worth hearing and knowing, topics not lugged in irrelevantly, nor by way of display, but springing from and suggested by the conversations themselves.</p>

<p>Besides what Favorinus said, I think this too ought to be added to our consideration of <hi rend="italic">penus,</hi>  <pb n="v1.p.317"/>  that Servius Sulpicius, in his <hi rend="italic">Criticism of the Chapters of Scaevola,</hi> wrote

<note>Fr. 4, Huschke; 3, Bremer. </note>
that Aelius Catus believed

<note>Fr. 1, Huschke, and Bremer.</note>
that not only articles for eating and drinking, but also incense and wax tapers were included under the head of <hi rend="italic">penus,</hi> since they were provided for practically the same purpose. But Masurius Sabinus, in the second book of his <hi rend="italic">Civil Law,</hi> declares

<note>Fr. 1, Huschke; 38, Bremer.</note>
that whatever was prepared for the beasts of burden which the owner of a house used was also <hi rend="italic">penus.</hi> He adds that some

<note>Rufi <hi rend="italic">resp.</hi> l<hi rend="sup">b</hi>, p. 44, Mucii <hi rend="italic">Jur. Civ.</hi> fr. 7a, Bremer.</note>
have thought that the term likewise included wood, faggots and charcoal, by means of which the <hi rend="italic">penus</hi> was made ready for use. But of articles kept in the same place, for use or for purposes of trade, he thinks that only the amount which was sufficient for a year's needs was to be regarded as <hi rend="italic">penus.</hi></p></div>

<!--<argument>-->

<p>On the difference between a disease and a defect, and the force of those terms in the aediles' edict; also whether eunuchs and barren women can he returned, and the various views as to that question.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THE edict of the curule aediles,

<note>The aediles, and some other magistrates, issued an edict, or proclamation, at the beginning of their term of office, relating to the matters over which they had jurisdiction. When successive officials adopted and announced the same body of rules (<hi rend="italic">edictum tralaticium</hi>), the edict assumed a more or less permanent form and became practically a code of laws.</note>
in the section containing stipulations about the purchase of slaves, reads as follows:

<note><hi rend="italic">F.J.R. p.</hi> 214; cf. Hor. <hi rend="italic">Epist.</hi> ii. 2. 1 ff.</note>
<quote>See to it that the sale ticket of each slave be so written that it can be known  <pb n="v1.p.319"/>  exactly what disease or defect each one has, which one is a runaway or a vagabond, or is still under condemnation for some offence.</quote></p>

<p>Therefore the jurists of old raised the question

<note>III. p. 510, Bremer.</note>
of the proper meaning of a <quote>diseased slave</quote> and one that was <quote>defective,</quote> and to what degree a disease differed from a defect. Caelius Sabinus, in the book which he wrote

<note>Fr. 1, Huschke; 2, Bremer.</note>
<hi rend="italic">On the Edict of t</hi> he <hi rend="italic">Curule Aediles,</hi> quotes Labeo,

<note><hi rend="italic">Ad. Ed. Aed.</hi> fr. 27, Huschke; 1, Bremer.</note>
as defining a disease in these terms: <quote>Disease is an unnatural condition of any body, which impairs its usefulness.</quote> But he adds that disease affects sometimes the whole body and at other times a part of the body. That a disease of the whole body is, for example, consumption or fever, but of a part of the body anything like blindness or lameness. <quote>But,</quote> he continues, <quote>one who stutters or stammers is defective rather than diseased, and a horse which bites or kicks has faults rather than a disease. But one who has a disease is also at the same time defective. However, the converse is not also true; for one may have defects and yet not be diseased. Therefore in the case of a man who is diseased,</quote> says he, <quote>it will be just and fair to state to what extent ' the price will be less on account of that defect.'</quote></p>

<p>With regard to a eunuch in particular it has been inquired whether he would seem to have been sold contrary to the aediles' edict, if the purchaser did not know that he was a eunuch. They say that Labeo ruled

<note><hi rend="italic">Ad. Ed. Aed.</hi> fr. 28, Huschke; 12, Bremer.</note>
that he could be returned as diseased; and that Labeo also wrote that if sows were sterile and had been sold, action could be brought on the basis of the edict of the aediles. But in the case of a barren woman, if the barrenness were  <pb n="v1.p.321"/>  congenital they say that Trebatius gave a ruling opposed to that of Labeo. For while Labeo thought

<note>Fr. 28; Huschke; 3, Bremer.</note>
that she could be returned as unsound, they quote Trebatius as declaring

<note>Fr. 10, Huschke; <hi rend="italic">Resp.</hi> 24. Bremer.</note>
that no action could be taken on the basis of the edict, if the woman had been born barren. But if her health had failed, and in consequence such a defect had resulted that she could not conceive, in that case she appeared to be unsound and there was ground for returning her. With regard to a short-sighted person too, one whom we call in Latin <hi rend="italic">luscitiosus,</hi> there is disagreement; for some maintain that such a person should be returned in all cases, while others on the contrary hold that he can be returned only if that defect was the result of disease. Servius indeed ruled

<note>Fr. 17, Huschke; <hi rend="italic">Resp.</hi> 108, Bremer.</note>
that one who lacked a tooth could be returned, but Labeo said

<note>Fr. 29, Huschke; 2, Bremer.</note>
that such a defect was not sufficient ground for a return: <quote>For,</quote> says he,<quote>many men lack some one tooth, and most of them are no more diseased on that account, and it would be altogether absurd to say that men are not born sound, because infants come into the world unprovided with teeth.</quote></p>

<p>I must not omit to say that this also is stated in the works of the early jurists,

<note>Cael. Sab. <hi rend="italic">ad. ed.</hi> fr. 1 ff., Bremer.</note>
that the difference between a disease and a defect is that the latter is lasting, while the former comes and goes. But if this be so, contrary to the opinion of Labeo, which I quoted above, neither a blind man nor a eunuch is diseased.</p>

<p>I have added a passage from the second book of Masurius Sabinus <hi rend="italic">On Civil Law.</hi>:

<note>Fr. . 5 Huschke; 173 ff., Bremer.</note>
<quote>A madman or a mute, or one who has a broken or crippled limb, or any defect which impairs his usefulness, is  <pb n="v1.p.323"/>  diseased. But one who is by nature near-sighted is as sound as one who runs more slowly than others.</quote></p></div>

<!--<argument>-->

<p>That before the divorce of Carvilius there were no lawsuits about a wife's dowry in the city of Rome; further, the proper meaning of the word <hi rend="italic">paelex</hi> and its derivation.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>IT is on record that for nearly five hundred years after the founding of Rome there were no lawsuits and no warranties

<note>That is, the repayment of the dowry in case of a divorce was not secured. A <hi rend="italic">cautio</hi> was a verbal or written promise, sometimes confirmed by an oath, as in Suet. <hi rend="italic">Aug.</hi> xcviii. 2, <hi rend="italic">ius iurandum et cautionem exegit.</hi></note>
in connection with a wife's dowry in the city of Rome or in Latium, since of course nothing of that kind was called for, inasmuch as no marriages were annulled during that period. Servius Sulpicius too, in the book which he compiled <hi rend="italic">On Dowries,</hi> wrote

<note>Fr. 1, Huschke; p. 227, Bremer.</note>
that security for a wife's dower seemed to have become necessary for the first time when Spurius Carvilius, who was surnamed Ruga, a man of rank, put away his wife because, owing to some physical defect, no children were born from her; and that this happened in the five hundred and twenty-third year after the founding of the city, in the consulship of Marcus Atilius and Publius Valerius.

<note>231 B.C.</note>
And it is reported that this Carvilius dearly loved the wife whom he divorced, and held her in strong affection because of her character, but that above his devotion and his love he set his regard for the oath which the censors had compelled him to take,

<note>An oath was regularly required by the censors that a man married for the purpose of begetting legal heirs (<hi rend="italic">liberorum quacrendorum causa);</hi> cf. Suet. <hi rend="italic">Jul.</hi> lii. 3.</note>
that he would marry a wife for the purpose of begetting children.</p>  <pb n="v1.p.325"/>

<p>Moreover, a woman was called <hi rend="italic">paelex,</hi> or <quote>concubine,</quote> and regarded as infamous, if she lived on terms of intimacy with a man who had another woman under his legal control in a state of matrimony, as is evident from this very ancient law, which we are told was one of king Numa's:

<note><hi rend="italic">F.J.R.,</hi> p. 8, fr. 2; I, p. 135, Bremer. </note>
<quote>Let no concubine touch the temple of Juno; if she touch it, let her, with hair unbound, offer up a ewe lamb to Juno.</quote></p>

<p>Now <hi rend="italic">paelex</hi> is the equivalent of <foreign xml:lang="grc">pa/llac,</foreign> that is to say, of <foreign xml:lang="grc">pallaki/s.</foreign>

<note>Walde, <hi rend="italic">Lat. Etymn. Wörterb. s.v.,</hi> regards <hi rend="italic">paelex</hi> and the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">pa/llac</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">pallaki/s,</foreign> the former in the sense of a young slave, as loan words from the Phoenician-Hebrew <hi rend="italic">pillegesh,</hi> <quote>concubine.</quote> The spelling <hi rend="italic">pellex</hi> is due to popular etymology, which associated the word with <hi rend="italic">pellicio,</hi> <quote>entice.</quote></note>

<p>What Servius Sulpicius wrote in his work <hi rend="italic">On Dowries</hi> about the law and usage of betrothals in early times.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>IN the book to which he gave the title <hi rend="italic">On Dowries</hi> Servius Sulpicius wrote

<note>Fr. 2, Huschke; p. 226, Bremer.</note>
that in the part of Italy known as Latium betrothals were regularly contracted according to the following customary and legal practice. <quote>One who wished to take a wife,</quote> says he, <quote>demanded of him from whom she was to be received a formal promise that she would be given in marriage. The man who was to take the woman to wife made a corresponding promise. That contract, based upon pledges given and received, was called <hi rend="italic">sponsalia,</hi> or 'betrothal.' Thereafter, she who had been promised was called <hi rend="italic">sponsa,</hi> and he who had asked her in marriage, <hi rend="italic">sponsus.</hi> But if, after such  <pb n="v1.p.327"/>  an interchange of pledges, the bride to be was not given in marriage, or was not received, then he who had asked for her hand, or he who had promised her, brought suit on the ground of breach of contract. The court took cognizance of the case. The judge inquired why the woman was not given in marriage, or why she was not accepted. If no good and sufficient reason appeared, the judge then assigned a money value to the advantage to be derived from receiving or giving the woman in marriage, and condemned the one who had made the promise, or the one who had asked for it, to pay a fine of that amount.</quote></p>

<p>Servius Sulpicius says that this law of betrothal was observed up to the time when citizenship was given to all Latium by the Julian law.

<note>90 B.C.</note>
The same account as the above was given also by Neratius in the book which he wrote <hi rend="italic">On Marriage.</hi>

<p>A story which is told of the treachery of Etruscan diviners; and how because of that circumstance the boys at Rome chanted this verse all over the city: <quote>Bad counsel to the giver is most ruinous.</quote> </p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The statue of that bravest of men, Horatius Cocles, which stood in the Comitium

<note>The Comitium, or place of assembly (<hi rend="italic">com-, co</hi>), was a <hi rend="italic">templum,</hi> or inaugurated plot of ground, orientated according to the points of the compass, at the north-western corner of the Forum Romanum.</note>
at Rome, was struck by lightning. To make expiatory offerings because of that thunderbolt, diviners were summoned from Etruria. These, through personal and national hatred of the Romans, had made up their minds to give false directions for the performance of that rite.</p>  <pb n="v1.p.329"/>

<p>They accordingly gave the misleading advice that the statue in question should be moved to a lower position, on which the sun never shone, being cut off by the high buildings which surrounded the place on every side. When they had induced the Romans to take that course, they were betrayed and brought to trial before the people, and having confessed their duplicity, were put to death. And it became evident, in exact accord with what were later found to be the proper directions, that the statue ought to be taken to an elevated place and set up in a more commanding position in the area of Vulcan;

<note>On the lower slope of the Capitoline Hill, at the northwest corner of the Forum.</note>
and after that was done, the matter turned out happily and successfully for the Romans. At that time, then, because the evil counsel of the Etruscan diviners had been detected and punished, this clever line is said to have been composed, and chanted by the boys all over the city:

<note>p. 37, Bährens, who needlessly changes the reading.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Bad counsel to the giver is most ruinous.</l></quote></p>

<p>This story about the diviners and that <hi rend="italic">senarius</hi>

<note>The <hi rend="italic">senarius</hi> was an iambic trimeter, consisting of six iambic feet, or three dipodies. The early Roman dramatic poets allowed substitutions (the tribrach, irrational spondee, irrational anapaest, cyclic dactyl, and proceleusmatic) in every foot except the last; others conformed more closely to the Greek models.</note>

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>NOT only was an earthquake regularly reported, and expiatory offerings made on that account, but I also find it mentioned in early records, that report was made to the senate when the spears of Mars

<note>The spears sacred to Mars and the sacred shields (<hi rend="italic">ancilia</hi>) were said to move of their own accord when danger threatened. According to Dio, xliv. 17, they shook violently before the death of Caesar.</note>
had moved in the sanctuary in the Regia.

<note>A building in the Roman Forum, near the temple of Vesta, the official headquarters of the <hi rend="italic">pontifex maximus.</hi> According to tradition, it was built and dwelt in by Numa. It contained a sanctuary of Mars, in which the sacred spears and shields (<hi rend="italic">ancilia</hi>) were sometimes kept. Dio, however, xliv. 17, tells us that at the time of Caesar's death they were in his house, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> the <hi rend="italic">domus public</hi> (see Suet. <hi rend="italic">Jul.</hi> xlvi.).</note>
Because of such an occurrence, a decree of the senate was passed in the consulship of Marcus Antonius and Aulus Postumius,

<note>99 B. C.</note>
of which this is a copy: <quote>Whereas Gaius Julius, son of Lucius, the pontifex, has reported that the spears of Mars have moved in the sanctuary in the Regia, the senate has therefore decreed with reference to that matter, that Marcus Antonius the consul should make expiation to Jupiter and Mars with full-grown victims, and with unweaned victims to such of the other gods as he thought proper. They decided that it should be regarded as sufficient for him to have sacrificed with these. If there should be any need of additional victims, the additional offerings should be made with red victims.</quote></p>

<p>Inasmuch as the senate called some victims <hi rend="italic">succidaneae,</hi> it is often inquired what that word means.  <pb n="v1.p.333"/>  Also in the comedy of Plautus which is entitled <hi rend="italic">Epidicus</hi> I hear that inquiry is made about that same word, which occurs in these verses:

<note>139 f. </note>
</p>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Should I the victim of your folly be</l> <l>And let you sacrifice my back to it,</l> <l>As substitute for yours?</l></quote>

<p>Now it is said that the victims were called <hi rend="italic">succidaneae</hi> —which is equivalent to <hi rend="italic">succaedaneae,</hi> the diphthong <hi rend="italic">ae,</hi> according to the custom in compound words, being changed to <hi rend="italic">i</hi>—because if the expiation was not effected by the first victims, other victims were brought and killed after them; and since these, after the first had already been offered, were substituted for the sake of making atonement and were <quote>slain in succession to</quote> the others, they were called <hi rend="italic">succidaneae,</hi>

<note>From <hi rend="italic">sub</hi> and <hi rend="italic">caedo.</hi></note>
the letter <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> of course, being pronounced long; for I hear that some barbarously shorten that letter in this word.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is on the same linguistic principle that <hi rend="italic">praecidanea</hi> is applied to those victims which are offered on the day before the regular sacrifices. Also the sow is called <hi rend="italic">praecidalea</hi>

<note>From <hi rend="italic">prae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">caedo,</hi> <quote>slay beforehand.</quote></note>
which it was usual to offer up to Ceres before the harvesting of the new crops, for the sake of expiation in case any had failed to purify a defiled household, or had performed that rite in an improper manner.</p>

<p>But that a sow and certain victims are called <hi rend="italic">praecidaneae,</hi> as I have said, is a matter of common knowledge; that some festivals are called <hi rend="italic">praecidaneae</hi> is a fact I think that is not known to the general public. Therefore I have quoted a passage from the fifth book of the treatise which Ateius Capito compiled <hi rend="italic">On Pontifical Law:</hi>

<note>Fr. 8, Huschke; 1, Bremer.</note>
<quote>Tiberius  <pb n="v1.p.335"/>  Coruncanius, the pontifex maximus, appointed <hi rend="italic">feriae praecidaneae,</hi> or <quote>a preparatory festival,</quote> for a day of ill-omen. The college of pontiffs voted that there need be no religious scruple against celebrating the <hi rend="italic">feriae praecidaneae</hi> on that day.</quote>

<note>So little is known about the <hi rend="italic">feriae praecidaneae</hi> that it is not easy to tell whether this vote was for that occasion only (<quote>on that day</quote> ) or was general (<quote>on such a day</quote> ). Since Gellius, v. 17. 2, quotes Verrius Flaccus as saying that no sacrifice could properly be made on a <hi rend="italic">dies ater,</hi> the former seems the more probable. In any case, the action of Coruncanius was evidently criticized, and his colleagues came to his rescue. Possibly <hi rend="italic">preliminary</hi> sacrifices might be offered on such a day, or <hi rend="italic">praecidaneae</hi> as applied to <hi rend="italic">feriae</hi> may not have involved sacrifices. The statement in Smith's <hi rend="italic">Dict. of Antiq.</hi> 3rd ed., ii. p. 839, that <hi rend="italic">feriae praecidaneae</hi> were <quote>often</quote> <hi rend="italic">dies atri,</hi> and were <quote>on certain occasions</quote> inaugurated by the chief pontiff, does not seem warranted by this passage, which is the only one in which the phrase occurs.</note>

<p>That verse, composed in octonarii,

<note>The term <hi rend="italic">octonarius</hi> is applied both to a trochaic tetrameter acatalectic (as here in the Latin verse) or to an iambic tetrameter acatalectic.

<p>What Gaius Fabricius said of Cornelius Rufinus, an avaricious man, whose election to the consulship he supported, although he hated him and was his personal enemy.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>FABRICIUS LUSCINUS was a man of great renown and great achievements. Publius Cornelius Rufinus was, to be sure, a man energetic in action, a good warrior, and a master of military tactics, but thievish and keen for money. This man Fabricius neither respected nor treated as a friend, but hated him because of his character. Yet when consuls were to be chosen at a highly critical period for the State, and that Rufinus was a candidate while his competitors were without military experience and untrustworthy, Fabricius used every effort to have the office given to Rufinus.

<note>This was in 290 B.C. at the beginning of the last Samnite war. Rufinus was consul again in 277 B. C.</note>
When many men expressed surprise at his attitude, in wishing an avaricious man, towards whom he felt bitter personal enmity, to be elected consul, he said: <quote>I would rather be robbed by a fellow-citizen than sold

<note>That is, sold into slavery by a victorious foe.</note>
by the enemy.</quote></p>

<p>This Rufinus afterwards, when he had been dictator and twice consul, Fabricius in his censorship expelled from the senate

<note>In 275 B.C.</note>
on the charge of extravagance, because he possessed ten pounds weight of silver plate. That remark of Fabricius about Rufinus I gave above in the form in which it appears in most historians; but Marcus Cicero, in the second book of the <hi rend="italic">De Oratore,</hi> says

<note>§268.</note>
that it was not made by Fabricius to others, but to Rufinus himself, when he was thanking Fabricius because he had been elected consul through his help.</p>

<p>On the proper meaning of <hi rend="italic">religiosus;</hi> and what changes the meaning of that word has undergone; and remarks of Nigidius Figulus on that subject, drawn from his <hi rend="italic">Commentaries.</hi></p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>NIGIDIUS FIGULUS, in my opinion the most learned of men next to Marcus Varro, in the eleventh book of his <hi rend="italic">Grammatical Commentaries,</hi> quotes

<note>Fr. 4, Swoboda.</note>
a truly remarkable line from an early poet:

<note>p. 297, Ribbeck<hi rend="sup">3</hi>, who reads: <hi rend="italic">réligentem esse &lt;téd&gt; oportet, réligiosus né fuas,</hi> following Fleckeisen.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Best it is to be religious, lest one superstitious be;</l></quote>  but he does not name the author of the poem. And in the same connection Nigidius adds: <quote>The suffix <hi rend="italic">osus</hi> in words of this kind, such as <hi rend="italic">vinosus, mulierosus, religiosus,</hi> always indicates an excessive amount of the quality in question. Therefore <hi rend="italic">religiosus</hi> is applied to one who has involved himself in an extreme and superstitious devotion, which was regarded as a fault.</quote></p>

<p>But in addition to what Nigidius says, by another shift in meaning <hi rend="italic">religiosus</hi> began to be used of an upright and conscientious man, who regulates his conduct by definite laws and limits. Similarly too the following terms, which have the same origin, appear to have acquired different meanings; namely, <hi rend="italic">religiosus dies</hi> and <hi rend="italic">religiosa delubra.</hi> For those days are called <hi rend="italic">religiosi</hi> which are of ill-fame and are hampered by an evil omen, so that on them one must refrain from offering sacrifice or beginning any new business whatever; they are, namely, the days that the ignorant multitude falsely and improperly call <hi rend="italic">ne fasti.</hi>

<note>On <hi rend="italic">ne fasti dies</hi> it was impious for legal business to be carried on, or assemblies held.</note>
Thus Marcus Cicero, in the ninth  <pb n="v1.p.341"/>  book of his <hi rend="italic">Letters to Atticus,</hi> writes:

<note>ix. 5. 2.</note>
<quote>Our forefathers maintained that the day of the battle at the Allia was more calamitous than that on which the city was taken; because the latter disaster was the result of the former. Therefore the one day is even now <hi rend="italic">religiosus,</hi> while the other is unknown to the general public.</quote> Yet the same Marcus Tullius, in his speech <hi rend="italic">On Appointing a Prosecutor,</hi>

<note><hi rend="italic">Div. in Caec. 3.</hi></note>
uses the term <hi rend="italic">religiosa delubra</hi> of shrines which are not ill-omened and gloomy, but full of majesty and sacredness. Masurius Sabinus too, in his <hi rend="italic">Notes on Native Words,</hi> says:

<note>Fr. 13, Huschke; p. 366, Bremer.</note>
<quote><hi rend="italic">Religiosus</hi> is that which because of some sacred quality is removed and withdrawn from us; the word is derived from <hi rend="italic">relinquo,</hi> as is <hi rend="italic">caerimonia</hi> from <hi rend="italic">careo.</hi></quote>

<note>The sense of <hi rend="italic">relinquo</hi> as= <quote>avoid</quote> is shown below (§ 10); that of <hi rend="italic">careo</hi> is explained by Paul. Fest. (pp. 62 and 298, Lindsay, <hi rend="italic">s.v. denariae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">purimenstrio</hi>) as referring to doing without, or refraining from, certain things on ceremonial days. Some Roman etymologists derived <hi rend="italic">caerimonia</hi> from the town of Caere, others from <hi rend="italic">caritas;</hi> see Paul. Fest. p. 38, Linds. The origin of the word is uncertain. For <hi rend="italic">religio</hi> some accept Cicero's derivation from <hi rend="italic">relegere (Nat. Deor.</hi> ii. 72), others that of Lactantius (iv. 28) from <hi rend="italic">religare.</hi></note>
According to this explanation of Sabinus, temples indeed and shrines—since an accumulation of these does not give rise to censure, as in case of things which are praised for their moderate use—since they are to be approached, not unceremoniously and thoughtlessly, but after purification and in due form, must be both revered and feared, rather than profaned; but those days are called <hi rend="italic">religiosi</hi> which for the opposite reason, because they are of dire omen, we avoid.

<note>That is, we avoid doing business, or undertaking any enterprise, on such days.</note>
And Terence says:

<note><hi rend="italic">Heaut.</hi> 228; Dziatzko reads: <hi rend="italic">turn quód dem ei <quote>recte</quote> est; nám nil esse míhi religiost dícere.</hi></note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Then too I give her nothing, except to say <quote>All right;</quote> </l> <l>For I avoid confessing my impecunious plight.</l></quote>  <pb n="v1.p.343"/>  But if, as Nigidius says, all derivatives of that kind indicate an excessive and immoderate degree, and therefore have a bad sense, as do <hi rend="italic">vinosus</hi> (<quote>fond of wine</quote> ), <hi rend="italic">mulierosus</hi> (<quote>fond of women</quote> ), <hi rend="italic">morosus</hi> (<quote>whimsical</quote> ), <hi rend="italic">verbosus</hi> (<quote>wordy</quote> ), <hi rend="italic">famosus</hi> (<quote>notorious</quote> ),

<note>The meaning <quote>full of</quote> or <quote>abounding in</quote> does not suit all these words, although it is related to their meaning. Thus a habit (<hi rend="italic">mos</hi>) easily becomes a whim, and one who is <hi rend="italic">morosus</hi> is likely to be peevish; for a somewhat different idea see Cicero, <hi rend="italic">Tusc. Disp.</hi> iv. 54, <hi rend="italic">bene igitur nostri, cum omnia essent in moribus vitia, quod nullum erat iracundia foedius, iracundos solos morosos nomninaverunt.</hi> It should be noted too that <hi rend="italic">famosus</hi> is used also in a good sense.</note>
why are <hi rend="italic">ingeniosus</hi> (<quote>talented</quote> ), <hi rend="italic">formosus</hi> (<quote>beautiful</quote> ), <hi rend="italic">officiosus</hi> (<quote>dutiful</quote> ), and <hi rend="italic">speciosus</hi> (<quote>showy</quote> ),

<note>Since <hi rend="italic">speciosus</hi> is used also in a bad sense, it should perhaps be omitted (see crit. note); but cf. <hi rend="italic">famosus,</hi> in the preceding list.</note>
which are formed in the same way from <hi rend="italic">ingenium, forma, officium,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">species,</hi> why too are <hi rend="italic">disciplinosus</hi> (<quote>well-trained</quote> ), <hi rend="italic">consiliosus</hi> (<quote>full of wisdom</quote> ), <hi rend="italic">victoriosus</hi> (<quote>victorious</quote> ), words coined by Marcus Cato,

<note>Fr. inc. 42, Jordan.</note>
why too <hi rend="italic">facundiosts</hi>—for Sempronius Asellio in the thirteenth book of his <hi rend="italic">History</hi> wrote,

<note>Fr. 10, Peter.</note>
<quote>one should regard his deeds, not his words if they are less eloquent (<hi rend="italic">facundiosa</hi>)</quote> —why, I say, are all these adjectives used, not in a bad, but in a good sense, although they too indicate an excessive amount of the quality which they signify? Is it because a certain necessary limit must be set for the qualities indicated by those words which I first cited? For favour if it is excessive and without limit,

<note>As would be indicated by <hi rend="italic">gratiosus,</hi> which, however, Gellius has not mentioned among <quote>the words which he first cited.</quote></note>
and habits if they are too many and varied, and words if they are unceasing, endless and deafening, and fame if it should be great and restless and begetting envy; all these are neither praiseworthy nor useful; but talent, duty, beauty, training, wisdom, victory and eloquence, being in <pb n="v1.p.345"/> themselves great virtues, are confined within no limits, but the greater and more extensive they are, the more are they deserving of praise.</p></div>

<p>The order observed in calling upon senators for their opinions; and the altercation in the senate between Gaius Caesar, when consul, and Marcus Cato, who tried to use up the whole day in talk.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>BEFORE the passage of the law which is now observed in the proceedings of the senate, the order in calling for opinions varied. Sometimes the man was first called upon whom the censors had first enrolled in the senate, sometimes the consuls elect; some of the consuls, influenced by friendship or some personal relationship, used to call first upon anyone they pleased, as a compliment, contrary to the regular order. However, when the usual order was not followed, the rule was observed of not calling first upon any but a man of consular rank. It is said that Gaius Caesar, when he was consul with Marcus Bibulus,

<note>In 59 B.C.</note>
called upon only four senators out of order. The first of these was Marcus Crassus, but after Caesar had betrothed his daughter to Gnaeus Pompeius, he began to call upon Pompeius first.

<note>See Suet. <hi rend="italic">Jul.</hi> xxi., who adds the information that it was the custom for the consul to maintain throughout the year the order with which he had begun on the first of January.</note>
</p>

<p>Caesar gave the senate his reason for this procedure, according to the testimony of Tullius Tiro, Cicero's freedman, who writes

<note>Fr. 1, Peter; p. 6, Lion.</note>
that he had the information from his patron. Ateius Capito has made the same statement in his work <hi rend="italic">On Senatorial Conduct.</hi>

<note>Fr. 18, Huschke; 1, Bremer.</note>
</p>  <pb n="v1.p.347"/>

<p>In the same treatise of Capito is this passage:

<note>Fr. 18, Huschke; 2, Bremer. </note>
<quote>The consul Gaius Caesar called upon Marcus Cato for his opinion. Cato did not wish to have the motion before the house carried, since he did not think it for the public good. For the purpose of delaying action, he made a long speech and tried to use up the whole day in talking. For it was a senator's right, when asked his opinion, to speak beforehand on any other subject he wished, and as long as he wished. Caesar, in his capacity as consul, summoned an attendant,

<note>According to Suet. <hi rend="italic">Jul.</hi> xx. 4, it was a lictor.</note>
and since Cato would not stop, ordered him to be arrested in the full tide of his speech and taken to prison. The senate arose in a body and attended Cato to the prison. But this,</quote> he says, <quote>aroused such indignation, that Caesar yielded and ordered Cato's release.</quote></p></div>

<!--<argument>-->

<p>The nature of the information which Aristoxenus has handed down about Pythagoras on the ground that it was more authoritative; and also what Plutarch wrote in the same vein about that same Pythagoras.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>AN erroneous belief of long standing has established itself and become current, that the philosopher Pythagoras did not eat of animals: also that he abstained from the bean, which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ku/amos.</foreign> In accordance with that belief the poet Callimachus wrote:

<note>Fr. 128, Schn.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>I tell you too, as did Pythagoras,</l> <l>Withhold your hands from beans, a hurtful food.</l></quote>  Also, as the result of the same belief, Marcus Cicero wrote these words in the first book of his work <hi rend="italic">On Didination:</hi>

<note>§ 62; see Pease, ad loc.</note>
<quote>Plato therefore bids us go to our  <pb n="v1.p.349"/>  sleep in such bodily condition that there may be nothing to cause delusion and disturbance in our minds. It is thought to be for that reason too that the Pythagoreans were forbidden to eat beans, a food that produces great flatulency, which is disturbing to those who seek mental calm.</quote></p>

<p>So then Cicero. But Aristoxenus the musician, a man thoroughly versed in early literature, a pupil of the philosopher Aristotle, in the book <hi rend="italic">On Pythagoras</hi> which he has left us, says that Pythagoras used no vegetable more often than beans, since that food gently loosened the bowels and relieved them. I add Aristoxenus' own words:

<note><hi rend="italic">F. H. G.</hi> ii. 273.</note>
<quote>Pythagoras among vegetables especially recommended the bean, saying that it was both digestible and loosening; and therefore he most frequently made use of it.</quote></p>

<p>Aristoxenus also relates that Pythagoras ate very young pigs and tender kids. This fact he seems to have learned from his intimate friend Xenophilus the Pythagorean and from some other older men, who lived not long after the time of Pythagoras. And the same information about animal food is given by the poet Alexis, in the comedy entitled <quote>The Pythagorean Bluestocking.</quote>

<note>Fr. 199, Kock.</note>
Furthermore, the reason for the mistaken idea about abstaining from beans seems to be, that in a poem of Empedocles, who was a follower of Pythagoras, this line is found:

<note>Fr. 141, Diehls.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>O wretches, utter wretches, from beans withhold your hands.</l></quote>  For most men thought that <foreign xml:lang="grc">kua/mous</foreign> meant the  <pb n="v1.p.351"/>  vegetable, according to the common use of the word. But those who have studied the poems of Empedocles with greater care and knowledge say that here <foreign xml:lang="grc">kua/mous</foreign> refers to the testicles, and that after the Pythagorean manner they were called in a covert and symbolic way <foreign xml:lang="grc">ku/amoi,</foreign> because they are the cause of pregnancy and furnish the power for human generation:

<note>Associating <foreign xml:lang="grc">ku/amos</foreign> with <foreign xml:lang="grc">kuei=n</foreign> <quote>to conceive.</quote></note>
and that therefore Empedocles in that verse desired to keep men, not from eating beans, but from excess in venery.</p>

<p>Plutarch too, a man of weight in scientific matters, in the first book of his work <hi rend="italic">On Homer</hi> wrote that Aristotle

<note>Fr. 194, Rose.</note>
gave the same account of the Pythagoreans: namely, that except for a few parts of the flesh they did not abstain from eating animals. Since the statement is contrary to the general belief, I have appended Plutarch's own words:

<note>vii., p. 100, Bern.</note>
<quote>Aristotle says that the Pythagoreans abstained from the matrix, the heart, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)kalh/fh</foreign> and some other such things, but used all other animal food.</quote> Now the <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)kalh/fh</foreign> is a marine creature which is called the sea-nettle. But Plutarch in his <hi rend="italic">Table Talk</hi> says

<note>viii. 8.</note>
that the Pythagoreans also abstained from mullets.</p>

<p>But as to Pythagoras himself, while it is well known that he declared that he had come into the world as Euphorbus, what Cleanthes

<note><hi rend="italic">F. H. G.</hi> ii. 317.</note>
and Dicaearchus

<note><hi rend="italic">F. H. G.</hi> ii. 244.</note>
have recorded is less familiar—that he was afterwards Pyrrhus Pyranthius, then Aethalides, and then a beautiful courtesan, whose name was Alco.</p>

<note>Made him an <hi rend="italic">aerarius,</hi> originally a citizen who owned no land, but paid a tax (<hi rend="italic">aes</hi>) based on such property as he had. The <hi rend="italic">aerarii</hi> had no political rights until about the middle of the fifth century B.C., when they were enrolled in the four city tribes.

one decree of the tribunes seemed to me full of old-time dignity. For that reason I remember it, and it was rendered for this reason and to this purport. Aulus Hostilius Mancinus was a curule aedile.

<note>The date is uncertain.</note>
He brought suit before the people against a courtesan called Manilia, because he said that he had been struck with a stone thrown from her apartment by night, and he exhibited the wound made by the stone. Manilia appealed to the tribunes of the commons. Before them she declared that Mancinus had come to her house in the garb of a reveller; that it would not have been to her advantage to admit him, and that when he tried to break in by force, he had been driven off with stones. The tribunes decided that the aedile had rightly been refused admission to a place to which it had not been seemly for him to go with a garland on his head;

<note>That is, as a reveller coming from a drinking-bout. An aedile might visit such a place officially in the course of his duty of regulating taverns and brothels.</note>
therefore they forbade the aedile to bring an action before the people.</p>

<p>The defence of a passage in the historical works of Sallust, which his enemies attacked in a spirit of malicious criticism.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THE elegance of Sallust's style and his passion for coining and introducing new words was met with exceeding great hostility, and many men of no mean ability tried to criticize and decry much in his writings. Many of the attacks on him were ignorant or malicious. Yet there are some things that may be regarded as deserving of censure, as for example the following passage in the <hi rend="italic">History of Catiline,</hi>

<note>iii. 2.</note>
which has the appearance of being written somewhat carelessly. Sallust's words are these: <quote>And for myself, although I am well aware that by no means equal repute attends the narrator and the doer of deeds, yet I regard the writing of history as one of the hardest of tasks; first because the style and diction must be equal to the deeds recorded; and in the second place, because such criticisms as you make of others' shortcomings are thought by most men to be due to malice and envy. Furthermore, when you commemorate the distinguished merit and fame of good men, while everyone is quite ready to believe you when you tell of things which he thinks he could easily do himself, everything beyond that he regards as fictitious, if not false.</quote> The critics say: <quote>He declared that he would give the reasons why it appears to be ' hard ' 'to write history'; and then, after mentioning the first reason, he does not give a second, but gives utterance to complaints. For it ought not to be regarded as a reason why the work of history is 'hard,' that the reader either <pb n="v1.p.359"/> misinterprets what is written or does not believe it to be true.</quote> They maintain that he ought to say that such work is exposed and subject to misjudgments, rather than <quote>hard</quote> ; for that which is <quote>hard</quote> is hard because of the difficulty of its accomplishment, not because of the mistaken opinions of other men.</p>

<p>That is what those ill-natured critics say. But Sallust does not use <hi rend="italic">arduus</hi> merely in the sense of <quote>hard,</quote> but as the equivalent of the Greek word <foreign xml:lang="grc">xalepo/s,</foreign> that is, both difficult and also troublesome, disagreeable and intractable.

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I LEARN that Marcus Varro and Publius Nigidius,

<note>Fr. 63, Swoboda.</note>
the most learned of all the Romans, always said and wrote <hi rend="italic">senatuis, domuis and fluctuis</hi> as the genitive case of the words <hi rend="italic">senatus, domus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fluctus,</hi> and used <hi rend="italic">senatui, domui, fluctui,</hi> and other similar words, with the corresponding dative ending. There is also a line of the comic poet Terence, which in the old manuscripts is written as follows:

<note><hi rend="italic">Heaut.</hi> 287.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Because, I think, of that old dame (<hi rend="italic">anuis</hi>) who died.</l></quote>  Some of the early grammarians wished to give this authority of theirs

<note>That is, of Varro, Nigidius, and Terence.</note>
the sanction of a rule; namely,  <pb n="v1.p.361"/>  that every dative singular ending in <hi rend="italic">l</hi>, if it has not the same form as the genitive singular,

<note>Dative singulars ending in <hi rend="italic">i</hi> and having the same form as the genitive singular occur only in the fifth declension (<hi rend="italic">diei, rei,</hi> etc.), except for the archaic forms of the first declension in <hi rend="italic">-ai.</hi></note>
makes the genitive singular by adding <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">pati patris, duci ducis, caedi caedis.</hi> <quote>Therefore,</quote> they say, <quote>since we use <hi rend="italic">senatui</hi> as the dative case, the genitive singular of that word is <hi rend="italic">senatuis,</hi> not <hi rend="italic">senatus.</hi></quote></p>

<!--<argument>-->

<p>A discussion of the natural quantity of certain particles, the long pronunciation of which, when prefixed to verbs, seems to be barbarous and ignorant; with several examples and explanations.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>IN the eleventh book of Lucilius are these lines:

<note>394, Marx.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Thus base Asellus did great Scipio taunt:</l> <l>Unlucky was his censorship and bad.</l></quote>  I hear that many read <hi rend="italic">obiciebat</hi> with a long <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> and they say that they do this in order to preserve the metre.

<note>The point is, that the <hi rend="italic">syllable ob,</hi> being a closed syllable, is long, while the <hi rend="italic">vowel o</hi> is short. Hence <hi rend="italic">o</hi> is pronounced short, but the first three syllables of <hi rend="italic">obiciebat</hi> form a dactyl (_ u u). Gellius' explanation in §§ 7–8 is correct, although not so clear as it might be.</note>
Again farther on he says:

<note>411, Marx.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>I'd versify the words the herald Granius spoke.</l></quote>  In this passage also they lengthen the prefix of the first word for the same reason. Again in the fifteenth book:

<note>509, Marx, who reads <hi rend="italic">suffert citrus,</hi> following Lion.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Subicit huic humilem et suffercitus posteriorem,

<note>The reading is uncertain and the meaning doubtful. The line is an hexameter, since final <hi rend="italic">s</hi> (as in <hi rend="italic">suffercitus</hi>) did not make position in early Latin.</note>
</l></quote>  they read <hi rend="italic">subicit</hi> with a long <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> because it is not proper for the first syllable to be short in heroic verse. Likewise in the <hi rend="italic">Epidicus</hi> of Plautus

<note>194.</note>
they lengthen the syllable <hi rend="italic">con</hi> in  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Haste now, Epidicus, prepare yourself,</l> <l>And throw (<hi rend="italic">conice</hi>) your mantle round about your neck.</l></quote>  In Virgil too I hear that some lengthen the verb <hi rend="italic">subicit</hi> in:

<note><hi rend="italic">Georg.</hi> ii. 18.</note>
<pb n="v1.p.365"/>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Parnassian laurel too</l> <l>Lifts (<hi rend="italic">subicit</hi>) 'neath large mother-shade its infant stem.</l></quote>  But neither the preposition <hi rend="italic">ob</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">sub</hi> is long <hi rend="italic">by</hi> nature, nor is <hi rend="italic">con</hi> long either, except when it is followed by the letters which come directly after it in <hi rend="italic">constituit</hi> and <hi rend="italic">confecit,</hi>

<note>Cf. ii. 17.</note>
or when its <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is lost, as in Sallust's <hi rend="italic">faenoribus copertus.</hi>

<note><quote>Loaded with debt,</quote> Hist. fr. iv. 52, Maur.; see note on ii. 17. 11, p. 168. <hi rend="italic">Copertus</hi> is from <hi rend="italic">co-</hi> (not <hi rend="italic">con-) opertus,</hi> and there is no loss of <hi rend="italic">n.</hi></note>
But in those instances which I have mentioned above the metre may be preserved without barbarously lengthening the prefixes; for the following letter in those words should be written with two <hi rend="italic">i's,</hi> not with one. For the simple verb to which the above-mentioned particles are prefixed, is not <hi rend="italic">icio,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">iacio,</hi> and the perfect is not <hi rend="italic">icit,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">iecit.</hi> When that word is used in compounds, the letter a is changed into <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> as happens in the verbs <hi rend="italic">insilio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">incipio,</hi> and thus the first <hi rend="italic">i</hi> acquires consonantal force.

<note>Gellius is partly right. As <hi rend="italic">in</hi> + <hi rend="italic">capio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">in</hi> + <hi rend="italic">salio</hi> became <hi rend="italic">incipio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">insilio,</hi> so <hi rend="italic">ob</hi> + <hi rend="italic">iacio</hi> became <hi rend="italic">obiicio.</hi> As the Romans disliked the combination <hi rend="italic">ii,</hi> only one i was written, but both were pronounced, and the syllable <hi rend="italic">ob</hi> was thus long <quote>by position.</quote> In the early Latin dramatists the scansion <hi rend="italic">ăbicio</hi> indicates that the <hi rend="italic">i</hi> was syncopated and the semi-vowel changed to a vowel. See Sommer, <hi rend="italic">Lat. Laut- und Formenlehre,</hi> p. 522.</note>
Accordingly, that syllable, being pronounced a little longer and fuller, does not allow the first syllable to be short, but makes it long by position, and thus the rhythm of the verse and the correct pronunciation are preserved.</p>

<p>What I have said leads also to a knowledge of this, that in the line which we find in the sixth book of Virgil:

<note><hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> vi. 365.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Unconquered chieftain, save me from these ills;</l> <l>Or do thou earth cast on (<hi rend="italic">inice</hi>) me,</l></quote>  <pb n="v1.p.367"/>  <hi rend="italic">iniice</hi> is to be written and pronounced as I have indicated above, unless anyone is so ignorant as to lengthen the preposition <hi rend="italic">in</hi> in this word too for the sake of the metre.</p>

<p>We ask then for what reason the letter <hi rend="italic">o</hi> in <hi rend="italic">obicibus</hi> is lengthened, since this word is derived from the verb <hi rend="italic">obiicio,</hi> and is not at all analogous to <hi rend="italic">motus,</hi> which is from <hi rend="italic">moveo</hi> and is pronounced with a long <hi rend="italic">o.</hi> I myself recall that Sulpicius Apollinaris, a man eminent for his knowledge of literature, pronounced <hi rend="italic">obices</hi> and <hi rend="italic">obicibus</hi> with a short <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> and that in Virgil too he read in the same way the lines:

<note><hi rend="italic">Georg.</hi> iii. 479.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>And by what force the oceans fathomless</l> <l>Rise, bursting all their bounds (<hi rend="italic">obicibus</hi>);</l></quote>  but, as I have indicated, he gave the letter <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> which in that word also should be doubled, a somewhat fuller and longer sound.</p>

<p>It is consistent therefore that <hi rend="italic">subices</hi> also, which is formed exactly like <hi rend="italic">obices,</hi> should be pronounced with the letter <hi rend="italic">u</hi> short. Ennius, in his tragedy which is entitled <hi rend="italic">Achilles,</hi> uses <hi rend="italic">subices</hi> for the upper air which is directly below the heavens, in these lines:

<note>2, Ribbeck<hi rend="sup">3</hi>.</note>
By lofty, humid regions (<hi rend="italic">subices</hi>) of the gods I swear, Whence comes the storm with savage roaring wind;  yet, in spite of what I have said, you may hear almost everyone read <hi rend="italic">subices</hi> with a long <hi rend="italic">u.</hi> But Marcus Cato uses that very verb with another prefix in the speech which he delivered <hi rend="italic">On his Consulship:</hi>

<p>Some stories of the elder Publius Africanus, taken from the annals and well worth relating.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>How greatly the earlier Scipio Africanus excelled in the splendour of his merits, how lofty and noble of spirit he was, and to what an extent he was upheld by consciousness of his own rectitude, is evident from many of his words and acts. Among these are the following two instances of his extreme self-confidence and sense of superiority.</p>

<p>When Marcus Naevius, tribune of the commons, accused him before the people

<note>In 185 B.C.</note>
and declared that he had received money from king Antiochus to make peace with him in the name of the Roman people on favourable and easy terms, and when the tribune added sundry other charges which were unworthy of so great a man, then Scipio, after a few preliminary remarks such as were called for by the dignity and renown of his life, said: <quote>I recall, fellow citizens, that this is the day on which in Africa in a mighty battle I conquered Hannibal the Carthaginian, the most bitter enemy of your power, and won for you a splendid peace and a glorious victory. Let us then not be ungrateful to the gods, but, I suggest, let us leave this worthless fellow, and go at once to render thanks to Jupiter, greatest and best of gods.</quote> So saying, he turned away and set out for the Capitol. Thereupon the whole assembly, which  <pb n="v1.p.371"/>  had gathered to pass judgment on Scipio, left the tribune, accompanied Scipio to the Capitol, and then escorted him to his home with the joy and expressions of gratitude suited to a festal occasion. The very speech is in circulation which is believed to have been delivered that day by Scipio,

<note><hi rend="italic">O. P. F.,</hi> p. 6, Meyer<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
and those who deny its authenticity at least admit that these words which I have quoted were spoken by Scipio.</p>

<p>There is also another celebrated act of his. Certain Petilii, tribunes of the commons, influenced they say by Marcus Cato, Scipio's personal enemy, and instigated to appear against him, insisted most vigorously in the senate

<note>Probably in 187 B.C., but the details of these attacks on Scipio are confused and uncertain.</note>
on his rendering an account of the money of Antiochus and of the booty taken in that war; for he had been deputy to his brother Lucius Scipio Asiaticus, the commander in that campaign. Thereupon Scipio arose, and taking a roll from the fold of his toga, said that it contained an account of all the money and all the booty; that he had brought it to be publicly read and deposited in the treasury. <quote>But that,</quote> said he, <quote>I shall not do now, nor will I so degrade myself.</quote> And at once, before them all, he tore the roll across with his own hands and rent it into bits, indignant that an account of money taken in war should be required of him, to whose account the salvation of the Roman State and its power ought to be credited.

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>IT has been found that if immature children eat a great deal and sleep too much, they become so sluggish as to have the dulness of a sufferer from insomnia or lethargy; and their bodies are stunted and under-developed.

<p>On the punishment by the censors of men who had made untimely jokes in their hearing; also a deliberation as to the punishment of a man who had happened to yawn when standing before them.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>AMONG the severities of the censors these three examples of the extreme strictness of their discipline are recorded in literature. The first is of this sort: The censor was administering the usual oath regarding wives, which was worded as follows: <quote>Have you, to the best of your knowledge and belief, a wife?</quote> The man who was to take the oath was a jester, a sarcastic dog,

<note><hi rend="italic">Canicula</hi> is used of a biting woman by Plaut. <hi rend="italic">Cure.</hi> 598, and of Diogenes by Tertullian, <hi rend="italic">adv. Marc.</hi> 1. 1.</note>
and too much given to buffoonery. Thinking that he had a chance to crack a joke, when the censor asked him, as was customary, <quote>Have you, to the best of your knowledge and belief, a wife?</quote> he replied: <quote>I indeed have a wife,  <pb n="v1.p.375"/>  but not, by Heaven! such a one as I could desire.</quote>

<note>The joke, which seems untranslatable, is of course on the doublemeaning of <hi rend="italic">ex sententia,</hi> <quote>according to your opinion</quote> and <quote>according to your wish.</quote></note>
Then the censor reduced him to a commoner for his untimely quip,

<note>Made him one of the <hi rend="italic">aerarii;</hi> see note 1, p. 352.</note>
and added that the reason for his action was a scurrilous joke made in his presence.</p>

<p>Here is another instance of the sternness of the same officials. The censors deliberated about the punishment of a man who had been brought before them by a friend as his advocate, and who had yawned in court very clearly and loudly. He was on the point of being condemned for his lapse, on the ground that it was an indication of a wandering and trifling mind and of wanton and undisguised indifference. But when the man had sworn that the yawn had overcome him much against his will and in spite of his resistance, and that he was afflicted with the disorder known as <hi rend="italic">oscedo,</hi> or a tendency to yawning, he was excused from the penalty which had already been determined upon. Publius Scipio Africanus, son of Paulus, included both these stories in a speech which he made when censor, urging the people to follow the customs of their forefathers.

<note><hi rend="italic">O. R. F.,</hi><hi rend="sup">2</hi> p. 179.</note>
</p>

<p>Sabinus Masurius too in the seventh book of his <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> relates a third instance of severity. He says: <quote>When the censors Publius Scipio Nasica and Marcus Popilius were holding a review of the knights, they saw a horse that was very thin and ill-kept, while its rider was plump and in the best of condition. 'Why is it,' said they, 'that you are better cared for than your mount?' 'Because,' he replied, 'I take care of myself, but Statius, a worthless slave, takes care of the horse.' This answer did not seem sufficiently respectful, and the man was reduced to a commoner, according to custom.</quote></p>  <pb n="v1.p.377"/>

<p>Now <hi rend="italic">Statius</hi> was a slave-name. In old times there were many slaves of that name. Caecilius too, the famous comic poet, was a slave and as such called <hi rend="italic">Statius.</hi> But afterwards this was made into a kind of surname and he was called <hi rend="italic">Caecilius Statius.</hi>

<note>This was regular in the case of freedmen, who took the forename and gentile name of their patron, or former master, and added their slave-name as a cognomen; <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> M. Tullius Tiro. The forename of the Caecilius to whom Statius belonged is not known.</note>

<p>That the philosopher Musonius criticized and rebuked those who expressed approval of a philosopher's discourse by loud shouts and extravagant demonstrations of praise.</p><!--</argument>-->

<note>p. 130, Hense.</note>
was accustomed. . .

<note>There seems to be a lacuna in the text; see crit. note.</note>
<quote>When a philosopher,</quote> he says, <quote>is uttering words of encouragement, of warning, of persuasion, or of rebuke, or is discussing any other philosophical theme, then if his hearers utter trite and commonplace expressions of praise without reflection or restraint, if they shout too, if they gesticulate, if they are stirred and swayed and impassioned by the charm of his utterance, by the rhythm of his words, and by certain musical notes,

<note>Heracus suggests <hi rend="italic">fritamenta</hi> in i. 11, 12.</note>
as it were, then you may know that speaker and hearers are wasting their time, and that they are not hearing a philosopher's lecture, but a flute-player's recital. The mind,</quote> said he, <quote>of one who is listening to a philosopher, so long as what is said is helpful and salutary, and furnishes a cure for faults and vices, has no time or leisure for continued and extravagant applause. Whoever the hearer may be, unless he is wholly lost, during the course of the philosopher's address he must necessarily shudder and feel secret shame and  <pb n="v1.p.383"/>  repentance, or rejoice or wonder, and even show changes of countenance and betray varying emotions, according as the philosopher's discourse has affected him and his consciousness of the different tendencies of his mind, whether noble or base.</quote></p>

<p>He added that great applause is not inconsistent with admiration, but that the greatest admiration gives rise, not to words, but to silence. <quote>Therefore,</quote> said he, "the wisest of all poets does not represent those who heard Ulysses' splendid account of his hardships as leaping up, when he ceased speaking, with shouts and noisy demonstrations, but he says they were one and all silent, as if amazed and confounded, since the gratification of their ears even affected their power of utterance."</p>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Thus he; but they in silence all were hushed</l> <l>And held in rapture through the shadowy hall.

<note>Bucephalas in Greek means <quote>ox-headed.</quote></note>
Chares wrote

that he was bought for thirteen talents and given to king Philip; that amount in Roman money is three hundred and twelve thousand sesterces. It seemed a noteworthy characteristic of this horse that when he was armed and equipped for battle, he would never allow himself to be mounted by any other than the king.

<note><hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> Suet. <hi rend="italic">Jul.</hi> lxi.</note>
It is also related that Alexander in the war against India, mounted upon that horse and doing  <pb n="v1.p.385"/>  valorous deeds, had driven him, with disregard of his own safety, too far into the enemies' ranks. The horse had suffered deep wounds in his neck and side from the weapons hurled from every hand at Alexander, but though dying and almost exhausted from loss of blood, he yet in swiftest course bore the king from the midst of the foe; but when he had taken him out of range of the weapons, the horse at once fell, and satisfied with having saved his master breathed his last, with indications of relief that were almost human. Then king Alexander, after winning the victory in that war, founded a city in that region and in honour of his horse called it <hi rend="italic">Bucephalon.</hi></p></div>

<p>The reason and the occasion which are said to have introduced Protagoras to the study of philosophical literature.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THEY say that Protagoras, a man eminent in the pursuit of learning, whose name Plato gave to that famous dialogue of his, in his youth earned his living as a hired labourer and often carried heavy burdens on his back, being one of that class of men which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)xqofo/roi</foreign> and we Latins <hi rend="italic">baiuli,</hi> or porters. He was once carrying a great number of blocks of wood, bound together with a short rope, from the neighbouring countryside into his native town of Abdera. It chanced at the time that Democritus, a citizen of that same city, a man esteemed before all others for his fine character and his knowledge of philosophy, as he was going out of the city, saw Protagoras walking along easily and rapidly with that burden, of a kind so awkward and so difficult to hold together. Democritus drew near, and  <pb n="v1.p.387"/>  noticing with what skill and judgment the wood was arranged and tied, asked the man to stop and rest awhile. When Protagoras did as he was asked, and Democritus again observed that the almost circular heap of blocks was bound with a short rope, and was balanced and held together with all but geometrical accuracy, lie asked who had put the wood together in that way. When Protagoras replied that he had done it himself, Democritus asked him to untie the bundle and arrange it again in the same way. But after he had done so, then Democritus, astonished at the keen intellect and cleverness of this uneducated man, said: <quote>My dear young man, since you have a talent for doing things well, there are greater and better employments which you can follow with me</quote> ; and he at once took him away, kept him at his own house, supplied him with money, taught him philosophy, and made him the great man that he afterwards became.</p>

<p>Yet this Protagoras was not a true philosopher, but the cleverest of sophists; for in consideration of the payment of a huge annual fee, he used to promise his pupils that he would teach them by what verbal dexterity the weaker cause could be made the stronger, a process which he called in Greek: <foreign xml:lang="grc">to\n h(/ttw lo/gon krei/ttw poiei=n,</foreign> or <quote>making the worse appear the better reason.</quote></p></div>

And then the king, filled with vainglory at the sight of an army so great and so well-equipped, turned to Hannibal and said: <quote>Do you think that all this can be equalled and that it is enough for the Romans?</quote> Then the Carthaginian, deriding the worthlessness and inefficiency of the king's troops in their costly armour, replied: <quote>I think all this will be enough, yes, quite enough, for the Romans, even though they are most avaricious.</quote> Absolutely nothing could equal this remark for wit and sarcasm; the king had inquired about the size of his army and asked for a comparative estimate; Hannibal in his reply referred to it as booty.</p></div>

<p>On military crowns, with a description of the triumphal, siege, civic, mural, camp, naval, ovation, and olive crowns.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>MILITARY crowns are many and varied. Of these the most highly esteemed I find to be in general the following: the <quote>triumphal, siege, civic, mural, camp and naval crowns.</quote> There is besides the so-called <quote>ovation</quote> crown, and lastly also the <quote>olive</quote> crown, which is regularly worn by those who have not taken part in a battle, but nevertheless are awarded a triumph.</p>  <pb n="v1.p.393"/>

<p><quote>Triumphal</quote> crowns are of gold and are presented to a commander in recognition of the honour of a triumph. This in common parlance is <quote>gold for a crown.</quote> This crown in ancient times was of laurel, but later they began to make them of gold.</p>

<p>The <quote>siege</quote> crown is the one which those who have been delivered from a state of siege present to the general who delivered them. That crown is of grass, and custom requires that it be made of grass which grew in the place within which the besieged were confined. This crown of grass the Roman senate and people presented to Quintus Fabius Maximus in the second Punic war, because he had freed the city of Rome from siege by the enemy.</p>

<p>The crown is called <quote>civic</quote> which one citizen gives to another who has saved his life in battle, in recognition of the preservation of his life and safety. It is made of the leaves of the esculent oak, because the earliest food and means of supporting life were furnished by that oak; it was formerly made also from the holm oak, because that is the species which is most nearly related to the esculent; this we learn from a comedy of Caecilius, who says:

<note>v. 269, Ribbeck<hi rend="sup">3</hi>.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>They pass with cloaks and crowns of holm; ye Gods!</l></quote>  But Masurius Sabinus,

<note>Fr. 17, Huschke; 8, Bremer.</note>
in the eleventh book of his <hi rend="italic">Memoirs,</hi> says that it was the custom to award the civic crown only when the man who had saved the life of a fellow citizen had at the same time slain the enemy who threatened him, and had not given ground in that battle; under other conditions he says that the honour of the civic crown was not granted. He adds, however, that Tiberius Caesar  <pb n="v1.p.395"/>  was once asked to decide whether a soldier might receive the civic crown who had saved a citizen in battle and killed two of the enemy, yet had not held the position in which he was fighting, but the enemy had occupied it. The emperor ruled that the soldier seemed to be among those who deserved the civic crown, since it was clear that he had rescued a fellow citizen from a place so perilous that it could not be held even by valiant warriors. It was this civic crown that Lucius Gellius, an ex-censor, proposed in the senate that his country should award to Cicero in his consulship, because it was through his efforts that the frightful conspiracy of Catiline had been detected and punished.</p>

<p>The <quote>mural</quote> crown is that which is awarded by a commander to the man who is first to mount the wall and force his way into an enemy's town; therefore it is ornamented with representations of the battlements of a wall. A <quote>camp</quote> crown is presented by a general to the soldier who is first to fight his way into a hostile camp; that crown represents a palisade. The <quote>naval</quote> crown is commonly awarded to the armed man who has been the first to board an enemy ship in a sea-fight; it is decorated with representations of the beaks of ships. Now the <quote>mural,</quote> <quote>camp,</quote> and <quote>naval</quote> crowns are regularly made of gold.</p>

<p>The <quote>ovation</quote> crown is of myrtle; it was worn by generals who entered the city in an ovation.</p>

<p>The occasion for awarding an ovation, and not a triumph, is that wars have not been declared in due form and so have not been waged with a legitimate enemy, or that the adversaries' character is low or unworthy, as in the case of slaves or pirates, or that,  <pb n="v1.p.397"/>  because of a quick surrender, a victory was won which was <quote>dustless,</quote> as the saying is,

<note><foreign xml:lang="grc">)Akoniti/</foreign> (<quote>dustless</quote> ) was proverbial in Greek for <quote>without an effort,</quote> as in Thuc. iv. 73; Xen. <hi rend="italic">Ages.</hi> 6. 3. <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> Hor. <hi rend="italic">Epist.</hi> i. 1. 54, <hi rend="italic">cui sit condicio dulcis sine pulvere palma.</hi></note>
and bloodless. For such an easy victory they believed that the leaves sacred to Venus were appropriate, on the ground that it was a triumph, not of Mars, but as it were of Venus. And Marcus Crassus, when he returned after ending the Servile war and entered the city in an ovation, disdainfully rejected the myrtle crown and used his influence to have a decree passed by the senate, that he should be crowned with laurel, not with myrtle.</p>

<p>Marcus Cato charges Marcus Fulvius Nobilior

<note>Nobilior was consul in 189 B. C. Cicero, <hi rend="italic">Tusc. Disp.</hi> i. 2. 3, says that Cato criticized him also for taking Ennius with him to his province of Aetolia.</note>
with having awarded crowns to his soldiers for the most trifling reasons possible, for the sake of popularity. On that subject I give you Cato's own words:

<note>xiv. 1, Jordan.</note>
<quote>Now to begin with, who ever saw anyone presented with a crown, when a town had not been taken or an enemy's camp burned?</quote> But Fulvius, against whom Cato brought that charge, had bestowed crowns on his soldiers for industry in building a rampart or in digging a well.</p>

<p>I must not pass over a point relating to ovations, about which I learn that the ancient writers disagreed. For some of them have stated that the man who celebrated an ovation was accustomed to enter the city on horseback: but Masurius Sabinus says

<note>Fr. 26, Huschke; memory. 15, Bremer.</note>
that they entered on foot, followed, not by their soldiers, but by the senate in a body.</p>

Hyginus wrote

that Virgil was in error, alleging that he did not notice that the words <hi rend="italic">ipse Quirinali lituo</hi> lacked something. <quote>For,</quote> said  <pb n="v1.p.401"/>  he, <quote>if we have not observed that something is lacking, the sentence seems to read ' girt with staff and scant shift,' which,</quote> says he,<quote>is utterly absurd; for since the <hi rend="italic">lituus</hi> is a short wand, curved at its thicker end, such as the augurs use, how on earth can one be looked upon as ' girt with a <hi rend="italic">lituus?</hi> '</quote></p>

<p>As a matter of fact, it was Hyginus himself who failed to notice that this expression, like very many others, contains an ellipsis. For example, when we say <quote>Marcus Cicero, a man of great eloquence</quote> and <quote>Quintus Roscius, an actor of consummate grace,</quote> neither of these phrases is full and complete, but to the hearer they seem full and complete. As Vergil wrote in another place:

<p>And since mention has been made of the <hi rend="italic">lituus,</hi> I must not pass over a question which obviously may be asked, whether the augurs' <hi rend="italic">lituus</hi> is called after the trumpet of the same name, or whether the  <pb n="v1.p.403"/>  trumpet derived its name <hi rend="italic">lituus</hi> from the augurs' staff; for both have the same form and both alike are curved.

<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>The bow twanged,</l></quote>  it must be concluded that the augural staff was called <hi rend="italic">litmus</hi> from its resemblance to the trumpet. And Virgil uses that word also as synonymous with <hi rend="italic">tuba</hi>:

<p>The story of Croesus dumb son, from the books of Herodotus.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THE son of king Croesus, when he was already old enough to speak, was dumb, and after lie had become a well-grown youth, he was still unable to utter a word. Hence he was for a long time regarded as mute and tongue-tied. When his father had been vanquished in a great war, the city in which he lived had been taken, and one of the enemy was rushing upon him with drawn sword, unaware that he was the king, then the young man opened his mouth in an attempt to cry out. And by that effort and the force of his breath he broke the impediment and the bond upon his tongue, and spoke plainly and clearly, shouting to the enemy not to kill king Croesus. Then the foeman withheld his sword, the king's life was saved, and from that  <pb n="v1.p.405"/>  time on the youth began to speak. Herodotus in his <hi rend="italic">Histories</hi>

<note>i. 85. </note>
is the chronicler of that event, and the words which he says the son of Croesus first spoke are: <quote>Man, do not kill Croesus.</quote></p>

<p>But also an athlete of Samos—his name was Echeklous—although he had previously been speechless, is said to have begun to speak for a similar reason. For when in a sacred contest the casting of lots between the Samians and their opponents was not being done fairly, and he had noticed that a lot with a false name was being slipped in, he suddenly shouted in a loud voice to the man who was doing it that he saw what he was up to. And he too was freed from the check upon his speech and for all the remaining time of his life spoke without stammering or lack of clearness.

<p>On the arguments which by the Greeks are called <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)ntistre/fon:</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="grc">ta,</foreign> and in Latin may be termed <hi rend="italic">reciproca.</hi></p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>AMONG fallacious arguments the one which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)ntistre/fon</foreign> seems to be by far the most fallacious. Such arguments some of our own philosophers have rather appropriately termed <hi rend="italic">reciproca,</hi> or <quote>convertible.</quote> The fallacy arises from the fact that the argument that is presented may be turned in the opposite direction and used against the one who has offered it, and is equally strong for both sides of the question. An example is the well-known argument which Protagoras, the keenest of all sophists, is said to have used against his pupil Euathlus.</p>  <pb n="v1.p.407"/>

<p>For a dispute arose between them and an altercation as to the fee which had been agreed upon, as follows: Euathlus, a wealthy young man, was desirous of instruction in oratory and the pleading of causes. He became a pupil of Protagoras and promised to pay him a large sum of money, as much as Protagoras had demanded. He paid half of the amount at once, before beginning his lessons, and agreed to pay the remaining half on the day when he first pleaded before jurors and won his case. Afterwards, when he had been for some little time a pupil and follower of Protagoras, and had in fact made considerable progress in the study of oratory, he nevertheless did not undertake any cases. And when the time was already getting long, and he seemed to be acting thus in order not to pay the rest of the fee, Protagoras formed what seemed to him at the time a wily scheme; he determined to demand his pay according to the contract, and brought suit against Euathlus.</p>

<p>And when they had appeared before the jurors to bring forward and to contest the case, Protagoras began as follows: <quote>Let me tell you, most foolish of youths, that in either event you will have to pay what I am demanding, whether judgment be pronounced for or against you. For if the case goes against you, the money will be due me in accordance with the verdict, because I have won; but if the decision be in your favour, the money will be due me according to our contract, since you will have won a case.</quote></p>

<p>To this Euatlllus replied: <quote>I might have met this sophism of yours, tricky as it is, by not pleading my own cause but employing another as my advocate. But I take greater satisfaction in a victory in which  <pb n="v1.p.409"/>  I defeat you, not only in the suit, but also in this argument of yours. So let me tell you in turn, wisest of masters, that in either event I shall not have to pay what you demand, whether judgment be pronounced for or against me. For if the jurors decide in my favour, according to their verdict nothing will be due you, because I have won; but if they give judgment against me, by the terms of our contract I shall owe you nothing, because I have not won a case.</quote></p>

<p>Then the jurors, thinking that the plea on both sides was uncertain and insoluble, for fear that their decision, for whichever side it was rendered, might annul itself, left the matter undecided and postponed the case to a distant day. Thus a celebrated master of oratory was refuted by his youthful pupil with his own argument, and his cleverly devised sophism failed.</p></div>

<p>The impossibility of regarding Bias' syllogism on marriage as an example of <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)ntistre/fon.</foreign></p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>SOME think that the famous answer of the wise and noble Bias, like that of Protagoras of which I have just spoken, was <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)ntistre/fon.</foreign>

<note>The <quote>convertible</quote> argument described in x.</note>
For Bias, being asked by a certain man whether lie should marry or lead a single life, said: <quote>You are sure to marry a woman either beautiful or ugly; and if beautiful, you will share her with others, but if ugly, she will be a punishment.

<note>In the Greek there is a word-play on <foreign xml:lang="grc">koinh/</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">poinh/,</foreign> which it does not seem possible to reproduce in English. Perhaps, a flirt or a hurt, or, a harlot or a hard lot. </note>
But neither of these things is desirable; therefore do not marry.</quote></p>  <pb n="v1.p.411"/>

<p>Now, they turn this argument about in this way. <quote>If I marry a beautiful woman, she will not be a punishment; but if an ugly one, I shall be her sole possessor; therefore marry.</quote> But this syllogism does not seem to be in the least convertible, since it appears somewhat weaker and less convincing when turned into the second form. For Bias maintained that one should not marry because of one of two disadvantages which must necessarily be suffered by one who took a wife. But he who converts the proposition does not defend himself against the inconvenience which is mentioned, but says that he is free from another which is not mentioned. But to maintain the opinion that Bias expressed, it is enough that a man who has taken a wife must necessarily suffer one or the other of two disadvantages, of having a wife that is unfaithful, or a punishment.</p>

<p>But our countryman Favorinus, when that syllogism which Bias had employed happened to be mentioned, of which the first premise is: <quote>You will marry either a beautiful or an ugly woman,</quote> declared that this was not a fact, and that it was not a fair antithesis, since it was not inevitable that one of the two opposites be true, which must be the case in a disjunctive proposition. For obviously certain outstanding extremes of appearance are postulated, ugliness and beauty.

<note>That is, in Bias' syllogism.</note>
<quote>But there is,</quote> said he, <quote>a third possibility also, lying between those two opposites, and that possibility Bias did not observe or regard. For between a very beautiful and a very ugly woman there is a mean in appearance, which is free from the danger to which an excess of beauty is exposed, and also from the feeling of repulsion  <pb n="v1.p.413"/>  inspired by extreme ugliness. A woman of that kind is called by Quintus Ennius in the <hi rend="italic">Melanippa</hi>

<note>253, Ribbeck<hi rend="sup">3</hi>. </note>
by the very elegant term ' normal,' and such a woman will be neither unfaithful nor a punishment.</quote> This moderate and modest beauty Favorinus, to my mind most sagaciously, called <quote>conjugal.</quote> Moreover Ennius, in the tragedy which I mentioned, says that those women as a rule are of unblemished chastity who possess normal beauty.</p></div>

<p>On the names of the gods of the Roman people called <hi rend="italic">Diovis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Vediovis.</hi></p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>IN ancient prayers we have observed that these names of deities appear: <hi rend="italic">Diovis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Vediovis;</hi> furthermore, there is also a temple of Vediovis at Rome, between the Citadel and the Capitolium.

<note>The two summits of the Capitoline Hill.</note>
The explanation of these names I have found to be this: the ancient Latins derived <hi rend="italic">Iovis</hi> from <hi rend="italic">iuvare</hi> (help), and called that same god <quote>father,</quote> thus adding a second word. For <hi rend="italic">Iovispater</hi> is the full and complete form, which becomes <hi rend="italic">Iupiter</hi>

<note>The correct spelling in Latin is <hi rend="italic">Iuppiter.</hi></note>
by the syncope or change of some of the letters. So also <hi rend="italic">Neptunuspater</hi> is used as a compound, and <hi rend="italic">Saturnus</hi>— <hi rend="italic">pater</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ianuspater</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Marspater</hi>—for that is the original form of <hi rend="italic">Marspiter</hi>—and Jove also was called <hi rend="italic">Diespiter,</hi> that is, the father of day and of light. And therefore by a name of similar origin Jove is called <hi rend="italic">Diovis</hi> and also <hi rend="italic">Lucetius,</hi> because he blesses and helps us by means of the day and the light, which are equivalent to life itself. And <hi rend="italic">Lucetius</hi> is applied to Jove by Gnaeus Naevius in his poem <hi rend="italic">On the Punic war.</hi>

<note>Fr. 55, Bährens.</note>
</p>  <pb n="v1.p.415"/>

<p>Accordingly, when they had given the names <hi rend="italic">Iovis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Diovis</hi> from <hi rend="italic">iuvare</hi> (help), they applied a lame of the contrary meaning to that god who had, not the power to help, but the force to do harm—for some gods they worshipped in order to gain their favour, others they propitiated in order to avert their hostility; and they called him <hi rend="italic">Vediovis,</hi> thus taking away and denying his power to give help. For the particle <hi rend="italic">ve</hi> which appears in different forms in different words, now being spelled with these two letters and now with an a inserted between the two, has two meanings which also differ from each other. For <hi rend="italic">ve,</hi> like very many other particles, has the effect either of weakening or of strengthening the force of a word; and it therefore happens that some words to which that particle is prefixed are ambiguous

<note>That is, it is uncertain what force <hi rend="italic">ve</hi>- has in these words; but see the next note.</note>
and may be used with either force, such as <hi rend="italic">vescus</hi> (small), <hi rend="italic">vemens</hi> (mighty), and <hi rend="italic">vegrandis</hi> (very small),

<note>Gellius is wrong in supposing that <hi rend="italic">ve</hi>- strengthened the force of a word; it means <quote>without, apart from.</quote> Nonius cites Lucilias for <hi rend="italic">vegrandis</hi> in the sense of <quote>very great,</quote> but wrongly; see Marx on Lucil. 631. <hi rend="italic">Vescus</hi> means <quote>small,</quote> or, in an active sense, <quote>make small</quote> (Lucr. i. 326); Walde derives it from <hi rend="italic">rescor</hi> in the sense of <quote>eating away, corroding</quote> (Lucr. i. 326) and from <hi rend="italic">ve</hi>-<hi rend="italic">escus</hi> in the sense of <quote>small</quote> <hi rend="italic">Vemens,</hi> for <hi rend="italic">vehemens,</hi> is probably a participle (<hi rend="italic">vehemenos</hi>) from <hi rend="italic">veho.</hi></note>
a point which I have discussed elsewhere

<note>xvi. 5. 6.</note>
in greater detail. But <hi rend="italic">vesanus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vecordes</hi> are used with only one of the meanings of <hi rend="italic">ve,</hi> namely, the privative or negative force, which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">kata\ ste/rhsin.</foreign></p>

<p>It is for this reason that the statue of the god Vediovis, which is in the temple of which I spoke above, holds arrows, which, as everyone knows, are devised to inflict harm. For that reason it has often been said that that god is Apollo; and a shegoat is sacrificed to him in the customary fashion,

<note>Vediovis, or Veiovis, was the opposite of Jupiter, <hi rend="italic">ve-</hi> having its negative force. He was a god of the nether world and of death; hence the arrows and the she-goat, which was an animal connected with the lower world (see Gell. x. 15. 12, and Wissowa <hi rend="italic">Religion und Kultus,</hi>p. 237). Some regarded the god as a youthful (little) Jupiter and the she-goat as the one which suckled him in his infancy; others as Apollo, because of the arrows, but the she-goat has no connection with Apollo.</note>
<pb n="v1.p.417"/>  and a representation of that animal stands near his statue.</p>

<p>It was for this reason, they say, that Virgil, a man deeply versed in antiquarian lore, but never making a display of his knowledge, prays to the unpropitious gods in the <hi rend="italic">Georgics,</hi> thus intimating that in gods of that kind there is a power capable of injuring rather than aiding. The verses of Vergil are these:

<note><hi rend="italic">Georg.</hi> iv. 6.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>A task of narrow span, but no small praise,</l> <l>If unpropitious powers bar not my way</l></quote>  And favouring Phoebus grant a poet's prayer. And among those gods which ought to be placated in order to avert evil influences from ourselves or our harvests are reckoned Auruncus

<note>Commonly called <hi rend="italic">Averruncus,</hi> although the glosses give also the form <hi rend="italic">Auruncus.</hi> From <hi rend="italic">averrunco,</hi> <quote>to avert.</quote></note>
and Robigus.

<p>On the rank and order of obligations established by the usage of the Roman people.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THERE was once a discussion, in my presence and hearing, of the rank and order of obligations, carried on by a company of men of advanced age and high position at Rome, who were also eminent for their knowledge and command of ancient usage and conduct. And when the question was asked to whom we ought first and foremost to discharge those obligations, in case it should be necessary to prefer some to others in giving assistance or showing attention, there was a difference of opinion. But it  <pb n="v1.p.419"/>  was readily agreed and accepted, that in accordance with the usage of the Roman people the place next after parents should be held by wards entrusted to our honour and protection; that second to them came clients, who also had committed themselves to our honour and guardianship; that then in the third place were guests; and finally relations by blood and by marriage.</p>

<p>Of this custom and practice there are numerous proofs and illustrations in the ancient records, of which, because it is now at hand, I will cite only this one at present, relating to clients and kindred. Marcus Cato in the speech which he delivered before the censors <hi rend="italic">Against Lentulus</hi> wrote thus:

<note>xli. 1, Jordan.</note>
<quote>Our forefathers regarded it as a more sacred obligation to defend their wards than not to deceive a client. One testifies in a client's behalf against one's relatives; testimony against a client is given by no one. A father held the first position of honour; next after him a patron.</quote></p>

<p>Masurius Sabinus, however, in the third book of his <hi rend="italic">Civil Law</hi> assigns a higher place to a guest than to a client. The passage from that book is this:

<note>Fr. 6, Huschke; 2 Bremer.</note>
<quote>In the matter of obligations our forefathers observed the following order: first to a ward, then to a guest, then to a client, next to a blood relation, finally to a relation by marriage. Other things being equal, women were given preference to men, but a ward who was under age took precedence of one who was a grown woman. Also those who were appointed by will to be guardians of the sons of a man against whom they had appeared in court, appeared for the ward in the same case.</quote></p>

<p>Very clear and strong testimony on this subject  <pb n="v1.p.421"/>  is furnished by the authority of Gaius Caesar, when he was high priest; for in the speech which he delivered <hi rend="italic">In Defence of the Bithynians</hi> he made use of this preamble:

<note>ii. p. 123, Dinter; <hi rend="italic">O. R. F.</hi><hi rend="sup">2</hi> p. 419.</note>
<quote>In consideration either of my guest-friendship with king Nicomedes or my relationship to those whose case is on trial, O Marcus Iuncus, I could not refuse this duty. For the remembrance of men ought not to be so obliterated by their death as not to be retained by those nearest to them, and without the height of disgrace we cannot forsake clients to whom we are bound to render aid even against our kinsfolk.</quote></p></div>

This one lion had drawn to himself the attention and eyes of all because of the activity and huge size of his body, his terrific and deep roar, the development of his muscles, and the mane streaming over his shoulders. There was brought in, among many others who had been condemned to fight with the wild beasts, the slave of an ex-consul; the slave's name was Androclus. When that lion saw him from a distance,</quote> says Apion, <quote>he stopped short as if in amazement, and then approached the man slowly and quietly, as if he recognized him. Then, wagging his tail in a mild and caressing way, after the manner and fashion of fawning dogs, he came close to the man, who was now half dead from fright, and gently licked his feet and hands. The man Androclus, while submitting to the caresses of so fierce a beast, regained his lost courage and gradually turned his eyes to look at the lion. Then,</quote> says Apion, <quote>you might have seen man and lion exchange joyful greetings, as if they had recognized each other.</quote></p>

<p>He says that at this sight, so truly astonishing, the people broke out into mighty shouts; and Gaius Caesar called Androclus to him and inquired the reason why that fiercest of lions had spared him alone. Then Androclus related a strange and  <pb n="v1.p.425"/>  surprising story. <quote>My master,</quote> said he, <quote>was governing Africa with proconsular authority. While there, I was forced by his undeserved and daily floggings to run away, and that my hiding-places might be safer from my master, the ruler of that country, I took refuge in lonely plains and deserts, intending, if food should fail me, to seek death in some form. Then,</quote> said he, <quote>when the midday sun was fierce and scorching, finding a remote and secluded cavern, I entered it, and hid myself. Not long afterwards this lion came to the same cave with one paw lame and bleeding, making known by groans and moans the torturing pain of his wound.</quote> And then, at the first sight of the approaching lion, Androclus said that his mind was overwhelmed with fear and dread. <quote>But when the lion,</quote> said he,<quote>had entered what was evidently his own lair, and saw me cowering at a distance, he approached me mildly and gently, and lifting up his foot, was evidently showing it to me and holding it out as if to ask for help. Then,</quote> said he, <quote>I drew out a huge splinter that was embedded in the sole of the foot, squeezed out the pus that had formed in the interior of the wound, wiped away the blood, and dried it thoroughly, being now free from any great feeling of fear. Then, relieved by that attention and treatment of mine, the lion, putting his paw in my hand, lay down and went to sleep, and for three whole years from that day the lion and I lived in the same cave, and on the same food as well. For he used to bring for me to the cave the choicest parts of the game which he took in hunting, which I, having no means of making a fire, dried in the noonday sun and ate. But,</quote> said he, <quote>after I had finally grown tired of that wild  <pb n="v1.p.427"/>  life, I left the cave when the lion had gone off to hunt, and after travelling nearly three days, I was seen and caught by some soldiers and taken from Africa to Rome to my master. He at once had me condemned to death by being thrown to the wild beasts. But,</quote> said he, <quote>I perceive that this lion was also captured, after I left him, and that he is now requiting me for my kindness and my cure of him.</quote></p>

<p>Apion records that Androclus told this story, and that when it had been made known to the people by being written out in full on a tablet and carried about the Circus, at the request of all Androclus was freed, acquitted and presented with the lion by vote of the people. <quote>Afterwards,</quote> said he, <quote>we used to see Androclus with the lion, attached to a slender leash, making the rounds of the shops throughout the city; Androclus was given money, the lion was sprinkled with flowers, and everyone who met them anywhere exclaimed: 'This is the lion that was a man's friend, this is the man who was physician to a lion.'</quote></p></div>

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A QUESTION that has been argued long and continuously by the most famous philosophers is whether voice has body or is incorporeal; for the word <hi rend="italic">incorporeus</hi> has been coined by some of them, corresponding exactly to the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)sw/matos.</foreign> Now a body is that which is either active or passive: this in Greek is defined as <foreign xml:lang="grc">to\ h)/toi poiou=n h)\ pa/sxon,</foreign> or <quote>that which either acts or is acted upon.</quote> Wishing  <pb n="v1.p.429"/>  to reproduce this definition the poet Lucretius wrote:

<note>II. 141, Arn.</note>
that voice is a body, and say that it is air which has been struck; Plato, however, thinks that voice is not corporeal: <quote>for,</quote> says he,

<note><hi rend="italic">Timaeus,</hi> p. 67, B.</note>
<quote>not the air which is struck, but the stroke and the blow themselves are voice.</quote> Democritus, and following him Epicurus, declare that voice consists of individual particles, and they call it, to use their own words, <foreign xml:lang="grc">r(eu=ma a)to/mwn,</foreign>

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I HAVE observed that the philosophers have varying opinions about the method of seeing and the nature of vision. The Stoics say

<note>II. 871, Arn.</note>
that the causes of sight are the emission of rays from the eyes to those objects which can be seen, and the simultaneous  <pb n="v1.p.431"/>  expansion of the air. Epicurus believes

<note>319, Usener.</note>
that there is a constant flow from all bodies of images of those bodies themselves, and that these impinge upon the eyes and hence the sensation of seeing arises. Plato is of the opinion

<note><hi rend="italic">Timaeus,</hi> p. 45, B.</note>
that a kind of fire or light issues from the eyes, and that this, being united and joined either with the light of the sun or with that of some other fire, by means of its own and the external force makes us see whatever it has struck and illumined. But here too we must not dally longer, but follow the advice of that Neoptolemus in Ennius, of whom I have just written,

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>VERRIUS FLACCUS, in the fourth book of his work <hi rend="italic">On the Meaning of Words,</hi> writes

that the days immediately following the Kalends, Nones and Ides, which the common people ignorantly call <quote>holidays,</quote> are properly called, and considered, <quote>ill-omened,</quote> for this reason:—<quote>When the city,</quote> he says, <quote>had been recovered from the Senonian Gauls, Lucius Atilius stated in the senate that Quintus Sulpicius, tribune of the soldiers, when on the eve of fighting against the Gauls at the Allia,

<note>In 390 B. C.</note>
offered sacrifice in anticipation of that battle on the day after the Ides; that the army of the Roman people was thereupon cut to pieces, and three days later the whole  <pb n="v1.p.433"/>  city, except the Capitol, was taken. Also many other senators said that they remembered that whenever with a view to waging war a magistrate of the Roman people had sacrificed on the day after the Kalends, Nones or Ides, in the very next battle of that war the State had suffered disaster. Then the senate referred the matter to the pontiffs, that they might take what action they saw fit. The pontiffs decreed that no offering would properly be made on those days.</quote></p>

<p>Many also avoid the fourth day before the Kalends, Nones and Ides, as ill-omened. It is often inquired whether any religious reason for that observance is recorded.

<p>In what respect, and how far, history differs from annals; and a quotation on that subject from the first book of the <hi rend="italic">Histories</hi> of Sempronius Asellio.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>SOME think that history differs from annals in this particular, that while each is a narrative of events, yet history is properly an account of events in which the narrator took part; and that this is the opinion of some men is stated by Verrius Flaccus in the fourth book of his treatise <hi rend="italic">On the Meaning of Words.</hi>

<note>p. xiv. Müller.</note>
He adds that he for his part has doubts about the matter, but he thinks that the view may have some appearance of reason, since <foreign xml:lang="grc">i(stori/a</foreign> in Greek means a  <pb n="v1.p.435"/>  knowledge of current events. But we often hear it said that annals are exactly the same as histories, but that histories are not exactly the same as annals; just as a man is necessarily an animal, but an animal is not necessarily a man.</p>

<p>Thus they say that history is the setting forth of events or their description, or whatever term may be used; but that annals set down the events of many years successively, with observance of the chronological order. When, however, events are recorded, not year by year, but day by day, such a history is called in Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)fhmeri/s,</foreign> or <quote>a diary,</quote> a term of which the Latin interpretation is found in the first book of Sempronius Asellio. I have quoted a passage of some length from that book, in order at the same time to show what his opinion is of the difference between history and chronicle.</p>

<p><quote>But between those,</quote> he says,

<note>Fr. 1, Peter.</note>
<quote>who have desired to leave us annals, and those who have tried to write the history of the Roman people, there was this essential difference. The books of annals merely made known what happened and in what year it happened, which is like writing a diary, which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)fhmeri/s.</foreign> For my part, I realize that it is not enough to make known what has been done, but that one should also show with what purpose and for what reason things were done.</quote> A little later in the same book Asellio writes:

<note>Fr. 2, Peter.</note>
<quote>For annals cannot in any way make men more eager to defend their country, or more reluctant to do wrong. Further-more, to write over and over again in whose consulship a war was begun and ended, and who in consequence entered the city in a triumph, and in that  <pb n="v1.p.437"/>  book not to state what happened in the course of the war, what decrees the senate made during that time, or what law or bill was passed, and with what motives these things were done—that is to tell stories to children, not to write history.</quote></p></div>

<p>The meaning of <hi rend="italic">adoptatio</hi> and also of <hi rend="italic">adrogatio,</hi> and how they differ; and the formula used by the official who, when children are adopted, brings the business before the people.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>WHEN outsiders are taken into another's family and given the relationship of children, it is done either through a praetor or through the people. If done by a praetor, the process is called <hi rend="italic">adoptatio;</hi> if through the people, <hi rend="italic">arrogatio.</hi> Now, we have <hi rend="italic">adoptatio,</hi> when those who are adopted are surrendered in court through a thrice repeated sale

<note>This was a symbolic sale, made by thrice touching a balance with a penny, in the presence of a praetor; see Suet., <hi rend="italic">Aug.</hi> lxiv.</note>
by the father under whose control they are, and are claimed by the one who adopts them in the presence of the official before whom the legal action takes place. The process is called <hi rend="italic">adrogatio,</hi> when persons who are their own masters deliver themselves into the control of another, and are themselves responsible for the act. But arrogations are not made without due consideration and investigation; for the so-called <hi rend="italic">comitia curiata</hi>

<note>The assembly of the <hi rend="italic">curiae,</hi> the thirty divisions into which the Roman citizens were divided, ten for each of the original three tribes. It was superseded at an early period by the <hi rend="italic">comitia centuriata,</hi> and its action was confined to formalities. See xv. 27. 5.</note>
are summoned under the authority of the pontiffs, and it is inquired whether the age of the one who wishes to adopt is not rather suited to begetting children of his own; precaution is taken that the property of the one who is being adopted is not being sought under false pretences; and an oath is administered which is said  <pb n="v1.p.439"/>  to have been formulated for use in that ceremony by Quintus Mucius,

<note>Fr. 13, Huschke; I. p. 58 and p. 80, Bremer.</note>
when he was pontifex maxinus. But no one may be adopted by <hi rend="italic">adrogatio</hi> who is not yet ready to assume the gown of manhood. The name <hi rend="italic">adrogatio</hi> is due to the fact that this kind of transfer to another's family is accomplished through a <hi rend="italic">rogatio</hi> or <quote>request,</quote> put to the people.</p>

<p>The language of this request is as follows: <quote>Express your desire and ordain that Lucius Valerius be the son of Lucius Titius as justly and lawfully as if he had been born of that father and the mother of his family, and that Titius have that power of life and death over Valerius which a father has over a son. This, just as I have stated it, I thus ask of you, fellow Romans.</quote></p>

<p>Neither a ward nor a woman who is not under the control of her father may be adopted by <hi rend="italic">adrogatio;</hi> since women have no part in the comitia, and it is not right that guardians should have so much authority and power over their wards as to be able to subject to the control of another a free person who has been committed to their protection. Freedmen, however, may legally be adopted in that way by freeborn citizens, according to Masurius Sabinus.

<note>Fr. 27, Huschke; <hi rend="italic">Jus. Civ.</hi> 60, Bremer.</note>
But he adds that it is not allowed, and he thinks it never ought to be allowed, that men of the condition of freedmen should by process of adoption usurp the privileges of the freeborn. <quote>Furthermore,</quote> says he, <quote>if that ancient law be maintained, even a slave may be surrendered by his master for adoption through the agency of a praetor.</quote> And he declares that several authorities

<note>Cato, Fr. 4<hi rend="sup">a</hi>, I. p. 21, Bremer.</note>
on ancient law have written that this can be done.</p>

<p>I have observed in a speech of Publius Scipio <hi rend="italic">On</hi>  <pb n="v1.p.441"/>  <hi rend="italic">Morals,</hi> which he made to the people in his censorship, that among the things that he criticized, on the ground that they were done contrary to the usage of our forefathers, he also found fault with this, that an adopted son was of profit to his adoptive father in gaining the rewards for paternity.

<note>That is, the privileges and exemptions conferred upon the fathers of children, later comprised under the <hi rend="italic">ius trium liberorum;</hi> see ii. 15. 3 ff.</note>
The passage in that speech is as follows:

<note><hi rend="italic">O.R.F.</hi><hi rend="sup">2</hi> p. 180.</note>
<quote>A father votes in one tribe, the son in another,

<note>The meaning is that a man who had been adopted would vote in the tribe of his adoptive father, which might be different from that of his own father.</note>
an adopted son is of as much advantage as if one had a son of his own; orders are given to take the census of absentees, and hence it is not necessary for anyone to appear in person at the census.</quote></p></div>

<p>The Latin word coined by Sinnius Capito for <quote>solecism,</quote> and what the early writers of Latin called that same fault: and also Sinnius Capito's definition of a solecism.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A solecism, which by Sinnius Capito and other lien of his time was called in Latin <hi rend="italic">inparilitas,</hi> or <quote>inequality,</quote> the earlier Latin writers termed <hi rend="italic">stribiligo,</hi>

<note>This word, which seems to occur only here and in Arnobius i. 36, apparently means <quote>twisted, awry.</quote></note>
evidently meaning the improper use of an inverted form of expression, a sort of twist as it were. This kind of fault is thus defined by Sinnius Capito, in a letter which lie wrote to Clodius Tuscus: <quote>A solecism,</quote> he says,

<note>Fr. 2, Huschke.</note>
<quote>is an irregular and incongruous joining together of the parts of speech.</quote></p>

<p>Since <quote>soloecismus</quote> is a Greek word, the question is often asked, whether it was used by the men of  <pb n="v1.p.443"/>  Attica who spoke most elegantly. But I have as yet found neither <hi rend="italic">soloecismus</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">barbarismus</hi>

<note>These words were applied to any impropriety in the use of language.</note>
in good Greek writers; for just as they used <foreign xml:lang="grc">ba/rbaros,</foreign> so they used <foreign xml:lang="grc">so/loikos.</foreign>

<note>Both words have the general meaning of <quote>foreign</quote> ; according to some, <foreign xml:lang="grc">so/loikos</foreign> was derived from Soloi, a town of Cilicia, whose inhabitants spoke a perverted Attic dialect. This derivation seems to be accepted to-day. <hi rend="italic">Barbarus</hi> is regarded as an onomatopoeic word, representing stammering; <hi rend="italic">cf. balbus.</hi></note>
So too our earlier writers used <hi rend="italic">soloecus</hi> regularly, <hi rend="italic">soloecismus</hi> never, I think. But if that be so, <hi rend="italic">soloecismus</hi> is proper usage neither in Greek nor in Latin.</p></div>

<p>One who says <hi rend="italic">pluria, compluria</hi> and <hi rend="italic">compluriens</hi> speaks good Latin, and not incorrectly.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>AN extremely learned man, a friend of mine, chanced in the course of conversation to use the word <hi rend="italic">pluria,</hi> not at all with a desire to show off, or because he thought that <hi rend="italic">plura</hi> ought not to be used. For he is a man of serious scholarship and devoted to the duties of life, and not at all meticulous in the use of words. But, I think, from constant perusal of the early writers a word which he had often met in books had become second nature to his tongue.</p>

<p>There was present when he said this a very audacious critic of language, who had read very little and that of the most ordinary sort; this fellow had some trifling instruction in the art of grammar, which was partly ill-digested and confused and partly false, and this he used to cast like dust into the eyes of any with whom he had entered into discussion. Thus on that occasion he said to my friend: <quote>You were incorrect in saying <hi rend="italic">pluria;</hi> for that form has  <pb n="v1.p.445"/>  neither justification nor authorities.</quote> Thereupon that friend of mine rejoined with a smile: <quote>My: good sir, since I now have leisure from more serious affairs, I wish you would please explain to me why <hi rend="italic">pluria</hi> and <hi rend="italic">compluria</hi>—for they do not differ-are used barbarously and incorrectly by Marcus Cato,

<note>Fr. 24, Peter.</note>
Quintus Claudius,

<note>Fr. 90, Peter.</note>
Valerius Antias,

<note>Fr. 65, Peter.</note>
Lucius Aelius,

<note>Fr. 48, Fun.</note>
Publius Nigidius,

<note>Frag. 64, Swoboda.</note>
and Marcus Varro, whom we have as endorsers and sanctioners of this form, to say nothing of a great number of the early poets and orators.</quote> And the fellow answered with excessive arrogance: <quote>You are welcome to those authorities of yours, dug up from the age of the Fauns and Aborigines, but what is your answer to this rule? No neuter comparative in the nominative plural has an <hi rend="italic">i</hi> before its final <hi rend="italic">a;</hi> for example, <hi rend="italic">meliora, maiora, graviora.</hi> Accordingly, then, it is proper to say <hi rend="italic">plura,</hi> not <hi rend="italic">pluria,</hi> in order that there be no i before final a in a comparative, contrary to the invariable rule.</quote></p>

<p>Then that friend of mine, thinking that the self-confident fellow deserved few words, said: <quote>There are numerous letters of Sinnius Capito, a very learned man, collected in a single volume and deposited, I think, in the Temple of Peace. The first letter is addressed to Pacuvius Labeo, and it is prefixed by the title, <hi rend="italic">'Pluria,</hi> not <hi rend="italic">plura,</hi> should be used.'

<note>Fr. 1, Huschke.</note>
In that letter he has collected the grammatical rules to show that <hi rend="italic">pluria,</hi> and not <hi rend="italic">plura,</hi> is good Latin. Therefore I refer you to Capito. From him you will learn at the same time, provided you can comprehend what is written in that letter, that <hi rend="italic">pluria,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">plura,</hi> is the positive and simple form, not, as it seems to you, a comparative.</quote></p>

<p>It also confirms that view of Sinnius, that when  <pb n="v1.p.447"/>  we say <hi rend="italic">complures</hi> or <quote>several,</quote> we are not using a comparative. Moreover, from the word <hi rend="italic">compluria</hi> is derived the adverb <hi rend="italic">compluriens,</hi> <quote>often.</quote> Since this is not a common word, I have added a verse of Plautus, from the comedy entitled <hi rend="italic">The Persian:</hi>

<note>v. 534.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>What do you fear?—By Heaven! I am afraid;</l> <l>I've had the feeling many a time and oft (<hi rend="italic">compluriens</hi>).</l></quote>  Marcus Cato too, in the fourth book of his <hi rend="italic">Origins,</hi> has used this word three times in the same passage:

<note>Fr. 79, Peter.</note>
<quote>Often (<hi rend="italic">compluriens</hi>) did their mercenary soldiers kill one another in large numbers in the camp; often (<hi rend="italic">compluriens</hi>) did many together desert to the enemy; often (<hi rend="italic">compluriens</hi>) did they attack their general.</quote></p>

<p>Some remarkable stories about the elder Publius Africanus, drawn from the annals.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The tale which in Grecian history is told of Olympias, wife of king Philip and mother of Alexander, is also recorded of the mother of that Publius Scipio who was the first to be called Africanus. For both Gaius Oppius

<note>Fr. 2, Peter<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
and Julius Hyginus,

<note>Fr. 4, Peter<hi rend="sup">2</hi>; p. 37, Bunte.</note>
as well as others who have written of the life and deeds of Africanus, declare that his mother was for a long time thought to be barren, and that Publius Scipio, her husband, had also given up hope of offspring; that afterwards, in her own room and bed, when she was lying alone in the absence of her husband and had fallen asleep, of a sudden a huge serpent was seen lying by her side; and that when those who had seen it were frightened and cried out, the snake glided away and could not be found. It is said that Publius Scipio himself consulted soothsayers about the occurrence; that they, after offering sacrifice, declared that he would have children, and not many days after that serpent had been seen in her bed, the woman began to <pb n="v2.p.5"/> experience the indications and sensation of conception.

<note>A similar story is told of Augustus (Suet. <hi rend="italic">Aug.</hi> xciv. 4) as well as of Alexander the Great (§ 1 and Livy, xxvi. 19. 7).</note>
Afterwards, in the tenth month, she gave birth to that Publius Scipio who conquered Hannibal and the Carthaginians in Africa in the second Punic war.

<note>At Zama, 202 B.C.</note>
But it was far more because of his exploits than because of that prodigy that he too

<note>As well as Alexander and Augustus; see note 1.</note>
was believed to be a man of godlike excellence.</p>

<p>This too I venture to relate, which the same writers that I mentioned before have put on record: This Scipio Africanus used often to go to the Capitolium in the latter part of the night, before the break of day, give orders that the shrine of Jupiter be opened,

<note>The name <hi rend="italic">Capitolium</hi> was applied to the southern summit of the Capitoline Hill, and also to the temple of <hi rend="italic">Juppiter Optimus Maximus.</hi> The temple contained three shrines, to Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva.</note>
and remain there a long time alone, apparently consulting Jupiter about matters of state; and the guardians of the temple were often amazed that on his coming to the Capitolium alone at such an hour the dogs,

<note>The temple was guarded at night by dogs, as were doubtless other similar places, and as it is said that the ruins of Pompeii are to-day. Geese were also used for the purpose; see Cic. <hi rend="italic">pro Sex. Rose. 56, anseribus cibaria publice locantur et canes aluntur in Capitolio, ut significent, si fures venerint.</hi></note>
that flew at all other intruders, neither barked at him nor molested him.</p>

<p>These popular beliefs about Scipio seemed to be confirmed and attested by many remarkable actions and sayings of his. Of these the following is a single example: He was engaged in the siege of a town

<note>According to Valerius Maximus, iii. 7. 1, the town was Badia.</note>
in Spain, which was strongly fortified and defended, protected by its position, and also well provisioned; and there was no prospect of taking it. One day he sat holding court in his camp, at a point from which there was a distant view of the town.  <pb n="v2.p.7"/>  Then one of the soldiers who were on trial before him asked in the usual way on what day and in what place he bade them give bail for their appearance. Then Scipio, stretching forth his hand towards the very citadel of the town which he was besieging, said: <quote>Appear the day after to-morrow in yonder place.</quote> And so it happened; on the third day, the day on which he had ordered them to appear, the town was captured, and on that same day he held court in the citadel of the place.</p></div>

This error has escaped the notice of many, in spite of their diligent search for opportunities to find fault with Caesellius, even through misrepresentation. Now, Caesellius wrote that Quintus Ennius, in the thirteenth book of his <hi rend="italic">Annals,</hi> used <hi rend="italic">cor</hi> in the masculine gender.</p>

<p>I add Caesellius' own words: <quote>Ennius used <hi rend="italic">cor,</hi> like many other words, in the masculine gender; for in <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi> xiii. he wrote <hi rend="italic">quem cor.</hi></quote> He then quoted two verses of Ennius

<note>381 ff., Vahlen<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
:  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>While Hannibal, of bold breast, did me exhort</l> <l>Not to make war, what heart thought he was mine?</l></quote>  <pb n="v2.p.9"/>  The speaker is Antiochus, king of Asia. He is surprised and indignant that Hannibal, the Carthaginian, discourages his desire to make war on the people of Rome.

<note>Antiochus did not follow Hannibal's advice and suffered a crushing defeat at Thermopylae in 191 B.C.</note>
Now, Caesellius understands the lines to mean that Antiochus says: <quote>Hannibal dissuades me from making war. In so doing, what kind of heart does he think I have, and how foolish does he believe me to be, when he gives me such advice?</quote></p>

<p>So Caesellius; but Ennius' meaning was quite different. For there are three verses, not two, which belong to this utterance of the poet's, and Caesellius overlooked the third verse:  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Through valour war's great advocate and friend.</l></quote>  The meaning and arrangement of these three verses I believe to be this: <quote>Hannibal, that boldest and most valiant of men, who I believed (for that is the meaning of <hi rend="italic">cor meum credidit,</hi> exactly as if he had said <quote>who l, foolish man, believed</quote>) would strongly advise war, discourages and dissuades me from making war.</quote> Caesellius, however, somewhat carelessly misled as to the connection of the words, assumed that Ennius said <hi rend="italic">quem cor,</hi> reading <hi rend="italic">quem</hi> with an acute accent,

<note>The interrogative <hi rend="italic">quem</hi> would be stressed (have <quote>an acute accent</quote>), while the relative <hi rend="italic">quem</hi> would not (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, would have a grave accent).</note>
as if it belonged with <hi rend="italic">cor</hi> and not with <hi rend="italic">Hannibal.</hi> But I am well aware that one might, if anyone should have so little understanding, defend Caesellius' masculine <hi rend="italic">cor</hi> by maintaining that the third verse should be read apart from the others, as if Antiochus had exclaimed in broken and abrupt language <quote>a mighty adviser!</quote> But those who would argue thus do not deserve a reply.</p>  <pb n="v2.p.11"/>  </div>

<!--<argument>-->

<p>What Tullius Tiro, Cicero's freedman, criticized in the speech which Marcus Cato delivered in the senate in defence of the Rhodians; and our answer to his strictures.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THE State of Rhodes is famed for the happy situation of the island, its celebrated works of art, its skill in seamanship and its naval victories. Although a friend and ally of the Roman people, that State was on cordial terms with Perses, son of Philip and king of Macedon, with whom the Romans were at war;

<note>The second Macedonian war, 171–168 B.C. The Rhodians sided with the Romans until 169 B.C., when they sent envoys to the Roman head-quarters and to the senate, declaring that they would no longer tolerate a war which injured their traffic with Macedonia and diminished their revenues; that they were disposed to declare war against the party which should refuse to make peace, and that they had already formed an alliance with Crete and with the Asiatic cities. The Romans, who had in the past treated the Rhodians with special favour, were indignant and glad of the opportunity to humble the presumptuous State. When it was proposed in the senate to declare war upon Rhodes, the Rhodians resorted to every means of placating the Romans. Cato pleaded their cause, pointing out that they had committed no offence, unless the Romans wished to punish mere wishes and thoughts. His words, however, were in vain. The senate deprived the Rhodians of their possessions on the mainland and humiliated them in other ways. Alliance with Rhodes was not renewed until 164 B.C., and then only after many entreaties.</note>
accordingly, the Rhodians often sent envoys to Rome and tried to reconcile the contending parties. But when their attempts at peace-making failed, many of the Rhodians harangued the people in their assemblies, urging that if peace were not made, the Rhodians should aid the king in his contest with the people of Rome; but as to that question no official action was taken. When, however, Perses was defeated and taken prisoner, the Rhodians were in great fear because of what had been said and done on many occasions in the popular assemblies; and they sent envoys to Rome, to apologize for the hastiness of some of their fellow-citizens and vindicate their loyalty as a community. When the envoys reached Rome and were admitted to the  <pb n="v2.p.13"/>  senate, after having humbly pleaded their cause they left the House, and the senators were called upon for their opinions. When some of the members complained of the Rhodians, declaring that they had been disloyal, and recommended that war be declared upon them, then Marcus Cato arose. He endeavoured to defend and save our very good and faithful allies, to whom many of the most distinguished senators were hostile through a desire to plunder and possess their wealth; and he delivered that famous speech entitled <hi rend="italic">For the Rhodians,</hi> which is included in the fifth book of his <hi rend="italic">Origins</hi> and is also in circulation as a separate publication.</p>

<p>Now Tullius Tiro, Marcus Cicero's freedman, was unquestionably a man of refined taste and by no means unacquainted with our early history and literature. He had been liberally educated from his earliest years, and Cicero found in him an assistant, and in a sense a partner, in his literary work. But surely Tiro showed more presumption than can be tolerated or excused. For he wrote a letter

<note>p. 9, Lion.</note>
to Quintus Axius, a friend of his patron, with excessive assurance and warmth, in which, as he imagined, he criticized that speech <hi rend="italic">For the Rhodians</hi> with keen and fine judgment. It chanced to take my fancy to touch upon certain of the animadversions which he makes in that letter, and I shall doubtless be the more readily pardoned for finding fault with Tiro, because he took Cato to task.</p>

<p>His first charge was that Cato, <quote>ignorantly and absurdly,</quote> to use Tiro's own language, made use of a preamble which was excessively arrogant and excessively severe and fault-finding, in which he declared that he feared lest the fathers, having their  <pb n="v2.p.15"/>  minds upset by joy and exultation at their success, might act unwisely and be in no state of mind for understanding and deliberating aright. Tiro says: <quote>Advocates who are pleading for clients ought in their opening remarks to win over and propitiate the jurors with complimentary and respectful language; they ought, while their minds, as they wait to hear the case, are still in suspense and cool, to render them complacent, and not to arouse contradiction by insults and arrogant threats.</quote> Then he has given us Cato's own preamble, which runs as follows:

<note><hi rend="italic">Origines,</hi> v. 1, Jordan.</note>
<quote>I am aware that in happy, successful and prosperous times the minds of most men are wont to be puffed up, and their arrogance and self-confidence to wax and swell. Therefore I am now gravely concerned, since this enterprise has gone on so successfully, lest something adverse may happen in our deliberations, to bring to naught our good fortune, and lest this joy of ours may become too extravagant. Adversity subdues and shows what ought to be done; prosperity, since it inspires joy, commonly turns men aside from wise counsel and right understanding. Therefore it is with the greater emphasis that I advise and urge that this matter be put off for a few days, until we regain our self-command after so great rejoicing.</quote></p>

<p><quote>Then what Cato says next,</quote> continues Tiro, <quote>amounts to a confession rather than a defence; for it does not contain a refutation or shifting of the charge, but the sharing of it with many others, which of course amounts to nothing in the way of excuse. Moreover,</quote> says Tiro, <quote>he also acknowledges that the Rhodians, who were accused of favouring the king's cause against the Roman people  <pb n="v2.p.17"/>  and wishing him success, did so from motives of self-interest, for fear that the Romans, already proud and self-confident, with the addition of a victory over king Perses might become immoderately insolent.</quote> And he gives Cato's own words, as follows:

<note><hi rend="italic">Origines,</hi> v. 2, Jordan.</note>
<quote>And I really think that the Rhodians did not wish us to end the war as we did, with a victory over king Perses. But it was not the Rhodians alone who had that feeling, but I believe that many peoples and many nations agreed with them. And I am inclined to think that some of them did not wish us success, not in order that we might be disgraced, but because they feared that if there were no one of whom we stood in dread, we would do whatsoever we chose. I think, then, that it was with an eye to their own freedom that they held that opinion, in order not to be under our sole dominion and enslaved to us. But for all that, the Rhodians never publicly aided Perses. Reflect how much more cautiously we deal with one another as individuals. For each one of us, if he thinks that anything is being done contrary to his interests, strives with might and main to prevent it; but they in spite of all permitted this very thing to happen.</quote> </p>

<p>Now as to his criticism of Cato's introduction, Tiro ought to have known that although Cato defended the Rhodians, he did so as a senator who had been consul and censor and was recommending what he thought was best for the public welfare, not as an advocate pleading the cause of the accused. For one kind of introduction is appropriate for a man who is defending clients before jurors and striving in every way to excite pity and compassion; quite another for a man of eminent authority, when the  <pb n="v2.p.19"/>  senate is asked for its opinion on a matter of State, and when, indignant at the highly unjust opinions of some of the members, he gives plain and emphatic expression at once to his indignation and his sorrow, speaking in behalf of the public welfare and the safety of our allies. Indeed, it is a proper and salutary rule of the schools of rhetoric, that jurors who are to pass judgment on the person of a stranger and on a case which does not personally concern them (so that apart from the duty of acting as jurors no danger or emolument will come to them) ought to be conciliated and induced by mild and soothing language to have regard for the reputation and safety of the prisoner at the bar. But when the common prestige, honour and advantage of all are involved, and therefore one must advise what is to be done, or what must be put off that has already been begun, then one who busies oneself with an introduction designed to make his hearers friendly and kindly disposed towards himself wastes his efforts in needless talk. For the common interests and dangers have themselves already disposed the jurors to listen to advice, and it is rather they themselves that demand good-will

<note>That is, towards the welfare of the State. Tiro seems to be making a word-play, using <hi rend="italic">benivolos</hi> and <hi rend="italic">benivolentiam</hi> in the same sense, but with a different application.</note>
on the part of their counsellor. But when Tiro says that Cato admitted that the Rhodians did not wish the Romans to fight as successfully as they did, and king Perses to be conquered by the Roman people, and when he asserts that he declared that not the Rhodians alone, but many other nations too, had the same feeling, but that this availed nothing in excuse or extenuation of their fault—in this very first point Tiro is guilty of a shameless lie. He quotes Cato's words, yet misrepresents him by giving them a false interpretation.  <pb n="v2.p.21"/>  For Cato does not admit that the Rhodians did not wish the Roman people to be victorious, but said that he thought they did not; and this was unquestionably an expression of his own opinion, not an concession of the guilt of the Rhodians. On this point, in my judgment at least, Cato is not only free from reproach, but is even deserving of praise and admiration. For he apparently expressed a frank and conscientious opinion adverse to the Rhodians; but then, having established confidence in his candour,

<note>Cf. i. 6. 6.</note>
he so changed and shifted that very statement which seemed to militate against them, that on that account alone it seemed right that they should be more highly esteemed and beloved by the people of Rome; inasmuch as they took no steps to aid the king, although they wished him to succeed and although his success would have been to their advantage.</p>

<p>Later on, Tiro quotes the following words from the same speech:

<note>v 3, Jordan.</note>
<quote>Shall we, then, of a sudden abandon these great services given and received and this strong friendship? Shall we be the first to do what we say they merely wished to do?</quote> <quote>This,</quote> says Tiro, <quote>is a worthless and faulty argument.

<note>An enthymeme in logic was an argument consisting of two propositions, the antecedent and its consequence.</note>
For it might be replied: 'Certainly we shall anticipate them, for if we do not, we shall be caught unawares and must fall into the snares against which we failed to guard in advance.' Lucilius,</quote> he says, <quote>justly criticizes

<note>1169, Marx.</note>
the poet Euripides for this reason, that when king Polyphontes declared that he had killed his brother, because his brother had  <pb n="v2.p.23"/>  previously planned to slay him, Meropa, his brother's wife, confuted the king with these words

<note>Fr. 451, Nauck<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
:  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>If, as you say, my husband planned your death,</l> <l>You too should only plan, till that time came.</l></quote>  But that,</quote> says Tiro, <quote>is altogether full of absurdity, to wish to do something, and yet have the design and purpose of never doing what you wish to do.</quote> But, as a matter of fact, Tiro failed to observe that the reason for taking precautions is not the same in all cases, and that the occupations and actions of human life, and the obligations of anticipation or postponement or even of taking vengeance or precautions, are not like a combat of gladiators. For to a gladiator ready to fight the fortune of battle offers the alternative, either to kill, if he should conquer, or to die, if he should yield. But the life of men in general is not restricted by such unfair or inevitable necessities that one must be first to commit an injury in order to avoid suffering injury. In fact, such conduct was so alien to the humanity of the Roman people that they often forbore to avenge the wrongs inflicted upon them.</p>

<p>Then Tiro says that later in that same speech Cato used arguments that were disingenuous and excessively audacious, not suited to the character which Cato showed at other times, but cunning and deceitful, resembling the subtleties of the Greek sophists. <quote>For although,</quote> says he, <quote>he charged the Rhodians with having wished to make war on the Roman people, he declared that they did not deserve punishment, because they had not made war in spite of their strong desire to do so.</quote> He says that Cato introduced what the logicians call an  <pb n="v2.p.25"/>  <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)pagwgh/,</foreign>

<note>Defined by Cicero, <hi rend="italic">Topica,</hi> 42 f., as <hi rend="italic">inductio,</hi> or an inductive argument, with examples; see also §§ 45–47, below.</note>
a most treacherous and sophistical device. designed not so much for the truth as for cavil, since by deceptive examples he tried to establish and prove that no one who wished to do wrong deserved to be punished, unless he actually accomplished his desire. Now Cato's words in that speech are as follows:

<note>v. 4, Jordan.</note>
<quote>He who uses the strongest language against them says that they wished to be our enemies. Pray is there any one of you who, so far as he is concerned, would think it fair to suffer punishment because he is accused of having wished to do wrong? No one, I think; for so far as I am concerned, I should not.</quote> Then a little farther on he says:

<note>v. 5, Jordan.</note>
<quote>What? Is there any law so severe as to provide that if anyone wish to do so and so, he be fined a thousand sesterces, provided that be less than half his property;

<note>The law provided that a man should not be fined in a sum greater than half his property.</note>
if anyone shall desire to have more than five hundred acres,

<note>This was forbidden by a Licinian Law, passed in 367 B.C.; the <hi rend="italic">iuger</hi> was really about two-thirds of an acre. Another Licinian Law provided that no one should pasture more than 100 head of cattle, or 500 of smaller animals, on the public lands. The number, and the amount of the fine, are here expressed indefinitely.</note>
let the fine be so much; if anyone shall wish to have a greater number of cattle, let the fine be thus and so. In fact, we all wish to have more, and we do so with impunity.</quote> Later he continues:

<note>v. 6, Jordan.</note>
<quote>But if it is not right for honour to be conferred because anyone says that he wished to do well, but yet did not do so, shall the Rhodians suffer, not because they did wrong, but because they are said to have wished to do wrong?</quote> With such arguments Tullius Tiro says that Marcus Cato strove to show that the Rhodians also ought not to be punished, because although they had wished to be enemies of the Roman people,  <pb n="v2.p.27"/>  they had actually not been such. Furthermore, he says that it cannot be denied that to wish to have more than five hundred acres, which was forbidden by Stolo's

<note>That is, the Licinian Law of C. Licinius Stolo.</note>
bill, is not exactly the same thing as to wish to make an unjust and unrighteous war upon the Roman people; also that it could not be denied that rewards and punishments belong to different categories. <quote>For services,</quote> he says, <quote>that are promised should be awaited, and not rewarded until they are performed; but in the case of threatening injuries, it is fair to guard against them rather than wait for them. For it is an admission of the greatest folly,</quote> he declares, <quote>not to go to meet wickedness that is planned, but to await and expect it, and then, when it has been committed and accomplished, at last to inflict punishment, when what is done cannot be undone.</quote></p>

<p>These are the criticisms which Tiro passed upon Cato, not altogether pointless or wholly unreasonable; but as a matter of fact, Cato did not leave this <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)pagwgh/</foreign> bare, isolated and unsupported, but he propped it up in various ways and clothed it with many other arguments. Furthermore, since lie had an eye as much to the interests of the State as to those of the Rhodians, he regarded nothing that he said or did in that matter as discreditable, provided he strove by every kind of argument to save our allies. And first of all, he very cleverly sought to find actions which are prohibited, not by natural or by international law, but by statutes passed to remedy some evil or meet an emergency; such for example as the one which limited the number of cattle or the amount of land. In such cases that which is forbidden cannot lawfully be done; but to  <pb n="v2.p.29"/>  wish to do it, if it should be allowed, is not dishonourable. And then he gradually compared and connected such actions as these with that which in itself it is neither lawful to do nor to wish to do. Then finally, in order that the impropriety of the comparison may not become evident, he defends it by numerous bulwarks, not laying great stress on those trivial and ideal censures of unlawful desires, such as form the arguments of philosophers in their leisure moments, but striving with might and main for one single end, namely, that the cause of the Rhodians, whose friendship it was to the interests of the commonwealth to retain, should be shown either to be just, or in any event, at least pardonable. Accordingly, he now affirms that the Rhodians did not make war and did not desire to do so; but again he declares that only acts should be considered and judged, and that mere empty wishes are liable neither to laws nor punishment; sometimes, however, as if admitting their guilt, he asks that they be pardoned and shows that forgiveness is expedient in human relations, arousing fear of popular outbreaks, if pardon is not granted, and on the other hand showing that if they forgive, the greatness of the Roman people will be maintained.</p>

<p>The charge of arrogance too, which in particular was brought against the Rhodians in the senate at that time, he evaded and eluded by a brilliant and all but inspired mode of reply. I shall give Cato's very words,

<note>v. 7, Jordan.</note>
since Tiro has passed them by: <quote>They say that the Rhodians are arrogant, bringing a charge against them which I should on no account wish to have brought against me and my children. Suppose they are arrogant. What is that to us?  <pb n="v2.p.31"/>  Are you to be angry merely because someone is more arrogant than we are?</quote> Absolutely nothing could be said with greater force or weight than this apostrophe against men proud of their deeds, loving pride in themselves, but condemning it in others.</p>

<p>It is further to be observed that throughout that speech of Cato's recourse is had to every weapon and device of the art rhetorical; but we are not conscious of their use, as we are in mock combats or in battles feigned for the sake of entertainment. For the case was not pleaded, I say, with an excess of refinement, elegance and observance of rule, but just as in a doubtful battle, when the troops are scattered, the contest rages in many parts of the field with uncertain outcome, so in that case at that time, when the notorious arrogance of the Rhodians had aroused the hatred and hostility of many men, Cato used every method of protection and defence without discrimination, at one time commending the Rhodians as of the highest merit, again exculpating them and declaring them blameless, yet again demanding that their property and riches should not be coveted, now asking for their pardon as if they were in the wrong, now pointing out their friendship to the commonwealth, appealing now to clemency, now to the mercy shown by our forefathers, now to the public interest. All this might perhaps have been said in a more orderly and euphonic style, yet I do not believe that it could have been said with greater vigour and vividness. It was therefore unfair of Tullius Tiro to single out from all the qualities of so rich a speech, apt in their connection with one another, a small and bare part to criticize, by asserting that it was not worthy  <pb n="v2.p.33"/>  of Marcus Cato to maintain that the mere desire for delinquencies that were not actually committed did not merit punishment.</p>

<p>But one will form a juster and more candid opinion of these words of mine, spoken in reply to Tullius Tiro, and judge accordingly, if one will take in hand Cato's own speech in its entirety, and will also take the trouble to look up and read the letter of Tiro to Axius. For then he will be able either to correct or confirm what I have said more truthfully and after fuller examination.</p>  </div>

<p>What sort of slaves Caelius Sabinus, the writer on civil law, said were commonly sold with caps on their heads, and why; and what chattels were sold under a crown in the days of our forefathers; and the meaning of that same expression <quote>under a crown.</quote></p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>CAELIUS SABINUS, the jurist, has written

<note>Fr. 2, Huschke; <hi rend="italic">De Manc</hi>. fr. 19, Bremer.</note>
that it was usual, when selling slaves, to put caps on those for whom the seller assumed no responsibility. He says that the reason for that custom was, that the law required that slaves of that kind be marked when offered for sale, in order that buyers might not err and be deceived; that it might not be necessary to wait for the bill of sale, but might be obvious at once what kind of slaves they were. <quote>Just so,</quote> he says, <quote>in ancient times slaves taken by right of conquest were sold wearing garlands, and hence were said to be sold 'under a crown.' For as the crown was a sign that those who were being sold were captives, so a cap upon the head indicated that slaves were being sold for whom the seller gave the buyer no guarantee.</quote></p>  <pb n="v2.p.35"/>

<p>There is, however, another explanation of the reason for the common saying that captives were sold <quote>under a crown</quote> namely, because a guard of soldiers stood around the bands of prisoners that were offered for sale, and such a ring of soldiers was called <hi rend="italic">corona.</hi> But that the reason which I first gave is the more probable one is made clear by Marcus Cato in the book which he wrote <hi rend="italic">On Military Science.</hi></p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THERE was in the land of Greece an actor of wide reputation, who excelled all others in his clear delivery and graceful action. They say that his name was Polus, and he often acted the tragedies of famous poets with intelligence and dignity. This Polus lost by death a son whom he dearly loved. After he felt that he had indulged his grief sufficiently, he returned to the practice of his profession.</p>

<p>At that time he was to act the <hi rend="italic">Electra</hi> of Sophocles at Athens, and it was his part to carry an urn which was supposed to contain the ashes of Orestes. The plot of the play requires that Electra, who is <pb n="v2.p.37"/> represented as carrying her brother's remains, should lament and bewail the fate that she believed had overtaken him. Accordingly Polus, clad in the mourning garb of Electra, took from the tomb the ashes and urn of his son, embraced them as if they were those of Orestes, and filled the whole place, not with the appearance and imitation of sorrow, but with genuine grief and unfeigned lamentation. Therefore, while it seemed that a play was being acted, it was in fact real grief that was enacted.</p>  </div>

<p>Whether <hi rend="italic">affatim,</hi> like <hi rend="italic">admodunm,</hi> should be pronounced with an acute accent on the first syllable; with some painstaking observations on the accents of other words.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THE poet Annianus,

<note>One of the few poets of Hadrian's time. He wrote Falisca, on rural life, and Fescennini. Like other poets of his time, he was fond of unusual metres; see <hi rend="italic">Gr. Lat.</hi> vi. 122, 12, K.</note>
in addition to his charming personality, was highly skilled in ancient literature and literary criticism, and conversed with remarkable grace and learning. He pronounced <hi rend="italic">affalim,</hi> as he did <hi rend="italic">admodum,</hi> with an acute accent

<note>This seems to mean no more than <quote>accent</quote>; see note 2, p. 9, above.</note>
on the first, and not on the medial, syllable; and he believed that the ancients so pronounced the word. He adds that in his hearing the grammarian Probus thus read the following lines of the <hi rend="italic">Cistellaria</hi> of Plautus:

<note>231.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Canst do a valiant deed?—Enough (<hi rend="italic">áffatim</hi>) there be</l> <l>Who can. I've no desire to be called brave,</l></quote>  and he said that the reason for that accent was that <hi rend="italic">affatim</hi> was not two parts of speech, but was made up of two parts that had united to form a single word; just as also in the word which we call <hi rend="italic">exadversum</hi> he thought that the second syllable should have the acute accent, because the word was one part of speech, and not two. Accordingly, he maintained that the two following verses of Terence

<note><hi rend="italic">Phormio,</hi> 88.</note>
ought to be read thus:  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Over against (<hi rend="italic">exádversum</hi>) the school to which she went</l> <l part="I">A barber had his shop.</l></quote>  <pb n="v2.p.41"/>  He added besides that the preposition <hi rend="italic">ad</hi> was commonly accented when it indicated <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)pi/tasis,</foreign> or as we say, <quote>emphasis,</quote> as in <hi rend="italic">ádfabre, ádmodum,</hi> and ádprobe.</p>

<p>In all else, indeed, Annianus spoke aptly enough. But if he supposed that this particle was always accented when it denoted emphasis, that rule is obviously not without exceptions; for when we say <hi rend="italic">adpotus, adprimus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">adprime,</hi> emphasis is evident in all those words, yet it is not at all proper to pronounce the particle <hi rend="italic">ad</hi> with the acute accent. I must admit, however, that <hi rend="italic">adprobus,</hi> which means <quote>highly approved,</quote> ought to be accented on the first syllable. Caecilius uses that word in his comedy entitled <hi rend="italic">The Triumph:</hi>

<p>An incredible story about a dolphin which loved a boy.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THAT dolphins are affectionate and amorous is shown, not only by ancient history, but also by tales of recent date. For in the sea of Puteoli, during the reign of Augustus Caesar, as Apion has written, and some centuries before at Naupactus, as Theophrastus tells us, dolphins are positively known to have been ardently in love. And they did not love those of their own kind, but had an extraordinary passion, like that of human beings, for boys of handsome figure, whom they chanced to have seen in boats or in the shoal waters near the shore.</p>

<p>I have appended the words of that learned man Apion, from the fifth book of his <hi rend="italic">Egyptian History,</hi> in which he tells of an amorous dolphin and a boy who did not reject its advances, of their intimacy and play with each other, the dolphin carrying the boy and the boy bestriding the fish; and Apion declares that of all this he himself and many others were eye-witnesses. <quote>Now I myself,</quote> he writes,

<note><hi rend="italic">F.H.G.</hi> iii. 510.</note>
<quote>near Dicaearchia

<note>The early Greek name of Puteoli.</note>
saw a dolphin that fell in love with a boy called Hyacinthus. For the fish with passionate eagerness came at his call, and drawing in his fins, to avoid wounding the delicate skin of the object of his affection, carried him as if mounted upon a horse for a distance of two hundred stadia. Rome and all Italy turned out to see a fish that was under the sway of Aphrodite.</quote> To this he adds a detail that is no less wonderful. <quote>Afterwards,</quote> he says, <quote>that same boy who was beloved by the  <pb n="v2.p.45"/>  dolphin fell sick and died. But the lover, when he had often come to the familiar shore, and the boy, who used to await his coming at the edge of the shoal water, was nowhere to be seen, pined away from longing and died. He was found lying on the shore by those who knew the story and was buried in the same tomb with his favourite.</quote>

<p>In the same way Atta in the <hi rend="italic">Aedilicia</hi> says:

</p>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>But he will be afraid, if I do prick him (<hi rend="italic">pepugero</hi>).</l></quote>

<p>Probus has noted that Aelius Tubero also, in his work dedicated to Gaius Oppius, wrote <hi rend="italic">occecurrit,</hi> and he has quoted him as follows:

<note>Fr. 2, Huschke; I. p. 367, Bremer.</note>
<quote>If the general form should present itself (<hi rend="italic">occecurrerit</hi>).</quote> Probus also observed that Valerius Antias in the twenty-second book of his <hi rend="italic">Histories</hi> wrote <hi rend="italic">speponderant,</hi> and he quotes his words as follows:

<note>Fr. 57, Peter<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
<quote>Tiberius Gracchus,  <pb n="v2.p.49"/>  who had been quaestor to Gaius Mancinus in Spain, and the others who had guaranteed (<hi rend="italic">speponderant</hi>) peace.</quote></p>

<p>Now the explanation of these forms might seem to be this: since the Greeks in one form of the past tense, which they call <foreign xml:lang="grc">parakei/menon,</foreign> or <quote>perfect,</quote> commonly change the second letter of the verb to <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> as <foreign xml:lang="grc">gra/fw ge/grafa, poiw= pepoi/hka, lalw= lela/lhka, kratw= kekra/thka, lou/w le/louka,</foreign> so accordingly <hi rend="italic">mordeo</hi> makes <hi rend="italic">memordi, posco peposci, tendo tetendi, tango tetigi, pungo pepugi, curro cecurri, tollo tetuli,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">spondeo spepondi.</hi> Thus Marcus Tullius

<p>I find besides that from the verb <hi rend="italic">scindo</hi> in the same way was made, not <hi rend="italic">sciderat,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">sciciderat.</hi> Lucius Accius in the first book of his <hi rend="italic">Sotadici</hi> writes <hi rend="italic">sciciderat.</hi> These are his words:

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As <hi rend="italic">ususcapio</hi> is treated as a compound word, in which the letter a is pronounced long, just so <hi rend="italic">pignoriscapio</hi> was pronounced as one word with a long a.

<!--<argument>-->

<p>That neither <hi rend="italic">levitas</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">nequitia</hi> has the meaning that is given to those words in ordinary conversation.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I OBSERVE that <hi rend="italic">levitas</hi> is now generally used to denote inconsistency and changeableness, and <hi rend="italic">nequitia,</hi> in the sense of craftiness and cunning. But those of the men of early days who spoke properly and purely applied the term <hi rend="italic">leves</hi> to those whom we now commonly call worthless and meriting no esteem. That is, they used <hi rend="italic">levitas</hi> with precisely the force of <hi rend="italic">vilitas,</hi> and applied the term <hi rend="italic">nequam</hi> to a man of no  <pb n="v2.p.53"/>  importance nor worth, the sort of man that the Greeks usually call <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)/swtos</foreign> (beyond recovery) or <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)ko/lastos</foreign>(incorrigible).</p>

<p>One who desires examples of these words need not resort to books that are very inaccessible, but he will find them in Marcus Tullius' second <hi rend="italic">Oration against Antony.</hi> For when Cicero wished to indicate a kind of extreme sordidness in the life and conduct of Marcus Antonius, that he lurked in a tavern, that he drank deep until evening, and that he travelled with his face covered, so as not to be recognized— when he wished to give expression to these and similar charges against him, he said:

<note><hi rend="italic">Phil.</hi> ii. 77.</note>
<quote>Just see the worthlessness (<hi rend="italic">levitatem</hi>) of the man,</quote> as if by that reproach he branded him with all those various marks of infamy which I have mentioned. But afterwards, when he had heaped upon the same Antony sundry other scornful and opprobrious charges, he finally added <quote>O man of no worth (<hi rend="italic">nequam</hi>)! for there is no term that I can use more fittingly.</quote></p>

<p>But from that passage of Marcus Tullius I should like to add a somewhat longer extract: <quote>Just see the worthlessness of the man! Having come to Saxa Rubra at about the tenth hour of the day,

<note>About four o'clock in the afternoon.</note>
he lurked in a certain low tavern, and shutting himself up there drank deep until evening. Then riding swiftly to the city in a cab, he came to his home with covered face. The doorkeeper asked: 'Who are you?' 'The bearer of a letter from Marcus,' was the reply. He was at once taken to the lady on whose account he had come,

<note>His wife, Fulvia.</note>
and handed her the letter. While she read it with tears—for it was written in amorous terms and its  <pb n="v2.p.55"/>  main point was this: that hereafter he would have nothing to do with that actress, that he had cast aside all his love for her and transferred it to the reader—when the woman wept still more copiously, the compassionate man could not endure it; he uncovered his face and threw himself on her neck. O man of no worth!—for I can use no more fitting term; was it, then, that your wife might unexpectedly see you, when you had surprised her by appearing as her lover, that you upset the city with terror by night and Italy with dread for many days?</quote></p>

<p>In a very similar way Quintus Claudius too, in the first book of his <hi rend="italic">Annals,</hi> called a prodigal and wasteful life of luxury <hi rend="italic">nequitia,</hi> using these words:

<note>Fr. 15, Peter<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
<quote>They persuade a young man from Lucania, who was born in a most exalted station, but had squandered great wealth in luxury and prodigality (<hi rend="italic">nequitia</hi>).</quote> Marcus Varro in his work <hi rend="italic">On the Latin Language</hi> says:

<note>x. 5. 81.</note>
<quote>Just as from <hi rend="italic">non</hi> and <hi rend="italic">volo</hi> we have <hi rend="italic">nolo, so</hi> from <hi rend="italic">ne</hi> and <hi rend="italic">quicquam</hi> is formed <hi rend="italic">nequam,</hi> with the loss of the medial syllable.</quote> Publius Africanus, speaking <hi rend="italic">In his own Defence against Tiberius Asellus</hi> in the matter of a fine, thus addressed the people:

<note><hi rend="italic">O. R. F.,</hi> p. 183, Meyer<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
<quote>All the evils, shameful deeds, and crimes that men commit come from two things, malice and profligacy (<hi rend="italic">nequitia</hi>). Against which charge do you defend yourself, that of malice or profligacy, or both together? If you wish to defend yourself against the charge of profligacy, well and good; if you have squandered more money on one harlot than you reported for the census as the value of all the <pb n="v2.p.57"/> equipment of your Sabine estate; if this is so, who pledges a thousand sesterces?

<note>The lexicons and commentators define the <hi rend="italic">sponsio</hi> as a <quote>legal wager,</quote> in which the two parties to a suit put up a sum of money, which was forfeited by the one who lost his case; and they cite Gaius, <hi rend="italic">Inst.</hi> iv. 93. But in iv. 94 Gaius says that only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> party pledged a sum of money (unde etiam is, cum quo agetur, non restipulabatur), that it was merely a preliminary to legal action, and that the sum was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> forfeited (non tamen haec summa sponsionis exigitur; nec enim poenalis sed praeiudicialis, et propter hoc solum fit, ut per earn de re iudicetur). Wagers, however, were common; see Plaut. <hi rend="italic">Pers.</hi> 186 ff.; <hi rend="italic">Cas.</hi> prol. 75; Catull. 44. 4; Ovid, <hi rend="italic">Ars Amat.</hi> i. 168.</note>
If you have wasted more than a third of your patrimony and spent it on your vices; if that is so, who pledges a thousand sesterces?

<p>Of the tunics called <hi rend="italic">chiridotae;</hi> that Publius Africanus reproved Sulpicius Gallus for wearing them.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>FOR a man to wear tunics coming below the arms and as far as the wrists, and almost to the fingers, was considered unbecoming in Rome and in all Latium. Such tunics our countrymen called by the Greek name <hi rend="italic">chiridotae</hi> (long-sleeved), and they thought that a long and full-flowing garment was not unbecoming for women only, to hide their arms and legs from sight. But Roman men at first wore the toga alone without tunics; later, they had close, short tunics ending below the shoulders, the kind which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)cwmi/des</foreign> (sleeveless).

<note>More literally, <quote>leaving the shoulders bare.</quote> </note>
Habituated to this older fashion, Publius Africanus, son of Paulus, a man gifted with all worthy arts and every virtue, among many other things with which he  <pb n="v2.p.59"/>  reproached Publius Sulpicius Gallus, an effeminate man, included this also, that he wore tunics which covered his whole hands. Scipio's words are these:

<note><hi rend="italic">O. R. F.,</hi> p. 181, Meyer<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
<quote>For one who daily perfumes himself and dresses before a mirror, whose eyebrows are trimmed, who walks abroad with beard plucked out and thighs made smooth, who at banquets, though a young man, has reclined in a long-sleeved tunic on the inner side of the couch with a lover, who is fond not only of wine but of men—does anyone doubt that he does what wantons commonly do?</quote></p>

<p>Of the three literary styles; and of the three philosophers who were sent as envoys by the Athenians to the senate at Rome.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>BOTH in verse and in prose there are three approved styles, which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">xarakth=res</foreign> and to which they have given the names of <foreign xml:lang="grc">a(dro/s, i)sxno/s</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">me/sos.</foreign> We also call the one which I put first <quote>grand,</quote> the second <quote>plain,</quote> and the third <quote>middle.</quote> </p>

<p>The grand style possesses dignity and richness, the plain, grace and elegance; the middle lies on the border line and partakes of the qualities of both.</p>

<p>To each of these excellent styles there are related an equal number of faulty ones, arising from unsuccessful attempts to imitate their manner and character. Thus very often pompous and bombastic speakers lay claim to the grand style, the mean and bald to the plain, and the unclear and ambiguous to the middle. But true and genuine Latin examples of these styles are said by Marcus Varro

<note>Fr. 80, Wilmanns.</note>
to be: Pacuvius of the grand style, Lucilius of the plain, and Terence of the middle. But in early days these same three styles of speaking were exemplified in three men by Homer: the grand and rich in  <pb n="v2.p.63"/>  Ulysses, the elegant and restrained in Menelaus, the middle and moderate in Nestor.</p>

<p>This threefold variety is also to be observed in the three philosophers whom the Athenians sent as envoys to the senate at Rome, to persuade the senators to remit the fine which they had imposed upon the Athenians because of the sack of Oropos;

<note>The embassy was sent in 155 B.C. Plutarch, <hi rend="italic">Cat. Mai.</hi> xxii. (<hi rend="italic">L.C.L.</hi> ii., p. 369) says that the fine was five hundred talents.</note>
and the fine amounted to nearly five hundred talents. The philosophers in question were Carneades of the Academy, Diogenes the Stoic, and Critolaus the Peripatetic. When they were admitted to the House, they made use of Gaius Acilius, one of the senators, as interpreter; but beforehand each one of them separately, for the purpose of exhibiting his eloquence, lectured to a large company. Rutilius

<note>Fr. 3, Peter<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
and Polybius

<note>xxxiii. 2, p. 1287, H.</note>
declare that all three aroused admiration for their oratory, each in his own style. <quote>Carneades,</quote> they say, <quote>spoke with a vehemence that carried you away, Critolaus with art and polish, Diogenes with restraint and sobriety.</quote></p>

<p>Each of these styles, as I have said, is more brilliant when it is chastely and moderately adorned; when it is rouged and be powdered, it becomes mere jugglery.</p>  </div>

<note>Or perhaps a sturgeon; the identification of some of these beasts and fish is very uncertain.</note>
pike from Cilicia, nuts from Thasos, dates from Egypt, acorns from Spain.</p>

<p>But this tireless gluttony, which is ever wandering about and seeking for flavours, and this eager quest of dainties from all quarters, we shall consider deserving of the greater detestation, if we recall the verses of Euripides of which the philosopher Chrysippus made frequent use,

<note>p. 344, Baguet.</note>
to the effect that gastronomic delicacies were contrived, not because of the necessary uses of life, but because of a spirit of luxury that disdains what is easily attainable because of the immoderate wantonness that springs from satiety.</p>

<p>I have thought that I ought to append the verses of Euripides:

<note>Fr. 884, Nauck.<hi rend="sup">2</hi></note>
</p>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>What things do mortals need, save two alone,</l> <l>The fruits of Ceres and the cooling spring,</l> <l>Which are at hand and made to nourish us?</l> <l>With this abundance we are not content,</l> <l>But hunt out other foods through luxury.</l></quote>  </div>

<p>A conversation held with a grammarian, who was full of insolence and ignorance, as to the meaning of the word <hi rend="italic">obnoxius;</hi> and of the origin of that word.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I INQUIRED at Rome of a certain grammarian who had the highest repute as a teacher, not indeed  <pb n="v2.p.69"/>  for the sake of trying or testing him, but rather from an eager desire for knowledge, what <hi rend="italic">obnoxius</hi> meant and what was the origin and history of the word. And he, looking at me and ridiculing what he considered the insignificance and unfitness of the query, said: <quote>Truly a difficult question is this that you ask, one demanding very many sleepless nights of investigation! Who, pray, is so ignorant of the Latin tongue as not to know that one is called <hi rend="italic">obnoxius</hi> who can be inconvenienced or injured by another, to whom he is said to be <hi rend="italic">obnoxius</hi> because the other is conscious of his <hi rend="italic">noxa,</hi> that is to say, of his guilt? Why not rather,</quote> said he, <quote>drop these trifles and put questions worthy of study and discussion?</quote></p>

<p>Then indeed I was angry, but thinking that I ought to dissemble, since I was dealing with a fool, I said; <quote>If, most learned sir, I need to learn and to know other things that are more abstruse and more important, when the occasion arises I shall inquire and learn them from you; but inasmuch as I have often used the word <hi rend="italic">obnoxious</hi> without knowing what I was saying, I have learned from you and am now beginning to understand what not I alone, as you seem to think, was ignorant of; for as a matter of fact, Plautus too, though a man of the first rank in his use of the Latin language and in elegance of diction, did not know the meaning of <hi rend="italic">obnoxius.</hi> For there is a passage of his in the <hi rend="italic">Stichus</hi> which reads as follows:  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>By Heaven! I now am utterly undone,</l> <l part="I">Not only partly so (<hi rend="italic">non obnoxie</hi>).

<note>497. Cf. Salmasius, <hi rend="italic">ad loc.,</hi> obnoxie perire dicitur, qui non plane nec funditus perit, sed aliquam spem salutis habet. Cf. <hi rend="italic">Poen.</hi> 787; <hi rend="italic">Amph.</hi> 372.</note>
</l></quote>  This does not in the least agree with what you have  <pb n="v2.p.71"/>  taught me; for Plautus contrasted <hi rend="italic">plane</hi> and <hi rend="italic">obnoxie</hi> as two opposites, which is far removed from your meaning.</quote></p>

<p>But that grammarian retorted foolishly enough, as if <hi rend="italic">obnoxius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">obnoxie</hi> differed, not merely in form, but in their substance and meaning: <quote>I gave a definition of <hi rend="italic">obnoxins,</hi> not <hi rend="italic">obnoxie.</hi></quote> But then I, amazed at the ignorance of the presumptuous fellow, answered: <quote>Let us, as you wish, disregard the fact that Plautus said <hi rend="italic">obnoxie,</hi> if you think that too far-fetched; and let us also say nothing of the passage in Sallust's <hi rend="italic">Catiline:</hi>

<note>xxiii. 3.</note>
'Also to threaten her with his sword, if she would not be submissive (<hi rend="italic">obnoxia</hi>) to him'; but explain to me this example, which is certainly more recent and more familiar. For the following verses of Virgil's are very well known:

<note><hi rend="italic">Georg.</hi> i. 395–6.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>For now the stars' bright sheen is seen undimmed.</l> <l>The rising Moon owes naught (<hi rend="italic">nec</hi> .. <hi rend="italic">obnoxia</hi>) to brother's rays;</l></quote>  but you say that it means 'conscious of her guilt.' In another place too Virgil uses this word with a meaning different from yours, in these lines:

<note><hi rend="italic">Georg.</hi> ii. 438.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l part="F">What joy the fields to view</l> <l>That owe no debt (<hi rend="italic">non obnoxia</hi>) to hoe or care of man.</l></quote>  for care is generally a benefit to fields, not an injury, as it would be according to your definition of <hi rend="italic">obnoxius.</hi> Furthermore, how can what Quintus Ennius writes in the following verses from the <hi rend="italic">Phoenix</hi>

<note>257 ff., Ribbeck.<hi rend="sup">3</hi></note>
agree with you:  <pb n="v2.p.73"/>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>'Tis meet a man should live inspired by courage true,</l> <l>In conscious innocence should boldly challenge foes.</l> <l>True freedom his who bears a pure and steadfast heart,</l> <l>All else less import has (<hi rend="italic">obnoxiosae</hi>) and lurks in gloomy night?</l></quote></quote></p>

<p>But our grammarian, with open mouth as if in a dream, said: <quote>Just now I have no time to spare. When I have leisure, come to see me and learn what Virgil, Plautus, Sallust and Ennius meant by that word.</quote></p>

<p>So saying that fool made off; but in case anyone should wish to investigate, not only the origin of this word, but also its variety of meaning, in order that he may take into consideration this Plautine use also, I have quoted the following lines from the <hi rend="italic">Asinaria:</hi>

<note>282.</note>
</p>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>He'll join with me and hatch the biggest jubilee,</l> <l>Stuff'd with most joy, for son and father too.</l> <l>For life they both shall be in debt (<hi rend="italic">obnoxii</hi>) to both of us,</l> <l>By our services fast bound.</l></quote>

<p>Now, in the definition which that grammarian gave, he seems in a word of such manifold content to have noted only one of its uses—a use, it is true, which agrees with that of Caecilius in these verses of the <hi rend="italic">Chrysium:</hi>

<note>21, Ribbeck.<hi rend="sup">3</hi></note>
</p>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Although I come to you attracted by your pay,</l> <l>Don't think that I for that am subject to your will (<hi rend="italic">tibi . . . obnoxium</hi>);</l> <l>If you speak ill of me, you'll hear a like reply.</l></quote>  <pb n="v2.p.75"/>  </div>

<p>On the strict observance by the Romans of the sanctity of an oath; and also the story of the ten prisoners whom Hannibal sent to Rome under oath.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>AN oath was regarded and kept by the Romans as something inviolable and sacred. This is evident from many of their customs and laws, and this tale which I shall tell may be regarded as no slight support of the truth of the statement. After the battle of Cannae Hannibal, commander of the Carthaginians, selected ten Roman prisoners and sent them to the city, instructing them and agreeing that, if it seemed good to the Roman people, there should be an exchange of prisoners, and that for each captive that one side should receive in excess of the other side, there should be paid a pound and a half of silver. Before they left, he compelled them to take oath that they would return to the Punic camp, if the Romans would not agree to an exchange.</p>

<p>The ten captives come to Rome. They deliver the message of the Punic commander in the senate. The senate refused an exchange. The parents, kinsfolk and connexions of the prisoners amid embraces declared that they had returned to their native land in accordance with the law of <hi rend="italic">postliminium,</hi>

<note>Recovery of civic rights by a person who has been reduced to slavery by capture in war, Pomponius, <hi rend="italic">Dig.</hi> xlix. 15. 5, and 19.</note>
and that their condition of independence was complete and inviolate; they therefore besought them not to think of returning to the enemy. Then eight of their number rejoined that they had no just right of <hi rend="italic">postliminium,</hi> since they were bound by an oath, and they at once went back to Hannibal, as they had sworn to do. The other two remained  <pb n="v2.p.77"/>  in Rome, declaring that they had been released and freed from their obligation because, after leaving the enemy's camp, they had returned to it as if for some chance reason, but really with intent to deceive, and having thus kept the letter of the oath, they had come away again unsworn. This dishonourable cleverness of theirs was considered so shameful, that they were generally despised and reprobated; and later the censors punished them with all possible fines and marks of disgrace, on the ground that they had not done what they had sworn to do.</p>

<p>Furthermore Cornelius Nepos, in the fifth book of his <hi rend="italic">Examples</hi>

<note>Corn. Nepos, <hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> fr. 2, Peter<hi rend="sup">2</hi>,</note>
has recorded also that many of the senators recommended that those who refused to return should be sent to Hannibal under guard, but that the motion was defeated by a majority of dissentients. He adds that, in spite of this, those who had not returned to Hannibal were so infamous and hated that they became tired of life and committed suicide.</p>  </div>

<p>A story, taken from the annals, about Tiberius Gracchus, tribune of the commons and father of the Gracchi; and also an exact quotation of the decrees of the tribunes.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A FINE, noble and generous action of Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus is recorded in the <hi rend="italic">Examples.</hi>

<note>Nepos, <hi rend="italic">Ex,,</hi> fr. 3, Peter<hi rend="sup">2</hi>,</note>
It runs as follows: Gaius Minucius Augurinus, tribune of the commons, imposed a fine on Lucius Scipio Asiaticus, brother of Scipio Africanus the elder,

<note>The famous conqueror of Hannibal at Zama in 202 B.C. He served as <hi rend="italic">legatus</hi> under his brother in the war against Antiochus, in 190 B.C.</note>
and demanded that he should give security  <pb n="v2.p.79"/>  for its payment. Scipio Africanus appealed to the college of tribunes on behalf of his brother, asking them to defend against the violent measures of their colleague a man who had been consul and had celebrated a triumph. Having heard the case, eight

<note>At this period there were ten tribunes; Augurinus and Gracchus were the other two.</note>
of the tribunes rendered a decision.</p>

<p>The words of their decree, which I have quoted, are taken from the records of the annals: <quote>Whereas Publius Scipio Africanus has asked us to protect his brother, Lucius Scipio Asiaticus, against the violent measures of one of our colleagues, in that, contrary to the laws and the customs of our forefathers, that tribune of the commons, having illegally convened an assembly without consulting the auspices, pronounced sentence upon him and imposed an unprecedented fine, and compels him to furnish security for its payment, or if he does not do so, orders that he be imprisoned; and whereas, on the other hand, our colleague has demanded that we should not interfere with him in the exercise of his legal authority—our unanimous decision in this matter is as follows: If Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus will furnish security in accordance with the decision of our colleague, we will forbid our colleague to take him to prison; but if he shall not furnish the securities in accordance with our colleague's decision, we will not interfere with our colleague in the exercise of his lawful authority.</quote></p>

<p>After this decree, Lucius Scipio refused to give security and the tribune Augurinus ordered him to be arrested and taken to prison. Thereupon Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, one of the tribunes of the commons and father of Tiberius and Gaius  <pb n="v2.p.81"/>  Gracchus, although he was a bitter personal enemy of Publius Scipio Africanus because of numerous disagreements on political questions, publicly made oath that he had not been reconciled with Publius Africanus nor become his friend, and then read a decree which he had written out.</p>

<p>That decree ran as follows: <quote>Whereas Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus, during the celebration of a triumph, cast the leaders of the enemy into prison, it seems contrary to the dignity of our country that the Roman people's commander should be consigned to the same place to which he had committed the leaders of the enemy; therefore I forbid my colleague to take violent measures towards Lucius Scipio Asiaticus.</quote></p>

<p>But Valerius Antias, contradicting this record of the decrees and the testimony of the ancient annals, has said

<note>Page 267 note, Peter<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
that it was after the death of Africanus that Tiberius Gracchus interposed that veto in behalf of Scipio Asiaticus; also that Scipio was not fined, but that being convicted of embezzlement of the money taken from Antiochus and refusing to give bail, was just being taken to prison when he was saved by this veto of Gracchus.</p>  </div>

<p>That Virgil removed <hi rend="italic">Nola</hi> from one of his lines and substituted <hi rend="italic">ora</hi> because the inhabitants of Nola had refused him water; and also some additional notes on the agreeable euphony of vowels.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I HAVE found it noted in a certain commentary that the following lines were first read and published by Virgil in this form:

<note><hi rend="italic">Georg.</hi> ii. 244 f.</note>
<pb n="v2.p.83"/>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Such is the soil that wealthy Capua ploughs</l> <l>And Nola near Vesuvius' height.</l></quote>  That afterwards Virgil asked the people of Nola to allow him to run their city water into his estate, which was near by, but that they refused to grant the favour which he asked; that thereupon the offended poet erased the name of their city from his poem, as if consigning it to oblivion, changing <hi rend="italic">Nola</hi> to <hi rend="italic">ora</hi> (region) and leaving the phrase in this form:</p>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>The region near Vesuvius' height.</l></quote>

<p>With the truth or falsity of this note I am not concerned; but there is no doubt that <hi rend="italic">ora</hi> has a more agreeable and musical sound than <hi rend="italic">Nola.</hi> For the last vowel in the first line and the first vowel in the following line being the same, the sound is prolonged by an hiatus that is at the same time melodious and pleasing. Indeed, it is possible to find in famous poets many instances of such melody, which appears to be the result of art rather than accident; but in Homer they are more frequent than in all other poets. In fact, in one single passage he introduces a number of sounds of such a nature, and with such an hiatus, in a series of successive words; for example:

<note><hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> xxii. 151.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>The other fountain e'en in summer flows,</l> <l>Like unto hail, chill snow, or crystal ice,</l>

makes such an occurrence a somewhat serious charge, thus apparently indicating that it was attended with disgrace.

<p>How Chrysippus replied to those who denied the existence of Providence.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Those who do not believe that the world was created for God and mankind, or that human affairs are ruled by Providence, think that they are using a strong argument when they say: <quote>If there were a Providence, there would be no evils.</quote> For they declare that nothing is less consistent with Providence than the existence of such a quantity of troubles and evils in a world which He is said to have made for the sake of man. Chrysippus, arguing against such views in the fourth book of his treatise <hi rend="italic">On Providence</hi>

<note>Fr. ii. 1169, Aru.</note>
says: <quote>There is absolutely nothing more foolish than those men who think that good could exist, if there were at the same time no evil. For since good is the opposite of evil, it necessarily follows that both must exist in opposition to each other, supported as it were by mutual adverse forces; since as a matter of fact no opposite is conceivable without something to oppose it. For how could there be an idea of justice if there were no acts of injustice? or what else is justice than the absence of injustice? How too can courage be understood except by contrast with cowardice? Or temperance except by contrast with intemperance? How also could there be wisdom, if folly did not exist as its opposite? Therefore,</quote> said he, <quote>why do not the  <pb n="v2.p.93"/>  fools also wish that there may be truth, but no falsehood? For it is in the same way that good and evil exist, happiness and unhappiness, pain and pleasure. For, as Plato says,

<note><hi rend="italic">Phaedo,</hi> 3, p. 60 B.</note>
they are bound one to the other by their opposing extremes; if you take away one, you will have removed both.</quote></p>

<p>In the same book

<note>Fr. ii, 1170, Arn.</note>
Chrysippus also considers and discusses this question, which he thinks worth investigating: whether men's diseases come by nature; that is, whether nature herself, or Providence, if you will, which created this structure of the universe and the human race, also created the diseases, weakness, and bodily infirmities from which mankind suffers. He, however, does not think that it was nature's original intention to make men subject to disease; for that would never have been consistent with nature as the source and mother of all things good. <quote>But,</quote> said he, <quote>when she was creating and bringing forth many great things which were highly suitable and useful, there were also produced at the same time troubles closely connected with those good things that she was creating</quote>; and he declared that these were not due to nature, but to certain inevitable consequences, a process that he himself calls <foreign xml:lang="grc">kata\ parakolou/qhsin.</foreign> <quote>Exactly as,</quote> he says, <quote>when nature fashioned men's bodies, a higher reason and the actual usefulness of what she was creating demanded that the lead be made of very delicate and small bones. But this greater usefulness of one part was attended with an external disadvantage; namely, that the head was but slightly protected and could be damaged by slight blows and shocks. In the same way diseases too and illness were created at the same time with  <pb n="v2.p.95"/>  health. Exactly, by Heaven!</quote> said he, <quote>as vices, through their relationship to the opposite quality, are produced at the same time that virtue is created for mankind by nature's design.</quote></p></div>

<!--<argument>-->

<p>How Chrysippus also maintained the power and inevitable nature of fate, but at the same time declared that we had control over our plans and decisions.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>CHRYSIPPUS, the leader of the Stoic philosophy, defined fate, which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ei(marme/nh,</foreign> in about the following terms:

<note>Fr. ii. 1000, Arn.</note>
<quote>Fate,</quote> he says, <quote>is an eternal and unalterable series of circumstances, and a chain rolling and entangling itself through an unbroken series of consequences, from which it is fashioned and made up.</quote> But I have copied Chrysippus' very words, as exactly as I could recall them, in order that, if my interpretation should seem too obscure to anyone, he may turn his attention to the philosopher's own language. For in the fourth book of his work <hi rend="italic">On Providence,</hi> he says that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ei(marme/nh</foreign> is <quote>an orderly series, established by nature, of all events, following one another and joined together from eternity, and their unalterable interdependence.</quote></p>

<p>But the authors of other views and of other schools of philosophy openly criticize this definition as follows: <quote>If Chrysippus,</quote> they say, <quote>believes that all things are set in motion and directed by fate, and that the course of fate and its coils cannot be turned aside or evaded, then the sins and faults of men too ought not to cause anger or be attributed to  <pb n="v2.p.97"/>  themselves and their inclinations, but to a certain unavoidable impulse which arises from fate,</quote> which is the mistress and arbiter of all things, and through which everything that will happen must happen; and that therefore the establishing of penalties for the guilty by law is unjust, if men do not voluntarily commit crimes, but are led into them by fate.</p>

<p>Against these criticisms Chrysippus argues at length, subtilely and cleverly, but the purport of all that he has written on that subject is about this:

<note>Fr. ii. 1000, Arn.</note>
<quote>Although it is a fact,</quote> he says, <quote>that all things are subject to an inevitable and fundamental law and are closely linked to fate, yet the peculiar properties of our minds are subject to fate only according to their individuality and quality. For if in the beginning they are fashioned by nature for health and usefulness, they will avoid with little opposition and little difficulty all that force with which fate threatens them from without. But if they are rough, ignorant, crude, and without any support from education, through their own perversity and voluntary impulse they plunge into continual faults and sin, even though the assault of some inconvenience due to fate be slight or non-existent. And that this very thing should happen in this way is due to that natural and inevitable connection of events which is called 'fate.' For it is in the nature of things, so to speak, fated and inevitable that evil characters should not be free from sins and faults.</quote></p>

<p>A little later he uses an illustration of this statement of his, which is in truth quite neat and appropriate:

<note>Fr. ii. 1000, Arn.</note>
<quote>For instance,</quote> he says, <quote>if you roll a cylindrical stone over a sloping, steep piece of ground, you do indeed furnish the beginning and  <pb n="v2.p.99"/>  cause of its rapid descent, yet soon it speeds onward, not because you make it do so, but because of its peculiar form and natural tendency to roll; just so the order, the law, and the inevitable quality of fate set in motion the various classes of things and the beginnings of causes, but the carrying out of our designs and thoughts, and even our actions, are regulated by each individual's own will and the characteristics of his mind.</quote> Then he adds these words, in harmony with what I have said:

<note>Fr. ii. 1000, Arn.</note>
<quote>Therefore it is said by the Pythagoreans also:

<note><foreign xml:lang="grc">Xru/sea )/Eph,</foreign> 54.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>You'll learn that men have ills which they themselves</l> <l part="I">Bring on themselves,</l></quote>  for harm comes to each of them through themselves, and they go astray through their own impulse and are harmed by their own purpose and determination.</quote> Therefore he says that wicked, slothful, sinful and reckless men ought not to be endured or listened to, who, when they are caught fast in guilt and sin, take refuge in the inevitable nature of fate, as if in the asylum of some shrine, declaring that their outrageous actions must be charged, not to their own heedlessness, but to fate.</p>

<p>The first to express this thought was the oldest and wisest of the poets, in these verses:

<note>Homer, <hi rend="italic">Odyss.</hi> i. 32.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Alas! how wrongly mortals blame the gods!</l> <l>From us, they say, comes evil; they themselves</l> <l>By their own folly woes unfated bear.</l></quote>  Therefore Marcus Cicero, in the book which he wrote <hi rend="italic">On Fate</hi>

<note>Fr. 1, p. 582, Orelli<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
after first remarking that this question is highly obscure and involved, declares that  <pb n="v2.p.101"/>  even the philosopher Chrysippus

<note>Fr. ii, 977, Arn. 2 </note>
was unable to extricate himself from its difficulties, using these words: <quote>Chrysippus, in spite of all efforts and labour, is perplexed how to explain that everything is ruled by fate, but that we nevertheless have some control over our conduct.</quote></p>  </div>

<p>A new account, written by the above-mentioned Tubero, of the capture of Regulus by the Carthaginians; and also what Tuditanus wrote about that same Regulus.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I RECENTLY read in the works of Tuditanus the well-known story about Atilius Regulus:

<note>Fr. 5, Peter<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
That  <pb n="v2.p.103"/>  Regulus, when a prisoner, in addition to the advice which he gave in the senate at Rome against making an exchange of prisoners with the Carthaginians, also declared that the Carthaginians had given him a poison, not of immediate effect, but such as to delay his death for a season; that their design was that he should live for a time, until the exchange was accomplished, but afterwards should waste away as the drug gradually took effect.</p>

<p>Tubero in his <hi rend="italic">Histories</hi> says

<note>Fr. 9, Peter.</note>
that this Regulus returned to Carthage and was put to death by the Carthaginians with tortures of a novel kind: <quote>They confined him,</quote> he says, <quote>in a dark and deep dungeon, and a long time afterwards suddenly brought him out, when the sun was shining most brightly, and exposed him to its direct rays, holding him and forcing him to fix his gaze upon the sky. They even drew his eyelids apart upward and downward and sewed them fast, so that he could not close his eyes.</quote> Tuditanus, however, reports that Regulus was for a long time deprived of sleep and so killed, and that when this became known at Rome, Carthaginian captives of the highest rank were handed over by the senate to his sons, who shut them in a chest studded within with spikes;

<note>See McCartney, <hi rend="italic">The Figurative Use of Animal Names</hi> Univ. of Penna diss.), Lancaster, Pa., 1912.</note>

<p>An error of the jurist Alfenus in the interpretation of early words.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THE jurist Alfenus, a pupil of Servius Sulpicius and a man greatly interested in matters antiquarian,  <pb n="v2.p.105"/>  in the thirty-fourth book of his <hi rend="italic">Digests</hi> and the second of his <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies,</hi> says:

<note>Fr. 1, Huschke; Resp. 14, Dig. 99, Bremer (i, pp. 287,322, 330).</note>
<quote>In a treaty which was made between the Roman people and the Carthaginians the provision is found, that the Carthaginians should pay each year to the Roman people a certain weight of <hi rend="italic">argenti puri puti,</hi> and the meaning of <hi rend="italic">puri puti</hi> was asked. I replied,</quote> he says, <quote>that <hi rend="italic">putus</hi> meant very pure,' just as we say <hi rend="italic">novicius</hi> for <hi rend="italic">novus</hi> (new) and <hi rend="italic">propicius</hi> for <hi rend="italic">proprius</hi> (proper), when we wish to augment and amplify the meaning of <hi rend="italic">novus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">proprius.</hi></quote></p>

<p>Upon reading this, I was surprised that Alfenus should think that the relation of <hi rend="italic">purus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">putus</hi> was the same as that of <hi rend="italic">novicius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">novus;</hi> for if the word were <hi rend="italic">puricius,</hi> then it would indeed appear to be formed like <hi rend="italic">novicius.</hi> It was also surprising that he thought that <hi rend="italic">novicius</hi> was used to imply amplification, since in fact <hi rend="italic">novicius</hi> does not mean <quote>more new,</quote> but is merely a derivative and variant of <hi rend="italic">novus.</hi> Accordingly, I agree with those who think that <hi rend="italic">putus</hi> is derived from <hi rend="italic">puto</hi> and therefore pronounce the word with the first syllable short, not long as Alfenus seems to have thought it, since he wrote that <hi rend="italic">putus</hi> came from <hi rend="italic">purus.</hi> Moreover, the earlier writers used <hi rend="italic">putare</hi> of removing and pruning away from anything whatever was superfluous and unnecessary, or even injurious and foreign, leaving only what seemed useful and without blemish. For that was the meaning of <hi rend="italic">putare,</hi> <quote>to prune,</quote> as applied to trees and vines, and so too as used of accounts.

<note>That is, to clear one's accounts.</note>
The verb <hi rend="italic">puto</hi> itself also, which we use for the purpose of stating our opinion, certainly means nothing else than that in an obscure and difficult matter we do our best, by cutting away and lopping  <pb n="v2.p.107"/>  off false views, to retain what seems true and pure and sound. Therefore in the treaty with Carthage silver was called <hi rend="italic">putum,</hi> as having been thoroughly purified and refined, as free from all foreign matter, and as spotless and whitened by the removal from it of all impurities.</p>

<p>But the expression <hi rend="italic">purum putum</hi> occurs, not only in the treaty with Carthage, but also in many other early writings, including the tragedy of Quintus Ennius entitled <hi rend="italic">Alexander,</hi>

<p>In these lines of Virgil

<note><hi rend="italic">Aen. vi.</hi> 14 f.</note>
Julius Hyginus

<note>Fr. 6, Fun.</note>
criticizes the use of <hi rend="italic">pennis praepetibus</hi> as an improper and ignorant expression. <quote>For,</quote> says he, <quote>those birds are called <hi rend="italic">praepetes</hi> by the augurs which either fly onward auspiciously or alight in suitable places.</quote> Therefore he thought it inappropriate in Virgil to use an augural term in speaking of the flight of Daedalus, which had nothing to do with the science of the augurs.</p>

<p>But of a truth it was Hyginus who was altogether foolish in supposing that the meaning of <hi rend="italic">praepetes</hi> was known to him, but unknown to Virgil and to  <pb n="v2.p.109"/>  Gnaeus Matius, a learned man, who in the second book of his <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> called winged Victory <hi rend="italic">praepes</hi> in the following line:

<note>Fr. 3, Bährens (<hi rend="italic">F.P.R.</hi>).</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>While Victory swift (<hi rend="italic">praepes</hi>) the victor's palm bestows.</l></quote></p>

<p>Furthermore, why does he not find fault also with Quintus Ennius, who in his <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi> uses <hi rend="italic">praepes,</hi> not of the wings of Daedalus, but of something very different, in the line:

<note>488, Vahlen<hi rend="sup">2</hi>. Cf. Gell. ix. 4. 1.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Brundisium girt with fair, propitious (<hi rend="italic">praepete</hi>) port?</l></quote>  But if Hyginus had regarded the force and origin of the word rather than merely noting the meaning given to it by the augurs, he would certainly pardon the poets for using words in a figurative and metaphorical sense rather than literally. For since not only the birds themselves which fly auspiciously, but also the places which they take, since these are suitable and propitious, are called <hi rend="italic">praepetes,</hi> therefore Virgil called the wings of Daedalus <hi rend="italic">praepetes,</hi> since he had come from places in which he feared danger into safer regions. Furthermore, the augurs call places <hi rend="italic">praepetes,</hi> and Ennius in the first book of his <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi> said:

<note>94, Vahlen<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
</p>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>In fair, propitious (<hi rend="italic">praepetibus</hi>) places they alight.</l></quote>

<p>But birds that are the opposite of <hi rend="italic">praepetes</hi> are called <hi rend="italic">inferae,</hi> or <quote>low,</quote>

<note>That is, low-flying, as opposed to swift-, or high-, flying.</note>
according to Nigidius Figulus, who says in the first book of his <hi rend="italic">Private Augury</hi>:

<note>Fr. 80, Swoboda.</note>
<quote>The right is opposed to the left, <hi rend="italic">praepes</hi> to <hi rend="italic">infera.</hi></quote> From this we may infer that birds were called <hi rend="italic">praepetes</hi> which have a higher and loftier  <pb n="v2.p.111"/>  flight, since Nigidius said that the <hi rend="italic">praepetes</hi> were contrasted with the <hi rend="italic">inferae.</hi></p>

<p>In my youth in Rome, when I was still in attendance on the grammarians, I gave special attention to Sulpicius Apollinaris. Once when there was a discussion about augural law and mention had been made of <hi rend="italic">praepetes aves,</hi> I heard him say to Erucius Clarus, the city prefect, that in his opinion <hi rend="italic">praepetes</hi> was equivalent to Homer's <foreign xml:lang="grc">tanupte/ruges,</foreign> or <quote>wide-winged,</quote> since the augurs had special regard to those birds whose flight was broad and wide because of their great wings. And then he quoted these verses of Homer:

<p>On Acca Larentia and Gaia Taracia; and on the origin of the priesthood of the Arval Brethren.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THE names of Acca Larentia and Gaia Taracia, or Fufetia as she is sometimes called, are frequent in the early annals. To the former of these after her death, but to Taracia while she still lived, the Roman people paid distinguished honours. And that Taracia, at any rate, was a Vestal virgin is proved by the Horatian law which was laid before the people with regard to her. By this law very many honours are bestowed upon her and among them the right of giving testimony is granted her, and that privilege is given to no other woman in the State. The word <hi rend="italic">testabilis</hi> is used in the Horatian law itself, and its opposite occurs in the <hi rend="italic">Twelve Tables</hi>:

<note>viii. 22; the date of this <hi rend="italic">privilegium</hi> (see x. 20. 4) is uncertain.</note>
<quote>Let him be  <pb n="v2.p.113"/>  infamous and <hi rend="italic">intestabilis,</hi> or 'forbidden to testify.'</quote> Besides, if at the age of forty she should wish to leave the priesthood and marry, the right and privilege of withdrawing from the order and marrying were allowed her, in gratitude for her generosity and kindness in presenting to the people the <hi rend="italic">campus Tiberinus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Martius.</hi></p>

<p>But Acca Larentia was a public prostitute and by that trade had earned a great deal of money. In her will she made king Romulus heir to her property, according to Antias' <hi rend="italic">History;</hi>

<note>Fr. 1, Peter<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
according to some others, the Roman people. Because of that favour public sacrifice was offered to her by the priest of Quirinus and a day was consecrated to her memory in the Calendar. But Masurius Sabinus, in the first book of his <hi rend="italic">Memorialia,</hi> following certain historians, asserts that Acca Larentia was Romulus' nurse. His words are:

<note>Fr. 14, Huschke; 1, Bremer (ii, p. 368).</note>
<quote>This woman, who had twelve sons, lost one of them by death. In his place Romulus gave himself to Acca as a son, and called himself and her other sons ' Arval Brethren.' Since that time there has always been a college of Arval Brethren, twelve in number, and the insignia of the priesthood are a garland of wheat ears and white fillets.</quote></p>  </div>

<p>Some noteworthy anecdotes of King Alexander and of Publius Scipio.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>APION, a Greek, called Pleistoneices,

<note><quote>Of many quarrels,</quote> a word coined in imitation of the epithet applied to famous athletes: <foreign xml:lang="grc">pleistoni/khs,</foreign> <quote>of many victories.</quote></note>
possessed a fluent and lively style. Writing in praise of king  <pb n="v2.p.115"/>  Alexander, he says:

<note><hi rend="italic">F.H.G.</hi> iii. 515.</note>
<quote>He forbade the wife of his vanquished foe, a woman of surpassing loveliness, to be brought into his presence, in order that he might not touch her even with his eyes.</quote> We have then the subject for a pleasant discussion—which of the two shall justly be considered the more continent: Publius Africanus the elder, who after he had stormed Carthage,

<note>Really New Carthage, captured in 210 B.C.; the story is told by Livy, xxvi. 50.</note>
a powerful city in Spain, and a marriageable girl of wonderful beauty, the daughter of a noble Spaniard, had been taken prisoner and brought to him, restored her unharmed to her father; or king Alexander, who refused even to see the wife of king Darius, who was also his sister, when he had taken her captive in a great battle and had heard that she was of extreme beauty, but forbade her to be brought before him.</p>

<p>But those who have an abundance of talent, leisure and eloquence may use this material for a pair of little declamations on Alexander and Scipio; I shall be satisfied with relating this, which is a matter of historical record: Whether it be false or true is uncertain, but at any rate the story goes that your Scipio in his youth did not have an unblemished reputation, and that it was all but generally believed that it was at him that the following verses were aimed by the poet Gnaeus Naevius:

<note>ii. 108, Ribbeck<hi rend="sup">3</hi>.</note>
</p>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>E'en he who oft-times mighty deeds hath done,</l> <l>Whose glory and exploits still live, to whom</l> <l>The nations bow, his father once led home,</l> <l>Clad in a single garment, from his love.</l></quote>

<p>I think it was by these verses that Valerius Antias was led to hold an opinion opposed to that of all  <pb n="v2.p.117"/>  other writers about Scipio's character, and to write,

<note>Fr. 25, Peter<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THIS custom was practised and observed at Athens by those who were on intimate terms with the philosopher Taurus; when he invited us to his home, in order that we might not come wholly tax-free,

<note>The reference is to a dinner to which each guest brought his contribution (<hi rend="italic">symbolon</hi>); cf. Hor. <hi rend="italic">Odes,</hi> iv. 12. 14 f., non ego te meis <hi rend="italic">immunem</hi> meditor tinguere poculis; Catull. xiii.</note>
as the saying is, and without a contribution, we brought to the simple meal, not dainty foods, but ingenious topics for discussion. Accordingly, each one of us came with a question which he had thought up and prepared, and when the eating ended, conversation began. The questions, however, were neither weighty nor serious, but certain neat but trifling <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)nqumhma/tia,</foreign> or problems, which would pique a mind enlivened with wine; for instance, the examples of playful subtlety which I shall quote.</p>

<p>The question was asked, when a dying man died—when he was already in the grasp of death, or while he still lived? And when did a rising man rise—when he was already standing, or while he was still seated? And when did one who was learning an art become an artist—when he already was one, or when he was still learning? For whichever answer you make, your statement will be absurd and laughable, and it will seem much more absurd, if you say that it is in either case, or in neither.</p>

<p>But when some declared that all these questions were pointless and idle sophisms, Taurus said: <quote>Do not despise such problems, as if they were mere trifling  <pb n="v2.p.127"/>  amusements. The most earnest of the philosophers have seriously debated this question.

<note>See Pease, <quote>Things without Honor,</quote> <hi rend="italic">Class. Phil.</hi> xxi. (1926), pp. 97 ff.</note>
Some have thought that the term 'die' was properly used, and that the moment of death came, while life still remained; others have left no life in that moment, but have claimed for death all that period which is termed dying.' Also in regard to other similar problems they have argued for different times and maintained opposite opinions. But our master Plato,</quote>

<note><hi rend="italic">Parm.</hi> 21, p. 156 D; cf. vi. 21, above. </note>
said he, <quote>assigned that time neither to life nor to death, and took the same position in every discussion of similar questions. For he saw that the alternatives were mutually contrary, that one of the two opposites could not be maintained while the other existed, and that the question arose from the juxtaposition of two opposing extremes, namely life and death. Therefore he himself devised, and gave a name to, a new period of time, lying on the boundary between the two, which he called in appropriate and exact language <foreign xml:lang="grc">h( e)cai/fnhs fu/sis,</foreign> or 'the moment of sudden separation.'

That reason for punishment exists when the dignity and the prestige of the one who is sinned against must be maintained, lest the omission of punishment bring him into contempt and diminish the esteem in which he is held; and therefore they think that it was given a name derived from the preservation of honour (<foreign xml:lang="grc">timh/</foreign>). A third reason for punishment is that which is called by the Greeks <foreign xml:lang="grc">para/deigma,</foreign> when punishment is necessary for the sake of example, in order that others through fear of a recognized penalty may be kept from similar sins, which it is to the common interest to prevent. Therefore our forefathers also used the word <hi rend="italic">exempla,</hi> or <quote>examples,</quote> for the severest and heaviest penalties. Accordingly, when there is either strong hope that the culprit will voluntarily correct himself without punishment, or on the other hand when there is no hope that he can be reformed and corrected; or when there is no need to fear loss of prestige in the one who has been sinned against; or if the sin is not of such a sort that punishment must be inflicted in order that it may inspire a necessary feeling of fear—then in the case of all such sins the desire to inflict punishment does not seem to be at all fitting.</p>

<p>Other philosophers have discussed these three reasons for punishment in various places, and so too had our countryman Taurus in the first book of the  <pb n="v2.p.131"/>  <hi rend="italic">Commentaries</hi> which he wrote <hi rend="italic">On the Gorgias of Plato.</hi> But Plato himself says in plain terms that there are only two reasons for punishment: one being that which I put first—for the sake of correction; the second, that which I gave in the third place—as an example to inspire fear. These are Plato's own words in the <hi rend="italic">Gorgias:</hi>

<note>81, p. 525 A.</note>
<quote>It is fitting that everyone who suffers punishment, when justly punished by another, either be made better and profit thereby, or serve as an example to others, in order that they, seeing his punishment, may be reformed through fear.</quote> In these words you may readily understand that Plato used <foreign xml:lang="grc">timwri/a,</foreign> not in the sense that 1 said above is given it by some, but with the general meaning of any punishment. But whether he omitted the maintenance of the prestige of an injured person as a reason for inflicting punishment, on the ground that it was altogether insignificant and worthy of contempt, or rather passed over it as something not germane to his subject, since he was writing about punishments to be inflicted after this life and not during life and among men, this question I leave undecided.</p>  </div>

<p>On the verb <hi rend="italic">quiesco,</hi> whether it should be pronounced with a long or a short <hi rend="italic">e.</hi></p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A FRIEND of mine, a man of much learning and devoted to the liberal arts, pronounced the verb <hi rend="italic">quiescit</hi> (<quote>be quiet</quote>) in the usual manner, with a short <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> Another man, also a friend of mine, marvellous in the use of grammatical rules as jugglers' tricks, so to say, and excessively fastidious  <pb n="v2.p.133"/>  in rejecting common words, thought that the first man had been guilty of a barbarism, maintaining that he ought to have lengthened the <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> rather than shortened it. For he asserted that <hi rend="italic">quiescit</hi> ought to be pronounced like <hi rend="italic">calescit, nitescit, stupescit</hi> and many other words of that kind. He also added the statement that <hi rend="italic">quies</hi> (quiet) is pronounced with the <hi rend="italic">e</hi> long, not short. But my first-named friend, with the unassuming modesty which was characteristic of him in all matters, said that not even if the Aelii, the Cincii and the Santrae

<note>Mentioned as typical grammarians. The <hi rend="italic">gens Aelia</hi> included several famous jurists and men of letters; the reference here is to Lucius Aelius Stilo, the teacher of Varro and Cicero. Santra was a grammarian of the first century B.C.; the Cincii were less well known.</note>
had decided that the word ought to be so pronounced, would he follow their ruling against the universal usage of the Latin language, nor would he speak in such an eccentric fashion as to be discordant and strange in his diction. Nevertheless he wrote a letter on the subject, among some exercises for his own amusement, in which he tried to prove that <hi rend="italic">quiesco</hi> is not like those words which I have quoted above; that it is not derived from <hi rend="italic">quies</hi> but rather <hi rend="italic">quies</hi> from <hi rend="italic">quiesco.</hi> He also maintained that <hi rend="italic">quiesco</hi> has the form and derivation of a Greek word,

<note>A fanciful derivation from Ionic <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)/xw, e)/sxw.</foreign></note>
and he tried to show, by reasons that were by no means without force, that the word should not be pronounced with a long <hi rend="italic">e.</hi>

<note>The <hi rend="italic">e</hi> is however long; <hi rend="italic">quiésco</hi> occurs in <hi rend="italic">C.1.L</hi>. vi, 6250 and 25521.</note>

<p>On a use by the poet Catullus of the word <hi rend="italic">deprecor,</hi> which is unusual, it is true, but appropriate and correct; and on the origin of that word, with examples from early writers.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As we chanced to be strolling one evening in the  <pb n="v2.p.135"/>  Lyceum,

<note>A gymnasium at Athens, the favourite resort of Aristotle and his pupils.</note>
we were furnished with sport and amusement by a certain man, of the kind that lays claim to a reputation for eloquence by a superficial and ill-regulated use of language, without having learned any of the usages and principles of the Latin tongue. For while Catullus in one of his poems had used the word <hi rend="italic">deprecor</hi> rather cleverly, that fellow, unable to appreciate this, declared that the following verses which I have quoted were very flat, although in the judgment of all men they are most charming:

<note>xcii.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>My Lesbia constantly speaks ill of me</l> <l>And ceases not. By Jove! she cares for me!</l> <l>How do I know? 'Tis just the same with me;</l> <l>I rail at, but by Jove! I worship, her.</l></quote></p>

<p>Our good man thought that <hi rend="italic">deprecor</hi> in this passage was used in the sense that is commonly given the word by the vulgar; that is, <quote>I pray earnestly,</quote> <quote>I beseech,</quote> <quote>I entreat,</quote> where the preposition <hi rend="italic">de</hi> is used intensively and emphatically. And if that were so, the verses would indeed be flat. But as a matter of fact the sense is exactly the opposite; for the preposition <hi rend="italic">de,</hi> since it has a double force, contains two meanings in one and the same word. For <hi rend="italic">deprecor</hi> is used by Catullus in the sense of <quote>denounce, execrate, drive away,</quote> or <quote>avert by prayers</quote>; but it also has the opposite meaning, when Cicero <hi rend="italic">In Defence of Publius Sulla</hi> speaks as follows:

<note>§ 72.</note>
<quote>How many men's lives did he beg off (<hi rend="italic">est deprecatus</hi>) from Sulla.</quote> Similarly in his speech <hi rend="italic">Against the Agrarian Law</hi> Cicero says:

<note>ii. 100.</note>
<quote>If I do any  <pb n="v2.p.137"/>  wrong, there are no masks of ancestors to intercede (<hi rend="italic">deprecentur,</hi> <quote>beg off</quote>) for me with you by their prayers.</quote> </p>

<p>But Catullus was not alone in using this word with that meaning. Indeed, the books are full of cases of its occurrence in the same sense, and of these I have quoted one or two which had come to mind. Quintus Ennius in the <hi rend="italic">Erectheus,</hi> not differing greatly from Catullus, says:

<note>128, Ribbeck<hi rend="sup">3</hi>.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Who now win freedom by my own distress</l> <l>For those whose slavery I by woe avert (<hi rend="italic">deprecor</hi>).</l></quote>  He means <quote>I drive away</quote> and <quote>remove,</quote> either by resort to prayer or in some other way. Similarly in the <hi rend="italic">Chresphontes</hi> Ennius writes:

<note>121, Ribbeck<hi rend="sup">3</hi>.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>When I my own life spare, may I avert (<hi rend="italic">deprecer</hi>)</l> <l>Death from mine enemy.</l></quote>  Cicero, in the sixth book of his <hi rend="italic">Republic,</hi> wrote:

<note>2.2.</note>
<quote>Which indeed was so much the more remarkable, because, while the colleagues were in the same case, they not only did not incur the same hatred, but the affection felt for Gracchus even averted (<hi rend="italic">deprecabatur</hi>) the unpopularity of Claudius.</quote> Here too the meaning is not <quote>earnestly entreated,</quote> but <quote>warded off</quote> unpopularity, so to speak, and defended him against it, a meaning which the Greeks express by the parallel word <foreign xml:lang="grc">paraitei=sqai.</foreign></p>

<p>Cicero also uses the word in the same way in his <hi rend="italic">Defence of Aulus Caecina,</hi> saying:

<note>§ 30.</note>
<quote>What can you do for a man like this? Can you not sometimes permit one to avert (<hi rend="italic">deprecetur</hi>) the odium of the greatest wickedness by the excuse of the most abysmal folly?</quote> Also in the first book of his second  <pb n="v2.p.139"/>  <hi rend="italic">Arraignment of Verres:</hi>

<note>ii. 2. 192.</note>
<quote>Now what can Hortensius do? Will he try to avert (<hi rend="italic">deprecetur</hi>) the charge of avarice by the praise of economy? But he is defending a man who is utterly disgraced and sunk in lust and crime.</quote> So then Catullus means that he is doing the same as Lesbia, in publicly speaking ill of her, scorning and rejecting her, and constantly praying to be rid of her, and yet loving her to madness.</p>  </div>

<p>Who was the first of all to establish a public library; and how many books there were in the public libraries at Athens before the Persian invasions.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THE tyrant Pisistratus is said to have been the first to establish at Athens a public library of books relating to the liberal arts. Then the Athenians themselves added to this collection with considerable diligence and care; but later Xerxes, when he got possession of Athens and burned the entire city except the citadel,

<note>In 480 B.C.</note>
removed that whole collection of books and carried them off to Persia. Finally, a long time afterwards, king Seleucus, who was surnamed Nicanor, had all those books taken back to Athens.</p>

<p>At a later time an enormous quantity of books, nearly seven hundred thousand volumes, was either acquired or written

<note><hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> copied from other manuscripts.</note>
in Egypt under the kings known as Ptolemies; but these were all burned during the sack of the city in our first war with Alexandria,

<note>In 48 B.C. By no means all of the Alexandrian Library was destroyed at that time, and the losses were made good, at least in part, by Antony in 41 B.C. A part of the library was burned under Aurelian, in A.D. 272, and the destruction seems to have been completed in 391.</note>

<p>Why Quintus Claudius Quadrigarius, in the nineteenth book of his <hi rend="italic">Annals,</hi> wrote that missiles hit their mark more accurately and surely if they are hurled from below, than if they are hurled from above.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When Quintus Claudius, in the nineteenth book of his <hi rend="italic">Annals,</hi> was describing an attack upon a town by the proconsul Metellus, and its defence against him by the townspeople from the top of the walls, he wrote these words:

<note>Fr. 85, Peter<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
<quote>The archers and slingers on both sides showered their weapons with the utmost vigour and courage. But there is this difference between shooting an arrow or a stone downward or upward; for neither missile can be discharged accurately downward, but both upwards with excellent effect. Therefore the soldiers of Metellus suffered far fewer wounds, and, what was of the greatest importance, they very easily drove the enemy back from the battlements by means of their slingers.</quote></p>

<p>I asked Antonius Julianus, the rhetorician, why what Quadrigarius had said was so; namely, that the shots of missiles are closer and more accurate if you discharge a stone or an arrow upwards rather than downwards, in spite of the fact that a throw from above downward is swifter and easier than one in the opposite direction. Then  <pb n="v2.p.155"/>  Julianus, after commending the character of the question, said: <quote>His statement about an arrow and a stone may be made about almost any missile weapon. But, as you have said, throwing is easier if you throw downwards, provided you wish only to throw, and not to hit a mark. But when the direction and force of the throw must be regulated and guided, then, if you are throwing downwards, tile control and command of the marksman are impaired by the downward impulse itself, such as it is, and by the weight of the falling missile. But if you throw your weapon upwards, and direct hand and eye to hitting something above you, the missile which you have hurled will go to the spot to which the impulse which you have given bears it.</quote> It was to this general effect that Julianus chatted with us about those words of Quintus Claudius.</p>

<p>With regard to the remark of the same Claudius, <quote>they very easily drove the enemy from the battlements,</quote> it must be observed that he used the word <hi rend="italic">defendebant,</hi> not in the sense which it commonly has, but yet quite properly and in accordance with good Latin usage. For <hi rend="italic">defendere</hi> and <hi rend="italic">offendere</hi> are opposed to each other, the latter meaning <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)mpodw\n e)/xein,</foreign> that is, <quote>to run against something and fall upon it,</quote> the former, <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)kpodw\n poiei=n,</foreign> that is, <quote>to avert and drive away</quote>; and the latter is Claudius' meaning in this passage.</p></div>

<p>In what terms Herodes Atticus reproved a man who in appearance and dress falsely laid claim to the title and character of philosopher.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>To Herodes Atticus, the ex-consul, renowned for his personal charm and his Grecian eloquence, there  <pb n="v2.p.157"/>  once came, when I was present, a man in a cloak, with long hair and a beard that reached almost to his waist, and asked that money be given him <foreign xml:lang="grc">ei)s a)/rtous,</foreign> that is, <quote>for bread.</quote> Then Herodes asked him who on earth he was, and the man, with anger in his voice and expression, replied that he was a philosopher, adding that he wondered why Herodes thought it necessary to ask what was obvious. <quote>I see,</quote> said Herodes, <quote>a beard and a cloak; the philosopher I do not yet see. Now, I pray you, be so good as to tell me by what evidence you think we may recognize you as a philosopher.</quote> Meanwhile some of Herodes' companions told him that the fellow was a vagabond of worthless character, who frequented foul dives and was in the habit of being shamefully abusive if he did not get what he demanded. Thereupon Herodes said: <quote>Let us give him some money, whatever his character may be, not because he is a man, but because we are men,</quote> and he ordered enough money to be given him to buy bread for thirty days.</p>

<p>Then, turning to those of us who were with him, he said: <quote>Musonius

<note>p. 132, Hense.</note>
ordered a thousand sesterces to be given to a fakir of this sort who posed as a philosopher, and when several told him that the fellow was a rascal and knave and deserving of nothing good, Musonius, they say, replied with a smile: <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)/cios ou)=n e)sti\n a)rguri/ou,</foreign> 'then he deserves money.' But,</quote> said Herodes, <quote>it is rather this that causes me resentment and vexation, that foul and evil beasts of this sort usurp a most sacred name and call themselves philosophers. Now, my ancestors the Athenians by public decree made it unlawful for slaves ever to be given the names of those valiant youths Harmodius  <pb n="v2.p.159"/>  and Aristogeiton, who to restore liberty tried to slay the tyrant Hippias;

<note>In 514 B.C. They slew Hipparchus, brother of Hippias and son of Pisistratus. Hippias was afterwards driven from the city and the tyrannicides, who had lost their lives in their attempt, received almost divine honours.</note>
for they thought it impious for the names of men who had sacrificed themselves for their country's freedom to be disgraced by contact with slavery. Why then do we allow the glorious title of philosopher to be defiled in the person of the basest of men? Moreover,</quote> said he, <quote>I hear that the early Romans, setting a similar example in a case of the opposite nature, voted that the forenames of certain patricians who had deserved ill of their country and for that reason had been condemned to death should never be given to any patrician of the same clan, in order that their very names might seem to be dishonoured and done to death, as well as the malefactors themselves.</quote>

using an epithet that is somewhat far-fetched, but altogether apt. There I saw some bundles of books exposed for sale, and I at once eagerly hurried to them. Now, all those books were in Greek, filled with marvellous tales, things unheard of, incredible; but the writers were ancient and of no mean authority: Aristeas of Proconnesus, Isigonus of Nicaea, Ctesias and Onesicritus, Philostephanus and Hegesias.

<note>See the Index.</note>
The volumes themselves, however, were filthy from long neglect, in bad condition and unsightly. Nevertheless, I drew near and asked their price; then, attracted by their extraordinary and unexpected cheapness, 1 bought a large number of them for a small sum, and ran through all of them hastily in the course of the next two nights. As I read, I culled from them, and noted down, some things that were remarkable and for the most part unmentioned by our native writers; these I have inserted here and there in these notes, so that whoever shall read them may not be found to be wholly ignorant and <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)nh/koos,</foreign> or <quote>uninstructed,</quote> when hearing tales of that kind.</p>

<p>Those books, then, contained matter of the following sort: that the most remote of the Scythians, who pass their life in the far north, eat human flesh and subsist on the nourishment of that food, and are called <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)nqrwpofa/goi,</foreign> or <quote>cannibals.</quote> Also that there are men in the same latitude having one eye in the middle of the forehead and called Arimaspi, who are of the appearance that the poets give the Cyclopes.

<note>The Arimaspi are mentioned as good riders by Aeschylus, <hi rend="italic">Prom.</hi> 805. Since Herodotus (iv. 27; <hi rend="italic">L.C.L.</hi> ii, p. 227) says that in Scythian <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)/rima</foreign> meant <quote>one</quote> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">spou=,</foreign> <quote>eye,</quote> Strabo (i, 2, 10; <hi rend="italic">L.C.L.</hi> vol. i, pp. 77 f.) thought that Homer might have derived his Cyclopes from the Scythian Arimaspi. See Milton, <hi rend="italic">P.L.</hi> 2, 945.</note>
That there are also in the same region  <pb n="v2.p.165"/>  other men, of marvellous swiftness, whose feet are turned backwards and do not point forward, as in the rest of mankind.

<note>Cf. Pliny, <hi rend="italic">N.H.</hi> vii. 11; Augustine, <hi rend="italic">Civ. Dei,</hi> xvi. 8.</note>
Further, that it was handed down by tradition that in a distant land called <hi rend="italic">Albania</hi> men are born whose hair turns white in childhood and who see better by night than in the daytime. That it was also a matter of assured belief that the Sauromatae, who dwell far away beyond the river Borysthenes, take food only every other day

<note>That is, every <hi rend="italic">third</hi> day, according to the Roman method of reckoning; cf. xvii. 12. 2, febrim <hi rend="italic">quartis</hi> diebus recurrentem, and xvii. 12. 5, haec <hi rend="italic">biduo</hi> medio intervallata febris, and see <hi rend="italic">Class. Phil.</hi> viii, pp. 1 ff.</note>
and fast on the intervening day.</p>

<p>In those same books I ran upon this statement too, which I later read also in the seventh book of the <hi rend="italic">Natural History</hi> of Plinius Secundus,

<note>vii. 16.</note>
that in the land of Africa there are families of persons who work spells by voice and tongue; for if they should chance to have bestowed extravagant praise upon beautiful trees, plentiful crops, charming children, fine horses, flocks that are well fed and in good condition, suddenly, for no other cause than this, all these would die. That with the eyes too a deadly spell is cast, is written in those same books, and it is said that there are persons among the Illyrians who by their gaze kill those at whom they have looked for some time in anger; and that those persons themselves, both men and women, who possess this power of harmful gaze, have two pupils in each eye. Also that in the mountains of the land of India there are men who have the heads of dogs, and bark, and that they feed upon birds and wild animals which they have taken in the chase. That in the remotest lands of the east too there are  <pb n="v2.p.167"/>  other marvellous men called <hi rend="italic">monocoli,</hi> or <quote>one-legged,</quote> who run by hopping with their single leg and are of a most lively swiftness.

<note>Cf. Plin. <hi rend="italic">N.H.</hi> vii. 23.</note>
And that there are also some others who are without necks and have eyes in their shoulders. But all bounds of wonder are passed by the statement of those same writers, that there is a tribe in farthest India with bodies that are rough and covered with feathers like birds, who eat no food but live by inhaling the perfume of flowers. And that not far from these people is the land of Pygmies, the tallest of whom are not more than two feet and a quarter in height.</p>

<p>These and many other stories of the kind I read; but when writing them down, I was seized with disgust for such worthless writings, which contribute nothing to the enrichment or profit of life. Nevertheless, the fancy took me to add to this collection of marvels a thing which Plinius Secundus, a man of high authority in his day and generation by reason of his talent and his position, recorded in the seventh book of his <hi rend="italic">Natural History,</hi>

<note>vii. 36.</note>
not as something that he had heard or read, but that he knew to be true and had himself seen. The words therefore which I have quoted below are his own, taken from that book, and they certainly make us hesitate to reject or ridicule that familiar yarn of the poets of old about Caenis and Caeneus.

<note>Caenis was a girl whom her lover Poseidon changed into a man and who was then called Caeneus; see Ovid, <hi rend="italic">Met.</hi> xii. 171 ff.; Virg. <hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> vi. 448.</note>
He says that the change of women into men is not a fiction. <quote>We find,</quote> says he, <quote>in the annals that in the consulship of Quintus Licinius Crassus and Gains Cassius Longinus

<note>171 B.C.</note>
a girl at Casinum was changed into a boy in the house of her parents and by direction of the diviners was deported to a desert island. Licinius Mucianus has stated  <pb n="v2.p.169"/>  that he saw at Argos one Arescontes, whose name had been Arescusa; that she had even been married, but presently grew a beard, became a man, and had taken a wife: and that at Smyrna also he had seen a boy who had experienced the same change. I myself in Africa saw Lucius Cossutius, a citizen of Thysdrus, who had been changed into a man on his wedding day and was still living when I wrote this.</quote></p>

<p>Pliny also wrote this in the same book:

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As to pleasure the philosophers of old expressed varying opinions. Epicurus makes pleasure the highest good, but defines it

as <foreign xml:lang="grc">sarko\s eu)staqe\s kata/sthma,</foreign> or <quote>a well-balanced condition of body.</quote> Antisthenes the Socratic calls it the greatest evil; for this is the expression he uses:

<foreign xml:lang="grc">manei/hn ma=llon h)\ h(sqei/hn</foreign>; that is to say, <quote>may I go mad rather than feel pleasure.</quote> Speusippus and all the old Academy declare

<note><hi rend="italic">F.P. G.</hi> iii. 92. 169.</note>
that pleasure and pain are two evils opposed to each other, but that what lay midway between the two was the good. Zeno thought

<note>p. 169, Pearson; i. 195, Arn.</note>
that pleasure was indifferent, that is neutral, neither good nor evil, that,  <pb n="v2.p.171"/>  namely, which he himself called by the Greek term <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)dia/foron.</foreign> Critolaus the Peripatetic declares that pleasure is an evil and gives birth to many other evils: injustice, sloth, forgetfulness, and cowardice. Earlier than all these, Plato discoursed in so many and varied ways about pleasure, that all those opinions which I have set forth may seem to have flowed from the founts of his discourses; for he makes use of each one of them according to the suggestion offered by the nature of pleasure itself, which is manifold, and according to the demands made by the character of the topics which he is treating and of the effect that he wishes to produce. But our countryman Taurus, whenever mention was made of Epicurus, always had on his lips and tongue these words of Hierocles the Stoic, a man of righteousness and dignity: <quote>Pleasure an end, a harlot's creed; there is no Providence, not even a harlot's creed.</quote></p>  </div>

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>FROM <hi rend="italic">ago</hi> and <hi rend="italic">egi</hi> are derived the verbs <hi rend="italic">actito</hi> and <hi rend="italic">actitavi,</hi> which the grammarians call <quote>frequentatives.</quote>

<note>Most modern grammarians prefer the more comprehensive term <quote>intensives.</quote></note>
These verbs I have heard some men, and those not without learning, pronounce with a shortening of the first syllable, and give as their reason that the first letter of the primitive <hi rend="italic">ago</hi> is pronounced short. Why then do we make the first vowel long in the frequentative forms <hi rend="italic">esito and</hi> <hi rend="italic">unctito,</hi> which are derived from <hi rend="italic">edo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ungo,</hi> in which the first letter is short;  <pb n="v2.p.173"/>  and, on the contrary, pronounce the first vowel short in <hi rend="italic">dictito</hi> from <hi rend="italic">dīco</hi>? Accordingly, should not <hi rend="italic">actito</hi> and <hi rend="italic">actitavi</hi> rather be lengthened? For the first syllable of almost all frequentatives is pronounced in the same way as the same syllable of the past participle of the verbs from which they are formed: for example, <hi rend="italic">lego lēctus</hi> makes <hi rend="italic">lēctito; ungo ūnctus, ūnctito; scrībo scrīptus, scrīptito; moveo mōtus, mōtito; pendeo pēnsus, pēnsito; edo ēsus, ēsito; but dīco dīctus forms dictito; gĕro gĕstus, gĕstito; vĕho vĕctus, vĕctito; răpio răptus, răptito; căpio căptus, căptito; făcio făctus, făctito.</hi> So then ăctito should be pronounced with the first syllable long, since it is from <hi rend="italic">ago</hi> and ăctus.</p>  </div>

<p>What method should be followed in translating Greek expressions; and on those verses of Homer which Virgil is thought to have translated either well and happily or unsuccessfully.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>WHENEVER striking expressions from the Greek poets are to be translated and imitated, they say that  <pb n="v2.p.177"/>  we should not always strive to render every single word with exact literalness. For many things lose their charm if they are transplanted too forcibly— unwillingly, as it were, and reluctantly.

<note>Cf. Hor. <hi rend="italic">Ars Poet.</hi> 149–150.</note>
Virgil therefore showed skill and good judgment in omitting some things and rendering others, when he was dealing with passages of Homer or Hesiod or Apollonius or Parthenius or Callimachus or Theocritus, or some other poet.</p>

<p>For example, when very recently the <hi rend="italic">Bucolics</hi> of Theocritus and Virgil were being read together at table, we perceived that Virgil had omitted something that in the Greek is, to be sure, wonderfully pleasing, but neither could nor ought to have been translated. But what he has substituted for that omission is almost more charming and graceful. Theocritus writes:

<note><hi rend="italic">Idyls</hi> v. 88 f; the translation is that of Edmonds, <hi rend="italic">L.C.L.</hi></note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>But when her goatherd boy goes by you should see my Cleärist</l> <l>Fling apples, and her pretty lips call pouting to be kissed.</l></quote>  Virgil has:

<note><hi rend="italic"> Ed.</hi> iii. 64 ff., translation by Dryden.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>My Phyllis me with pelted apples plies,</l> <l>Then tripping to the woods the wanton hies,</l> <l>And wishes to be seen before she flies.</l></quote>  Also in another place I notice that what was very sweet in the Greek was prudently omitted. Theocritus writes:

<note><hi rend="italic">Idyis iii.</hi> 3 ff.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>O Tityrus, well-belovéd, feed my goats,</l> <l>And lead them to the fount, good Tityrus;</l> <l>But 'ware yon buck-goat yellow, lest he butt.</l></quote>  <pb n="v2.p.179"/>  But how could Virgil reproduce <foreign xml:lang="grc">to\ kalo\n pefilhme/ne</foreign> (<quote>well-beloved</quote>), words that, by Heaven! defy translation, but have a certain native charm? He therefore omitted that expression and translated the rest very cleverly, except in using <hi rend="italic">caper</hi> for Theocritus' <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)no/rxas</foreign>; for, according to Marcus Varro,

<note>Fr. 104, G. &amp; S.</note>
a goat is called <hi rend="italic">caper</hi> in Latin only after he has been castrated. Virgil's version is:

<note><hi rend="italic">Ecl.</hi> ix. 23.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Till I return—not long—feed thou my goats;</l> <l>Then, Tityrus, give them drink, but as you go,</l> <l>Avoid the buck-goat's horn—the fellow butts'</l></quote></p>

<p>And since I am speaking on the subject of translation, I recall hearing from pupils of Valerius Probus, a learned man and well trained in reading and estimating the ancient writings, that he used to say that Virgil had never translated Homer less successfully than in these delightful lines which Homer wrote about Nausicaa:

<note><hi rend="italic">Odyss.</hi> vi. 102 ff., translation by Dryden.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>As when o'er Erymanth Diana roves,</l> <l>Or wide Taÿgetus' resounding groves,</l> <l>A silver train the huntress queen surrounds,</l> <l>Her rattling quiver from her shoulder sounds;</l> <l>Fierce in the sport, along the mountain's brow</l> <l>They bay the boar or chase the bounding roe;</l> <l>High o'er the lawn, with more majestic pace,</l> <l>Above the nymphs she treads with stately grace;</l> <l>Distinguished excellence the goddess proves,</l> <l>Exults Latona as the virgin moves:</l> <l>With equal grace Nausicaa trod the plain,</l> <l>And shone transcendent o'er the beauteous train.</l></quote>  This passage Virgil renders thus:

<note><hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> i. 498. ff.</note>
<pb n="v2.p.181"/>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>As on Eurotas' banks or Cynthus' heights</l> <l>Diana guides her dancing bands, whose train</l> <l>A thousand Oreads follow, right and left;</l> <l>A quiver bears she on her shoulder fair,</l> <l>And as she treads, the goddesses o'ertops;</l> <l>Joys thrill Latona's silent breast.</l></quote>	  First of all, they said that Probus thought that in Homer the maiden Nausicaa, playing among her girl companions in solitary places, was consistently and properly compared with Diana hunting on the mountain heights among the rural goddesses; but that Virgil had made a comparison that was by no means suitable, since Dido, walking with dignified dress and gait in the midst of a city, and surrounded by the Tyrian chiefs, <quote>pressing on the work of her rising kingdom,</quote> as he himself says,

<note><hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> i. 504.</note>
can have no points of similarity corresponding with the sports and hunts of Diana. Then secondly, that Homer mentions plainly and directly Diana's interest and pleasure in the chase, while Virgil, not having said a word about the goddess' hunting, merely pictures her as carrying a quiver on her shoulder, as if it were a burden or a pack. And they said that Probus was particularly surprised at this feature of Virgil's version, that while Homer's Leto rejoices with a joy that is unaffected, deep, and springing from the very depths of her heart and soul—for the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ge/ghqe de/ te fre/na Lhtw/,</foreign> or <quote>Leto rejoiced in heart,</quote> mean nothing else—Virgil, on the other hand, in his attempt to imitate this, has depicted a joy that is passive, mild, slow, and as it were floating on the surface of the heart; for Probus said that he did not know what else the word <hi rend="italic">pertemptant</hi> could mean.

<note><hi rend="italic">Pertempto</hi> means <quote>try thoroughly,</quote> hence <quote>affect deeply.</quote> Probus must have taken <hi rend="italic">per</hi> in the sense of <quote>over,</quote> <quote>on the surface,</quote> thus giving <hi rend="italic">pertempto</hi> a meaning of which no example exists.</note>
<pb n="v2.p.183"/>  Besides all this, Virgil seemed to have left out the flower of the whole passage, by giving only a faint shadow of this verse of Homer's:  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>And shone transcendent o'er the beauteous train.

<note>Literally, "And is readily recognized, though all are fair."</note>
</l></quote>  For no greater or more complete praise of beauty can be expressed than that she alone excelled where all were beautiful, that she alone was easily distinguished from all the rest.</p>  </div>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THE poet Annianus,

<note>A name of Celtic origin, according to Schulze, <hi rend="italic">Eigenn.</hi> 426.</note>
and with him many other devotees of the same Muse, extolled with high and constant praise the verses of Virgil in which, while depicting and describing the conjugal union of Vulcan and Venus, an act that nature's law bids us conceal, he veiled it with a modest paraphrase. For thus he wrote:

<note><hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> viii. 404 ff.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>So speaking, the desired embrace he gave,</l> <l>And sinking on the bosom of his spouse,</l> <l>Calm slumber then he wooed in every limb.</l></quote>  But they thought it less difficult, in speaking of such a subject, to use one or two words that suggest it by a slight and delicate hint, such as Homer's <foreign xml:lang="grc">parqeni/h zw/nh,</foreign> or <quote>maiden girdle</quote>;

<note><hi rend="italic">Odyss.</hi> xi. 245.</note>
<foreign xml:lang="grc">le/ktroio qesmo/n,</foreign>  <quote>the right of the couch</quote>;

<note><hi rend="italic">Odyss.</hi> xi. 246.</note>
that no other than Virgil has ever spoken of those sacred mysteries of chaste intercourse in so  <pb n="v2.p.185"/>  many and such plain words, which yet were not licentious, but pure and honourable.</p>

<p>But Annaeus Cornutus, a man in many other respects, to be sure, lacking neither in learning nor taste, nevertheless, in the second book of the work which he compiled <hi rend="italic">On Figurative Language,</hi> defamed the high praise of all that modesty by an utterly silly and odious criticism.

<p>Of Valerius Corvinus and the origin of his surname, </p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THERE is not one of the well-known historians who has varied in telling the story of Valerius Maximus, who was called Corvinus because of the help and defence rendered him by a raven. That truly remarkable event is in fact thus related in the annals:

<note><hi rend="italic">e.q.</hi> Claud. Quad. Fr. 12, Peter<hi rend="sup">2.</hi></note>
In the consulship of Lucius Furius and Appius Claudius,

<note>349 B.C.</note>
a young man of such a family

<note>That is, as had been described in what preceded.</note>
was appointed tribune of the soldiers. And at that time vast forces of Gauls had encamped in the Pomptine district, and the Roman army was being drawn up in order of battle by the consuls, who were not a little disquieted by the strength and number of the enemy. Meanwhile the leader of the Gauls, a man of enormous size and stature, his armour gleaming with gold, advanced with long strides and flourishing his spear, at the same time casting haughty and contemptuous glances  <pb n="v2.p.187"/>  in all directions. Filled with scorn for all that he saw, he challenged anyone from the entire Roman army to come out and meet him, if he dared. Thereupon, while all were wavering between fear and shame, the tribune Valerius, first obtaining the consuls' permission to fight with the Gaul who was boasting so vainly, advanced to meet him, boldly yet modestly. They meet, they halt, they were already engaging in combat. And at that moment a divine power is manifest: a raven, hitherto unseen, suddenly flies to the spot, perches on the tribune's helmet, and from there begins an attack on the face and the eyes of his adversary. It flew at the Gaul, harassed him, tore his hand with its claws, obstructed his sight with its wings, and after venting its rage flew back to the tribune's helmet. Thus the tribune, before the eyes of both armies, relying on his own valour and defended by the help of the bird, conquered and killed the arrogant leader of the enemy, and thus won the surname Corvinus. This happened four hundred and five years after the founding of Rome.</p>

<p>To that Corvinus the deified Augustus caused a statue to be erected in his Forum.

<note>In the colonnades of his Forum Augustus placed statues of <quote>the leaders who had raised the estate of the Roman people from obscurity to greatness</quote>: see Suetonius, <hi rend="italic">Aug.</hi> xxxi. 5.</note>
On the head of this statue is the figure of a raven, a reminder of the event and of the combat which I have described.</p>  </div>

<p>On words which are used with two opposite meanings, both active and passive.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As the adjective <hi rend="italic">formidulosus</hi> may be used both of one who fears and of one who is feared, <hi rend="italic">invidiosus</hi> of  <pb n="v2.p.189"/>  one who envies and of one who is envied, <hi rend="italic">suspiciosus</hi> of one who suspects and of one who is suspected, <hi rend="italic">ambitiosus</hi> of one who courts favour and of one who is courted, <hi rend="italic">gratiosus</hi> also of one who gives, and of one who receives, thanks, <hi rend="italic">laboriosus</hi> of one who toils and of one who causes toil—as many other words of this kind are used in both ways, so <hi rend="italic">infestus</hi> too has a double meaning. For he is called <hi rend="italic">infestus</hi> who inflicts injury on anyone, and on the other hand he who is threatened with injury from another source is also said to be <hi rend="italic">infestus.</hi></p>

<p>But the meaning which I gave first surely needs no illustration, so many are there who use <hi rend="italic">infestus</hi> in the sense of hostile and adverse; but that second meaning is less familiar and more obscure. For who of the common run would readily call a man <hi rend="italic">infestus</hi> to whom another is hostile? However, not only did many of the earlier writers speak in that way, but Marcus Tullius also gave the word that meaning in the speech which he wrote <hi rend="italic">In Defence of Gnaeus Plancius,</hi> saying:

<note>§ 1.</note>
<quote>I were grieved, gentlemen of the jury, and keenly distressed, if this man's safety should be more endangered (<hi rend="italic">infestior</hi>) for the very reason that he had protected my life and safety by his own kindliness, protection and watchfulness.</quote> Accordingly, I inquired into the origin and meaning of the word and found this statement in the writings of Nigidius:

<note>Fr. 47, Swoboda.</note>
<quote><hi rend="italic">Infestus</hi> is derived <hi rend="italic">from</hi> <hi rend="italic">festinare,</hi></quote> says he, <quote>for one who threatens anyone, and is in haste to attack him, and hurries eagerly to crush him; or on the other hand one whose peril and ruin are being hastened— both of these are called <hi rend="italic">infestus</hi> from the urgent imminence of the injury which one is either about to inflict on someone, or to suffer.</quote>

<p>Now, that no one may have to search for an example of <hi rend="italic">suspiciosus,</hi> which I mentioned above, and of <hi rend="italic">formidulosus</hi> in its less usual sense, Marcus Cato, <hi rend="italic">On the properly of Florius,</hi> used <hi rend="italic">suspiciosus</hi> as follows:

<note>lvii. 1, Jordan.</note>
<quote>But except in the case of one who practised public prostitution, or had hired himself out to a procurer, even though he had been ill-famed and suspected <hi rend="italic">suspiciousus,</hi> they decided that it was unlawful to use force against the person of a freeman.</quote> For in this passage Cato uses <hi rend="italic">suspicious</hi> in the sense of <quote>suspected,</quote> not that of <quote>suspecting.</quote> Sallust too in the <hi rend="italic"> (Cailine</hi> uses <hi rend="italic">formidulosus</hi> of one who is feared, in this passage:

<note>vii. 5.</note>
<quote>To such men consequently no labour was unfamiliar, no region too rough or too steep, no armed foeman to be dreaded (<hi rend="italic">formidulosus</hi>).</quote></p>

<p>Gaius Calvus also in his poems uses <hi rend="italic">laboriosus,</hi> not in the ordinary sense of <quote>one who toils,</quote> but of that on which labour is spent, saying:

<note>Fr. 2, Bährens, <hi rend="italic">F.P.R.</hi></note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>The hard and toilsome (<hi rend="italic">laboriosum</hi>) country he will</l> <l>shun.</l></quote>  In the same way Laberius also in the <hi rend="italic">Sisters</hi> says:

<note>86, Ribbeck<hi rend="sup">3</hi>.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>By Castor! sleepy (<hi rend="italic">somniculosum</hi>) wine!</l></quote>  and Cinna in his poems:

<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>As Punic Psyllus doth

<note>Some such word as <quote>handle</quote> is to be supplied.</note>
the sleepy (<hi rend="italic">somniculosam</hi>) asp.

<note>The Psylli, according to Pliny, <hi rend="italic">Nat. Hist.</hi> vii. 14, were an African people whose bodies contained a poison deadly to serpents, and gave out an odour which put snakes to flight; see also <hi rend="italic">Nat.

</l></quote></p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Metus</hi> also and <hi rend="italic">iniuria,</hi> and some other words of the kind. may be used in this double sense; for <hi rend="italic">metus hostium,</hi> <quote>fear of the enemy,</quote> is a correct expression  <pb n="v2.p.193"/>  both when the enemy fear and when they are feared. Thus Sallust in the first book of his <hi rend="italic">History</hi>

<note>i. 53, Maur.</note>
speaks of <quote>the fear of Pompey,</quote> not implying that Pompey was afraid, which is the more common meaning, but that he was feared. These are Sallust's words: <quote>That war was aroused by the fear of the victorious Pompey, who was restoring Hiempsal to his kingdom.</quote> Also in another passage:

<note>I. 12, Maur.</note>
<quote>After the fear of the Carthaginians had been dispelled and there was leisure to engage in dissensions.</quote> In the same way we speak of the <quote>injuries,</quote> as well of those who inflict them as of those who suffer them, and illustrations of that usage are readily found.</p>

<p>The following passage from Virgil affords a similar instance of this kind of double meaning; he says:

<note><hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> ii. 436.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Slow from Ulysses' wound,</l></quote>  using <hi rend="italic">vulnus,</hi> not of a wound that Ulysses had suffered, but of one that he had inflicted. <hi rend="italic">Nescius</hi> also is used as well of one who is unknown as of one who does not know; but its use in the sense of one who does not know is common, while it is rarely used of that which is unknown. <hi rend="italic">Ignarus</hi> has the same double application, not only to one who is ignorant, but also to one who is not known. Thus Plautus in the <hi rend="italic">Rudens</hi> says:

<note>v. <hi rend="italic">275.</hi></note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>In unknown (<hi rend="italic">nesciis</hi>) realms are we where hope</l> <l>knows naught (<hi rend="italic">nescia</hi>).

<!--<argument>-->

<p>A passage from the history of Claudius Quadrigarius, in which he pictured the combat of Manlius Torquatus, a young noble, with a hostile Gaul, who challenged the whole Roman army.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>TITUS MANLIUS was a man of the highest birth and of exalted rank. This Manlius was given the surname Torquatus. The reason for the surname, we are told, was that he wore as a decoration a golden neck-chain, a trophy taken from an enemy whom he had slain. But who the enemy was, and what his nationality, how formidable his huge size, how insolent his challenge, and how the battle was fought all this Quintus Claudius has described in the first book of his <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi> with words of the utmost purity and clearness, and with the simple and unaffected charm of the old-time style. When the philosopher Favorinus read this passage from that work, he used to say that his mind was stirred and affected by no less emotion and excitement than if he were himself an eye-witness of their contest.</p>

<p>I have added the words of Quintus Claudius in which that battle is pictured: <quote>In the meantime a Gaul came forward, who was naked except for a shield and two swords and the ornament of a neck-chain and bracelets; in strength and size, in youthful vigour and in courage as well, he excelled all the rest. In the very height of the battle, when the two armies were fighting with the utmost ardour, he began to make signs with his hand to both sides, to cease fighting. The combat ceased. As soon as silence was secured, he called out in a mighty voice that if anyone wished to engage him in single combat,  <pb n="v2.p.197"/>  he should come forward. This no one dared do, because of his great size and savage aspect. Then the Gaul began to laugh at them and to stick out his tongue. This at once roused the great indignation of one Titus Manlius, a youth of the highest birth, that such an insult should be offered his country, and that no one from so great an army should accept the challenge. He, as I say, stepped forth, and would not suffer Roman valour to be shamefully tarnished by a Gaul. Armed with a foot-soldier's shield and a Spanish sword, he confronted the Gaul. Their meeting took place on the very bridge, in the presence of both armies, amid great apprehension. Thus they confronted each other, as I said before: the Gaul, according to his method of fighting, with shield advanced and awaiting an attack; Manlius, relying on courage rather than skill, struck shield against shield, and threw the Gaul off his balance. While the Gaul was trying to regain the same position, Manlius again struck shield against shield, and again forced the man to change his ground. In this fashion he slipped in under the Gaul's sword and stabbed him in the breast with his Spanish blade. Then at once with the same mode of attack he struck his adversary's right shoulder, and he did not give ground at all until he overthrew him, without giving the Gaul a chance to strike a blow. After he had overthrown him, he cut off his head, tore off his neck-chain, and put it, covered with blood as it was, around his own neck. Because of this act, he himself and his descendants had the surname Torquatus.</quote>

<!--<argument>-->

<p>That Quadrigarius also, with correct Latinity, used <hi rend="italic">facies</hi> as a genitive; and some other observations on the inflection of similar words.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THE expression that I quoted above from Quintus Claudius,

<note>2 ix. 13. 11</note>
<quote>On account of his great size and savage aspect (<hi rend="italic">facies</hi>),</quote> I have inquired into by examining several old manuscripts, and have found it to be as I wrote it. For it was in that way, as a rule, that the early writers declined the word—<hi rend="italic">facies facies</hi>— whereas the rule of grammar now requires <hi rend="italic">faciei</hi> as the genitive. But I did find some corrupt manuscripts in which <hi rend="italic">faciei</hi> was written, with erasure of the former reading.</p>

<p>I remember too having found both <hi rend="italic">facies</hi> and <hi rend="italic">facii</hi> written in the same manuscript of Claudius

<note>Frag. 30, Peter<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
in the library at Tibur. But <hi rend="italic">facies</hi> was written in the text and <hi rend="italic">facii,</hi> with double <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> in the margin opposite; nor did I regard that as inconsistent with a certain early usage; for from the nominative <hi rend="italic">dies</hi> they used both <hi rend="italic">dies</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dii</hi> as the genitive, and from <hi rend="italic">fames,</hi> both <hi rend="italic">famis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fami.</hi></p>  <pb n="v2.p.201"/>

<p>Quintus Ennius, in the sixteenth book of his <hi rend="italic">Annals,</hi> wrote <hi rend="italic">dies</hi> for <hi rend="italic">diei</hi> in the following verse:

<note>Ann. 413, Vahlen 2; Vahlen reads <hi rend="italic">postremo</hi> and omits <hi rend="italic">quod.</hi></note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Caused by the distant time of the last day (<hi rend="italic">dies</hi>).</l></quote>  Caesellius asserts that Cicero also wrote <hi rend="italic">dies</hi> for <hi rend="italic">diei</hi> in his oration <hi rend="italic">For Publius Sestius,</hi> and after sparing no pains and inspecting several old manuscripts, I found Caesellius to be right. These are the words of Marcus Tullius:

<note><hi rend="italic">Sest.</hi> 28; our texts commonly read <hi rend="italic">diei.</hi></note>
<quote>But the knights shall pay the penalty for that day (<hi rend="italic">dies</hi>).</quote> As a result, I readily believe those who have stated that they saw a manuscript from Virgil's own hand, in which it was written:

<note><hi rend="italic">Georg.</hi> i. 208.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>When Libra

<note>The constellation of the Balance.</note>
shall make like the hours of day (<hi rend="italic">dies</hi>) and sleep,</l></quote>  where <hi rend="italic">dies</hi> is used for <hi rend="italic">diei.</hi></p>

<p>But just as in this place Virgil evidently wrote <hi rend="italic">dies,</hi> so there is no doubt that he wrote <hi rend="italic">dii</hi> for <hi rend="italic">diei</hi> in the following line:

<note><hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> i. 636.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>As gifts for that day's (<hi rend="italic">dii</hi>) merriment,</l></quote>  where the less learned read <hi rend="italic">dei,</hi>

doubtless shrinking from the use of so uncommon a form. But the older writers declined <hi rend="italic">dies dii,</hi> as they did <hi rend="italic">fames fami, pernicies pernicii, progenies progenii, luxuries luxurii, acies acii.</hi> For Marcus Cato in his oration <hi rend="italic">On the Punic War</hi> wrote as follows:

<quote>The women and children were driven out because of the famine (<hi rend="italic">fami causa</hi>).</quote> Lucilius in his twelfth book has:

These are his words:

<note><hi rend="italic">Pro Rose. Amer.</hi> 131.</note>
<quote>We think that none of these things was produced by divine will for the purpose of dealing destruction (<hi rend="italic">pernicii</hi>), but by the very force and greatness of Nature.</quote> We must therefore suppose that Quadrigarius wrote either <hi rend="italic">facies</hi> or <hi rend="italic">facii</hi> as the genitive; but I have not found the reading <hi rend="italic">facie</hi> in any ancient manuscript.</p>

<p>But in the dative case those who spoke the best Latin did not use the form <hi rend="italic">faciei,</hi> which is now current, but <hi rend="italic">facie.</hi> For example, Lucilius in his <hi rend="italic">Satires:</hi>

<note>1257, Marx, who fills out the second line with <hi rend="italic">naturae dotibus aetas;</hi> tantis,<foreign xml:lang="grc">w.</foreign></note>

<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Who loves you, and who to your youth and charms (<hi rend="italic">facie</hi>),</l> <l>Plays courtier, promising to be your friend.</l></quote>  However, there are not a few who read <hi rend="italic">facii</hi> in both these passages of Lucilius. But Gaius Caesar, in the second book of his treatise <hi rend="italic">On Analogy,</hi>

<note>ii, p. 129, Dinter.</note>
thinks that we should use <hi rend="italic">die</hi> and <hi rend="italic">specie</hi> as genitive forms.</p>

<p>I have also found <hi rend="italic">die</hi> in the genitive case in a manuscript of Sallust's <hi rend="italic">Jugurtha</hi> of the utmost trustworthiness and of venerable age. These were the words:

<note><hi rend="italic">Jug.</hi> xcvii. 3</note>
<quote>when scarcely a tenth part of the day (<hi rend="italic">die</hi>) was left.</quote> For I do not think we ought to accept such a quibble as the assertion that <hi rend="italic">die</hi> is used for <hi rend="italic">ex die.</hi></p>  </div>

<p>On the kind of debate which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)/poros.</foreign></p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>WITH the rhetorician Antonius Julianus I had withdrawn to Naples during the season of the summer holidays, wishing to escape the heat of Rome. And there was there at the time a young man of the richer class studying with tutors in both languages, and trying to gain a command of Latin eloquence in order to plead at the bar in Rome; and he begged Julianus to hear one of his declamations. Julianus went to hear him and I went along with him. The young fellow entered the room, made some preliminary remarks in a more arrogant and presumptuous style than became his years, and then asked that subjects for debate be given him.</p>  <pb n="v2.p.207"/>

<p>There was present there with us a pupil of Julianus, a man of ready speech and good ability, who was already offended that in the hearing of a man like Julianus the fellow should show such rashness and should dare to test himself in extempore speaking. Therefore, to try him, he proposed a topic for debate that was not logically constructed, of the kind which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)/poros,</foreign> and in Latin might with some propriety be termed <hi rend="italic">inexplicabile,</hi> that is, <quote>unsolvable.</quote> The subject was of this kind: <quote>Seven judges are to hear the case of a defendant, and judgment is to be passed in accordance with the decision of a majority of their number. When the seven judges had heard the case, two decided that the defendant ought to be punished with exile; two, that he ought to be fined; the remaining three, that he should be put to death. The execution of the accused is demanded according to the decision of the three judges, but he appeals.</quote></p>

<p>As soon as the young man had heard this, without any reflection and without waiting for other subjects to be proposed, he began at once with incredible speed to reel off all sorts of principles and apply then to that same question, pouring out floods of confused and meaningless words and a torrent of verbiage. All the other members of his company, who were in the habit of listening to him, showed their delight by loud applause, but Julianus blushed and sweat from shame and embarrassment. But when after many thousand lines of drivel the fellow at last came to an end and we went out, his friends and comrades followed Julianus and asked him for his opinion. Whereupon Julianus very wittily replied <quote>Don't ask me what I think; without controversy

<note><hi rend="italic">Sine controversia</hi> is of course used in a double sense: <quote>without question,</quote> and <quote>without an opponent</quote> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> when there is no one to argue against him).</note>

<p>How Plinius Secundus, although not without learning, failed to observe and detect the fallacy in an argument of the kind that the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)ntistre/fon.</foreign></p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>PLINIUS SECUNDUS was considered the most learned man of his time. He left a work, entitled <hi rend="italic">For Students of Oratory,</hi> which is by no manner of means to be lightly regarded. In that work he introduces much varied material that will delight the ears of the learned. He also quotes a number of arguments that he regards as cleverly and skilfully urged in the course of debates. For instance, he cites this argument from such a debate: <quote>'A brave man shall be given the reward which he desires. A man who had done a brave deed asked for the wife of another in marriage, and received her. Then the man whose wife she had been did a brave deed. He demands the return of his wife, but is refused.' On the part of the second brave man, who demanded the return of his wife,</quote> says Pliny, <quote>this elegant and plausible argument was presented: ' If the law is valid, return her to me; if it is not valid, return her.'</quote>

<note>If the law was valid, the second man ought to be granted what he desired; that is, the return of his wife. If the law was not valid, the first man's desire should not have been granted, and the second man's wife should not have been taken from him. Cf. v. 10 for a similar argument.</note>
But it escaped Pliny's notice that this bit of reasoning, which he thought very acute, was not without the fallacy which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)ntistre/fon,</foreign> or <quote>a convertible proposition.</quote> And that is a deceptive fallacy, which lies concealed under a false appearance of truth; for that very argument may just as easily be turned about and used against the same man, and might, for example, be put thus by that former husband: <quote>If the law is valid, I do not return her; if it is not valid, I do not return her.</quote></p>

<p>Whether one ought to say <hi rend="italic">tertium consul</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tertio;</hi> and how Gnaeus Pompeius, when he would inscribe his honours on the theatre which he was about to dedicate, by Cicero's advice evaded the difficulty as to the form of that word.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I SENT a letter from Athens to a friend of mine in Rome. In it I said that I had now written him for the third time (<hi rend="italic">tertium</hi>). In his reply he asked me to give my reason for having written <hi rend="italic">tertium</hi> and not <hi rend="italic">tertio.</hi> He added that he hoped I would at the same time inform him what I thought about the question whether one should say <hi rend="italic">tertium consul,</hi> meaning <quote>consul for the third time,</quote> and <hi rend="italic">quartum,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tertio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">quarto;</hi> since he had heard a learned man at Rome say <hi rend="italic">tertio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">quarto consul,</hi> not <hi rend="italic">tertium</hi> and <hi rend="italic">quartum;</hi> also, that Coelius had so written

<note>Fr. 59, Peter<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
at the beginning of his third book and that Quintus Claudius in his eleventh book said

<note>Fr. 82, Peter<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
that Marius was chosen consul for the seventh time, using <hi rend="italic">septimo.</hi></p>

<p>In reply to these questions, to decide both matters about which he had written to me, I contented myself with quoting Marcus Varro, a more learned man in my opinion than Coelius and Claudius together. For Varro has made it quite plain what ought to be said, and I did not wish, when at a distance, to enter into a dispute with a man who had the name of being learned.</p>  <pb n="v2.p.215"/>

<p>Marcus Varro's words, in the fifth book of his <hi rend="italic">Disciplinae,</hi> are as follows:

<note>p. 202, Bipont.</note>
<quote>It is one thing to be made praetor <hi rend="italic">quarto,</hi> and another <hi rend="italic">quartum;</hi> for <hi rend="italic">quarto</hi> refers to order and indicates that three were elected before him;

<note>That is, that he was fourth in order of election.</note>
<hi rend="italic">quartum</hi> refers to time and indicates that he had been made praetor three times before. Accordingly Ennius was right when he wrote:

<note><hi rend="italic">Ann. </hi>295, Vahlen<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Quintus, his sire, a fourth time (<hi rend="italic">quartum</hi>) consul is,</l></quote>  and Pompeius was timid when, in order to avoid writing <hi rend="italic">consul tertium</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tertio</hi> on his theatre, he did not write the final letters.</quote>

<note>He wrote <hi rend="italic">tert.;</hi> see § 7. <hi rend="italic">Tertium</hi> is correct; the inscription on the Pantheon reads <hi rend="italic">MA. Agrippa, L.f., cos. Tertium fecit.</hi></note>
</p>

<p>What Varro briefly and somewhat obscurely hinted at concerning Pompey, Tullius Tiro, Cicero's freedman, wrote at greater length in one of his letters, substantially as follows:

<note>p. 12, Lion.</note>
<quote>When Pompey was preparing to consecrate the temple of Victory, the steps of which formed his theatre,

<note>Because of the sentiment against a permanent theatre at Rome, Pompey placed a temple of Venus Victrix at the top of his theatre, so that the seats of the auditorium formed an approach to it. It was built in 55 B.C.</note>
and to inscribe upon it his name and honours, the question arose whether <hi rend="italic">consul tertium</hi> should be written, or <hi rend="italic">tertio.</hi> Pompey took great pains to refer this question to the most learned men of Rome, and when there was difference of opinion, some maintaining that <hi rend="italic">tertio</hi> ought to be written, others <hi rend="italic">tertium,</hi> Pompey asked Cicero,</quote> says Varro, <quote>to decide upon what seemed to him the more correct form.</quote> Then Cicero was reluctant to pass judgment upon learned men, lest he might seem to have censured the men themselves in criticizing their opinion. <quote>He accordingly advised Pompey to write neither <hi rend="italic">tertium</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">tertio,</hi> but to inscribe the first  <pb n="v2.p.217"/>  four letters only, so that the meaning was shown without writing the whole word, but yet the doubt as to the form of the word was concealed.</quote></p>

<p>But that of which Varro and Tiro spoke is not now written in that way on this same theatre. For when, many years later, the back wall of the stage had fallen and was restored, the number of the third consulship was indicated, not as before, by the first four letters, but merely by three incised lines.

<note>That is, by the Roman numeral III.</note>
</p>

<p>However, in the fourth book of Marcus Cato's <hi rend="italic">Origines</hi> we find:

<note>Fr. 84, Peter<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
<quote>The Carthaginians broke the treaty for the sixth time (<hi rend="italic">sextum</hi>).</quote> This word indicates that they had violated the treaty five times before, and that this was the sixth time.

<!--<argument>-->

<p>A collection of famous passages from the speeches of Gaius Gracchus, Marcus Cicero and Marcus Cato, and a comparison of them.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>GAIUS GRACCHUS is regarded as a powerful and vigorous speaker. No one disputes this. But how can one tolerate the opinion of some, that he was more impressive, more spirited and more fluent than Marcus Tullius? Indeed, I lately read the speech of Gaius Gracchus <hi rend="italic">On the Promulgation of Laws,</hi> in which, with all the indignation of which he is master, he complains that Marcus Marius and other distinguished men of the Italian free-towns were unlawfully beaten with rods by magistrates of the Roman people.</p>

<p>His words on the subject are as follows:

<note><hi rend="italic">O.R.F.,</hi> p. 236, Meyer<hi rend="sup">3</hi>.</note>
<quote>The consul lately came to Teanum Sidicinum. His wife said that she wished to bathe in the men's baths. Marcus Marius, the quaestor of Sidicinum, was instructed to send away the bathers from the baths. The wife tells her husband that the baths were not given up to her soon enough and that they were not sufficiently clean. Therefore a stake was planted in the forum and Marcus Marius, the most illustrious man of his city, was led to it. His clothing was stripped off, he was whipped with rods. The people of Cales, when they heard of this, passed a decree that no one should think of using the public baths when a Roman magistrate was in town. At Ferentinum, for the  <pb n="v2.p.221"/>  same reason, our praetor ordered the quaestors to be arrested; one threw himself from the wall, the other was caught and beaten with rods.</quote></p>

<p>In speaking of such an atrocious action, in so lamentable and distressing a manifestation of public injustice, has he said anything either fluent or brilliant, or in such a way as to arouse tears and pity; is there anything that shows an outpouring of indignation and solemn and impressive remonstrance? Brevity there is, to be sure, grace, and a simple purity of expression, such as we sometimes have in the more refined of the comedies.</p>

<p>Gracchus also in another place speaks as follows:

<note><hi rend="italic">O.R.F.,</hi> p. 236, Meyer.<hi rend="sup">2</hi></note>
<quote>I will give you a single example of the lawlessness of our young men, and of their entire lack of self-control. Within the last few years a young man who had not yet held a magisterial office was sent as an envoy from Asia. He was carried in a litter. A herdsman, one of the peasants of Venusia, met him, and not knowing whom they were bearing, asked in jest if they were carrying a corpse. Upon hearing this, the young man ordered that the litter be set down and that the peasant be beaten to death with the thongs by which it was fastened.</quote></p>

<p>Now these words about so lawless and cruel an outrage do not differ in the least from those of ordinary conversation. But in Marcus Tullius, when in a similar case Roman citizens, innocent men, are beaten with rods contrary to justice and contrary to the laws, or tortured to death, what pity is then aroused! What complaints does he utter! How he brings the whole scene before our eyes! What a mighty surge of indignation and bitterness comes seething forth! By Heaven! when I read those  <pb n="v2.p.223"/>  words of Cicero's, my mind is possessed with the sight and sound of blows, cries and lamentation. For example, the words which he speaks about Gaius Verres, which I have quoted so far as my memory went, which was all that I could do at present:

<note><hi rend="italic">In Verr.</hi> ii. 5. 161.</note>
<quote>The man himself came into the forum, blazing with wickedness and frenzy. His eyes burned, every feature of his face displayed cruelty. All were waiting to see to what ends he would go, or what he would do, when on a sudden he gave orders that the man be dragged forth, that he be stripped in the middle of the forum and bound, and that rods be brought.</quote> Now, so help me! the mere words <quote>he ordered that he be stripped and bound, and rods brought</quote> arouse such emotion and horror that you do not seem to hear the act described, but to see it acted before your face.</p>

<p>But Gracchus plays the part, not of one who complains or implores, but of a mere narrator: <quote>A stake,</quote> he says, <quote>was planted in the forum, his clothing was stripped off, he was beaten with rods.</quote> But Marcus Cicero, finely representing the idea of continued action, says,

<note><hi rend="italic">In Verr.</hi> ii. 5. 162.</note>
not <quote>he was beaten,</quote> but <quote>a citizen of Rome was being beaten with rods in the middle of the forum at Messana, while in the meantime no groan, no sound was heard from that wretched man amid his torture and the resounding blows except these words, 'I am a Roman citizen.' By thus calling to mind his citizenship he hoped to avert all their stripes and free his body from torture.</quote> Then Cicero with vigour, spirit and fiery indignation complains of so cruel an outrage and inspires the Romans with hatred and detestation of Verres by these words:

<note><hi rend="italic">Id.</hi> ii. 5. 163.</note>
<quote>O beloved name of liberty! O  <pb n="v2.p.225"/>  eminent justice of our country! O Porcian and Sempronian laws! O authority of the tribunes, earnestly desired and finally restored to the Roman commons! Pray, have all these blessings fallen to this estate, that a Roman citizen, in a province of the Roman people, in a town of our allies, should be bound and flogged in the forum by one who derived the emblems of his power from the favour of the Roman people? What! when fire and hot irons and other tortures were applied, although your victim's bitter lamentation and piteous outcries did not affect you, were you not moved by the tears and loud groans even of the Roman citizens who were then present?</quote></p>

<p>These outrages Marcus Tullius bewailed bitterly and solemnly, in appropriate and eloquent terms. But if anyone has so rustic and so dull an ear that this brilliant and delightful speech and the harmonious arrangement of Cicero's words do not give him pleasure; if he prefers the earlier oration because it is unadorned, concise and unstudied, yet has a certain native charm, and because it has, so to say, a shade and colour of misty antiquity—let such a one, if he has any judgment at all, study the address in a similar case of Marcus Cato, a man of a still earlier time, to whose vigour and flow of language Gracchus could never hope to attain. He will realize, I think, that Cato was not content with the eloquence of his own time, but aspired to do even then what Cicero later accomplished. For in the speech which is entitled <hi rend="italic">On Sham Battles</hi> he thus made complaint of Quintus Thermus:

<note>ix, Jordan.</note>
<quote>He said that his provisions had not been satisfactorily attended to by the decemvirs.

<note>The local magistrates.</note>
He ordered them to be stripped and scourged. The  <pb n="v2.p.227"/>  Bruttiani

<note>See § 18, below.</note>
scourged the decemvirs, many men saw it done. Who could endure such an insult, such tyranny, such slavery? No king has ever dared to act thus; shall such outrages be inflicted upon good men, born of a good family, and of good intentions? Where is the protection of our allies? Where is the honour of our forefathers? To think that you have dared to inflict signal wrongs, blows, lashes, stripes, these pains and tortures, accompanied with disgrace and extreme ignominy, since their fellow citizens and many other men looked on! But amid how great grief, what groans, what tears, what lamentations have I heard that this was done! Even slaves bitterly resent injustice; what feeling do you think that such men, sprung from good families, endowed with high character, had and will have so long as they live?</quote></p>

<p>When Cato said <quote>the Bruttiani scourged them,</quote> lest haply anyone should inquire the meaning of <hi rend="italic">Bruttiani,</hi> it is this: When Hannibal the Carthaginian was in Italy with his army, and the Romans had suffered several defeats, the Bruttii were the first people of all Italy to revolt to Hannibal. Angered at this, the Romans, after Hannibal left Italy and the Carthaginians were defeated, by way of ignominious punishment refused to enrol the Bruttii as soldiers or treat them as allies, but commanded them to serve the magistrates when they went to their provinces, and to perform the duties of slaves. Accordingly, they accompanied the magistrates in the capacity of those who are called <quote>floggers</quote> in the plays, and bound or scourged those whom they were ordered. And because they came from the land of the Bruttii,

<note>The name <hi rend="italic">Bruttium</hi> is of late origin </note>
they were called <hi rend="italic">Bruttiani.</hi></p>  <pb n="v2.p.229"/>  </div>

<p>How Publius Nigidius with great cleverness showed that words are not arbitrary, but natural.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>PUBLIUS NIGIDIUS in his <hi rend="italic">Grammatical Notes</hi> shows that nouns and verbs were formed, not by a chance use, but by a certain power and design of nature, a subject very popular in the discussions of the philosophers; for they used to inquire whether words originate by <quote>nature</quote> or are man-made.

<note>That is, whether language is a natural growth or a conscious product.</note>
Nigidius employs many arguments to this end, to show that words appear to be natural rather than arbitrary. Among these the following seems particularly neat and ingenious

<note>Fr. 41, Swoboda.</note>
: <quote>When we say <hi rend="italic">vos, or</hi> 'you,'</quote> says Nigidius, <quote>we make a movement of the mouth suitable to the meaning of the word; for we gradually protrude the tips of our lips and direct the impulse of the breath towards those with whom we are speaking. But on the other hand, when we say <hi rend="italic">nos,</hi> or 'us,' we do not pronounce the word with a powerful forward impulse of the voice, nor with the lips protruded, but we restrain our breath and our lips, so to speak, within ourselves. The same thing happens in the words <hi rend="italic">tu</hi> or 'thou,' <hi rend="italic">ego</hi> or ' I,' <hi rend="italic">tibi</hi> ' to thee,' and <hi rend="italic">mihi</hi> 'to me.' For just as when we assent or dissent, a movement of the head or eyes corresponds with the nature of the expression, so too in the pronunciation of these words there is a kind of natural gesture made with the mouth and breath. The same principle that we have noted in our own speech applies also to Greek words.</quote></p>  <pb n="v2.p.231"/>  </div>

<p>Whether <hi rend="italic">avarus</hi> is a simple word or, as it appears to Publius Nigidius, a compound, made up of two parts.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>PUBLIUS NIGIDIUS, in the twenty-ninth book of his <hi rend="italic">Commentaries,</hi>

<note>Fr. 42, Swoboda.</note>
declares that <hi rend="italic">avarus</hi> is not a simple word, but is compounded of two parts: <quote>For that man,</quote> he says, <quote>is called <hi rend="italic">avarus,</hi> or 'covetous,' who is <hi rend="italic">avidus aeris,</hi> or 'eager for money;' but in the compound the letter <hi rend="italic">e</hi> is lost.</quote> He also says

<note><hi rend="italic">Id.</hi> fr. 44.</note>
that a man is called by the compound term <hi rend="italic">locuples,</hi> or <quote>rich,</quote> when he holds <hi rend="italic">pleraque loca,</hi> that is to say, <quote>many possessions.</quote>

<note>The derivation from <hi rend="italic">locus</hi> and the root <hi rend="italic">ple-</hi> (of <hi rend="italic">pleo, plenus,</hi> etc.) seems to be correct.</note>
</p>

<p>But his statement about <hi rend="italic">locuples</hi> is the stronger and more probable. As to <hi rend="italic">avarus</hi> there is doubt; for why may it not seem to be derived from one single word, namely <hi rend="italic">aveo,</hi>

<note>This is, of course, the accepted etymology.

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>PUBLIC punishment was formerly inflicted, not only upon crimes, but even upon arrogant language; so necessary did men think it to maintain the dignity of Roman conduct inviolable. For the daughter of the celebrated Appius Caecus, when leaving the plays of  <pb n="v2.p.233"/>  which she had been a spectator, was jostled by the crowd of people that surrounded her, flocking together from all sides. When she had extricated herself, complaining that she had been roughly handled, she added: <quote>What, pray, would have become of me, and how much more should I have been crowded and pressed upon, had not my brother Publius Claudius lost his fleet in the sea-fight and with it a vast number of citizens?

<note>In 249 B.C. He was warned not to fight by the refusal of the sacred chickens to eat; but he threw them overboard, saying that they might drink, since they would not eat. See Suet. <hi rend="italic">Tib.</hi> ii. 2.</note>
Surely I should have lost my life, overwhelmed by a still greater mass of people. How I wish,</quote> said she, <quote>that my brother might come to life again, take another fleet to Sicily, and destroy that crowd which has just knocked poor me about.</quote> Because of such wicked and arrogant words, Gaius Fundanius and Tiberius Sempronius, the plebeian aediles,

<note>The two plebeian aediles were first appointed with the tribunes of the commons in 494 B.C. (see xvii. 21. 11), and the designation <hi rend="italic">plebei</hi> or <hi rend="italic">plebi</hi> was perhaps not added until the appointment of two curule aediles in 388 B.C. They were assistants to the tribunes, but also had the right of independent action, as here. Julius Caesar added two <hi rend="italic">aediles ceriales;</hi> Suet. <hi rend="italic">Jul.</hi> xli. 1.</note>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I HAVE heard that the ancient Greeks wore a ring on the finger of the left hand which is next to the little finger. They say, too, that the Roman men commonly wore their rings in that way. Apion in his <hi rend="italic">Egyptian History</hi> says

<note><hi rend="italic">F.H.G.</hi> iii. 511.</note>
that the reason for this practice is, that upon cutting into and opening human bodies, a custom in Egypt which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)natomai/,</foreign> or <quote>dissection,</quote> it was found that a very fine nerve proceeded from that finger alone of which we have spoken, and made its way to the human heart; that it therefore seemed quite reasonable that this finger in particular should be honoured with such an ornament, since it seems to be joined, and as it were united, with that supreme organ, the heart.</p>  <pb n="v2.p.239"/>  </div>

<p>The derivation and meaning of the word <hi rend="italic">mature,</hi> and that it is generally used improperly; and also that the genitive of <hi rend="italic">praecox</hi> is <hi rend="italic">praecocis</hi> and not <hi rend="italic">praecoquis.</hi></p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/><hi rend="italic">MATURE</hi> in present usage signifies <quote>hastily</quote> and <quote>quickly,</quote> contrary to the true force of the word; for <hi rend="italic">mature</hi> means quite a different thing. Therefore Publius Nigidius, a man eminent in the pursuit of all the liberal arts, says:

<note>Fr. 48, Swoboda.</note>
<quote><hi rend="italic">Mature</hi> means neither 'too soon' nor 'too late,' but something between the two and intermediate.</quote></p>

<p>Publius Nigidius has spoken well and properly. For of grain and fruits those are called <hi rend="italic">matura,</hi> or <quote>mature,</quote> which are neither unripe and hard, nor falling and decayed, but full-grown and ripened in their proper time. But since that which was not done negligently was said to be done <hi rend="italic">mature,</hi> the force of the word has been greatly extended, and an act is now said to be done <hi rend="italic">mature</hi> which is done with some haste, and not one which is done without negligence; whereas such things as are immoderately hastened are more properly called <hi rend="italic">inmatura,</hi> or <quote>untimely.</quote></p>

<p>That limitation of the word, and of the action itself, which was made by Nigidius was very elegantly expressed by the deified Augustus with two Greek words; for we are told that he used to say in conversation, and write in his letters, <foreign xml:lang="grc">speu=de brade/ws,</foreign> that is, <quote>make haste slowly,</quote>

<note>See Suetonius, <hi rend="italic">Aug.</hi> xxv. 4. Hence the common <hi rend="italic">festina lente</hi> and German <hi rend="italic">Eile mit Weile.</hi></note>
by which he recommended that to accomplish a result we should use at once the promptness of energy and the delay of carefulness, and it is from these two opposite qualities that <hi rend="italic">maturitas</hi> springs. Virgil also, to one  <pb n="v2.p.241"/>  who is observant, has skilfully distinguished the two words <hi rend="italic">properare</hi> and <hi rend="italic">maturare</hi> as clearly opposite, in these verses:

<note><hi rend="italic">Goorg.</hi> i. 259 ff.; Dryden's translation.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Whenever winter's rains the hind confine,</l> <l>Much is there that at leisure may be done (<hi rend="italic">maturare</hi>),</l> <l>Which in fair weather he must hurry on (<hi rend="italic">properanda</hi>).</l></quote>  Most elegantly has he distinguished between those two words; for in rural life the preparations during rainy weather may be made at leisure, since one has time for them; but in fine weather, since time presses, one must hasten.</p>

<p>But when we wish to indicate that anything has been done under too great pressure and too hurriedly, then it is more properly said to have been done <hi rend="italic">praemature,</hi> or <quote>prematurely,</quote> than <hi rend="italic">mature.</hi> Thus Afranius in his Italian play called <hi rend="italic">The Title</hi> says:

<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>With madness premature (<hi rend="italic">praemature</hi>) you seek a hasty power.</l></quote>  In this verse it is to be observed that he says <hi rend="italic">praecocem</hi> and not <hi rend="italic">praecoquem;</hi> for the nominative case is not <hi rend="italic">praecoquis,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">praecox.</hi></p>  </div>

<p>Of extravagant tales which Plinius Secundus most unjustly ascribes to the philosopher Democritus; and also about the flying image of a dove.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>PLINY THE ELDER, in the twenty-eighth book of his <hi rend="italic">Natural History</hi> asserts

<note>xxviii. 112.</note>
that there is a book of that  <pb n="v2.p.243"/>  most famous philosopher Democritus <hi rend="italic">On the Power and Nature of the Chameleon,</hi> and that he had read it; and then he transmits to us many foolish and intolerable absurdities, alleging that they were written by Democritus. Of these unwillingly, since they disgust me, I recall a few, as follows: that the hawk, the swiftest of all birds, if it chance to fly over a chameleon which is crawling on the ground, is dragged down and falls through some force to the earth, and offers and gives itself up of its own accord to be torn to pieces by the other birds. Another statement too is past human belief, namely, that if the head and neck of the chameleon be burned by means of the wood which is called oak, rain and thunder are suddenly produced, and that this same thing is experienced if the liver of that animal is burned upon the roof of a house. There is also another story, which by heaven! I hesitated about putting down, so preposterous is it; but I have made it a rule that we ought to speak our mind about the fallacious seduction of marvels of that kind, by which the keenest minds are often deceived and led to their ruin, and in particular those which are especially eager for knowledge. But I return to Pliny. He says

<note>xxviii. 115.</note>
that the left foot of the chameleon is roasted with an iron heated in the fire, along with an herb called by the same name, <quote>chameleon</quote>; both are mixed in an ointment, formed into a paste, and put in a wooden vessel. He who carries the vessel, even if he go openly amid a throng, can be seen by no one.</p>

<p>I think that these marvellous and false stories written by Plinius Secundus are not worthy of the name of Democritus; the same is true of what the same Pliny, in his tenth book, asserts

<note>x. 137.</note>
that <pb n="v2.p.245"/> Democritus wrote; namely, that there were certain birds with a language of their own, and that by mixing the blood of those birds a serpent was produced; that whoso ate it would understand the language of birds and their conversation.</p>

<p>Many fictions of this kind seem to have been attached to the name of Democritus by ignorant men, who sheltered themselves under his reputation and authority. But that which Archytas the Pythagorean is said to have devised and accomplished ought to seem no less marvellous, but yet not wholly absurd. For not only many eminent Greeks, but also the philosopher Favorinus, a most diligent searcher of ancient records, have stated most positively that Archytas made a wooden model of a dove with such mechanical ingenuity and art that it flew; so nicely balanced was it, you see, with weights and moved by a current of air enclosed and hidden within it. About so improbable a story I prefer to give Favorinus' own words: <quote>Archytas the Tarentine, being in other lines also a mechanician, made a flying dove out of wood. Whenever it lit, it did not rise again. For until this... .</quote>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>CEREMONIES in great number are imposed upon the priest of Jupiter

<note>The <hi rend="italic">flamen</hi> was the special priest of an individual deity. There were three <hi rend="italic">flamines maiores</hi>—of Jupiter (<hi rend="italic">Dialis</hi>), Mars and Quirinus—and twelve <hi rend="italic">flamines minores.</hi> For <quote>taboos</quote> imposed on priests see Frazer, <hi rend="italic">Golden Bough,</hi> ch. 2.</note>
and also many abstentions, of which we read in the books written <hi rend="italic">On the Public Priests;</hi> and they are also recorded in the first book of Fabius Pictor.

<note>Fr. 19, 24, 35, 46, R. Peter; fr. 3, Huschke; <hi rend="italic">id.</hi> Bremer (i, p. 10).</note>
Of these the following are in general what I remember: It is unlawful for the priest of Jupiter to ride upon a horse; it is also unlawful for him to see the <quote>classes

<note><hi rend="italic">Classis</hi> originally meant one of the classes into which the citizens were divided by the Servian constitution, then, collectively, the army composed of the classes.</note>
arrayed</quote> outside the pomerium,

<note>The pomerium was the religious boundary of the city; see xiii. 14.</note>
that is, the army in battle array; hence the priest of Jupiter is rarely made consul, since wars were entrusted to the consuls; also it is always unlawful for the priest to take an oath; likewise to wear a ring, unless it be perforated and without a gem. It is against the law for fire to be taken from the <hi rend="italic">flaminia,</hi> that is, from the home of the flamen  <pb n="v2.p.251"/>  Dialis, except for a sacred rite; if a person in fetters enter his house, he must be loosed, the bonds must be drawn up through the <hi rend="italic">impluvium</hi>

<note>The opening in the roof of the <hi rend="italic">atrium</hi> or main room of a Roman house.</note>
to the roof and from there let down into the street. He has no knot in his head-dress, girdle, or any other part of his dress; if anyone is being taken to be flogged and falls at his feet as a suppliant, it is unlawful for the man to be flogged on that day. Only a free man may cut the hair of the Dialis. It is not customary for the Dialis to touch, or even name, a she-goat, raw flesh, ivy, and beans.</p>

<p>The priest of Jupiter must not pass under an arbour of vines. The feet of the couch on which he sleeps must be smeared with a thin coating of clay, and he must not sleep away from this bed for three nights in succession, and no other person must sleep in that bed. At the foot of his bed there should be a box with sacrificial cakes. The cuttings of the nails and hair of the Dialis must be buried in the earth under a fruitful tree. Every day is a holy day for the Dialis. He must not be in the open air without his cap; that he might go without it in the house has only recently been decided by the pontiffs, so Masurius Sabinus wrote,

<note>Fr. 28, Huschke; <hi rend="italic">Memor.</hi> 16, Bremer (ii, p. 372).</note>
and it is said that some other ceremonies have been remitted and he has been excused from observing them.</p>

<p><quote>The priest of Jupiter</quote> must not touch any bread fermented with yeast. He does not lay off his inner tunic except under cover, in order that he may not be naked in the open air, as it were under the eye of Jupiter. No other has a place at table above the flamen Dialis, except the <hi rend="italic">rex sacrificulus.</hi>

<note>The priest who succeeded the kings, after their expulsion, in presiding over the sacrifices. Although he nominally outranked the flamens and the pontifex maximus, the office was unimportant.</note>
If the  <pb n="v2.p.253"/>  Dialis has lost his wife he abdicates his office. The marriage of the priest cannot be dissolved except by death. He never enters a place of burial, he never touches a dead body; but he is not forbidden to attend a funeral.</p>

<p>The ceremonies of the priestess of Jupiter are about the same; they say that she observes other separate ones: for example, that she wears a dyed robe, that she has a twig from a fruitful tree in her head-dress, that it is forbidden for her to go up more than three rounds of a ladder, except the so called Greek ladders;

<note>What these were is uncertain. Probably they offered less exposure of the person than an ordinary ladder.</note>
also, when she goes to the Argei,

<note>The term <hi rend="italic">Argei</hi> was applied to twenty-four chapels distributed among the four regions of early Rome, and also called <hi rend="italic">Sacella Argeiorum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Argea.</hi> It also designated the same number of puppets, or bundles of straw in the shape of men, which were thrown from the <hi rend="italic">Pons Sublicius</hi> into the Tiber by the Vestal virgins on the Ides of May. See Fowler, <hi rend="italic">Roman Festivals,</hi> pp. 111 ff. and <hi rend="italic">Thes. Ling. Lat. s.v. Argei.</hi></note>
that she neither combs her head nor dresses her hair.</p>

<p>I have added the words of the praetor in his standing edict concerning the flamen Dialis and the priestess of Vesta:

<note><hi rend="italic">Fontes Jur. Rom.,</hi> p. 197.</note>
<quote>In the whole of my jurisdiction I will not compel the flamen of Jupiter or a priestess of Vesta to take an oath.</quote> The words of Marcus Varro about the flamen Dialis, in the second book of his <hi rend="italic">Divine Antiquities,</hi> are as follows:

a passage in Virgil's sixth book and thinks that he would have corrected it. Palinurus is in the Lower World, begging Aeneas to take care that his body be found and buried. His words are:

<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>O save me from these ills, unconquered one;</l> <l>Or throw thou earth upon me, for you can,</l> <l>And to the port of Velia return.</l></quote>  <quote>How,</quote> said he, <quote>could either Palinurus know and name 'the port of Velia,' or Aeneas find the place from that name, when the town of Velia, from which he has called the harbour in that place 'Veline' was founded in the Lucanian district and called by that name when Servius Tullius was reigning in Rome,

<note>578—534 B.C., traditional chronology.</note>
more than six hundred years after Aeneas came to Italy? For of those,</quote> he adds, <quote>who were driven from the land of Phocis

<note>Phocis, a district of Greece west of Boeotia, was confused by Hyginus with Phocaea, a city on the western coast of Asia Minor.</note>
by Harpalus,

<note>Probably an error for Harpagus.</note>
prefect of king Cyrus, some founded Velia, and others Massilia. Most absurdly, then, does Palinurus ask Aeneas to seek out the Veline port, when at that time no such name existed anywhere. Nor ought that to be considered a similar error,</quote> said he, <quote>which occurs in the first book:

<note><hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> i. 2.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Exiled by fate, to Italy fared and to Lavinian strand,</l></quote>  <pb n="v2.p.257"/>  and similarly in the sixth book:

<note><hi rend="italic">Alen.</hi> vi. 17.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>At last stood lightly poised on the Chalcidian height,</l></quote>  since it is usually allowed the poet himself to mention, <foreign xml:lang="grc">kata\ pro/lhyin,</foreign> 'by anticipation,' in his own person some historical facts which took place later and of which he himself could know; just as Virgil knew the town of Lavinium and the colony from Calchis. But how could Palinurus,</quote> he said, <quote>know of events that occurred six hundred years later, unless anyone believes that in the Lower World he had the power of divination, as in fact the souls of the deceased commonly do? But even if you understand it in that way, although nothing of the kind is said, yet how could Aeneas, who did not have the power of divination, seek out the Veline port, the name of which at that time, as we have said before, was not in existence anywhere?</quote></p>

<p>He also censures the following passage in the same book, and thinks that Virgil would have corrected it, had not death prevented: <quote>For,</quote> says He, <quote>when he had named Theseus among those who had visited the Lower World and returned, and had said:

<note><hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> vi. 122.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>But why name Theseus? why Alcides great?</l> <l>And my race too is from almighty Jove,</l></quote>  he nevertheless adds afterwards:

<note><hi rend="italic">Aen.vi.</hi> 617.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Unhappy Theseus sits, will sit for aye.</l></quote>  But how,</quote> says he, <quote>could it happen that one should sit for ever in the Lower World whom the poet mentions before among those who went down there and returned again, especially when the story of  <pb n="v2.p.259"/>  Theseus says that Hercules tore him from the rock and led him to the light of the Upper World?</quote></p>

<p>He also says that Virgil erred in these lines:

<note><hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> vi. 838. The rendering is by Rhoades, except for <quote>spotless</quote> in the last line.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>He Argos and Mycenae shall uproot,</l> <l>City of Agamemnon, and the heir</l> <l>Of Aeacus himself, from war-renowned</l> <l>Achilles sprung,

<note>Neoptolemus, also called Pyrrus (or Pyrrhus), the son of Achilles and Deidameia.</note>
his ancestors of Troy</l> <l>Avenging and Minerva's spotless shrine.

<note>Probably either Gellius or Hyginus misquotes Virgil. With their version we have a transfer of the epithet <hi rend="italic">intemerata</hi> from Minerva to her shrine.</note>
</l></quote>  <quote>He has confounded,</quote> says Hyginus, <quote>different persons and times. For the wars with the Achaeans and with Pyrrus were not waged at the same time nor by the same men. For Pyrrus, whom he calls a descendant of Aeacus, having crossed over from Epirus into Italy, waged war with the Romans against Manius Curius, who was their leader in that war.

<note>280—275 B.C.</note>
But the Argive, that is, the Achaean war, was carried on many years after under the lead of Lucius Mummius.

<note>146 B.C.</note>

<p>Why and how the philosopher Democritus deprived himself of his eye-sight; and the very fine and elegant verses of Laberius on that subject.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>IT is written in the records of Grecian story that the philosopher Democritus, a man worthy of  <pb n="v2.p.261"/>  reverence beyond all others and of the highest authority, of his own accord deprived himself of eyesight, because he believed that the thoughts and meditations of his mind in examining nature's laws would be more vivid and exact, if he should free them from the allurements of sight and the distractions offered by the eyes. This act of his, and the manner too in which he easily blinded himself by a most ingenious device, the poet Laberius has described, in a farce called <hi rend="italic">The Ropemaker,</hi> in very elegant and finished verses; but he has imagined another reason for voluntary blindness and applied it with no little neatness to his own subject. For the character who speaks these lines in Laberius is a rich and stingy miser, lamenting in vigorous terms the excessive extravagance and dissipation of his young son.

<p>The story of Artemisia; and of the contest at the tomb of Mausolus in which celebrated writers took part.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>ARTEMISIA is said to have loved her husband Mausolus with a love surpassing all the tales of passion and beyond one's conception of human <pb n="v2.p.263"/> affection. Now Mausolus, as Marcus Tullius tells us,

<note><hi rend="italic">Tusc. Disp.</hi> iii. 75.</note>
was king of the land of Caria; according to some Greek historians he was governor of a province, the official whom the Greeks term a satrap. When this Mausolus had met his end amid the lamentations and in the arms of his wife,

<note>In 353 B.C.</note>
and had been buried with a magnificent funeral, Artemisia, inflamed with grief and with longing for her spouse, mingled his bones and ashes with spices, ground them into the form of a powder, put them in water, and drank them; and she is said to have given many other proofs of the violence of her passion. For perpetuating the memory of her husband, she also erected, with great expenditure of labour, that highly celebrated tomb,

<note>The famous Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, adorned by Scopas, Bryaxis, Timotheus and Leochares with sculptures, the remains of which are now in the British Museum. It was a square building, 140 feet high, surrounded by Ionic columns. It stood upon a lofty base and was surmounted by a pyramid of steps ending in a platform, on which was a four-horse chariot. The term <hi rend="italic">mausoleum</hi> was applied by the Romans to large and magnificent tombs such as the mausoleum of Augustus and that of Hadrian.</note>
which has been deemed worthy of being numbered among the seven wonders of the world.

<note>The other six <quote>wonders</quote> were: The walls and hanging gardens of Babylon; the temple of Diana at Ephesus; the statue of Olympian Zeus by Phidias; the Pyramids; and the Pharos, or lighthouse, at Alexandria.</note>
When Artemisia dedicated this monument, consecrated to the deified shades of Mausolus, she instituted an <hi rend="italic">agon,</hi> that is to say, a contest in celebrating his praises, offering magnificent prizes of money and other valuables. Three men distinguished for their eminent talent and eloquence are said to have come to contend in this eulogy, Theopompus, Theodectes

<note>The more approved spelling is Theodectas; see <hi rend="italic">C.I.G.</hi> ii. 977.</note>
and Naucrates; some have even written that Isocrates himself entered the lists with them. But Theopompus was adjudged the victor in that contest. He was a pupil of Isocrates.</p>  <pb n="v2.p.265"/>

<p>The tragedy of Theodectes, entitled <hi rend="italic">Mausolus,</hi> is still extant to-day; and that in it Theodectes was more pleasing than in his prose writings is the opinion of Hyginus in his <hi rend="italic">Examples.</hi>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THE philosopher Taurus once reproved a young man with severe and vigorous censure because he had turned from the rhetoricians and the study of eloquence to the pursuit of philosophy, declaring that he had done something dishonourable and shameful. Now the young man did not deny the allegation, but urged in his defence that it was commonly done and tried to justify the baseness of the fault by citing examples and by the excuse of custom. And then Taurus, being the more irritated by the very nature of his defence, said: <quote>Foolish and worthless fellow, if the authority and rules of philosophy do not deter you from following bad examples, does not even the saying of your own celebrated Demosthenes occur to you? For since it is couched in a polished and graceful form of words, it might, like a sort of rhetorical catch, the more easily remain fixed in your memory. For,</quote> said he, <quote>if I do not forget what as a matter of fact I read in my early youth, these are the words of Demosthenes, spoken against one who, as you now do, tried to justify and excuse his own sin by those of others:

For just as, if anyone had suffered a penalty for it, you would not have proposed this, so if you suffer punishment now, no one else will propose it.'</quote> Thus did Taurus, by the use of every kind of persuasion and admonition, incline his disciples to the principles of a virtuous and blameless manner of life.</p>  </div>

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I HEAR it asked what the meaning is of <hi rend="italic">lex, plebisscitum, rogatio,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">privilegium.</hi> Ateius Capito, a man highly skilled in public and private law, defined the meaning of <hi rend="italic">lex</hi> in these words:

<note>Fr. 22, Huschke; <hi rend="italic">Coniect.</hi> fr. 13, Bremer.</note>
<quote>A law,</quote> said he, <quote>is a general decree of the people, or of the commons, answering an appeal

<note>That is, a <hi rend="italic">royatio.</hi></note>
made to them by a magistrate.</quote> If this definition is correct, neither the appeal for Pompey's military command, nor about the recall of Cicero, nor as to the murder or Clodius, nor any similar decrees of the people of commons, can be called laws. For they are not general decrees, and they are framed with regard, not to the whole body of citizens, but to individuals. Hence they ought rather to be called <hi rend="italic">privilegia,</hi> or <quote>privileges,</quote> since the ancients used <hi rend="italic">priva</hi> where we now use <hi rend="italic">singula</hi> (private or individual). This word Lucilius used in the first book of his <hi rend="italic">Satires:</hi>

<note>v. 49, Marx.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>I'll give them, when they come, each his own (<hi rend="italic">priva</hi>) piece</l> <l>Of tunny belly and acarne

<note>The <hi rend="italic">acarne</hi> was a kind of sea-fish.</note>
heads.</l></quote></p>  <pb n="v2.p.269"/>

<p>Capito, however, in the same definition divided

<note>Fr. 23, Huschke; 14, Bremer.</note>
the <hi rend="italic">plebes,</hi>

<note>The older form of the nominative <hi rend="italic">plebs.</hi></note>
or <quote>commons,</quote> from the <hi rend="italic">populus,</hi> or <quote>people,</quote> since in the term <quote>people</quote> are embraced every part of the state and all its orders, but <quote>commons</quote> is properly applied to that part in which the patrician families of the citizens are not included. Therefore, according to Capito, a <hi rend="italic">plebisscitum</hi> is a law which the commons, and not the people, adopt.</p>

<p>But the head itself, the origin, and as it were the fount of this whole process of law is the <hi rend="italic">rogatio,</hi> whether the appeal (<hi rend="italic">rogatio</hi>) is to the people or to the commons, on a matter relating to all or to individuals. For all the words under discussion are understood and included in the fundamental principle and name of <hi rend="italic">rogatio;</hi> for unless the people or commons be appealed to (<hi rend="italic">rogetur</hi>), no decree of the people or commons can be passed.</p>

<p>But although all this is true, yet in the old records we observe that no great distinction is made among the words in question. For the common term <hi rend="italic">lex</hi> is used both of decrees of the commons and of <quote>privileges,</quote> and all are called by the indiscriminate and inexact name <hi rend="italic">rogatio.</hi></p>

<p>Even Sallust, who is most observant of propriety in the use of words, has yielded to custom and applied the term <quote>law</quote> to the <quote>privilege</quote> which was passed with reference to the return of Gnaeus Pompeius. The passage, from the second book of his <hi rend="italic">Histories,</hi> reads as follows:

<note>ii. 21, Maur.</note>

<p>Why Marcus Cicero very scrupulously avoided any use of the words novissime and novissimus.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>IT is clear that Marcus Cicero was unwilling to use many a word which is now in general circulation, and was so in his time, because he did not approve of them; for instance, <hi rend="italic">novissimus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">novissine.</hi> For although both Marcus Cato

<note>Fr. inc. 51, Jordan.</note>
and Sallust,

<note><hi rend="italic">Cat.</hi> xxxiii. 2; <hi rend="italic">Jug.</hi> x. 2; xix. 7, etc.</note>
as well as others also of the same period, have used that word generally, and although many men besides who were not without learning wrote it in their books, yet he seems to have abstained from it, on the ground that it was not good Latin, since Lucius Aelius Stilo,

<note>p. 53, 15, Fun.</note>
who was the most learned man of his time, had avoided its use, as that of a novel and improper word.</p>

<p>Moreover, what Marcus Varro too thought of that word I have deemed it fitting to show from his own words in the sixth book of his <hi rend="italic">De Lingua Latina,</hi> dedicated to Cicero:

<note>vii. 59.</note>
<quote>What used to be called <hi rend="italic">extremum</hi> or 'last,'</quote> says he, <quote>is beginning to be called generally <hi rend="italic">novissimum,</hi> a word which within my own memory both Aelius and several old men avoided as too new a term; as to its origin, just as from <hi rend="italic">vetus</hi> we have <hi rend="italic">vetustior</hi> and <hi rend="italic">veterrimus,</hi> so from <hi rend="italic">novus</hi> we get <hi rend="italic">novior</hi> and <hi rend="italic">novissimus.</hi></quote>

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>PLATO, a man most devoted to the truth and most ready to point it out to all, has said truly and nobly, though not from the mouth of a dignified or suitable character, all that in general may be said against those idle and worthless fellows, who, sheltered under the name of philosophy, follow profitless idleness and darkness of speech and life. For although Callicles, whom he makes his speaker, being ignorant of true philosophy, heaps dishonourable and undeserved abuse upon philosophers, yet what he says is to be taken in such a way that we may gradually come to understand it as a warning to ourselves not to deserve such reproofs, and not by idle and foolish sloth to feign the pursuit and cultivation of philosophy.</p>

<quote>Philosophy, Socrates, is indeed a nice thing, if one pursue it in youth with moderation; but if one occupy oneself with it longer than is proper, it is a corrupter of men. For even if a man be well endowed by nature and follow philosophy when past his youth, he must necessarily be ignorant of all those things in which a man ought to be versed if he is to be honourable, good and of high repute. For such men are ignorant both of the laws relating to the city, and of the language which  <pb n="v2.p.275"/>  it is necessary to use in the intercourse of human society, both privately and publicly, and of the pleasures and desires of human life; in brief, they are wholly unacquainted with manners. Accordingly, when they engage in any private or public business, they become a laughing-stock; just exactly as statesmen, I suppose, become ridiculous when they enter into your debates and discussions.</quote></p>

<p>A little later he adds the following: "But I think it best to take part in both. It is good to pursue philosophy merely as a matter of education, and to be a philosopher is not dishonourable when one is young; but when one who is already older persists in the business, the thing becomes laughable, Socrates, and I for my part feel the same towards those who philosophize as towards those who lisp and play. Whenever I see a little boy, to whom it is fitting to speak thus, lisping and playing, I am pleased, and it seems to me becoming and liberal and suited to the age of childhood; but when I hear a small boy speaking with precision, it seems to me to be a disagreeable thing; it wounds my ears and appears to be something befitting a slave. When, however, one hears a man lisping, or sees him playing, it appears ridiculous, unmanly and deserving of stripes. I feel just the same way towards the philosophers When I see philosophy in a young man, I rejoice; it seems to me fitting, and I think that the young man in question is ingenuous; that he who does not study philosophy is not ingenuous and will never himself be worthy of anything noble or generous. But when I see an older man still philosophizing and not giving it up, such a man, Socrates, seems to me to deserve stripes. For, as I have just said, it is possible for such a man, even  <pb n="v2.p.277"/>  though naturally well endowed, to become unmanly, avoiding the business of the city and the marketplace, where, as the poet says,

<note>Homer, <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> ix. 441 f. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ou)/pw ei)do/q' o(moii/ou pole/moio Ou)d' a)gore/wn, i(/na t' a)/ndres a)riprepe/es tele/qousin.</foreign></note>
men become <quote>most eminent,</quote> and living the rest of his life in hiding with young men, whispering in a corner with three or four of them, but never accomplishing anything liberal, great or satisfactory."</p>

<p>These sentiments, as I have said, Plato put into the mouth of a man of no great worth indeed, yet possessing a reputation for common sense and understanding and a kind of uncompromising frankness. He does not, of course, refer to that philosophy which is the teacher of all the virtues, which excels in the discharge of public and private duties alike, and which, if nothing prevents, governs cities and the State with firmness, courage and wisdom; but rather to that futile and childish attention to trifles which contributes nothing to the conduct and guidance of life, but in which people of that kind grow old in <quote>ill-timed playmaking,</quote>

<p>A passage from a speech of Marcus Cato on the mode of life and manners of women of the olden time; and also that the husband had the right to kill his wife, if she were taken in adultery.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Those who have written about the life and civilization of the Roman people say that the women of Rome and Latium <quote>lived an abstemious life</quote>; that  <pb n="v2.p.279"/>  is, that they abstained altogether from wine, which in the early language was called <hi rend="italic">temetum;</hi> that it was an established custom for them to kiss their kinsfolk for the purpose of detection, so that, if they had been drinking, the odour might betray them. But they say that the women were accustomed to drink the second brewing, raisin wine, spiced wine

<note>Flavoured with myrrh.</note>
and other sweet-tasting drinks of that kind. And these things are indeed made known in those books which I have mentioned, but Marcus Cato declares that women were not only censured but also punished by a judge no less severely if they had drunk wine than if they had disgraced themselves by adultery.</p>

<p>I have copied Marcus Cato's words from the oration entitled <hi rend="italic">On the Dowry,</hi> in which it is also stated that husbands had the right to kill wives taken in adultery:

<note>p. 68. 3, Jordan.</note>
<quote>When a husband puts away his wife,</quote> says he, <quote>he judges the woman as a censor would, and has full powers if she has been guilty of any wrong or shameful act; she is severely punished if she has drunk wine; if she has done wrong with another man, she is condemned to death.</quote> Further, as to the right to put her to death it was thus written: <quote>If you should take your wife in adultery, you may with impunity put her to death without a trial; but if you should commit adultery or indecency, she must not presume to lay a finger on you, nor does the law allow it.</quote></p>  <pb n="v2.p.281"/>  </div>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I HEAR <hi rend="italic">die quarto</hi> and <hi rend="italic">die quinto,</hi> which the Greeks express by <foreign xml:lang="grc">ei)s teta/rthn kai\ ei)s pe/mpthn,</foreign> used nowadays even by learned men, and one who speaks otherwise is looked down upon as crude and illiterate. But in the time of Marcus Tullius, and earlier, they did not, I think, speak in that way; for they used <hi rend="italic">diequinte</hi> and <hi rend="italic">diequinti</hi> as a compound adverb, with the second syllable of the word shortened. The deified Augustus, too, who was well versed in the Latin tongue and an imitator of his father's

<note>That is, his adoptive father, Julius Caesar.</note>

<note>p. 145, Weichert.</note>
used that means of designating the days. But it will be sufficient to show the undeviating usage of the men of old, if I quote the regular formula of the praetor, in which, according to the usage of our forefathers, he is accustomed to proclaim the festival known as the Compitalia.

<note>A movable festival, celebrated between Dec. 15 and Jan. 5, at cross-roads, in honour of the <hi rend="italic">Lares compitales.</hi></note>
His words are as follows: <quote>On the ninth day the Roman people, the Quirites, will celebrate the Compitalia; when they shall have begun, legal business ceases.</quote> The praetor says <hi rend="italic">dienoni,</hi> not <hi rend="italic">die nono.</hi></p>

<p>And not the praetor alone, but almost all antiquity, spoke in that way. Look you, this passage of the well-known poet Pomponius comes to my mind, from the Atellan farce entitled <hi rend="italic">Mevia:</hi>

<note>ii, 77, Ribbeck.<hi rend="sup">3</hi></note>

<quote>If you are willing to give me the cavalry and follow me yourself with the rest of the army, on the fifth day (<hi rend="italic">diequinti</hi>) I will have your dinner ready for you in the Capitol at Rome.</quote>

<note>Said to Hannibal by his officer Maharbal after the battle of Cannae, 216 B.C.</note>
But Coelius took both the story itself and the word from the fourth book of Marcus Cato's <hi rend="italic">Origines,</hi> where we find the following:

<note>Fr. 86, Peter<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
<quote>Then the master of the horse thus advised the Carthaginian dictator: 'Send me to Rome with the cavalry; on the fifth day (<hi rend="italic">diequinti</hi>) your dinner shall be ready for you in the Capitol.'</quote></p>

<p>The final syllable of that word I find written sometimes with <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and sometimes with <hi rend="italic">i;</hi> for it was usual with those men of olden times very often to use those letters without distinction, saying <hi rend="italic">praefiscine</hi> and <hi rend="italic">praefiscini, proclivi</hi> and <hi rend="italic">proclive,</hi> and using many other words of that kind with either ending; in the same way too they said <hi rend="italic">die pristini,</hi> that is, <quote>the day before,</quote> which is commonly expressed by <hi rend="italic">pridie,</hi> changing the order of the words in the compound, as if it were <hi rend="italic">pristino die.</hi> Also by a similar usage they said <hi rend="italic">die crastini,</hi> meaning <hi rend="italic">crastino die</hi> or <quote>to-morrow.</quote> The priests of the Roman people, too, when they make a proclamation for the third day, say <hi rend="italic">diem perendini.</hi> But just as very many people said <hi rend="italic">die pristini,</hi> so Marcus Cato in his oration <hi rend="italic">Against Furius</hi>

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>ONCE upon a time, when I was riding in a carriage, to keep my mind from being dull and unoccupied and a prey to worthless trifles, it chanced to occur to me to try to recall the names of weapons, darts and swords which are found in the early histories, and also the various kinds of boats and their names. Those, then, of the former that came to mind at the time are the following: spear, pike, fire-pike, half-pike, iron bolt, Gallic spear, lance, hunting-darts, javelins, long bolts, barbed-javelins, German spears, thonged-javelin, Gallic bolt, broadswords, poisoned arrows,

Illyrian hunting-spears, cimeters, darts, swords, daggers, broadswords, double-edged swords, small-swords, poniards, cleavers.</p>

<p>Of the <hi rend="italic">lingula,</hi> or <quote>little tongue,</quote> since it is less common, I think I ought to say that the ancients applied that term to an oblong small-sword, made in the form of a tongue; it is mentioned by Naevius in his tragedy <hi rend="italic">Hesione.</hi> I quote the line:

<note>Fr. 1, Ribbeck<hi rend="sup">3</hi>, who gives the title as <hi rend="italic">Aesiona.</hi> There is of course a word-play on <hi rend="italic">lingula.</hi></note>

<!--<argument>-->

<p>That Asinius Pollio showed ignorance in criticizing Sallust because he used <hi rend="italic">transgressus</hi> (crossing) for <hi rend="italic">transfretatio</hi> (crossing the sea) and <hi rend="italic">trangressi</hi> (those who had crossed) for <hi rend="italic">qui transfretaverant</hi> (those who had crossed the sea).</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>ASINIUS POLLIO, in a letter which he addressed to Plancus, and certain others who were unfriendly to Gaius Sallustius, thought that Sallust deserved censure because in the first book of his <hi rend="italic">Histories</hi> he called the crossing of the sea and a passage made in ships <hi rend="italic">transgresses,</hi> using <hi rend="italic">transgressi</hi> of those who had crossed the sea, for which the usual term is <hi rend="italic">transfretare.</hi> I give Sallust's own words:

<note><hi rend="italic">Hist.</hi> i. 104, Maur.</note>
<quote>Accordingly Sertorius, having left a small garrison in Mauretania and taking advantage of a dark night and a favourable tide, tried either by secrecy or speed to avoid a battle while crossing (<hi rend="italic">in transgressu</hi>).</quote> Then later he wrote:

<note><hi rend="italic">ib.</hi> i. 105.</note>
<quote>When they had crossed (<hi rend="italic">transgressos), a</hi> mountain which had been seized in advance by the Lusitanians gave them all shelter.</quote></p>

<p>This, they say, is an improper and careless usage, supported by no adequate authority. <quote>For <hi rend="italic">transgressus,</hi></quote> says Pollio, <quote>comes from <hi rend="italic">transgredi,</hi> 'to step  <pb n="v2.p.289"/>  across,' and this word itself refers to walking and stepping with the feet.</quote> Therefore Pollio thought that the verb <hi rend="italic">transgredi</hi> did not apply to those who fly or creep or sail, but only to those who walk and measure the way with their feet. Hence they say that in no good writer can <hi rend="italic">transgressus</hi> be found applied to ships, or as the equivalent of transfretatio.</p>

<p>But, since <hi rend="italic">cursus,</hi> or <quote>running,</quote> is often correctly used of ships, I ask why it is that ships may not be said to make a <hi rend="italic">transgressus,</hi> especially since the small extent of the narrow strait which flows between Spain and the Afric land is most elegantly described by the word <hi rend="italic">transgressio,</hi> as being a distance of only a few steps. But as to those who ask for authority and assert that <hi rend="italic">ingredi</hi> or <hi rend="italic">transgredi</hi> has not been used of sailing, I should like them to tell me how much difference they think there is between <hi rend="italic">ingredi,</hi> or <quote>march,</quote> and <hi rend="italic">ambulare,</hi> or <quote>walk.</quote> Yet Cato in his book <hi rend="italic">On Farming</hi> says:

<note>i. 3.</note>
<quote>A farm should be chosen in a situation where there is a large town near by and the sea, or a river where ships pass (<hi rend="italic">ambulant</hi>).</quote> Moreover Lucretius, by the use of this same expression, bears testimony that such figures are intentional and are regarded as ornaments of diction. For in his fourth book he speaks of a shout as <quote>marching</quote> (<hi rend="italic">gradientem</hi>) through the windpipe and jaws, which is much bolder than the Sallustian expression about the ships. The lines of Lucretius are as follows:

<note>iv. 526.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>The voice besides doth often scrape the throat;</l> <l>A shout forth marching (<hi rend="italic">gradiens</hi>) doth make the windpipe rough.</l></quote></p>  <pb n="v2.p.291"/>

<p>Accordingly, Sallust, in the same book, uses <hi rend="italic">progressus,</hi> not only of those who sailed in ships, but also of floating skiffs. I have added his own words about the skiffs:

<note><hi rend="italic">Hist.</hi> i. 98, Maur.</note>
<quote>Some of them, after going (<hi rend="italic">progressae</hi>) but a little way, the load being excessive and unstable, when panic had thrown the passengers into disorder, began to sink.</quote></p>  </div>

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>IT is stated in ancient records that the strength, the spirit and the numbers of the Roman and the Carthaginian people were once equal. And this opinion was not without foundation. With other nations the contest was for the independence of one or the other state, with the Carthaginians it was for the rule of the world.</p>

<p>An indication of this is found in the following word and act of each of the two peoples: Quintus Fabius, a Roman general, delivered a letter to the Carthaginians, in which it was written that the Roman people had sent them a spear and a herald's staff, signs respectively of war and peace; they might choose whichever they pleased and regard the one which they should choose as sent them by the Roman people. The Carthaginians replied that they chose neither one; those who had brought them might leave whichever they liked; that whatever should be left them they would consider that they themselves had chosen.</p>

<p>Marcus Varro, however, says that neither the spear itself nor the staff itself was sent, but two  <pb n="v2.p.293"/>  tokens, on one of which was engraved the representation of a staff; on the other that of a spear.</p>  </div>

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>TIMAEUS, in the <hi rend="italic">History</hi>

<note><hi rend="italic">F.H.G.</hi> i. 195, Müller </note>
which he composed in the Greek language about the affairs of the Roman people, and Marcus Varro in his <hi rend="italic">Human Antiquities,</hi>

<note>x. f. 1, Mirsch.</note>
wrote that the land of Italy derived its name from a Greek word, oxen in the old Greek tongue being called <foreign xml:lang="grc">i)taloi/</foreign>; for in Italy there was a great abundance of cattle, and in that land pastures are numerous and grazing is a frequent employment.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we may infer that it was for the same reason—namely, since Italy at that time so abounded in cattle—that the fine was established which is called <quote>supreme,</quote> consisting of two sheep and thirty oxen each day, obviously proportionate to the abundance of oxen and the scarcity of sheep. But when a fine of that sort, consisting of cattle and sheep, was pronounced by a magistrate, oxen and sheep were brought, now of small, again of greater value; and this made the penalty of the fine unequal. Therefore later, by the Aternian law,

<note>Passed by the consul, A. Atinius, in 454 B.C.</note>
the value of a sheep was fixed at ten pieces of brass, of the cattle at a hundred apiece. Now the <quote>smallest</quote>  <pb n="v2.p.301"/>  fine is that of one sheep. The <quote>supreme</quote> fine is of that number which we have mentioned, beyond which it is not lawful to impose a fine for a period of successive days;

<note>That is, for a certain number of animals to be paid on a number of successive days.</note>
and for that reason it is called <quote>supreme,</quote> that is, greatest and heaviest.</p>

<p>When therefore even now, according to ancient usage, either the <quote>smallest</quote> or the <quote>supreme</quote> fine is pronounced by Roman magistrates, it is regularly observed that <hi rend="italic">oves</hi> (<quote>sheep</quote>) be given the masculine gender; and Marcus Varro has thus recorded the words of the law by which the smallest fine was pronounced:

<note>xxiii. fr. 2, Mirsch.</note>
<quote>Against Marcus Terentius, since, though summoned, he has neither appeared nor been excused, I pronounce a fine of one sheep (<hi rend="italic">unum ovem</hi>)</quote>; and they declared that the fine did not appear to be legal unless that gender was used.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Marcus Varro, in the twenty-first book of his <hi rend="italic">Human Antiquities,</hi> also says

<note>xxi. fr. 1, Mirsch.</note>
that the word for fine (<hi rend="italic">multa</hi>) is itself not Latin, but Sabine, and he remarks that it endured even to within his own memory in the speech of the Samnites, who are sprung from the Sabines. But the upstart herd of grammarians have asserted that this word, like some others, is used on the principle of opposites.

<note>That is, the <quote>lucus a non lucendo</quote> idea.</note>
Furthermore, since it is a usage and custom in language for us to say even now, as the greater number of the early men did, <hi rend="italic">multam dixit</hi> and <hi rend="italic">multa dicta est,</hi> I have thought it not out of place to note that Marcus Cato spoke otherwise.

<note>Fr. 82, Peter<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
For in the fourth book of his <hi rend="italic">Origins</hi> are these words: <quote>Our commander, if anyone has gone to battle out of order, imposes (<hi rend="italic">facit</hi>) a fine upon him.</quote> But it may seem that Cato changed the word with an eye to propriety, since the fine was imposed in camp  <pb n="v2.p.303"/>  and in the army, not pronounced in the comitium or in the presence of the people.</p></div>

<!--<argument>-->

<p>That the word <hi rend="italic">elegantia</hi> in earlier days was not used of a more refined nature, but of excessive fastidiousness in dress and mode of life, and was a term of reproach.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>IT was not customary to call a man <hi rend="italic">elegans, or</hi> <quote>elegant,</quote> by way of praise, but up to the time of Marcus Cato that word as a rule was a reproach, not a compliment. And this we may observe both in some other writers, and also in the work of Cato entitled <hi rend="italic">Carmen de Moribus.</hi> In this book is the following passage:

<note>p. 82, 10, Jordan.</note>
<quote>They thought that avarice included all the vices; whoever was considered extravagant, ambitious, elegant, vicious or good-fornothing received praise.</quote>

<note>That is, in comparison with the miser.</note>
It is evident from these words that in days of old the <quote>elegant</quote> man was so called, not because of refinement of character, but because he was excessively particular and extravagant in his attire and mode of life.</p>

<p>Later, the <quote>elegant</quote> man ceased indeed to be reproached, but he was deemed worthy of no commendation, unless his elegance was very moderate. Thus Marcus Tullius commended Lucius Crassus and Quintus Scaevola, not for mere elegance, but for elegance combined with great frugality. <quote>Crassus,</quote> he says,

<note><hi rend="italic">Brut.</hi> 148.</note>
<quote>was the most frugal of elegant men; Scaevola the most elegant of the frugal.</quote></p>

<p>Besides this, in the same work of Cato, I recall also these scattered and cursory remarks:

<note>p. 83, 1, Jordan.</note>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>WHEN I have leisure from legal business, and walk or ride for the sake of bodily exercise, I have the habit sometimes of silently meditating upon questions that are trifling indeed and insignificant, even negligible in the eyes of the uneducated, but are nevertheless highly necessary for a thorough understanding of the early writers and a knowledge of the Latin language. For example, lately in the retirement of Praeneste,

<p>Some brief notes about the Pyrronian philosophers and the Academics; and of the difference between them.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THOSE whom we call the Pyrronian philosophers are designated by the Greek name <foreign xml:lang="grc">skeptikoi/,</foreign> or <quote>sceptics,</quote> which means about the same as <quote>inquirers</quote> and <quote>investigators.</quote> For they decide nothing and determine nothing, but are always engaged in inquiring and considering what there is in all nature concerning which it is possible to decide and determine. And moreover they believe that they do not see or hear anything clearly,  <pb n="v2.p.311"/>  but that they undergo and experience something like seeing and hearing; but they are in doubt as to the nature and character of those very things which cause them those experiences, and they deliberate about them: and they declare that in everything assurance and absolute truth seem so beyond our grasp, owing to the mingling and confusing of the indications of truth and falsehood, that any man who is not rash and precipitate in his judgment ought to use the language which they say was used by Pyrro, the founder of that philosophy: <quote>Does not this matter stand so, rather than so, or is it neither?</quote> For they deny that proofs of anything and its real qualities can be known and understood, and they try in many ways to point this out and demonstrate it. On this subject Favorinus too with great keenness and subtlety has composed ten books, which he entitled <foreign xml:lang="grc">Purrwnei=oi Tro/poi,</foreign> or <hi rend="italic">The Pyrronian Principles.</hi>

<note>p. 88, Marres. Apparently a discussion of the arguments by which the Pyrronian philosophers supported their beliefs.</note>
</p>

<p>It is besides a question of long standing, which has been discussed by many Greek writers, whether the Pyrronian and Academic philosophers differ at all, and to what extent. For both are called <quote>sceptics, inquirers and doubters,</quote> since both affirm nothing and believe that nothing is understood. But they say that appearances, which they call <foreign xml:lang="grc">fantasi/ai,</foreign> are produced from all objects, not according to the nature of the objects themselves, but according to the condition of mind or body of those to whom those appearances come. Therefore they call absolutely all things that affect men's senses <foreign xml:lang="grc">ta\ pro/s ti.</foreign>

<note>That is, <quote>things relative to something else.</quote></note>
This expression means that there is nothing at all that is self-dependent or which has its own power and nature, but that absolutely all things have <quote>reference  <pb n="v2.p.313"/>  to something else</quote> and seem to be such as their appearance is while they are seen, and such as they are formed by our senses, to which they come, not by the things themselves, from which they have proceeded. But although the Pyrronians and the Academics express themselves very much alike about these matters, yet they are thought to differ from each other both in certain other respects and especially for this reason—because the Academics do, as it were, <quote>comprehend</quote>

<note><hi rend="italic">Comprehendo</hi> is used in a technical sense; cf. Cic. <hi rend="italic">Acad. Pr.</hi> ii. 47, cum plane compresserat (manum) pugnumque fecerat, comprehensionem illam esse dicebat; also <hi rend="italic">Acad.

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>To use words that are too antiquated and worn out, or those which are unusual and of a harsh and unpleasant novelty, seems to be equally faulty. But for my own part I think it more offensive and censurable to use words that are new, unknown and unheard of, than those that are trite and mean. Furthermore, I maintain that those words also seem new which are out of use and obsolete, even though they are of ancient date.

For instance, at Rome in my presence a man of experience and celebrated as a pleader, who had acquired a sudden and, so to speak, haphazard kind of education, was speaking before the prefect of the city and wished to say that a certain man lived upon poor and wretched food, ate bread made from bran,  <pb n="v2.p.317"/>  and drank flat and spoiled wine: <quote>This Roman knight,</quote> said he, <quote>eats <hi rend="italic">apluda</hi> and drinks <hi rend="italic">flocces.</hi></quote> All who were present looked at one another, at first somewhat seriously, with a disturbed and inquiring aspect, wondering what in the world the two words meant; then presently they all burst into a laugh, as if he had said something in Etruscan or Gallic. Now that man had read that the farmers of ancient days called the chaff of grain <hi rend="italic">apluda,</hi> and that the word was used by Plautus in the comedy entitled <hi rend="italic">Astraba,</hi>

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>CRITOLAUS has written

<note><hi rend="italic">F. H. G.</hi> iv. 373.</note>
that envoys came from Miletus to Athens on public business, perhaps for  <pb n="v2.p.321"/>  the purpose of asking aid. Then they engaged such advocates as they chose, to speak for them, and the advocates, according to their instructions, addressed the people in behalf of the Milesians. Demosthenes vigorously opposed the demands of the Milesians, maintaining that the Milesians did not deserve aid, nor was it to the interest of the State to grant it. The matter was postponed to the next day. The envoys came to Demosthenes and begged him earnestly not to speak against them; he asked for money, and received the amount which he demanded. On the following day, when the case was taken up again, Demosthenes, with his neck and shoulders wrapped in thick wool, came forward before the people and said that he was suffering from quinsy and hence could not speak against the Milesians. Then one of the populace cried out that it was, not quinsy, but <quote>silverinsy</quote> from which Demosthenes was suffering.</p>

<p>Demosthenes himself too, as Critolaus also relates, did not afterwards conceal that matter, but actually made a boast of it. For when he had asked Aristodemus, the player, what sum he had received for acting, and Aristodemus

<note>Ps.-Plutarch, <hi rend="italic">Decem Orat. Vitae, Demosth.,</hi> p. 848, B, says that the actor was Polos. Famous actors made large sums of money; according to Pliny, <hi rend="italic">N.H.</hi> vii. 129, the celebrated Roman actor Roscius made 500,000 sesterces yearly.</note>

<quote>For you, fellow citizens, if you wish to be wise and honest, and if you inquire into the matter, will find that none of us comes forward here without pay. All of us who address you are after something, and no one appears before you for any purpose except to carry something away. I myself, who am now recommending you to increase your taxes, in order that you may the more easily serve your own advantage and administer the government, do not come here for nothing; but I ask of you, not money, but honour and your good opinion. Those who come forward to persuade you not to accept this law, do not seek honour from you, but money from Nicomedes; those also who advise you to accept it are not seeking a good opinion from you, but from Mithridates a reward and an increase of their possessions; those, however, of the same rank and order who are silent are your very bitterest enemies, since they take money from all and are false to all. You, thinking that they are innocent of such conduct, give them your esteem; but the embassies from the kings, thinking it is for their sake that they are silent, give them great gifts and rewards. So in the land of Greece, when a Greek tragic actor boasted that he had received a whole talent for one play, Demades, the most eloquent man of his country, is said to have replied to him: 'Does it seem wonderful to you that you have gained a talent by speaking?

<p>What Titus Castricius thought about the wording of a sentence of Gaius Gracchus; and that he showed that it contributed nothing to the effectiveness of the sentence.</p><!--</argument>-->

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THE speech of Gaius Gracchus <hi rend="italic">Against Publius Popilius</hi>

<note><hi rend="italic">0. R. F.,</hi> p. 238, Meyer.</note>
was read before Titus Castricius, a teacher of the art of rhetoric and a man of sound and solid judgment. At the beginning of that speech the sentences were constructed with more care and regard for rhythm than was customary with the early orators. The words, arranged as I have said, are as follows: <quote>If you now reject rashly the things which all these years you have earnestly sought and longed for, it must be said either that you formerly sought them earnestly, or now have rejected them without consideration.</quote></p>

<p>Well then, the flow and rhythm of this well-rounded and smooth-flowing sentence pleased us to a remarkable and unparalleled degree, and still more the evidence that composition of that kind appealed even in those early days to Gaius Gracchus, a man of distinction and dignity. But when those very same words were read again and again at our request, we  <pb n="v2.p.329"/>  were admonished by Castricius to consider what the force and value of the thought was, and not to allow our ears to be charmed by the rhythm of a well-turned sentence and through mere pleasure to confuse our judgment as well.</p>

<p>And when by this admonition he had made us more alert, <quote>Look deeply,</quote> said he, <quote>into the meaning of these words, and tell me pray, some of you, whether there is any weight or elegance in this sentence: 'If you rashly reject the things which all these years you have earnestly sought and longed for, it must be said either that you formerly sought them earnestly or now reject them without consideration.' For to whom of all men does it not occur, that it is certainly natural that you should be said earnestly to have sought what you earnestly sought, and to have rejected without consideration what you rejected without consideration? But I think,</quote> said he, <quote>if it had been written thus: ' If you now reject what you have sought and longed for these many years, it must be said that you formerly sought it earnestly or that you now reject it without consideration'; if,</quote> said he, <quote>it were spoken thus, the sentence would be weightier and more solid and would arouse some reasonable expectation in the hearer; but as it is, these words 'earnestly' and 'without consideration,' on which the whole effect of the sentence rests, are not only spoken at the end of the sentence, but are also put earlier where they are not needed, so that what ought to arise and spring from the very conception of the subject is spoken wholly before the subject demands it. For one who says: ' If you do this, you will be said to have done it earnestly,' says something that is composed and  <pb n="v2.p.331"/>  arranged with some regard to sense; but one who says: 'If you do it earnestly, you will be said to have done it earnestly,' speaks in much the same way as if he should say: 'If you do it earnestly, you will do it earnestly.' I have warned you of this,</quote> said he, <quote>not with the idea of censuring Gaius Gracchus—may the gods give me a wiser mind! for if any fault or error can be mentioned in a man of such powerful eloquence, it is wholly excused by his authority and overlooked in view of his antiquity—but in order that you might be on your guard lest the rhythmic sound of any flowing eloquence should easily dazzle you, and that you might first balance the actual weight of the substance against the high quality of the diction; so that if any sentence was uttered that was weighty, honest and sound, then, if you thought best, you might praise also the mere flow of the language and the delivery; that if, on the contrary, thoughts that were cold, trifling and futile should be conveyed in words neatly and rhythmically arranged, they might have the same effect upon you as when men conspicuous for their deformity and their ludicrous appearance imitate actors and play the buffoon.</quote></p>  </div>

<p>But why Scaurus was led to censure Caesellius on this point, I certainly could not understand.

But Scaurus ought rather, in censuring the commentaries of Caesellius, to have taken him to task for what he left unsaid; namely, whether <hi rend="italic">ludibundus, ridibundus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">errabundus</hi> differ at all from <hi rend="italic">ludens, ridens and errans,</hi> and to what extent, and so with other words of the same kind; whether they differ only in some slight degree from their primitives, and what is the general force of the suffix which is added to words of that kind. For in examining a phenomenon of that nature that were a more pertinent inquiry, just as in <hi rend="italic">vinulentus, lutulentus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">turbulentus</hi> it is usual to ask whether that suffix is superfluous and without meaning, <foreign xml:lang="grc">paragwgh/,</foreign> as the Greeks say,

<note>That is, <quote>an addition to the end of a syllable.</quote></note>
or whether the suffix has some special force of its own.</p>

<p>However, in noting this criticism of Scaurus it occurred to me that Sisenna, in the fourth book of his <hi rend="italic">Histories,</hi> used a word of the same form. He says:

<note>Fr. 55, Peter.</note>
<quote>He came to the town, laying waste the fields (<hi rend="italic">populabundus</hi>),</quote> which of course means <quote>while he was laying waste the fields,</quote> not, as Sisenna says of similar words, <quote>when he played the part of, or imitated, one laying waste.</quote></p>

<p>But when I was inquiring about the signification and origin of such forms as <hi rend="italic">populabundus, errabundus, laetabundus, ludibundus,</hi> and many other words of that kind, our friend Apollinaris—very appositely by Heaven! —remarked that it seemed to him that the final syllable of such words indicated force and abundance, and as it were, an excess of the quality belonging to  <pb n="v2.p.337"/>  the primitive word. Thus <hi rend="italic">laetabundus</hi> is used of one who is excessively joyful, and <hi rend="italic">errabundus</hi> of one who has wandered long and far, and he showed that all other words of that form are so used that this addition and ending indicates a great and overflowing force and abundance

<note>In general these words <hi rend="italic">in-bundus</hi> have the same force as the pres. participle; the intensive force in a few words comes originally from forms like <hi rend="italic">versabundus,</hi> formed from intensive verbs. See Stolz, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Lat. Gr.</hi> i, p. 570.</note>

<note/>
The word means <quote>being busy about many things,</quote> often with the idea of <quote>officiousness</quote> or <quote>meddling.</quote></p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>WE have frequently observed not a few names of things which we cannot express in Latin by single words, as in Greek; and even if we use very many words, those ideas cannot be expressed in Latin so aptly and so clearly as the Greeks express them by single terms. Lately, when a book of Plutarch had been brought to me, and I had read its title, which was <foreign xml:lang="grc">Peri\ Polupragmosu/nhs,</foreign> a man who was unacquainted with Greek letters and words asked who the author was and what the book was about. The name of the writer I gave him at once, but I hesitated when on the point of naming the subject of the work. At first indeed, since it did not seem to me that it would be a very apt interpretation if I said that it was written <hi rend="italic">De Negotiositale</hi> or <quote>On Busyness,</quote> I began to rack my brains for something else which would render the title word for word, as the saying is. But there was absolutely nothing that  <pb n="v2.p.339"/>  I remembered to have read, or even that I could invent, that was not to a degree harsh and absurd, if I fashioned a single word out of <hi rend="italic">multitudo,</hi> or <quote>multitude,</quote> and <hi rend="italic">negotium,</hi> or <quote>business,</quote> in the same way that we say <hi rend="italic">multiiugus</hi> (<quote>manifold</quote>), <hi rend="italic">multicolorus</hi> (<quote>multicoloured</quote>) and <hi rend="italic">multiformius</hi> (<quote>multiform</quote>). But it would be no less uncouth an expression than if you should try to translate by one word <foreign xml:lang="grc">polufili/a</foreign> (abundance of friends), <foreign xml:lang="grc">polutropi/a</foreign> (versatility), or <foreign xml:lang="grc">polusarki/a</foreign> (fleshiness). Therefore, after spending a brief time in silent thought, I finally answered that in my opinion the idea could not be expressed by a single word, and accordingly I was preparing to indicate the meaning of that Greek word by a phrase.</p>

<p><quote>Well then,</quote> said I, <quote>undertaking many things and busying oneself with them all is called in Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">polupragmosu/nh,</foreign> and the title shows that this is the subject of our book.</quote> Then that illiterate fellow, misled by my unfinished, rough-and-ready language and believing that <foreign xml:lang="grc">polupragmosu/nh</foreign> was a virtue, said: <quote>Doubtless this Plutarch, whoever he is, urges us to engage in business and to undertake very many enterprises with energy and dispatch, and properly enough he has written as the title of the book itself the name of this virtue about which, as you say, he is intending to speak.</quote> <quote>Not at all,</quote> said I; <quote>for that is by no means a virtue which, expressed by a Greek term, serves to indicate the subject of this book; and neither does Plutarch do what you suppose, nor do I intend to say that he did. For, as a matter of fact, it is in this book that he tries to dissuade us, so far as he can, from the haphazard, promiscuous and unnecessary planning and pursuit  <pb n="v2.p.341"/>  of such a multitude of things. But,</quote> said I, <quote>I realize that this mistake of yours is due to my imperfect command of language, since even in so many words I could not express otherwise than very obscurely what in Greek is expressed with perfect elegance and clearness by a single term.</quote></p>  </div>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As I chanced to be sitting in the library of Trajan's temple,

<note>The <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Ulpia</hi> in the temple in Trajan's forum. Other great public libraries at Rome were in Vespasian's temple of Peace (see v. 21. 9 and the note), in Augustus' temple of Apollo on the Palatine hill, and in the <hi rend="italic">porticus Octaniae.</hi> The first public library at Rome was founded by Asinius Pollio.</note>

<p>The punishment which Draco the Athenian, in the laws which he made for his fellow-citizens, inflicted upon thieves; that of Solon later; and that of our own decemvirs, who compiled the <hi rend="italic">Twelve Tables;</hi> to which it is added, that among the Egyptians thefts were permitted and lawful, while among the Lacedaemonians they were even strongly encouraged and commended as a useful exercise; also a memorable utterance of Marcus Cato about the punishment of theft.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>DRACO the Athenian was considered a good man and of great wisdom, and he was skilled in law, human and divine. This Draco was the first of all to make laws for the use of the Athenians. In those laws he decreed and enacted that one guilty of any theft whatsoever should be punished with death, and added many other statutes that were excessively severe.</p>

<p>Therefore his laws, since they seemed very much too harsh, were abolished, not by order and decree, but by the tacit, unwritten consent of the Athenians. After that, they made use of other, milder laws, compiled by Solon. This Solon was one of the famous seven wise men.

<note>See note 2, vol. i. p. 11.</note>
He thought proper by his law to punish thieves, not with death, as Draco had formerly done, but by a fine of twice the value of the stolen goods.</p>

<p>But our decemvirs, who after the expulsion of the kings compiled laws on <hi rend="italic">Twelve Tables</hi> for the use of the Romans, did not show equal severity in <pb n="v2.p.345"/> punishing thieves of every kind, nor yet too lax leniency. For they permitted

<note>viii. 13 ff.</note>
a thief who was caught in the act to be put to death, only if it was night when he committed the theft, or if in the daytime he defended himself with a weapon when taken. But other thieves taken in the act, if they were freemen, the decemvirs ordered to be scourged and handed over

<note>To be his bondsman, until the debt was paid.</note>
to the one from whom the theft had been made, provided they had committed the theft in daylight and had not defended themselves with a weapon. Slaves taken in the act were to be scourged and hurled from the rock,

<note>That is, the Tarpeian Rock on the Capitoline Hill.</note>
but they decided that boys under age should be flogged at the discretion of the praetor and the damage which they had done made good. Those thefts also which were detected by the girdle and mask,

<note>See Paul. Festus, pp. 104—5, Lindsay. The searchers were clad only in a girdle, that they might not be suspected of bringing anything in with them and saying that it had been stolen, and they held a perforated plate before their faces, because of the presence of the women of the household.</note>
they punished as if the culprit had been caught in the act.</p>

<p>But to-day we have departed from that law of the decemvirs; for if anyone wishes to try a case of manifest theft by process of law, action is brought for four times the value. But <quote>manifest theft,</quote> says Masurius,

<note>Fr. 7, Huschke; <hi rend="italic">Jur. Civ.</hi> 126, Bremer (ii, p. 517).</note>
<quote>is one which is detected while it is being committed. The act is completed when the stolen object is carried to its destination.</quote> When stolen goods are found in possession of the thief (<hi rend="italic">concepti</hi>) or in that of another (<hi rend="italic">oblati</hi>), the penalty is threefold.</p>

<p>But one who wishes to learn what <hi rend="italic">oblatum</hi> means, and <hi rend="italic">conceptum,</hi> and many other particulars of the same kind taken from the admirable customs of our forefathers, and both useful and agreeable to know, will consult the book of Sabinus entitled <hi rend="italic">On Thefts.</hi> In this book there is also written

<note>Fr. 7, Huschke; 3–5, Bremer (ii, p. 383).</note>
a thing that is not  <pb n="v2.p.347"/>  commonly known, that thefts are committed, not only of men and movable objects which can be purloined and carried off secretly, but also of an estate and of houses; also that a farmer was found guilty of theft, because he had sold the farm which he had rented and deprived the owner of its possession. And Sabinus tells this also, which is still more surprising, that one person was convicted of having stolen a man, who, when a runaway slave chanced to pass within sight of his master, held out his gown as if he were putting it on, and so prevented the slave from being seen by his master.</p>

<p>Then upon all other thefts, which were called <quote>not manifest,</quote> they imposed a two-fold penalty.

<note><hi rend="italic">XII. Tab.</hi> viii. 16.</note>
I recall also that I read in the work of the jurist Aristo,

<note>Fr. 1, Huschke; ii. 2, p. 393, Bremer.</note>
a man of no slight learning, that among the ancient Egyptians, a race of men known to have been ingenious in inventions and keen in getting at the bottom of things, thefts of all kinds were lawful and went unpunished.</p>

<p>Among the Lacedaemonians too, those serious and vigorous men (a matter for which the evidence is not so remote as in the case of the Egyptians) many famous writers, who have composed records of their laws and customs, affirm that thieving was lawful and customary, and that it was practised by their young men, not for base gain or to furnish the means for indulgence or amassing wealth, but as an exercise and training in the art of war; for dexterity and practice in thieving made the minds of the youth keen and strong for clever ambuscades, and for endurance in watching, and for the swiftness of surprise.</p>

<p>Marcus Cato, however, in the speech which he  <pb n="v2.p.349"/>  wrote <hi rend="italic">On Dividing Spoils among the Soldiers,</hi> complains in strong and choice language about unpunished thievery and lawlessness. I have quoted his words, since they pleased me greatly:

<note>p. 69, 1, Jordan.</note>
<quote>Those who commit private theft pass their lives in confinement and fetters; plunderers of the public, in purple and gold.</quote></p>

<p>But I think I ought not to pass over the highly ethical and strict definition of theft made by the wisest men, lest anyone should consider him only a thief who privately purloins anything or secretly carries it off. The words are those of Sabinus in his second book <hi rend="italic">On Civil Law:</hi>

<note>Fr. 2, Huschke; 113, Bremer (ii, p. 513).</note>
<quote>He is guilty of theft who has touched anything belonging to another, when he has reason to know that he does so against the owner's will.</quote> Also in another chapter:

<note>Fr. 3, Huschke; 119, Bremer (ii, p. 515).</note>
<quote>He who silently carries off another's property for the sake of gain is guilty of theft, whether he knows to whom the object belongs or not.</quote></p>

<p>Thus has Sabinus written, in the book which I just now mentioned, about handling things for the purpose of stealing them. But we ought to remember, according to what I have written above, that a theft may be committed even without touching anything, when the mind alone and the thoughts desire that a theft be committed. Therefore Sabinus says

<note>Fr. 4, Huschke; 127, Bremer.</note>
that he has no doubt that a master should be convicted of theft who has ordered a slave of his to steal something.</p>

<p>A discourse of the philosopher Favorinus, in which he urged a lady of rank to feed with her own milk, and not with that of other nurses, the children whom she had borne.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>WORD was once brought in my presence to the philosopher Favorinus that the wife of an auditor and disciple of his had been brought to bed a short time before, and that his pupil's family had been increased by the birth of a son. <quote>Let us go,</quote> said he, <quote>both to see the child and to congratulate the father.</quote>

<note>The addition of a son to his family gave the father certain privileges.</note>
</p>

<p>The father was of senatorial rank and of a family of high nobility. We who were present at the time went with Favorinus, attended him to the house to which he was bound, and entered it with him. Then the philosopher, having embraced and congratulated the father immediately upon entering, sat down. And when he had asked how long the labour had been and how difficult, and had learned that the young woman, overcome with fatigue and wakefulness, was sleeping, he began to talk at greater length and said: <quote>I have no doubt she will suckle her son herself!</quote> But when the young woman's mother said to him that she must spare her daughter and provide nurses for the child, in order that to the pains which she had suffered in childbirth there might not be added the wearisome and difficult task of nursing, he said: <quote>I beg you, madam, let her be wholly and  <pb n="v2.p.355"/>  entirely the mother of her own child. For what kind of unnatural, imperfect and half-motherhood is it to bear a child and at once send it away from her? to have nourished in her womb with her own blood something which she could not see, and not to feed with her own milk what she sees, now alive, now human, now calling for a mother's care? Or do you too perhaps think,</quote> said he, "that nature gave women nipples as a kind of beauty-spot, not for the purpose of nourishing their children, but as an adornment of their breast? For it is for that reason though such a thing is of course far from your thoughts) that many of those unnatural women try to dry up and check that sacred fount of the body, the nourisher of mankind, regardless of the danger of diverting and spoiling the milk, because they think it disfigures the charms of their beauty. In so doing they show the same madness as those who strive by evil devices to cause abortion of the fetus itself which they have conceived, in order that their beauty may not be spoiled by the weight of the burden they bear and by the labour of parturition. But since it is an act worthy of public detestation and general abhorrence to destroy a human being in its inception, while it is being fashioned and given life and is still in the hands of Dame Nature, how far does it differ from this to deprive a child, already perfect, already brought into the world, already a son, of the nourishment of its own familiar and kindred blood?"</p>

<p>"'But it makes no difference,' for so they say, 'provided it be nourished and live, by whose milk that is effected.' Why then does not he who affirms this, if he is so dull in comprehending natural <pb n="v2.p.357"/> feeling, think that it also makes no difference in whose body and from whose blood a human being is formed and fashioned? Is the blood which is now in the breasts not the same that it was in the womb, merely because it has become white from abundant air and warmth? Is not the wisdom of nature evident also in this, that as soon as the blood, the artificer, has fashioned the whole human body within its secret precincts, when the time for birth comes, it rises into the upper parts, is ready to cherish the first beginnings of life and of light, and supplies the newborn children with the familiar and accustomed food? Therefore it is believed not without reason that, just as the power and nature of the seed are able to form likenesses of body and mind, so the qualities and properties of the milk have the same effect. And this is observed not only in human beings, but in beasts also; for if kids are fed on the milk of ewes, or lambs on that of goats, it is a fact that as a rule the wool is harsher in the former and the hair softer in the latter. In trees too and grain the power and strength of the water and earth which nourish them have more effect in retarding or promoting their growth than have those of the seed itself which is sown; and you often see a strong and flourishing tree, when transplanted to another spot, die from the effect of an inferior soil. What the mischief, then, is the reason for corrupting the nobility of body and mind of a newly born human being, formed from gifted seeds, by the alien and degenerate nourishment of another's milk? Especially if she whom you employ to furnish the milk is either a slave or of servile origin and, as usually happens, of a foreign and barbarous nation, if she is dishonest, ugly,  <pb n="v2.p.359"/>  unchaste and a wine-bibber; for as a rule anyone who has milk at the time is employed and no distinction made."</p>

<p>"Shall we then allow this child of ours to be infected with some dangerous contagion and to draw a spirit into its mind and body from a body and mind of the worst character? This, by Heaven! is the very reason for what often excites our surprise, that some children of chaste women turn out to be like their parents neither in body nor in mind. Wisely then and skilfully did our Maro make use of these lines of Homer:

<note><hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> xvi. 33 ff.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>The horseman Peleus never was thy sire,</l> <l>Nor Thetis gave thee birth; but the gray sea</l> <l>Begat thee, and the hard and flinty rocks;</l> <l part="I">So savage is thy mind.</l></quote>  For he bases his charge, not upon birth alone, as did his model, but on fierce and savage nurture, for his next verse reads: <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>And fierce Hyrcanian tigers gave thee suck.

<note><hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> iv. 366f.</note>
</l></quote>  And there is no doubt that in forming character the disposition of the nurse and the quality of the milk play a great part; for the milk, although imbued from the beginning with the material of the father's seed, forms the infant offspring from the body and mind of the mother as well.</p>

<p><quote>And in addition to all this, who can neglect or despise this consideration also, that those who desert their offspring, drive them from them, and give them to others to nurse, do sever, or at any rate loosen and relax, that bond and cementing of the mind and of affection with which nature attaches  <pb n="v2.p.361"/>  parents to their children? For when the child is given to another and removed from its mother's sight, the strength of maternal ardour is gradually and little by little extinguished, every call of impatient anxiety is silenced, and a child which has been given over to another to nurse is almost as completely forgotten as if it had been lost by death. Moreover, the child's own feelings of affection, fondness, and intimacy are centred wholly in the one by whom it is nursed, and therefore, just as happens in the case of those who are exposed at birth, it has no feeling for the mother who bore it and no regret for her loss. Therefore, when the foundations of natural affection have been destroyed and removed, however much children thus reared may seem to love their father and mother, that affection is in a great measure not natural but merely courteous and conventional.</quote>"</p>

<p>I heard Favorinus make this address in the Greek language. I have reproduced his sentiments, so far as I was able, for the sake of their general utility, but the elegance, copiousness and richness of his words hardly any power of Latin eloquence could equal, least of all my humble attainments.</p></div>

<!--<argument>-->

<p>That the judgment passed by Annaeus Seneca on Quintus Ennius and Marcus Cicero was trifling and futile.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>SOME think of Annaeus Seneca as a writer of little value, whose works are not worth taking up, since his style seems commonplace and ordinary, while the matter and the thought are characterized, now by a foolish and empty vehemence, now by an empty and  <pb n="v2.p.363"/>  affected cleverness; and because his learning is common and plebeian, gaining neither charm nor distinction from familiarity with the earlier writers.

<note>Besides Caligula, who called Seneca's essays <quote>mere declamation exercises</quote> and his style <quote>sand without lime</quote> (Suet. <hi rend="italic">Calig.</hi> liii), there were other critics of Seneca in his own day, as well as in the following Flavian epoch.</note>
Others, on the contrary, while not denying that his diction lacks elegance, declare that he is not without learning and a knowledge of the subjects which he treats, and that he censures the vices of the times with a seriousness and dignity which are not wanting in charm. I myself do not feel called upon to criticize and pass judgment upon his talents in general, or upon his writings as a whole; but I shall select for consideration the nature of the opinions which he has expressed about Marcus Cicero, Quintus Ennius and Publius Vergilius.</p>

<p>For in the twenty-second book of his <hi rend="italic">Moral Epistles,</hi> which he addressed to Lucilius, he says

<note>pp. 610 f. Hense; except for these fragments, only twenty books have come down to us.</note>
that the following verses which Quintus Ennius wrote

<note><hi rend="italic">Ann.</hi> 306 ff., Vahlen<hi rend="sup">2</hi>; quoted by Cicero, <hi rend="italic">Brut.</hi> 58.</note>
about Cethegus, a man of the olden time, are absurd: <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>He by his fellow citizens was called,</l> <l>By every man who lived and flourished then,</l> <l>The people's chosen flower, Persuasion's marrow.</l></quote>  He then wrote the following about these lines: <quote>I am surprised that men of great eloquence, devoted to Ennius, have praised those absurd verses as his best. Cicero, at any rate, includes them among examples of his good verses.</quote>

<note><hi rend="italic">Cic. Brut.</hi> 58.</note>
He then goes on to say of Cicero: <quote>I am not surprised that there existed a man who could write such verses, when there existed a man who could praise them; unless haply Cicero, that great orator, was pleading his own cause  <pb n="v2.p.365"/>  and wished his own verse to appear excellent.</quote> Later he adds this very stupid remark: <quote>In Cicero himself too you will find, even in his prose writings, some things which will show that he did not lose his labour when he read Ennius.</quote> Then he cites passages from Cicero which he criticizes as taken from Ennius; for example, when Cicero wrote as follows in his <hi rend="italic">Republic:</hi>

<note>V. 9, 11.</note>
<quote>As Menelaus, the Laconian, had a kind of sweet-speaking charm,</quote> and said in another place: <quote>he cultivates brevity of speech in his oratory.</quote> And then that trifler apologizes for what he considers Cicero's errors, saying: <quote>This was not the fault of Cicero, but of the times; it was necessary to say such things when such verses were read.</quote> Then he adds that Cicero inserted these very things in order to escape the charge of being too diffuse and ornamental in his style.</p>

<p>In the same place Seneca writes the following about Virgil also: <quote>Our Virgil too admitted some verses which are harsh, irregular and somewhat beyond the proper length, with no other motive than that those who were devoted to Ennius might find a flavour of antiquity in the new poem.</quote></p>

<p>But I am already weary of quoting Seneca; yet I shall not pass by these jokes of that foolish and tasteless man: <quote>There are some thoughts in Quintus Ennius,</quote> says he, <quote>that are of such lofty tone that though written among the unwashed,

<note>Lit., <quote>those who smell like a he-goat</quote>; cf. Hor. <hi rend="italic">Serm.</hi> i. 2. 27, pastillos Rufillus olet, Gargonius hircum; <hi rend="italic">Epod.</hi> xii. 5.</note>
they nevertheless can give pleasure among the anointed</quote>; and, after censuring the verses about Cethegus which I have quoted above, he said: <quote>It would be clear to you that those who love verses of this kind admire even the couches of Sotericus.</quote>

<note>Obviously, an unskilful workman.</note>
</p>  <pb n="v2.p.367"/>

<p>Worthy indeed would Seneca appear

<note>Ironical, of course.</note>
of the reading and study of the young, a man who has compared the dignity and beauty of early Latin with the couches of Sotericus, implying forsooth that they possessed no charm and were already obsolete and despised! Yet listen to the relation and mention of a few things which that same Seneca has well said, for example what he said of a man who was avaricious, covetous and thirsting for money: <quote>Why, what difference does it make how much you have? There is much more which you do not have.</quote> Is not that well put? Excellently well; but the character of the young is not so much benefited by what is well said, as it is injured by what is very badly put; all the more so, if the bad predominates, and if a part of the bad is uttered, not as an argument about some slight and trivial affair, but as advice in a matter requiring decision.</p>  </div>

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>QUINTUS ENNIUS in the seventh book of his <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi> describes and defines very vividly and skilfully in his sketch of Geminus Servilius, a man of rank, the tact, courtesy, modesty, fidelity, restraint and propriety in speech, knowledge of ancient history and of customs old and new, scrupulousness in keeping and guarding a secret; in short, the various remedies and methods of relief and solace for guarding against the <pb n="v2.p.371"/> annoyances of life, which the friend of a man who is his superior in rank and fortune ought to have. Those verses in my opinion are no less worthy of frequent, attentive perusal than the rules of the philosophers about duties. Besides this, there is such a venerable flavour of antiquity in these verses, such a sweetness, so unmixed and so removed from all affectation, that in my opinion they ought to be observed, remembered and cherished as old and sacred laws of friendship. Therefore I thought them worthy of quotation, in case there should be anyone who desired to see them at once;

<!--<argument>-->

<p>A discourse of the philosopher Taurus on the manner and method of enduring pain, according to the principles of the Stoics.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>WHEN the philosopher Taurus was on his way to Delphi, to see the Pythian games and the throng that gathered there from almost all Greece, I was his companion. And when, in the course of the journey, we had come to Lebadia, which is an ancient town in the land of Boeotia, word was brought to Taurus there that a friend of his, an eminent philosopher of the Stoic sect, had been seized with illness and had taken to his bed. Then interrupting our journey, which otherwise would have called for haste, and leaving the carriages, he hastened to visit his friend, and I followed, as I usually did wherever he went. When we came to the house in which the sick man was, we saw that he was suffering anguish from pains in the stomach, such as the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ko/los,</foreign> or <quote>colic,</quote> and at the same time from a high fever. The stifled groans that burst from him, and the heavy sighs that escaped his panting breast, revealed his suffering, and no less his struggle to overcome it.</p>

<p>Later, when Taurus had sent for physicians and discussed with them the means of cure, and had encouraged the patient to keep up his endurance by commending the fortitude which he was showing,  <pb n="v2.p.375"/>  we left the house. And as we were returning to the carriages, and our companions, Taurus said: <quote>You were witness of no very pleasant sight, it is true, but one which was, nevertheless, a profitable experience, in beholding the encounter and contest of a philosopher with pain. The violent character of the disorder, for its part, produced anguish and torture of body; reason and the spiritual nature, on the other hand, similarly played their part, supporting and restraining within bounds the violence of well-nigh ungovernable pain. He uttered no shrieks, no complaints, not even any unseemly outcries; yet, as you saw, there were obvious signs of a battle between soul and body for the man's possession.</quote></p>

<p>Then one of the disciples of Taurus, a young man not untrained in philosophy, said: <quote>If the bitterness of pain is such that it struggles against the will and judgment, forcing a man to groan involuntarily and confess the evil of his violent disorder, why is it said among the Stoics that pain is a thing indifferent and not an evil? Furthermore, why can a Stoic be compelled to do anything, or how can pain compel him, when the Stoics say that pain exerts no compulsion, and that a wise man cannot be forced to anything?</quote>

<note>iii. 168, Arn.</note>
</p>

<p>To this Taurus, with a face that was now somewhat more cheerful, for he seemed pleased at being lured into a discussion, replied as follows: <quote>If this friend of ours were now in better health, he would have defended such unavoidable groans against reproach and, I dare say, would have answered your question; but you know that I am no great friend of the Stoics, or rather, of the Stoa; for it is often  <pb n="v2.p.377"/>  inconsistent with itself and with us, as is shown in the book which I have written on that subject. But to oblige you, I will say 'unlearnedly and clearly,' as the adage has it, what I imagine that any Stoic now present would have said more intricately and cleverly. For you know, I suppose, that old and familiar proverb:

<note>Aristophanes, <hi rend="italic">Frogs,</hi> 1445.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Less eruditely speak and clearer, please.</l></quote></quote></p>

<p>And with that preamble he discoursed as follows about the pain and groans of the ailing Stoic:

<note>iii. 181, Arn.</note>
<quote>Nature,</quote> said he, "who produced us, implanted in us and incorporated in the very elements from which we sprang a love and affection for ourselves, to such a degree that nothing whatever is dearer or of more importance to us than ourselves. And this, she thought, would be the underlying principle for assuring the perpetuation of the human race, if each one of us, as soon as he saw the light, should have a knowledge and understanding first of all of those things which the philosophers of old have called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ta\ prw=ta kata\ fu/sin,</foreign> or 'the first principles of nature'; that is, that he might delight in all that was agreeable to his body and shrink from everything disagreeable. Later, with increasing years, reason developed from its first elements, and reflection in taking counsel, and the consideration of honour and true expediency, and a wiser and more careful choice of advantages as opposed to disadvantages; and in this way the dignity of virtue and honour became so preeminent and so superior, that any disadvantage from without which prevented our holding and retaining this quality was despised. Nothing was considered truly and wholly good unless it was honourable, and  <pb n="v2.p.379"/>  nothing evil unless it is dishonourable. All other things which lay between, and were neither honourable nor dishonourable, were decided to be neither good nor evil.

<note>Cf. i. 2. 9.</note>
But <hi rend="italic">productions</hi> and <hi rend="italic">relationes,</hi> which the philosophers call <foreign xml:lang="grc">prohgme/na,</foreign> or 'things desirable,' and <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)poprohgme/na,</foreign> or 'things undesirable,' are distinguished and set apart each by their own qualities. Therefore pleasure also and pain, so far as the end of living well and happily is concerned, are regarded as indifferent and classed neither with good nor with evil. But since the newly-born child is endowed with these first sensations of pain and pleasure before the appearance of judgment and reason, and is attracted to pleasure by nature, but averted and alienated from pain, as if from some bitter enemy—therefore reason, which is given to him later, is hardly able to uproot and destroy those inclinations which were originally and deeply implanted in him. Yet he constantly struggles with them, checks and tramples them under foot when they are excessive, and compels them to obey and submit to him. Hence you saw the philosopher, relying upon the efficacy of his system, wrestling with the insolent violence of disease and pain, yielding nothing, admitting nothing; not, as sufferers commonly do, shrieking, lamenting and calling himself wretched and unhappy, but giving vent only to panting breathing and deep sighs, which are signs and indications, not that he is overcome or subdued by pain, but that he is struggling to overcome and subdue it.</p>

<p><quote>But very likely,</quote> said he, <quote>because of the mere fact that he struggles and groans, someone may ask, if pain is not an evil, why it is necessary to groan and struggle? It is because all things which are not  <pb n="v2.p.381"/>  evil are not also wholly lacking in annoyance, but there are very many things which, though free from any great harm or baneful effect, as not being base,

<note>That is, they do not involve any guilt.</note>
are none the less opposed to the gentleness and mercy of nature through a certain inexplicable and inevitable law of nature herself. These, then, a wise man can endure and put up with, but he cannot exclude them altogether from his consciousness; for <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)nalghsi/a,</foreign> or 'insensibility,' and <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)pa/qeia,</foreign> or 'lack of feeling,' not only in my judgment,</quote> said he, "but also in that of some of the wise men of that same school (such as Panaetius,

<note>Fr. 14, Fowler.</note>
a serious and learned man) are disapproved and rejected."</p>

<p>"But why is a Stoic philosopher, upon whom they say no compulsion can be exerted, compelled to utter groans against his will? It is true that no compulsion can be exerted upon a wise man when he has the opportunity of using his reason; but when nature compels, then reason also, the gift of nature, is compelled. Inquire also, if you please, why a man involuntarily winks when someone's hand is suddenly directed against his eyes, why when the sky is lit up by a flash of lightning he involuntarily drops his head and closes his eyes, why as the thunder grows louder he gradually becomes terrified, why he is shaken by sneezing, why he sweats in the heat of the sun or grows cold amid severe frosts. For these and many other things are not under the control of the will, the judgment, or the reason, but are decrees of nature and of necessity.</p>

<p><quote>Moreover, that is not fortitude which, like a giant, struggles against nature and goes beyond her bounds, either through insensibility of spirit, or  <pb n="v2.p.383"/>  savage pride, or some unhappy and compulsory practice in bearing pain—such as we heard of in a certain savage gladiator of Caesar's school, who used to laugh when his wounds were probed by the doctors—but that is true and noble fortitude which our forefathers called a knowledge of what is endurable and unendurable. From this it is evident that there are some insupportable trials, from the undergoing or endurance of which brave men may shrink.</quote></p>

<p>Why Gnaeus Dolabella, the proconsul, referred to the court of the Areopagus the case of a woman charged with poisoning and admitting the fact.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>WHEN Gnaeus Dolabella was governing the province of Asia with proconsular authority, a woman of Smyrna was brought before him. This woman had killed her husband and her son at the same time by secretly giving them poison. She confessed the crime, and said that she had reason for it, since her husband and son had treacherously done to death another son of hers by a former husband, an excellent and blameless youth; and there was no dispute about the truth of this statement. Dolabella referred the matter to his council. No member of the council ventured to render a decision in so difficult a case, since the confession of the poisoning which had resulted in the death of the husband and son seemed to call for punishment, while at the same time a just penalty had thereby been inflicted upon two wicked men. Dolabella referred the question to the Areopagites

<note>A very ancient court at Athens, so called because it held its meetings on the Areopagus, or Hill of Mars.</note>
at Athens, as judges of greater authority and experience. The Areopagites, after having heard the case, summoned the woman and her accuser to appear after a hundred years. Thus the woman's crime was not condoned, for the laws did not permit that, nor, though guilty, was she condemned and punished for a pardonable offence. The story is told in the ninth book of Valerius Maximus' work on <hi rend="italic">Memorable Occurrences and Sayings.</hi>

<p>Noteworthy reconciliations between famous men.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>PUBLIUS AFRICANUS the elder and Tiberius Gracchus, father of Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus, men illustrious for their great exploits, the high offices which they held, and the uprightness of their lives, often disagreed about public questions, and for that reason, or some other, were not friends. When this hostility had lasted for a long time, the feast was offered to Jupiter on the appointed day,

<note>On the 13th of September, which was also the anniversary of the founding of the Capitoline Temple. See Fowler, <hi rend="italic">.Roman Festivals,</hi> pp. 217 f.</note>
and on the occasion of that ceremony the senate banqueted in the Capitol. It chanced that the two men were placed side by side at the same table, and immediately, as if the immortal gods, acting as arbiters at the feast of Jupiter, Greatest and Best of Gods, had joined their hands, they became the best of friends. And not only did friendship spring up between them, but at the same time their families were united by a marriage; for Publius Scipio, having a daughter that was unwedded and marriageable at the time, thereupon on the spot betrothed her to Tiberius Gracchus, whom he had chosen and approved at a time when judgment is most strict; that is, while he was his personal enemy.</p>

<p>Aemilius Lepidus, too, and Fulvius Flaccus, men of noble birth, who had held the highest offices, and occupied an exalted place in public life, were opposed to each other in a bitter hatred and enmity of long standing. Later, the people chose them censors at the same time. Then they, as soon as their election was proclaimed by the herald, in the Campus Martius itself, before the assembly was <pb n="v2.p.389"/> dispersed, both voluntarily and with equal joy, immediately joined hands and embraced each other, and from that day, both during their censorship and afterwards, they lived in continual harmony as loyal and devoted friends.</p>  </div>

<!--<argument>-->

<p>What is meant by <quote>ambiguous</quote> words; and that even <hi rend="italic">honos</hi> was such a word.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>ONE may very often see and notice in the early writings many words which at present in ordinary conversation have one fixed meaning, but which then were so indifferent and general, that they could signify and include two opposite things. Some of these are well known, such as <hi rend="italic">tempestas</hi> (weather), <hi rend="italic">valitudo</hi> (health), <hi rend="italic">facinus</hi> (act), <hi rend="italic">dolus</hi> (device), <hi rend="italic">gratia</hi> (favour), <hi rend="italic">industria</hi> (activity).

<note><hi rend="italic">Tempestas</hi> means good or bad weather; <hi rend="italic">valitudo,</hi> good or ill health, etc.</note>
For it is well-nigh a matter of general knowledge that these are ambiguous and can be used either in a good or in a bad sense.</p>

<p>That <hi rend="italic">periculm</hi> (trial), too, and <hi rend="italic">venenum</hi> (drug) and <hi rend="italic">contagium</hi> (contagion) were not used, as they now are, only in a bad sense, you may learn from many examples of that usage. But the use of <hi rend="italic">honor</hi> as an indifferent word, so that people even spoke of <quote>bad honour,</quote> signifying <quote>wrong</quote> or <quote>injury,</quote> is indeed very rare. However, Quintus Metellus Numidicus, in a speech which he delivered <hi rend="italic">On his Triumph,</hi> used these words:

<note><hi rend="italic">O. B. F.,</hi> p. 275, Meyer.<hi rend="sup">2</hi></note>
<quote>In this affair, by as much as the whole of you are more important than my single self, by so much he inflicts upon you greater insult and injury than on me; and by as much as honest men are more willing to suffer wrong than to  <pb n="v2.p.391"/>  do wrong to another, by so much has he shown worse honour (<hi rend="italic">peiorem honorem</hi>) to you than to me; for he wishes me to suffer injustice, Romans, and you to inflict it, so that I may be left with cause for complaint, and you may be open to reproach.</quote> He says, <quote>he has shown worse honour to you than to me,</quote> and the meaning of the expression is the same as when he himself says, just before that, <quote>he has inflicted a greater injury and insult on you than on me.</quote></p>

<p>In addition to the citation of this word, I thought I ought to quote the following saying from the speech of Quintus Metellus, in order to point out that it is a precept of Socrates; the saying in question is: <quote>It is worse to be unjust than to suffer injustice.</quote>

<note>There is a lacuna in the text.</note>

<note>Fr. 56, G. &amp; S.</note>
that we ought to use <hi rend="italic">aedituus</hi> rather than <hi rend="italic">aedituus,</hi> because the latter is made up by a late invention, while the former is pure and of ancient origin.

In the most reliable copies of Marcus Tullius' <hi rend="italic">Fourth Oration against Verres</hi> I find it written:

<quote>The custodians (<hi rend="italic">aeditumi</hi>) and guards quickly perceive it,</quote> but in the ordinary copies <hi rend="italic">aeditui</hi> is read. There is an Atellan farce of Pomponius' entitled <hi rend="italic">Aeditumus.</hi> In it is this line:

<note>Both <hi rend="italic">aeditumus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">aedituus</hi> are good Latin words.

<p>That those are deceived who sin in the confident hope of being undetected, since there is no permanent concealment of wrongdoing; and on that subject a discourse of the philosopher Peregrinus and a saying of the poet Sophocles.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>WHEN I was at Athens, I met a philosopher named Peregrinus, who was later surnamed Proteus, a man of dignity and fortitude, living in a hut outside the city. And visiting him frequently, I heard him say many things that were in truth helpful and noble. Among these I particularly recall the following:</p>

<p>He used to say that a wise man would not commit a sin, even if he knew that neither gods nor men  <pb n="v2.p.395"/>  would know it; for he thought that one ought to refrain from sin, not through fear of punishment or disgrace, but from love of justice and honesty and from a sense of duty. If, however, there were any who were neither so endowed by nature nor so well disciplined that they could easily keep themselves from sinning by their own will power, he thought that such men would all be more inclined to sin whenever they thought that their guilt could be concealed and when they had hope of impunity because of such concealment. <quote>But,</quote> said he, <quote>if men know that nothing at all can be hidden for very long, they will sin more reluctantly and more secretly.</quote> Therefore he said that one should have on his lips these verses of Sophocles, the wisest of poets:

<note>That is, <hi rend="italic">intra,</hi></note>
but be it understood that you will not act according to what I shall say about its nature, but according to what you shall learn to be the interpretation agreed upon by all, or by very many, men; for not only are the true and proper significations of common words changed by long usage, but even the provisions of the laws themselves become a dead letter by tacit consent.</quote></p>

<p>Then he proceeded to discourse, in my hearing and that of several others, in about this fashion: <quote>When the time,</quote> said he, "is so defined that the judge is to render a decision 'within the Kalends, everyone at once jumps to the conclusion that there is no doubt that the verdict may lawfully be rendered before the Kalends, and I observe that the only  <pb n="v2.p.401"/>  question is the one which you raise, namely, whether the decision may lawfully be rendered also on the Kalends. But undoubtedly the word itself is of such origin and such a nature that when the expression 'within the Kalends' is used, no other day ought to be meant than the Kalends alone. For those three words <hi rend="italic">intra, citra, ultra</hi> (within, this side, beyond), by which definite boundaries of places are indicated, among the early writers were expressed by monosyllables, <hi rend="italic">in, cis, uls.</hi> Then, since these particles had a somewhat obscure utterance because of their brief and slight sound, the same syllable was added to all three words, and what was formerly <hi rend="italic">cis Tiberim</hi> (on this side of the Tiber) and <hi rend="italic">uls Tiberim</hi> (beyond the Tiber) began to be called <hi rend="italic">citra Tiberim</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ultra Tiberim;</hi> and <hi rend="italic">in</hi> also became <hi rend="italic">intra</hi> by the addition of the same syllable. Therefore all these expressions are, so to speak, related, being united by common terminations: <hi rend="italic">intra oppidum, ultra oppidum, citra oppidum,</hi> of which <hi rend="italic">intra,</hi> as I have said, is equivalent to <hi rend="italic">in;</hi> for one who says <hi rend="italic">intra oppidum, intra cubiculum, intra ferias</hi> means nothing else than <hi rend="italic">in oppido</hi> (in the town), <hi rend="italic">in cubiculo</hi> (in the room), <hi rend="italic">in feriis</hi> (during the festival)."</p>

<p><quote>'Within the Kalends,' then, is not 'before the Kalends,' but 'on the Kalends'; that is, on the very day on which the Kalends fall. Therefore, according to the meaning of the word itself, one who is ordered to give judgment 'within the Kalends,' unless he do so on the Kalends, acts contrary to the order contained in the phrase; for if he does so earlier, he renders a decision not ' within' but ' before the Kalends.' But somehow or other the utterly absurd interpretation has been generally adopted,  <pb n="v2.p.403"/>  that ' within the Kalends' evidently means also ' on this side of the Kalends' or 'before the Kalends'; for these are nearly the same thing. And, besides, it is doubted whether a decision may be rendered on the Kalends also, since it must be rendered neither beyond nor before that date, but 'within the Kalends,' a time which lies between these; that is to say, ' on the Kalends.' But no doubt usage has gained the victory, the mistress not only of all things, but particularly of language.</quote></p>

<p>After this very learned and clear discussion of the subject by Apollinaris, I then spoke as follows: <quote>It occurred to me,</quote> said I, <quote>before coming to you, to inquire and investigate how our ancestors used the particle in question. Accordingly, I found that Tullius in his <hi rend="italic">Third Oration against Verres</hi> wrote thus:

<note>ii. 3. 207.</note>
'There is no place within the ocean (<hi rend="italic">intra oceanum</hi>) either so distant or so hidden, that the licentiousness and injustice of our countrymen has not penetrated it.' He uses 'within the ocean' contrary to your reasoning; for he does not, I think, wish to say 'in the ocean,' but he indicates all the lands which are surrounded by the ocean and to which our countrymen have access; and these are 'this side the ocean,' not 'in the ocean.' For he cannot be supposed to mean some islands or other, which are spoken of as far within the waters of the ocean itself.</quote></p>

<p>Then with a smile Sulpicius Apollinaris replied: <quote>Keenly and cleverly, by Heaven! have you confronted me with this Ciceronian passage; but Cicero said ' within the ocean,' not, as you interpret it, ' this side ocean.' What pray can be said to be 'on this side of the ocean,' when the ocean surrounds and  <pb n="v2.p.405"/>  encircles all lands on every side?

<note>The Greeks of early times regarded the ocean as a great river encircling the earth.</note>
For that which is 'on this side' of a thing, is outside of that thing; but how can that be said to be ' within' which is without? But if the ocean were only on one side of the world, then the land in that part might be said to be 'this side the ocean,' or 'before the ocean.' But since the ocean surrounds all lands completely and everywhere, nothing is on this side of it, but, all lands being walled in by the embrace of its waters, everything which is included within its shore is in its midst, just as in truth the sun moves, not on this side of the heavens, but within and in them.</quote></p>

<p>At the time, what Sulpicius Apollinaris said seemed to be learned and acute. But later, in a volume of <hi rend="italic">Letters to Servius Sulpicius</hi> by Marcus Tullius, I found <quote>within moderation</quote> (<hi rend="italic">intra modum</hi>) used in the same sense that those give to <quote>within the Kalends</quote> who mean to say <quote>this side of the Kalends.</quote> These are the words of Cicero, which I quote:

<note><hi rend="italic">Ad Fam. IV.</hi> 4. 4.</note>
<quote>But yet since I have avoided the displeasure of Caesar, who would perhaps think that I did not regard the present government as constitutional if I kept silence altogether, I shall do this

<note><hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> take part in politics.</note>
moderately, or even less than moderately (<hi rend="italic">intra modum</hi>), so as to consult both his wishes and my own desires.</quote> He first said <quote>I shall do this moderately,</quote> that is, to a fair and temperate degree; then, as if this expression did not please him and he wished to correct it, he added <quote>or even within moderation,</quote> thus indicating that he would do it to a less extent than might be considered moderate; that is, not up to the very limit, but somewhat short of, or <quote>on this side of</quote> the limit.</p>  <pb n="v2.p.407"/>

<p>Also in the speech which he wrote <hi rend="italic">In Defence of Publius Sestius</hi> Cicero says <quote>within Mount Taurus</quote> in such a way as to mean, not <quote>on Mount Taurus,</quote> but <quote>as far as the mountain and including the mountain itself.</quote> These are Cicero's own words in the speech which I have mentioned:

<note>§ 58</note>
<quote>Our forbears, having overcome Antiochus the Great after a mighty struggle on land and sea, ordered him to confine his realm 'within Mount Taurus.' Asia, which they had taken from him, they gave to Attalus, to be his kingdom.</quote> Cicero says: <quote>They ordered him to confine his realm within Mount Taurus,</quote> which is not the same as when we say <quote>within the room,</quote> unless <quote>within the mountain</quote> may appear to mean what is within the regions which are separated by the interposition of Mount Taurus.

<note>This is the usage of the Greek geographers, such as Strabo, who uses <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)/sw tou= i)sqmou=</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)/sw tou= Tau/rou</foreign> in the sense of <quote>south of the isthmus</quote> and <quote>south of Taurus.</quote> </note>
For just as one who is <quote>within a room</quote> is not in the walls of the room, but is within the walls by which the room is enclosed, which walls themselves are yet equally in the room, just so one who rules <quote>within Mount Taurus,</quote> not only rules on Mount Taurus but also in those regions which are bounded by Mount Taurus.</p>

<p>According therefore to the analogy of the words of Marcus Tullius may not one who is bidden to make a decision <quote>within the Kalends</quote> lawfully make it before the Kalends and on the Kalends themselves? And this results, not from a sort of privilege conceded to ignorant usage, but from an accurate regard for reason, since all time which is embraced by the day of the Kalends is correctly said to be <quote>within the Kalends.</quote></p>  <pb n="v2.p.409"/>  </div>

<p>The meaning and origin of the particle <hi rend="italic">saltem.</hi></p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>WE were inquiring what the original meaning of the particle <hi rend="italic">saltem</hi> (at least) was, and what was the derivation of the word; for it seems to have been so formed from the first that it does not appear, like some aids to expression, to have been adopted inconsiderately and irregularly. And there was one man who said that he had read in the <hi rend="italic">Grammatical Notes</hi> of Publius Nigidius

<note>p. 19, 66, Swoboda.</note>
that <hi rend="italic">saltem</hi> was derived from <hi rend="italic">si aliter,</hi> and that this itself was an elliptical expression, since the complete sentence was <hi rend="italic">si aliter non potest,</hi> <quote>if otherwise, it cannot be.</quote> But I myself have nowhere come upon that statement in those <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi> of Publius Nigidius, although I have read them, I think, with some care.</p>

<p>However, that phrase <hi rend="italic">si aliter non potest</hi> does not seem at variance with the meaning of the word under discussion. But yet to condense so many words into a very few letters shows a kind of misplaced subtlety. There was also another man, devoted to books and letters, who said that <hi rend="italic">saltem</hi> seemed to him to be formed by the syncope of a medial <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> saying that what we call <hi rend="italic">saltem</hi> was originally <hi rend="italic">salute.</hi> <quote>For when some other things have been requested and refused, then,</quote> said he, <quote>we are accustomed, as if about to make a final request which ought by no means to be denied, to say ' this at least (<hi rend="italic">saltem</hi>) ought to be done or given,' as if at last seeking safety <hi rend="italic">salutem,</hi> which it is surely most just to grant and to obtain.</quote> But this also,  <pb n="v2.p.411"/>  though ingeniously contrived, seems too far-fetched. I thought therefore that further investigation was necessary.

<note><hi rend="italic">Saltem</hi> or <hi rend="italic">saltim</hi> is the accusative of a noun (cf. <hi rend="italic">partim,</hi> etc.) derived by some from the root of <hi rend="italic">sal-vus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"> sal-us;</hi> by others from that of <hi rend="italic">sal-io;</hi> Walde, <hi rend="italic">Lat.

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>MARCUS CICERO, in his first <hi rend="italic">Oration against Antony,</hi>

<note><hi rend="italic">Phil. i.</hi> 10.</note>
has left us these words: <quote>I hastened then to follow him whom those present did not follow; not that I might be of any service, for I had no hope of that nor could I promise it, but in order that if anything to which human nature is liable should happen to me (and many things seem to threaten contrary even to nature and contrary to fate) I might leave what I have said to-day as a witness to my country of my constant devotion to its interests.</quote> Cicero says <quote>contrary to nature and contrary to fate.</quote> Whether he intended both words, <quote>fate</quote> and <quote>nature,</quote> to have the same meaning and has used two words to designate one thing,

<note>This is the recognized figure of speech known as hendiadys.</note>
or whether he so divided and separated them that nature seems to bring some casualties and fate others, I think ought to be investigated; and this question ought especially to be asked—how it is that he has said that many things to which humanity is liable can happen contrary to fate, when the plan and order and a kind of unconquerable necessity of fate are so ordained that  <pb n="v2.p.417"/>  all things must be included within the decrees of fate; unless perhaps he has followed Homer's saying:  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Lest, spite of fate, you enter Hades' home.</l>

<note><hi rend="italic">Iliad, xx.</hi> 336.</note>
</quote>  But there is no doubt that Cicero referred to a violent and sudden death, which may properly seem to happen contrary to nature.</p>

<p>But why he has put just that kind of death outside the decrees of fate it is not the part of this work to investigate, nor is this the time. The point, however, must not be passed by, that Virgil too had that same opinion about fate which Cicero had, when in his fourth book he said of Elissa, who inflicted a violent death upon herself:

<note><hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> iv. 696.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>For since she perished not by fate's decree,</l> <l part="I">Nor earned her death;</l></quote>  just as if, in making an end of life, those deaths which are violent do not seem to come by fate's decree. Cicero, however, seems to have followed the words of Demosthenes, a man gifted with equal wisdom and eloquence, which express about the same idea concerning nature and fate. For Demosthenes in that splendid oration entitled <hi rend="italic">On the Crown</hi> wrote as follows

<note>205, p. 296.</note>
: <quote>He who thinks that he was born only for his parents, awaits the death appointed by fate, the natural death; but he who thinks that he was born also for his country, will be ready to die that he may not see his country enslaved.</quote> What Cicero seems to have called <quote>fate</quote> and <quote>nature,</quote> Demosthenes long before termed <quote>fate</quote> and <quote>the natural death.</quote> For <quote>a natural death</quote> is one which comes in the course of fate and nature, as it were, and is caused by no force from without.</p></div>  <pb n="v2.p.419"/>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THOSE who have had leisure and inclination to inquire into the life and times of learned men and hand them down to memory, have related the following anecdote of the tragic poets Marcus Pacuvius and Lucius Accius: <quote><hi rend="italic">Pacuvius,</hi></quote> they say, <quote>when already enfeebled by advanced age and constant bodily illness, had withdrawn from Rome to Tarentum.

<note>i.e. Gaius lulius Caesar.</note>

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THE philosopher Aristotle, being already nearly sixty-two years of age, was sickly and weak of body and had slender hope of life. Then the whole band of his disciples came to him, begging and entreating that he should himself choose a successor to his position and his office, to whom, as to himself, they might apply after his last day, to complete and perfect their knowledge of the studies into which he had initiated them. There were at the time in his school many good men, but two were conspicuous, Theophrastus and Eudemus, who excelled the rest in talent and learning. The former was from the island of Lesbos, but Eudemus from Rhodes. Aristotle replied that he would do what they asked, so soon as the opportunity came.</p>

<p>A little later, in the presence of the same men who had asked him to appoint a master, he said that the wine he was then drinking did not suit his health, but was unwholesome and harsh; that therefore they ought to look for a foreign wine, something either from Rhodes or from Lesbos. He asked them to procure both kinds for him, and said that he would use the one which he liked the better. They went, sought, found, brought. Then Aristotle asked for the Rhodian and tasting it said: <quote>This is truly a sound and pleasant wine.</quote> Then he called for the Lesbian. Tasting that also, he remarked: <quote>Both are very good indeed, but the Lesbian is the sweeter.</quote> When he said this, no one doubted that gracefully, and at the same time tactfully, he had  <pb n="v2.p.427"/>  by those words chosen his successor, not his wine. This was Theophrastus, from Lesbos, a man equally noted for the fineness of his eloquence and of his life. And when, not long after this, Aristotle died,

His words in that book are as follows:

<note>iii. 108.</note>
<quote>But the lioness, although a strong and most courageous animal, gives birth once only in her lifetime to one cub; for in giving birth she discharges her womb with the whelp.</quote> Homer, however, says that lions (for so he calls the females also, using the masculine or <quote>common</quote> (epicene) gender, as the grammarians call it) produce and rear many whelps. The verses in which he plainly says this are these:

<note><hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> xvii. 133.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>He stood, like to a lion before its young,</l> <l>Beset by hunters in a gloomy wood</l> <l part="I">And leading them away.</l></quote>  In another passage also he indicates the same thing:

<note><hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> xviii. 318.</note>
</p>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>With many a groan, like lion of strong beard,</l> <l>From which a hunter stole away its young</l> <l part="I">Amid dense woods.</l></quote>

<note>The passage is not quoted; see critical note. Aristotle tells us that the lioness gives birth to young every year, usually two, at most six, sometimes only one. The current idea that the womb is discharged with the young is absurd; it arose from the fact that lions are rare and that the inventor of the story did not know the real reason, which is that their habitat is of limited extent. The lionesses in Syria give birth five times, producing at first five cubs, then one less at each successive birth.</note>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THAT was a fine and true thought of the poet Afranius about the birth of Wisdom and the means of acquiring it, when he said that she was the daughter of Experience and Memory. For in that way he shows that one who wishes to be wise in human affairs does not need books alone or instruction in rhetoric and dialectics, but ought also to occupy and train himself in becoming intimately acquainted with and testing real life, and in firmly fixing in his memory all such acts and events; and accordingly he must learn wisdom and judgment from the teaching of actual experience, not from what books only, or masters, through vain words and fantasies, have foolishly represented as though in a farce or a dream. The verses of Afranius are in a Roman comedy called <hi rend="italic">The Chair:</hi>

<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>My sire Experience was, me Memory bore,</l> <l>In Greece called Sophia, Wisdom in Rome.</l></quote>  There is also a line of Pacuvius to about the same purport, which the philosopher Macedo, a good man and my intimate friend, thought ought to be written over the doors of all temples:

<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>I hate base men who preach philosophy.</l></quote>  For he said that nothing could be more shameful or insufferable than that idle, lazy folk, disguised with beard and cloak, should change the character and  <pb n="v2.p.433"/>  advantages of philosophy into tricks of the tongue and of words, and, themselves saturated with vices, should eloquently assail vice.</p>  </div>

<p>What Tullius Tiro wrote in his commentaries about the <hi rend="italic">Suculae,</hi> or <quote>Little Pigs,</quote> and the <hi rend="italic">Hyades,</hi> which are the names of constellations.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>TULLIUS TIRO was the pupil and freedman of Marcus Cicero and an assistant in his literary work. He wrote several books on the usage and theory of the Latin language and on miscellaneous questions of various kinds. Pre-eminent among these appear to be those to which he gave the Greek title <foreign xml:lang="grc">Pande/ktai,</foreign>

<note>Literally, all-embracing.</note>
implying that they included every kind of science and fact. In these he wrote the following about the stars which are called the <hi rend="italic">Suculae,</hi> or <quote>Little Pigs</quote>:

<note>pp. 7 ff. Lion.</note>
<quote>The early Romans,</quote> says he, <quote>were so ignorant of Grecian literature and so unfamiliar with the Greek language, that they called those stars which are in the head of the Bull <hi rend="italic">Suculae,</hi> or 'The Little Pigs,' because the Greeks call them <foreign xml:lang="grc">u(a/des</foreign>; for they supposed that Latin word to be a translation of the Greek name because <foreign xml:lang="grc">u(/es</foreign> in Greek is <hi rend="italic">sues</hi> in Latin. But the <foreign xml:lang="grc">u(a/des,</foreign></quote> says he, <quote>are so called, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ou)k a)po\ tw=n u(w=n</foreign> (that is, not from pigs), as our rude forefathers believed, but from the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">u(/ein</foreign>; for both when they rise and when they set they cause rainstorms and heavy showers. And <hi rend="italic">pluere,</hi> (to rain) is expressed in the Greek tongue by <foreign xml:lang="grc">u(/ein.</foreign></quote></p>

<p>So, indeed, Tiro in his <hi rend="italic">Pandects.</hi> But, as a matter of fact, our early writers were not such boors and  <pb n="v2.p.435"/>  crowns as to give to the stars called <hi rend="italic">hyades</hi> the name of <hi rend="italic">suculae,</hi> or <quote>little pigs,</quote> because <foreign xml:lang="grc">u(/es</foreign> are called <hi rend="italic">sues</hi> in Latin; but just as what the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">u(pe/r</foreign> we call <hi rend="italic">super,</hi> what they call <foreign xml:lang="grc">u(/ptios</foreign> we call <hi rend="italic">supinus,</hi> what they call <foreign xml:lang="grc">u(forbo/s</foreign> we call <hi rend="italic">subulcus,</hi> and finally, what they call <foreign xml:lang="grc">u(/pnos</foreign> we call first <hi rend="italic">sypnus,</hi> and then, because of the kinship of the Greek letter <hi rend="italic">y</hi> and the Latin <hi rend="italic">o, somnus</hi>—just so, what they call <foreign xml:lang="grc">u(a/des</foreign> were called by us, first <hi rend="italic">shades,</hi> and then <hi rend="italic">suculae.</hi></p>

<p>But the stars in question are not in the head of the Bull, as Tiro says, for except for those stars the Bull has no head; but they are so situated and arranged in the circle that is called the <quote>zodiac,</quote> that from their position they seem to present the appearance and semblance of a bull's head, just as the other parts, and the rest of the figure of the Bull, are formed and, as it were, pictured by the place and location of those stars which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">Pleia/des</foreign> and we, <hi rend="italic">Vergiliae.</hi></p>  </div>

<p>The derivation of <hi rend="italic">soror,</hi> according to Antistins Labeo, and that of <hi rend="italic">frater,</hi> according to Publius Nigidius.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>ANTISTIUS LABEO cultivated the study of civil law with special interest, and gave advice publicly to those who consulted him on legal questions; he was also not unacquainted with the other liberal arts, and he had delved deep into grammar and dialectics, as well as into the earlier and more recondite literature. He had also become versed in the origin and formation of Latin words, and applied that knowledge in particular to solving many knotty points of law. In fact, after his death works of his were published,  <pb n="v2.p.437"/>  which are entitled <hi rend="italic">Posteriores,</hi> of which three successive books, the thirty-eighth, thirty-ninth and fortieth, are full of information of that kind, tending to explain and illustrate the Latin language. Moreover, in the books which he wrote <hi rend="italic">On the Praetor's Edict</hi> he has included many observations, some of which are graceful and clever. Of such a kind is this, which we find written in the fourth book <hi rend="italic">On the Edict:</hi>

<note>Fr. 26, Huschke; 2, Bremer (ii, p. 85).</note>
<quote>A <hi rend="italic">soror,</hi> or 'sister,'</quote> he says, <quote>is so called because she is, as it were, born <hi rend="italic">seorsum,</hi> or ' outside,' and is separated from that home in which she was born, and transferred to another family.</quote>

<note>That is to say, by marriage.</note>
</p>

<p>Moreover, Publius Nigidius, a man of prodigious learning, explains the word <hi rend="italic">frater,</hi> or <quote>brother,</quote> by a no less clever and ingenious derivation:

<note>Fr. 50, Swoboda.</note>
<quote>A <hi rend="italic">frater,</hi></quote> he says, <quote>is so called because he is, as it were, <hi rend="italic">fere alter,</hi> that is, 'almost another self.'</quote>

<note>These derivations are, of course, purely fanciful; <hi rend="italic">soror</hi> and <hi rend="italic">frater</hi> are cognate with <quote>sister</quote> and <quote>brother,</quote> and are not of Latin derivation.</note>

<p>Marcus Varro's opinion of the just and proper number of banqueters; his views about the dessert and about sweetmeats.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THAT is a very charming book of Marcus Varro's, one of his <hi rend="italic">Menippean Satires,</hi> entitled <hi rend="italic">You know not what the Late Evening may Bring,</hi>

<note>Apparently a proverbial expression; cf. Virg. <hi rend="italic">Georg.</hi> i. 461, <hi rend="italic">Denique, quid vesper serus vehat . .. sol tibi signa dabit.</hi></note>
in which he descants upon the proper number of guests at a dinner, and about the order and arrangement of the entertainment itself. Now he says

<note>Fr. 333, Bücheler.</note>
that the number of the guests ought to begin with that of the Graces and end with that of the Muses; that is,  <pb n="v2.p.439"/>  it should begin with three and stop at nine, so that when the guests are fewest, they should not be less than three, when they are most numerous, not more than nine. <quote>For it is disagreeable to have a great number, since a crowd is generally disorderly,

<note>There is a word-play on <hi rend="italic">turba</hi> and <hi rend="italic">turbulenta,</hi> which it seems difficult to reproduce. Cf. Ausonius, p. 12, 146, Peiper; i., p. 22, <hi rend="italic">L. C. L.:</hi> <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Quinque advocavi; sex enim convivium</l> <l>Cum rege iustum; si super, convicium est.</l></quote></note>
and at Rome it stands,

<note>Referring to <hi rend="italic">turba</hi> as the throng of citizens in public assembly.</note>
at Athens it sits, but nowhere does it recline. Now, the banquet itself,</quote> he continues, <quote>has four features, and then only is it complete in all its parts: if a nice little group has been got together, if the place is well chosen, the time fit, and due preparation not neglected. Moreover, one should not,</quote> he says, <quote>invite either too talkative or too silent guests, since eloquence is appropriate to the Forum and the courts, but silence to the bed-chamber and not to a dinner.</quote> He thinks, then, that the conversation at such a time ought not to be about anxious and perplexing affairs, but diverting and cheerful, combining profit with a certain interest and pleasure, such conversation as tends to make our character more refined and agreeable. <quote>This will surely follow,</quote> he says, <quote>if we talk about matters which relate to the common experience of life, which we have no leisure to discuss in the Forum and amid the press of business. Furthermore, the host,</quote> he says, <quote>ought rather to be free from meanness than over-elegant,</quote> and, he adds: <quote>At a banquet not everything should be read,

<note>Readings or music were common forms of entertainment at a Roman dinner (cf. <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> Pliny, <hi rend="italic">Epist.</hi> iii. 1. 9). <hi rend="italic">Legi,</hi> however, may have the meaning of <hi rend="italic">legere</hi> in § 3 (end), in which case the reference would be to the viands and <foreign xml:lang="grc">biwfelh=</foreign> would mean <quote>wholesome.</quote></note>
but such things as are at once edifying and enjoyable.</quote></p>  <pb n="v2.p.441"/>

<p>And he does not omit to tell what the nature of the dessert ought to be. For he uses these words: <quote>Those sweetmeats (<hi rend="italic">bellaria</hi>) are sweetest which are not sweet;

<note>An example of Varro's fondness for word-plays; <quote>sweetest</quote> is used in the double sense of sweetest to the taste and pleasantest in their after-effects.</note>
for harmony between delicacies and digestion is not to be counted upon.</quote></p>

<p>That no one may be puzzled by the word <hi rend="italic">bellaria</hi> which Varro uses in this passage, let me say that it means all kinds of dessert. For what the Greeks called <foreign xml:lang="grc">pe/mmata</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">tragh/mata,</foreign> our forefathers called <hi rend="italic">bellaria.</hi>

<p>That the tribunes of the commons have the right to arrest, but not to summon.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>IN one of the letters of Ateius Capito we read

<note>Fr. 19, Huschke: ii. p. 287, Bremer.</note>
that Antistius Labeo was exceedingly learned in the laws and customs of the Roman people and in the civil law. <quote>But,</quote> he adds, <quote>an excessive and mad love of freedom possessed the man, to such a degree that, although the deified Augustus was then emperor and was ruling the State, Labeo looked upon nothing as lawful and accepted nothing, unless he had found it ordered and sanctioned by the old Roman law.</quote> He then goes on to relate the reply of this same Labeo, when he was summoned by the messenger of a tribune of the commons. He says: <quote>When the tribunes of the commons had been appealed to by a woman against Labeo and had sent to him at  <pb n="v2.p.443"/>  the Gallianum

<note>Probably Labeo's country place. He spent half the year in retirement (<hi rend="italic">Dig.</hi> i. 2. 2.47), and <hi rend="italic">praedia Galliana</hi> are mentioned in <hi rend="italic">C.I.L.</hi> iii. 536, and ix. 1455, col. iii, lines 62—64.</note>
bidding him come and answer the woman's charge, he ordered the messenger to return and say to the tribunes that they had the right to summon neither him nor anyone else, since according to the usage of our forefathers the tribunes of the commons had the power of arrest, but not of summons; that they might therefore come and order his arrest, but they did not have the right to summon him when absent.</quote></p>

<p>Having read this in that letter of Capito's, I later found the same statement made more fully in the twenty-first book of Varro's <hi rend="italic">Human Antiquities,</hi> and I have added Varro's own words on the subject:

<note>Fr. 2, Mirsch.</note>
<quote>In a magistracy</quote> says he, <quote>some have the power of summons, others of arrest, others neither; summoning, for example, belongs to the consuls and others possessing the <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi>

<note>The right of commanding an army conferred by the <hi rend="italic">Lex Curiata de imperio</hi> on the dictator, consuls, <hi rend="italic">magister equitum</hi> and praetors.</note>
; arrest, to the tribunes of the commons and the rest who are attended by a messenger; neither summoning nor arrest to the quaestors and others who have neither a lictor nor a messenger. Those who have the power of summons may also arrest, detail, and lead off to prison, all this whether those whom they summon are present or are sent for by their order. The tribunes of the commons have no power of summons, nevertheless many of them in ignorance have used that power, as if they were entitled to it; for some of them have ordered, not only private persons, but even a consul to be summoned before the rostra. I myself, when a triumvir,

<note>That is, one of the <hi rend="italic">triumviri capitales,</hi> a minor office.</note>
on being summoned by Porcius, tribune of the commons, did not appear, following the authority of our leading men, but I held to the old law. Similarly, when I was a tribune, I ordered  <pb n="v2.p.445"/>  no one to be summoned, and required no one who was summoned by one of my colleagues to obey, unless he wished.</quote></p>

<p>I think that Labeo, being a private citizen at the time,

<note>That is, he had not yet held a magisterial office.</note>
showed unjustified confidence in that law of which Marcus Varro has written, in not appearing when summoned by the tribunes. For how the mischief was it reasonable to refuse to obey those whom you admit to have the power of arrest? For one who can lawfully be arrested may also be taken to prison. But since we are inquiring why the tribunes, who had full power of coercion, did not have the right to summon ...

<note>There seems to be a lacuna in the text. Supply <quote>we may assume that it was,</quote> or something similar.</note>
because the tribunes of the commons seem to have been elected in early times, not for administering justice, nor for taking cognizance of suits and complaints when the parties were absent, but for using their veto-power when there was immediate need, in order to prevent injustice from being done before their eyes; and for that reason the right of leaving the city at night was denied them, since their constant presence and personal oversight were needed to prevent acts of violence.</p>  </div>

<p>That it is stated in Marcus Varro's books on <hi rend="italic">Human Antiquities</hi> that the aediles and quaestors of the Roman people might be cited before a praetor by a private citizen.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>WHEN from the secluded retreat of books and masters I had come forth among men and into the light of the forum, I remember that it was the  <pb n="v2.p.447"/>  subject of inquiry in many of the quarters frequented by those who gave public instruction in law, or offered counsel, whether a quaestor of the Roman people could be cited by a praetor. Moreover, this was not discussed merely as an academic question, but an actual instance of the kind had chanced to arise, in which a quaestor was to be called into court. Now, not a few men thought that the praetor did not have the right to summon him, since he was beyond question a magistrate of the Roman people and could neither be summoned, nor if he refused to appear could he be taken and arrested without impairing the dignity of the office itself which he held. But since at that time I was immersed in the books of Marcus Varro, as soon as I found that this matter was the subject of doubt and inquiry, I took down

<note>From his bookcase.</note>
the twenty-first book of his <hi rend="italic">Human Antiquities,</hi> in which the following is written:

<note>Fr. 3, Mirsch.</note>
<quote>It is lawful for those magistrates who have the power neither of summoning the people as individuals nor of arrest, even to be called into court by a private citizen. Marcus Laevinus, a curule aedile, was cited before a praetor by a private citizen; to-day, surrounded as they are by public servants, aediles not only may not be arrested, but even presume to disperse the people.</quote></p>

<p>This is what Varro says in the part of his work which concerns the aediles, but in an earlier part of the same book he says

<note>See xiii. 12. 6, above.</note>
that quaestors have the right neither to summon nor to arrest. Accordingly, when both parts of the book had been read, all came over to Varro's opinion, and the quaestor was summoned before the praetor.</p>  <pb n="v2.p.449"/>  </div>

<p>The meaning of <hi rend="italic">pomerium.</hi></p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THE augurs of the Roman people who wrote books <hi rend="italic">On the Auspices</hi> have defined the meaning of pomerium in the following terms: <quote>The pomerium is the space within the rural district designated by the augurs along the whole circuit of the city without the walls, marked off by fixed bounds and forming the limit of the city auspices.</quote>

<note>That is to say, the <hi rend="italic">pomerium</hi> separated the <hi rend="italic">ager Romanus,</hi> or country district, from the city. The auspices could be taken only within the <hi rend="italic">pomerium.</hi> When a furrow was drawn and the earth turned inward to mark the line of the city walls, the furrow represented the <hi rend="italic">pomerium.</hi> On the derivation of the word see <hi rend="italic">T.A.P.A.</hi> xliv. 19 ff.</note>
Now, the most ancient pomerium, which was established by Romulus, was bounded by the foot of the Palatine hill. But that pomerium, as the republic grew, was extended several times and included many lofty hills. Moreover, whoever had increased the domain of the Roman people by land taken from an enemy had the right to enlarge the pomerium.</p>

<p>Therefore it has been, and even now continues to be, inquired why it is that when the other six of the seven hills of the city are within the pomerium, the Aventine alone, which is neither a remote nor an unfrequented district, should be outside the pomerium; and why neither king Servius Tullius nor Sulla, who demanded the honour of extending the pomerium, nor later the deified Julius, when he enlarged the pomerium, included this within the designated limits of the city.</p>

<p>Messala wrote

<note>Fr. 3, Huschke; id., Bremer (ii, p. 265).</note>
that there seemed to be several reasons for this, but above them all he himself approved one, namely, because on that hill Remus took the auspices with regard to founding the city, but found the birds unpropitious and was less  <pb n="v2.p.451"/>  successful in his augury than Romulus. <quote>Therefore,</quote> says he, <quote>all those who extended the pomerium excluded that hill, on the ground that it was made ill-omened by inauspicious birds.</quote></p>

<p>But speaking of the Aventine hill, I thought I ought not to omit something which I ran across recently in the <hi rend="italic">Commentary</hi> of Elys,

<note>The name is obviously corrupt; see critical note.</note>
an early grammarian. In this it was written that in earlier times the Aventine was, as we have said, excluded from the pomerium, but afterwards by the authority of the deified Claudius it was admitted and honoured with a place within the limits of the pomerium.</p>  </div>

<p>A passage from the book of the augur Messala, in which he shows who the minor magistrates are and that the consul and the praetor are colleagues; and certain observations besides on the auspices.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>IN the edict of the consuls by which they appoint the day for the centuriate assembly it is written in accordance with an old established form: <quote>Let no minor magistrate presume to watch the skies.</quote>

<note>That is, for omens.</note>
Accordingly, the question is often asked who the minor magistrates are. On this subject there is

<note>This and the following verbs seem to be in epistolary past tenses; that is, Gellius uses the tenses which would represent the time from the standpoint of his future readers.</note>
no need for words of mine, since by good fortune the first book of the augur Messala <hi rend="italic">On Auspices</hi> is at hand, when I am writing this. Therefore I quote from that book Messala's own words:

<note>Fr. 1, Huschke; 1<hi rend="sup">a</hi>, Bremer (i, p. 263).</note>
<quote>The auspices of the patricians are divided into two classes. The  <pb n="v2.p.453"/>  greatest are those of the consuls, praetors and censors. Yet the auspices of all these are not the same or of equal rank, for the reason that the censors are not colleagues of the consuls or praetors,

<note>Explained in § 6, below.</note>
while the praetors are colleagues of the consuls. Therefore neither do the consuls or the praetors interrupt or hinder the auspices of the censors, nor the censors those of the praetors and consuls; but the censors may vitiate and hinder each other's auspices and again the praetors and consuls those of one another. The praetor, although he is a colleague of the consul, cannot lawfully elect either a praetor or a consul, as indeed we have learned from our forefathers, or from what has been observed in the past, and as is shown in the thirteenth book of the <hi rend="italic">Commentaries</hi> of Gaius Tuditanus;

<note>Fr. 8, Peter<hi rend="sup">2</hi>; 2, Huschke; id., Bremer (i, p. 35).</note>
for the praetor has inferior authority and the consul superior, and a higher authority cannot be elected by a lower, or a superior colleague by an inferior. At the present time, when a praetor elects the praetors, I have followed the authority of the men of old and have not taken part in the auspices at such elections. Also the censors are not chosen under the same auspices as the consuls and praetors. The lesser auspices belong to the other magistrates. Therefore these are called 'lesser' and the others 'greater' magistrates. When the lesser magistrates are elected, their office is conferred upon them by the assembly of the tribes, but full powers by a law of the assembly of the <hi rend="italic">curiae;</hi> the higher magistrates are chosen by the assembly of the centuries.</quote>

<note>On these <hi rend="italic">comitia</hi> see xv. 27, below.</note>
</p>

<p>From this whole passage of Messala it becomes clear both who the lesser magistrates are and why they are so called. But he also shows that the praetor  <pb n="v2.p.455"/>  is a colleague of the consul, because they are chosen under the same auspices. Moreover, they are said to possess the greater auspices, because their auspices are esteemed more highly than those of the others.</p>  </div>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THE same Messala in the same book has written as follows about the lesser magistrates

<quote>A consul may call away the people from all magistrates, when they are assembled for the elections or for another purpose. A praetor may at any time call away the people when assembled for the elections or for another purpose, except from a consul. Lesser magistrates may never call away the people when assembled for the elections or another purpose. Hence, whoever of them first summons the people to an election has the law on his side, because it is unlawful to take the same action twice with the people (<hi rend="italic">bifariam cum populo agi</hi>), nor can one minor magistrate call away an assembly from another. But if they wish to address the people (<hi rend="italic">contionem habere</hi>) without laying any measure before them, it is lawful for any number of magistrates to hold a meeting (<hi rend="italic">contionem habere</hi>) at the same time.</quote> From these words of Messala it is clear that <hi rend="italic">cum populo agere,</hi> <quote>to treat with the people,</quote> differs from <hi rend="italic">contionem habere,</hi> <quote>to address the people.</quote> For the former means to ask something of the people  <pb n="v2.p.457"/>  which they by their votes are to order or forbid; the latter, to speak to the people without laying any measure before them.</p>  </div>

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THERE is a speech by Marcus Cato Censorius <hi rend="italic">On the Improper Election of Aediles.</hi> In that oration is this passage:

<note>lxv. 1, Jordan.</note>
<quote>Nowadays they say that the standing-grain, still in the blade, is a good harvest. Do not count too much upon it. I have often heard that many things may come <hi rend="italic">inter os atque offam,</hi> or 'between the mouth and the morsel'; but there certainly is a long distance between a morsel and the blade.</quote> Erucius Clarus, who was prefect of the city and twice consul, a man deeply interested in the customs and literature of early days, wrote to Sulpicius Apollinaris, the most learned man within my memory, begging and entreating that he would write him the meaning of those words. Then, in my presence, for at that time I was a young man in Rome and was in attendance upon him for purposes of instruction, Apollinaris replied to Clarus very briefly, as was natural when writing to a man of learning, that <quote>between mouth and morsel</quote> was an old proverb, meaning the same as the poetic Greek adage:  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>'Twixt cup and lip there's many a slip.</l></quote></p>  <pb n="v2.p.461"/>  </div>

<p>That Plato attributes a line of Sophocles to Euripides; and some other matters of the same kind.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THERE is an iambic trimeter verse of notorious antiquity:  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>By converse with the wise wax tyrants wise.</l></quote>  This verse Plato in his <hi rend="italic">Theaetetus</hi>

<note>Really <hi rend="italic">Theages</hi> 6, p. 125 B.</note>
attributes to Euripides. I am very much surprised at this; for I have met it in the tragedy of Sophocles entitled <hi rend="italic">Ajax the Locrian</hi>

<note>Fr. 13, Nauck<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
and Sophocles was born before Euripides.</p>

<p>But the following line is equally well known:  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>I who am old shall lead you, also old.</l></quote>  And this is found both in a tragedy of Sophocles, of which the title is <hi rend="italic">Phthiotides,</hi>

<note>Id. 633.</note>
and in the <hi rend="italic">Bacchae</hi> of Euripides.

<note>193.</note>
</p>

<p>I have further observed that in the <hi rend="italic">Fire-bringing Prometheus</hi> of Aeschylus and in the tragedy of Euripides entitled <hi rend="italic">Ino</hi> an identical verse occurs, except for a few syllables. In Aeschylus it runs thus:

<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>When proper, keeping silent, and saying what is fit.</l></quote>  In Euripides thus:

<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>When proper, keeping silent, speaking when 'tis safe.</l></quote>  But Aeschylus was considerably the earlier writer.

<note>According to tradition Euripides was born on the day of the battle of Salamis (480 B.C.), Aeschylus took part in the fight, and Sophocles, then about sixteen years old, figured in the celebration of the victory.

<p>Of the lineage and names of the Porcian family.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>WHEN Sulpicius Apollinaris and I, with some others who were friends of his or mine, were sitting in the library of the Palace of Tiberius, it chanced that a book was brought to us bearing the name of Marcus Cato Nepos. We at once began to inquire who this Marcus Cato Nepos was. And thereupon a young man, not unacquainted with letters, so far as I could judge from his language, said: <quote>This Marcus Cato is called Nepos, not as a surname, but because he was the grandson of Marcus Cato Censorius through his son, and father of Marcus Cato the ex-praetor, who slew himself with his own sword at Utica during the civil war. There is a book of Marcus Cicero's about the life of the last-named, entitled <hi rend="italic">Laus Catonis,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">A Eulogy of Cato,</hi> in which Cicero says

<note>Fr. 1, p. 987, Orelli<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
that he was the great-grandson of Marcus Cato Censorius. Therefore the father of the man whom Cicero eulogized was this Marcus Cato, whose orations are circulated under the name of Marcus Cato Nepos.</quote></p>

<p>Then Apollinaris. very quietly and mildly, as was his custom when passing criticism, said: <quote>I congratulate you, my son, that at your age you have been able to favour us with a little lecture on the family of Cato, even though you do not know who this Marcus Cato was, about whom we are now inquiring. For the famous Marcus Cato Censorius had not one, but several grandsons, although not all were sprung from the same father. For the famous Marcus Cato, who was both an orator and  <pb n="v2.p.465"/>  a censor, had two sons, born of different mothers and of very different ages; since, when one of them was a young man, his mother died and his father, who was already well on in years, married the maiden daughter of his client Salonius, from whom was born to him Marcus Cato Salonianus, a surname which he derived from Salonius, his mother's father. But from Cato's elder son, who died when praetorelect, while his father was still living, and left some admirable works on <hi rend="italic">The Science of Law,</hi> there was born the man about whom we are inquiring, Marcus Cato, son of Marcus, and grandson of Marcus. He was an orator of some power and left many speeches written in the manner of his grandfather; he was consul with Quintus Marcius Rex, and during his consulship went to Africa and died in that province. But he was not, as you said he was, the father of Marcus Cato the ex-praetor, who killed himself at Utica and whom Cicero eulogized; nor because he was the grandson of Cato the censor and Cato of Utica was the censor's great-grandson does it necessarily follow that the former was the father of the latter. For this grandson whose speech was just brought to us did, it is true, have a son called Marcus Cato, but he was not the Cato who died at Utica, but the one who, after being curule aedile and praetor, went to Gallia Narbonensis and there ended his life. But by that other son of Censorius, a far younger man, who, as I said, was surnamed Salonianus, two sons were begotten: Lucius and Marcus Cato. That Marcus Cato was tribune of the commons and died when a candidate for the praetorship; he begot Marcus Cato the ex-praetor, who committed suicide at Utica during the civil war, and when Marcus  <pb n="v2.p.467"/>  Tullius wrote the latter's life and panegyric he said that he was the great-grandson of Cato the censor. You see therefore that the branch of the family which is descended from Cato's younger son differs not only in its pedigree, but in its dates as well; for because that Salonianus was born near the end of his father's life, as I said, his descendants also were considerably later than those of his elder brother. This difference in dates you will readily perceive from that speech itself, when you read it.</quote></p>

<p>Thus spoke Sulpicius Apollinaris in my hearing. Later we found that what he had said was so, when we read the <hi rend="italic">Funeral Eulogies</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Genealogy of the Porcian Family.</hi></p>  </div>

<p>That the most elegant writers pay more attention to the pleasing sound of words and phrases (what the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">eu)fwni/a,</foreign> or <quote>euphony</quote>) than to the rules and precepts devised by the grammarians.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>VALERIUS PROBUS was once asked, as I learned from one of his friends, whether one ought to say <hi rend="italic">has urbis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">has urbes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">hanc turrem.</hi> or <hi rend="italic">hanc turrim.</hi> <quote>If,</quote> he replied, <quote>you are either composing verse or writing prose and have to use those words, pay no attention to the musty, fusty rules of the grammarians, but consult your own ear as to what is to be said in any given place. What it favours will surely be the best.</quote> Then the one who had asked the question said: <quote>What do you mean by 'consult my ear'?</quote> and he told me that Probus answered: <quote>Just as Vergil did his, when in different passages  <pb n="v2.p.469"/>  he has used <hi rend="italic">urbis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">urbes,</hi> following the taste and judgment of his ear. For in the first <hi rend="italic">Georgic,</hi> which,</quote> said he, <quote>I have read in a copy corrected by the poet's own hand, he wrote <hi rend="italic">urbis</hi> with an <hi rend="italic">i.</hi> These are the words of the verses:

<note><hi rend="italic">Georg.</hi> i. 25.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>O'er cities (<hi rend="italic">urbis</hi>) if you choose to watch, and rule</l> <l part="I">Our lands, O Caesar great.</l></quote>  But turn and change it so as to read <hi rend="italic">urbes,</hi> and somehow you will make it duller and heavier. On the other hand, in the third <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> he wrote <hi rend="italic">urbes</hi> with an <hi rend="italic">e:</hi>

<note><hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> iii. 106.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>An hundred mighty cities (<hi rend="italic">urbes</hi>) they inhabit.</l></quote>  Change this too so as to read <hi rend="italic">urbis</hi> and the word will be too slender and colourless, so great indeed is the different effect of combination in the harmony of neighbouring sounds. Moreover, Vergil also said <hi rend="italic">turrim,</hi> not <hi rend="italic">turrem,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">securim,</hi> not <hi rend="italic">securem:</hi>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>A turret (<hi rend="italic">turrim</hi>) on sheer edge standing,

<note><hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> ii. 460.</note>
</l></quote>  and  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Has shaken from his neck the ill-aimed axe (securim).

<note><hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> ii. 224.</note>
</l></quote>  These words have, I think, a more agreeable lightness than if you should use the form in <hi rend="italic">e</hi> in both places.</quote> But the one who had asked the question, a boorish fellow surely and with untrained ear, said: <quote>I don't just understand why you say that one form is better and more correct in one place and the other in the other.</quote> Then Probus, now somewhat impatient, retorted: <quote>Don't trouble then to inquire whether you ought to say <hi rend="italic">urbis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">urbes.</hi> For since  <pb n="v2.p.471"/>  you are the kind of man that I see you are and err without detriment to yourself, you will lose nothing whichever you say.</quote></p>

<p>With these words then and this conclusion Probus dismissed the man, somewhat rudely, as was his way with stupid folk. But I afterwards found another similar instance of double spelling by Vergil. For he has used <hi rend="italic">tres</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tris</hi> in the same passage with such fineness of taste, that if you should read differently and change one for the other, and have any ear at all, you would perceive that the sweetness of the sound is spoiled. These are the lines, from the tenth book of the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid:</hi>

<note><hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> x. 350.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Three (<hi rend="italic">tres</hi>) Thracians too from Boreas' distant race,</l> <l>And three (<hi rend="italic">iris</hi>) whom Idas sent from Ismarus' land.</l></quote>  In one place he has <hi rend="italic">tres,</hi> in the other <hi rend="italic">tris;</hi> weigh and ponder both, and you will find that each sounds most suitable in its own place. But also in this line of Vergil,

<note><hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> ii. 554.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>This end (<hi rend="italic">haec finis</hi>) to Priam's fortunes then,</l></quote>  if you change <hi rend="italic">haec</hi> and say <hi rend="italic">hic finis,</hi> it will be hard and unrhythmical and your ears will shrink from the change. Just as, on the contrary, you would make the following verse of Vergil less sweet, if you were to change it:

<note><hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> i. 241.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>What end (<hi rend="italic">quem finem</hi>) of labours, great king, dost thou grant?</l></quote>  For if you should say <hi rend="italic">quam das finem,</hi> you would somehow make the sound of the words harsh and somewhat weak.</p>  <pb n="v2.p.473"/>

<p>Ennius too spoke of <hi rend="italic">rectos cupressos,</hi> or <quote>straight cypresses,</quote> contrary to the accepted gender of that word, in the following verse: <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>On cliffs the nodding pine and cypress straight.

<note><hi rend="italic">Ann.</hi> 490, Vahlen.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Ennius also has <hi rend="italic">longi cupressi</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Ann.</hi> 262.</note>
</l></quote>  The sound of the word, I think, seemed to him stronger and more vigorous, if he said <hi rend="italic">rectos cupressos</hi> rather than <hi rend="italic">rectas.</hi> But, on the other hand, this same Ennius in the eighteenth book of his <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi>

<note><hi rend="italic">Ann.</hi> 454, Vahlen<hi rend="sup">2</hi>, cf. ii. 26. 4.</note>
said <hi rend="italic">aere fulva</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">fulvo,</hi> not merely because Homer said <foreign xml:lang="grc">h)e/ra baqei=a,</foreign>

<note><hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> xx. 446; xxi. 6.</note>
but because this sound, I think, seemed more sonorous and agreeable.</p>

<p>In the same way Marcus Cicero also thought it smoother and more polished to write, in his fifth <hi rend="italic">Oration against Verres,</hi>

<note>ii. 5. 169.</note>
<hi rend="italic"> fretiu</hi> rather than <hi rend="italic">freto.</hi> He says <quote>divided by a narrow strait (<hi rend="italic">fretu</hi>)</quote>; for it would have been heavier and more archaic to say <hi rend="italic">perangusto freto.</hi> Also in his second <hi rend="italic">Oration against Verres,</hi> making use of a like rhythm, he said

<note>ii. 2. 191.</note>
<quote>by an evident sin,</quote> using <hi rend="italic">peccatu</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">peccato;</hi> for I find this written in one or two of Tiro's copies, of very trustworthy antiquity. These are Cicero's words: <quote>No one lived in such a way that no part of his life was free from extreme disgrace, no one was detected in such manifest sin (<hi rend="italic">peccatu</hi>) that while he had been shameless in committing it, he would seem even more shameless if he denied it.</quote></p>

<p>Not only is the sound of this word more elegant in this passage, but the reason for using the word is definite and sound. For <hi rend="italic">hic peccatus,</hi> equivalent to <hi rend="italic">peccatio,</hi> is correct and good Latin, just as many of the early writers used <hi rend="italic">incestus</hi> (criminal), not of the one who committed the crime, but of the crime  <pb n="v2.p.475"/>  itself, and <hi rend="italic">tributus,</hi> where we say <hi rend="italic">tributum</hi> (tribute). <hi rend="italic">Adlegatus</hi> (instigation) too and <hi rend="italic">arbitratus</hi> (judgment) are used for <hi rend="italic">adlegatio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">arbitratio,</hi> and preserving these forms we say <hi rend="italic">arbitratu</hi> and <hi rend="italic">adlegatu meo.</hi> So then Cicero said <hi rend="italic">in manifesto peccatu,</hi> as the early writers said <hi rend="italic">in manifesto incestu,</hi> not that it was not good Latin to say <hi rend="italic">peccato,</hi> but because in that context the use of <hi rend="italic">peccatu</hi> was finer and smoother to the ear.</p>

<p>With equal regard for our ears Lucretius made <hi rend="italic">funis</hi> feminine in these verses:

<note>ii. 1153.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>No golden rope (<hi rend="italic">aurea funis</hi>), methinks, let down from heaven</l> <l part="I">The race of mortals to this earth of ours,</l></quote>  although with equally good rhythm he might have used the more common <hi rend="italic">aureus funis</hi> and written: <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Aureus e caelo demisit funis in arva.</l></quote></p>

<p>Marcus Cicero calls

<note><hi rend="italic">In Verr.</hi> iv. 99.</note>
even priests by a feminine term, <hi rend="italic">antistitae,</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">antislites,</hi> which is demanded by the grammarians' rule. For while he usually avoided the obsolete words used by the earlier writers, yet in this passage, pleased with the sound of the word, he said: <quote>The priests of Ceres and the guardians (<hi rend="italic">antistitae</hi>) of her shrine.</quote> To such a degree have writers in some cases followed neither reason nor usage in choosing a word, but only the ear, which weighs words according to its own standards.

<note>cf. Hor. <hi rend="italic">Epist.</hi> i. 7. 98.</note>
<quote>And as for those who do not feel this,</quote> says Marcus Cicero himself,

<note><hi rend="italic">Orat.</hi> 168.</note>
when speaking about appropriate and rhythmical language, <quote>I know not what ears they have, or what there is in them resembling a man.</quote></p>  <pb n="v2.p.477"/>

<p>But the early grammarians have noted this feature in Homer above all, that when he had said in one place

<note><hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> xvi. 583.</note>
<foreign xml:lang="grc">koloiou/s te yhra/s te,</foreign> <quote>both crows and starlings,</quote> in another place

<note><hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> xvii. 755.</note>
he did not use <foreign xml:lang="grc">yhrw=n te,</foreign> but <foreign xml:lang="grc">yarw=n</foreign>: <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>As lights a cloud of starlings (<foreign xml:lang="grc">yarw=n</foreign>) or of daws,</l></quote>  not conforming to general usage, but seeking the pleasing effect peculiar to the word in each of the two positions; for if you change one of these for the other, you will give both a harsh sound.</p>  </div>

<p>The words of Titus Castricius to his young pupils on unbecoming clothes and shoes.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>TITUS CASTRICIUS, a teacher of the art of rhetoric, who held the first rank at Rome as a declaimer and an instructor, a man of the greatest influence and dignity, was highly regarded also by the deified Hadrian for his character and his learning. Once when 1 happened to be with him (for I attended him as my master) and he had seen some pupils of his who were senators wearing tunics and cloaks on a holiday, and with sandals on their feet,

<note>Instead of the senatorial shoe; this was red or black and was fastened on by four black thongs which passed crosswise around the ankle and the calf of the leg; of Hor. <hi rend="italic">Sat.</hi> i. 6. 27.</note>
he said: <quote>For my part, I should have preferred to see you in your togas, or if that was too much trouble, at least with girdles and mantles. But if this present attire of yours is now pardonable from long custom, yet it is not at all seemly for you, who are senators of the Roman people, to go through the streets of the city  <pb n="v2.p.479"/>  in sandals, nor by Jove! is this less criminal in you than it was in one whom Marcus Tullius once reproved for such attire.</quote></p>

<p>This, and some other things to the same purport, Castricius said in my hearing with true Roman austerity. But several of those who had heard him asked why he had said <hi rend="italic">soleatos,</hi> or <quote>in sandals,</quote> of those who wore <hi rend="italic">gallicae,</hi> or <quote>Gallic slippers,</quote> and not <hi rend="italic">soleae.</hi> But Castricius certainly spoke purely and properly; for in general all kinds of foot-gear which cover only the bottom of the soles, leaving the rest almost bare, and are bound on by slender thongs, are called <hi rend="italic">soleae,</hi> or sometimes by the Greek <hi rend="italic">word</hi> <hi rend="italic">crepidulae.</hi> But <hi rend="italic">gallicae,</hi> I think, is a new word, which came into use not long before the time of Marcus Cicero. In fact, he himself uses it in his second <hi rend="italic">Oration against Antony:</hi>

<note><hi rend="italic">Phil.</hi> ii. 76.</note>
<quote>You ran about,</quote> says lie, <quote>in slippers (<hi rend="italic">gallicis</hi>) and cloak.</quote> Nor do I find this word with that meaning in any other writer—a writer of high authority, that is; but, as I have said, they called that kind of shoe <hi rend="italic">crepidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">crepidulae,</hi> shortening the first syllable of the Greek word <foreign xml:lang="grc">krhpi=des,</foreign> and the makers of such shoes they termed <hi rend="italic">crepidarii.</hi> Sempronius Asellio in the fourteenth book of his <hi rend="italic">Histories</hi> says:

<p>Of the Nerio of Mars in ancient prayers.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>PRAYERS to the immortal gods, which are offered according to the Roman ritual, are set forth in the  <pb n="v2.p.481"/>  books of the priests of the Roman people, as well as in many early books of prayers. In these we find: <quote>Lua,

<note>These names apparently represented characteristics of the deities with which they are coupled, which in some cases later became separate goddesses; see Fowler, <hi rend="italic">Roman Festivals,</hi> pp. 60 ff. Gellius is apparently right in his explanation of Nerio in §§ 7–10, while later myths made her the wife of Mars. Lua (cf. <hi rend="italic">luo,</hi> <quote>purify</quote>), according to Livy xlv. 33. 2, was a goddess to whom, in company with Mars and Minerva, the captured arms of an enemy were devoted when they were burned by the victors. Salacia (cf. <hi rend="italic">sal,</hi> <quote>salt one</quote>) was a sea-goddess. Hora, according to Nonius, p. 120, was a goddess of youth. Ovid, <hi rend="italic">Met.</hi> xiv. 830- 851, says that it was the name given to Hersilia, the wife of Romulus, after her deification. For the other names see the Index.</note>
of Saturn; Salacia, of Neptune; Hora, of Quirinus; the Virites of Quirinus; Maia of Vulcan; Heries of Juno; Moles of Mars, and Nerio of Mars.</quote> Of these I hear most people pronounce the one which I have put last with a long initial syllable, as the Greeks pronounce <foreign xml:lang="grc">Nhrei/+des</foreign> (<quote>Nereids</quote>). But those who have spoken correctly made the first syllable short and lengthened the third. For the nominative case of the word, as it is written in the books of early writers, is <hi rend="italic">Nerio,</hi> although Marcus Varro, in his <hi rend="italic">Menippean Satire</hi> entitled <foreign xml:lang="grc">Skiomaxi/a,</foreign> or <quote>Battle of the Shadows,</quote> uses in the vocative <hi rend="italic">Nericnes,</hi> not <hi rend="italic">Nerio,</hi> in the following verses:

<note>Frag. 506, Bücheler.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Thee, Anna and Peranna, Panda Cela, Pales,</l> <l>Nerienes and Minerva, Fortune and likewise Ceres.</l></quote>  From which it necessarily follows that the nominative case is the same. But <hi rend="italic">Nerio</hi> was declined by our forefathers like <hi rend="italic">Atnio;</hi> for, as they said <hi rend="italic">Aniēnem</hi> with the third syllable long, so they did <hi rend="italic">Neriēnem.</hi> Furthermore, that word, whether it be <hi rend="italic">Nerio</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Nerienes,</hi> is Sabine and signifies valour and courage. Hence among the Claudii, who we are told sprang from the Sabines, whoever was of eminent and surpassing courage was called <hi rend="italic">Nero.</hi>

<note>See Suet. <hi rend="italic">Tib.</hi> i. 2.</note>
But the Sabines  <pb n="v2.p.483"/>  seem to have derived this word from the Greeks, who call the sinews and ligaments of the limbs <foreign xml:lang="grc">neu=ra,</foreign> whence we also in Latin call them <hi rend="italic">nervi.</hi> Therefore <hi rend="italic">Nerio</hi> designates the strength and power of Mars and a certain majesty of the War-god.</p>

<p>Plautus, however, in the <hi rend="italic">Truculentus</hi> says

<note>515.</note>
that Nerio is the wife of Mars, and puts the statement into the mouth of a soldier, in the following line:  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Mars, coming home, greets his wife Nerio.</l></quote></p>

<p>About this line I once heard a man of some repute say that Plautus, with too great an eye to comic effect, attributed this strange and false idea, of thinking that Nerio was the wife of Mars, to an ignorant and rude soldier. But whoever will read the third book of the <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi> of Gnaeus Gellius will find that this passage shows learning, rather than a comic spirit; for there it is written that Hersilia, when she pleaded before Titus Tatius and begged for peace, prayed in these words:

<note>Fr. 15, Peter<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
<quote>Neria of Mars, I beseech thee, give us peace; I beseech thee that it be permitted us to enjoy lasting and happy marriages, since it was by thy lord's advice that in like manner they carried off us maidens,

<note>Referring to the rape of the Sabine women. <hi rend="italic">Itidem</hi> shows that Cn. Gellius had in mind the later myth (see note 1, p. 480) that Mars finally carried off Nerio as his bride.</note>
that from us they might raise up children for themselves and their people, and descendants for their country.</quote> She says <quote>by thy lord's advice,</quote> of course meaning her husband, Mars; and from this it is plain that Plautus made use of no poetic fiction, but that there was also a tradition according to which Nerio was said by some to be the wife of Mars. But it must be noticed besides that Gellius writes <hi rend="italic">Neria</hi> with an <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> not <hi rend="italic">Nerio</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">Nerienes.</hi> In addition to Plautus too, and Gellius, Licinius  <pb n="v2.p.485"/>  Imbrex, an early writer of comedies, in the play entitled <hi rend="italic">Neaera,</hi> wrote as follows:

<note>p. 39, Ribbeck<hi rend="sup">3</hi>.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Neaera I'd not wish to have thee called;</l> <l>Neriene rather, since thou art wife to Mars.</l></quote>  Moreover, the metre of this verse is such that the third syllable in that name must be made short,

<note>That is, Nērĭĕnem, instead of Nērĭēnem.</note>
contrary to what was said above. But how greatly the quantity of this syllable varied among the early writers is so well known that I need not waste many words on the subject. Ennius also, in this verse from the first book of his <hi rend="italic">Annals,</hi>

<p>Remarks of Marcus Cato, who declared that he lacked many things, yet desired nothing.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>MARCUS CATO, ex-consul and ex-censor, says that when the State and private individuals were abounding in wealth, his country-seats were plain and  <pb n="v2.p.487"/>  unadorned, and not even whitewashed, up to the seventieth year of his age. And later he uses these words on the subject:

<note><hi rend="italic">O.R.F.,</hi> p. 146, Meyer<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
<quote>I have no building, utensil or garment bought with a great price, no costly slave or maidservant. If I have anything to use,</quote> he says, <quote>I use it; if not, I do without. So far as I am concerned, everyone may use and enjoy what he has.</quote> Then he goes on to say: <quote>They find fault with me, because I lack many things; but I with them, because they cannot do without them.</quote> This simple frankness of the man of Tusculum, who says that he lacks many things, yet desires nothing, truly has more effect in inducing thrift and contentment with small means than the Greek sophistries of those who profess to be philosophers and invent vain shadows of words, declaring that they have nothing and yet lack nothing and desire nothing, while all the time they are fevered with having, with lacking, and with desiring.</p>  </div>

<p>The meaning of <hi rend="italic">manubiae</hi> is asked and discussed; with some observations as to the propriety of using several words of the same meaning.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>ALL along the roof of the colonnades of Trajan's forum

<note>The largest and grandest of the imperial fora, including the basilica Ulpia, the column of Trajan, and the library.</note>
there are placed gilded statues of horses and representations of military standards, and underneath is written <hi rend="italic">Ex manubiis.</hi> Favorinus inquired, when he was walking in the court of the forum, waiting for  <pb n="v2.p.489"/>  his friend the consul, who was hearing cases from the tribunal—and I at the time was in attendance on him—he asked, I say, what that inscription <hi rend="italic">manubiae</hi> seemed to us really to mean. Then one of those who were with him, a man of a great and wide-spread reputation for his devotion to learned pursuits, said: <quote><hi rend="italic">Ex manubiis</hi> is the same as <hi rend="italic">ex praeda;</hi> for <hi rend="italic">manubiae</hi> is the term for booty which is taken <hi rend="italic">mann,</hi> that is 'by hand.'</quote> Then Favorinus rejoined: <quote>Although my principal and almost my entire attention has been given to the literature and arts of Greece, I am nevertheless not so inattentive to the Latin language, to which I devote occasional or desultory study, as to be unaware of this common interpretation of <hi rend="italic">manubiae,</hi> which makes it a synonym <hi rend="italic">of praeda.</hi> But I raise the question, whether Marcus Tullius, a man most careful in his diction, in the speech which he delivered against Rullus on the first of January <hi rend="italic">On the Agrarian Law,</hi> joined <hi rend="italic">manubiae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">praeda</hi> by an idle and inelegant repetition, if it be true that these two words have the same meaning and do not differ in any respect at all.</quote> And then, such was Favorinus' marvellous and almost miraculous memory, he at once added Cicero's own words. These I have appended:

<note><hi rend="italic">De Leg. Agr.</hi> i., p. 601, Orelli<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
<quote>The decemvirs will sell the booty (<hi rend="italic">praedam</hi>), the proceeds of the spoils (<hi rend="italic">manubias</hi>), the goods reserved for public auction, in fact Gnaeus Pompeius' camp, while the general sits looking on</quote>; and just below he again used these two words in conjunction:

<note>Id. ii. 59.</note>
<quote>From the booty (<hi rend="italic">ex praeda</hi>), from the proceeds of the spoils (<hi rend="italic">ex manubiis</hi>), from the crown-money.</quote>

<note>It was customary for cities in the provinces to send golden crowns to a victorious general, which were carried before him in his triumph. By the time of Cicero the presents took the form of money, called <hi rend="italic">aurum coronarium.</hi> Later, it was a present to the emperor on stated occasions.</note>
Then, turning to the man who had said <hi rend="italic">that</hi> <hi rend="italic">manubiae</hi> was the same as <hi rend="italic">praeda,</hi> Favorinus said, "Does it seem to you that in both  <pb n="v2.p.491"/>  these passages Marcus Cicero weakly and frigidly used two words which, as you think, mean the same thing, thus showing himself deserving of the ridicule with which in Aristophanes, the wittiest of comic writers, Euripides assailed Aeschylus, saying:

<note><hi rend="italic">Frogs</hi> 1154, 1156 ff. </note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Wise Aeschylus has said the same thing twice;</l> <l>'I come into the land,' says he, 'and enter it.'</l> <l>But 'enter' and ' come into' are the same.</l> <l>By Heaven, yes! It's just as if one said</l> <l>To a neighbour: 'Use the pot, or else the pan'?</l></quote></p>

<p><quote>But by no means,</quote> said he, <quote>do Cicero's words seem like such repetitions as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ma/ktra,</foreign> pot, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ka/rdopos,</foreign> pan, which are used either by our own poets or orators and those of the Greeks, for the purpose of giving weight or adornment to their subject by the use of two or more words of the same meaning.</quote></p>

<p><quote>Pray,</quote> said Favorinus, "what force has this repetition and recapitulation of the same thing under another name in <hi rend="italic">manubiae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">praeda?</hi> It does not adorn the sentence, does it, as is sometimes the case? It does not make it more exact or more melodious, does it? Does it make an effective cumulation of words designed to strengthen the accusation or brand the crime? As, for example, in the speech of the same Marcus Tullius <hi rend="italic">On the Appointment of an Accuser</hi> one and the same thing is expressed in several words with force and severity:

<note><hi rend="italic">Div. in Caec. 19.</hi></note>
' All Sicily, if it could speak with one voice, would say this: <quote>Whatever gold, whatever silver, whatever jewels I had in my cities, abodes and shrines.'</quote> For having once mentioned the cities as a whole, he added 'abodes' and 'shrines,' which are themselves a  <pb n="v2.p.493"/>  part of the cities. Also in the same oration he says in a similar manner:

<note>§ 11.</note>
'During three years Gaius Verres is said to have plundered the province of Sicily, devastated the cities of the Sicilians, emptied their homes, pillaged their shrines.' Does he not seem to you, when he had mentioned the province of Sicily and had besides added the cities as well, to have included the houses also and the shrines, which he later mentioned? So too do not those many and varied words, 'plundered, devastated, emptied, pillaged,' have one and the same force? They surely do. But since the mention of them all adds to the dignity of the speech and the impressive copiousness of its diction, although they are nearly the same and spring from a single idea, yet they appear to contain more meaning because they strike the ears and mind more frequently.</p>

<p>"This kind of adornment, by heaping up in a single charge a great number of severe terms, was frequently used even in early days by our most ancient orator, the famous Marcus Cato, in his speeches; for example in the one entitled <hi rend="italic">On the Ten,</hi> when he accused Thermus because he had put to death ten freeborn men at the same time, he used the following words of the same meaning, which, as they are brilliant flashes of Latin eloquence, which was just then coming into being, I have thought fit to call to mind:

<note>p. 39, 127, Jordan.</note>
'You seek to cover up your abominable crime with a still worse crime, you slaughter men like swine, you commit frightful bloodshed, you cause ten deaths, slay ten freemen, take life from ten men, untried, unjudged, uncondemned.' So too Marcus Cato, at the beginning of the speech which he delivered in the senate, <hi rend="italic">In Defence</hi>  <pb n="v2.p.495"/>  <hi rend="italic">of the Rhodians,</hi> wishing to describe too great prosperity, used three words which mean the same thing.

<note><hi rend="italic">Orig.</hi> v. 1, p. 21, 8, Jordan.</note>
His language is as follows: I know that most men in favourable, happy and prosperous circumstances are wont to be puffed up in spirit and to increase in arrogance and haughtiness.' In the seventh book of his <hi rend="italic">Origins</hi> too,

<note>Frag. 108, Peter<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
in the speech which he spoke <hi rend="italic">Against Servius Galba,</hi> Cato used several words to express the same thing:

<note><hi rend="italic">O.R.F., p.</hi> 123, Meyer<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
' Many things have dissuaded me from appearing here, my years, my time of life, my voice, my strength, my old age; but nevertheless, when I reflected that so important a matter was being discussed..." </p>

<p>"But above all in Homer there is a brilliant heaping up of the same idea and thought, in these lines:

<note><hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> xi. 163.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Zeus from the weapons, from the dust and blood,</l> <l>From carnage, from the tumult Hector bore.</l></quote>  Also in another verse:

<note><hi rend="italic">Odyss.</hi> xi. 612.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Engagements, battles, carnage, deaths of men.</l></quote>  For although all those numerous synonymous terms mean nothing more than 'battle,' yet the varied aspects of this concept are elegantly and charmingly depicted by the use of several different words. And in the same poet this one thought is repeated with admirable effect by the use of two words; for Idaeus, when he interrupted the armed contest of Hector and Ajax, addressed them thus:

<note><hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> vii. 279.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>No longer fight, dear youths, nor still contend,</l></quote>  <pb n="v2.p.497"/>  and in this verse it ought not to be supposed that the second word, meaning the same as the first, was added and lugged in without reason, merely to fill out the metre; for that is utterly silly and false. But while he gently and calmly chided the obstinate fierceness and love of battle in two youths burning with a desire for glory, he emphasized and impressed upon them the atrocity of the act and the sin of their insistence by adding one word to another; and that double form of address made his admonition more impressive. Nor ought the following repetition of the same thought to seem any more weak and cold:

<note><hi rend="italic">Odyss.</hi> xx. 241.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>With death the suitors threatened, and with fate, Telemachus,</l></quote>  because he said the same thing twice in <foreign xml:lang="grc">qa/naton</foreign> (death) and <foreign xml:lang="grc">mo/ron</foreign> (fate); for the heinousness of attempting so cruel and unjust a murder is deplored by the admirable repetition of the word meaning 'death.' Who too is of so dull a mind as not to understand that in

<note><hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> ii. 8.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Away, begone, dire dream,</l></quote>  and

<note><hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> viii. 399.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Away, begone, swift Iris,</l></quote>  two words of the same meaning are not used to no purpose, <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)k parallh/lwn,</foreign> 'as the repetition of two similar words,' as some think, but are a vigorous exhortation to the swiftness which is enjoined?"</p>

<p><quote>Also those thrice repeated words in the speech of Marcus Cicero <hi rend="italic">Against Lucius Piso,</hi> although displeasing to men of less sensitive ears, did not merely aim at elegance, but buffeted Piso's assumed expression  <pb n="v2.p.499"/>  of countenance by the rhythmical accumulation of several words. Cicero says:

<note><hi rend="italic">In Pis. 1.</hi></note>
Finally, your whole countenance, which is, so to speak, the silent voice of the mind, this it was that incited men to crime, this deceived, tricked, cheated those to whom it was not familiar.' Well then,</quote> continued Favorinus, "is the use of <hi rend="italic">praeda</hi> and <hi rend="italic">manubiae</hi> in the same writer similar to this? Truly, not at all! For by the addition of <hi rend="italic">manubiae</hi> the sentence does not become more ornate, more forcible, or more euphonius; but <hi rend="italic">manubiae</hi> means one thing, as we learn from the books on antiquities and on the early Latin, <hi rend="italic">praeda</hi> quite another. For <hi rend="italic">praeda</hi> is used of the actual objects making up the booty, but <hi rend="italic">manubiae</hi> designates the money collected by the quaestor from the sale of the booty. Therefore Marcus Tullius, in order to rouse greater hatred of the decemvirs, said that they would carry off and appropriate the two: both the booty which had not yet been sold and the money which had been received from the sale of the booty."</p>

<p><quote>Therefore this inscription which you see, <hi rend="italic">ex manubiis,</hi> does not designate the objects and the mass of booty itself, for none of these was taken from the enemy by Trajan, but it declares that these statues were made and procured 'from the <hi rend="italic">manubiae,'</hi> that is, with the money derived from the sale of the booty. For <hi rend="italic">manubiae</hi> means, as I have already said, not booty, but money collected from the sale of the booty by a quaestor of the Roman people. But when I said 'by the quaestor,' one ought now to understand that the praefect of the treasury is meant. For the charge of the treasury has been transferred from the quaestors to praefects.

<note>See Suet. <hi rend="italic">Claud.</hi> xxiv.</note>
However, it is possible to find instances in which  <pb n="v2.p.501"/>  writers of no little fame have written in such a way as to use <hi rend="italic">praeda</hi> for <hi rend="italic">manubiae</hi> or <hi rend="italic">manubiae</hi> for <hi rend="italic">praeda,</hi> either from carelessness or indifference; or by some metaphorical figure they have interchanged the words, which is allowable when done with judgment and skill. But those who have spoken properly and accurately, as did Marcus Tullius in that passage, have used <hi rend="italic">manubiae</hi> of money.</quote></p>  </div>

<p>A passage of Publius Nigidius in which he says that in <hi rend="italic">Valeri,</hi> the vocative case of the name <hi rend="italic">Valerius,</hi> the first syllable should have an acute accent; with other remarks of the same writer on correct writing.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THESE are the words of Publius Nigidius, a man pre-eminent for his knowledge of all the sciences, from the twenty-fourth book of his <hi rend="italic">Grammatical Notes:</hi>

<note>Fr. 35, Swoboda.</note>
<quote>How then can the accent be correctly used, if in names like <hi rend="italic">Valeri</hi> we do not know whether they are genitive

<note>On <hi rend="italic">casus interrogandi</hi> for the genitive see Fay, <hi rend="italic">A.J.P.</hi> xxxvi (1916), p. 78.</note>
or vocative? For the second syllable of the genitive has a higher pitch than the first, and on the last syllable the pitch falls again; but in the vocative case the first syllable has the highest pitch, and then there is a gradual descent.</quote>

<note>See note 2, p. 426. Many believe this to be true also of the Latin <hi rend="italic">sermo urbanus</hi>; see <hi rend="italic">Class. Phil.</hi> ii. 444 ff.</note>
Thus indeed Nigidius bids us speak. But if anyone nowadays, calling to a Valerius, accents the first syllable of the vocative according to the direction of Nigidius, he will not escape being laughed at. Furthermore, Nigidius calls the acute accent <quote>the highest pitch,</quote> and what we call <hi rend="italic">accentus,</hi> or <quote>accent,</quote> he calls <hi rend="italic">voculatio,</hi> or <quote>tone,</quote> and the case which we now call <hi rend="italic">genetivus,</hi> or <quote>genitive,</quote> he calls <hi rend="italic">casus interrogandi,</hi> <quote>the case of asking.</quote> </p>  <pb n="v2.p.503"/>

<p>This too I notice in the same book of Nigidius:

<note>36 Swoboda.</note>
<quote>If you write the genitive case of <hi rend="italic">amicus,</hi></quote> he says, <quote>or of <hi rend="italic">magnus,</hi> end the word with a single <hi rend="italic">i;</hi> but if you write the nominative plural, you must write <hi rend="italic">magnei</hi> and <hi rend="italic">amicei,</hi> with an <hi rend="italic">e</hi> followed by <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> and so with similar words. Also

<note>Id. 37.</note>
if you write <hi rend="italic">terra</hi> in the genitive, let it end with the letter <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">terrai;</hi>

<note>Really <hi rend="italic">terrái.</hi></note>
but in the dative with <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">terrae.</hi> Also

<note>Id. 38.</note>
one who writes <hi rend="italic">mei</hi> in the genitive case, as when we say <hi rend="italic">mei studiosus,</hi> or ' devoted to me,' let him write it with <hi rend="italic">i</hi> only (<hi rend="italic">mei</hi>), not with <hi rend="italic">e</hi> (<hi rend="italic">meei</hi>);

<note>Gellius refers only to the <hi rend="italic">ending,</hi> which is <hi rend="italic">i</hi> alone, and not <hi rend="italic">i</hi> preceded by <hi rend="italic">e.</hi></note>
but when he writes <hi rend="italic">mehei,</hi> it must be written with <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> since it is the dative case.</quote> Led by the authority of a most learned man, I thought that I ought not to pass by these statements, for the sake of those who desire a knowledge of such matters.</p>  </div>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THE second book of the philosopher Panaetius <hi rend="italic">On Duties</hi> was being read to us, being one of those three celebrated books which Marcus Tullius emulated with great care and very great labour.

<note>Fr. 8, Fowler.</note>
<quote>The life of men,</quote> he says, <quote>who pass their time in the midst of affairs, and who wish to be helpful to themselves and to others, is exposed to constant and almost daily troubles and sudden dangers. To guard against and avoid these one needs a mind that is always ready and alert, such as the athletes have who are called 'pancratists.' For just as they, when called to the contest, stand with their arms raised and stretched out, and protect their head and face by opposing their hands as a rampart; and as all their limbs, before the battle  <pb n="v2.p.507"/>  has begun, are ready to avoid or to deal blows—so the spirit and mind of the wise man, on the watch everywhere and at all times against violence and wanton injuries, ought to be alert, ready, strongly protected, prepared in time of trouble, never flagging in attention, never relaxing its watchfulness, opposing judgment and forethought like arms and hands to the strokes of fortune and the snares of the wicked, lest in any way a hostile and sudden onslaught be made upon us when we are unprepared and unprotected.</quote></p>  </div>

<p>That Quadrigarius used the expression <hi rend="italic">cum multis mortalibus;</hi> whether it would have made any difference if he had said <hi rend="italic">cum multis hominibus,</hi> and how great a difference.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THE following is a passage of Claudius Quadrigarius from the thirteenth book of his <hi rend="italic">Annals:</hi>

<note>Fr. 76, Peter.<hi rend="sup">2</hi></note>
<quote>When the assembly had been dismissed, Metellus came to the Capitol with many mortals (<hi rend="italic">cum mortalibus mulltis</hi>); from there he went home attended by the entire city.</quote> When this book and this passage were read to Marcus Fronto, as I was sitting with him in company with some others, it seemed to one of those present, a man not without learning, that the use of <hi rend="italic">mortalibus multis</hi> for <hi rend="italic">hominibus multis</hi> in a work of history was foolish and frigid, and savoured too much of poetry. Then Fronto said to the man who expressed this opinion: <quote>Do you, a man of most refined taste in other matters, say that <hi rend="italic">mortalibus multis</hi> seems to you foolish and frigid, and do you think there is no reason why a man whose language is chaste, pure and almost conversational,  <pb n="v2.p.509"/>  preferred to say <hi rend="italic">mortalibus</hi> rather than <hi rend="italic">hominibus?</hi> And do you think that he would have described a multitude in the same way if he said <hi rend="italic">cum multis hominibus</hi> and not <hi rend="italic">cum multis mortalibus?</hi> For my part,</quote> continued Fronto, <quote>unless my regard and veneration for this writer, and for all early Latin, blinds my judgment, I think that it is far, far fuller, richer and more comprehensive in describing almost the whole population of the city to have said <hi rend="italic">mortales</hi> rather than <hi rend="italic">homines.</hi> For the expression ' many men' may be confined and limited to even a moderate number, but 'many mortals' somehow in some indefinable manner includes almost all the people in the city, of every rank, age and sex; so you see Quadrigarius, wishing to describe the crowd as vast and mixed, as in fact it was, said that Metellus came into the Capitol ' with many mortals, speaking with more force than if he had said 'with many men.'</quote></p>

<p>When we, as was fitting, had expressed, not only approval, but admiration of all this that we had heard from Fronto, he said: <quote>Take care, however, not to think that <hi rend="italic">mortales multi</hi> is to be used always and everywhere in place of <hi rend="italic">multi homines,</hi> lest that Greek proverb, <foreign xml:lang="grc">to\ e)pi\ th=| fakh=| mu/ron,</foreign> or 'myrrh on lentils,

which is found in one of Varro's <hi rend="italic">Satires,</hi>

<p>That <hi rend="italic">fades</hi> has a wider application than is commonly supposed.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>

<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>WE may observe that many Latin words have departed from their original signification and passed into one that is either far different or near akin, and that such a departure is due to the usage of those ignorant people who carelessly use words of which they have not learned the meaning. As, for example, some think that <hi rend="italic">facies,</hi> applied to a man, means only the face, eyes and cheeks, that which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">pro/swpon</foreign>; whereas <hi rend="italic">facies</hi> really designates the whole form, dimensions and, as it were, the make-up of the entire body, being formed from <hi rend="italic">facio</hi> as <hi rend="italic">species</hi> is from <hi rend="italic">aspects</hi> and <hi rend="italic">figura</hi> from <hi rend="italic">fingere.</hi> Accordingly Pacuvius, in the tragedy entitled <hi rend="italic">Niptra,</hi> used <hi rend="italic">faces</hi> for the height of a man's body in these lines:

<note>253, Ribbeck<hi rend="sup">3</hi>.</note>
</p>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>A man in prime of life, of spirit bold,</l> <l part="I">Of stature (<hi rend="italic">facie</hi>) tall.</l></quote>

<p>But <hi rend="italic">facies</hi> is applied, not only to the bodies of men, but also to the appearance of other things of every kind. For <hi rend="italic">facies</hi> may be said properly, if the application be seasonable, of a mountain, the heavens and the sea.

<note>Just so we speak of the face of nature, the face of the waters, and the like.</note>

<p>The meaning of <hi rend="italic">caninum prandium</hi> in Marcus Varro's satire.</p><!--</argument>-->

I therefore went up to him and said: <quote>Master, of course you know that old Greek saying, that music, if it be hidden, is of no account.

<note>The same proverb is put into the mouth of Nero by Suetonius (<hi rend="italic">Nero,</hi> xx. 1), where the meaning is, that it is of no use for one to know how to sing, unless he proves that he knows how by singing in public.</note>

<p>Then, as many others who were there present agreed with me and made the same request, I handed him an ancient copy of the satire, of tested correctness and clearly written. But he took it with a most disturbed and worried expression. But what shall I say followed? I really do not dare to ask you to believe me. Ignorant schoolboys, if they had taken up that book, could not have read more laughably, so wretchedly did he pronounce the words and murder the thought.

<p>The words of the passage in which that proverb is found are as follows:

<quote>Do you not know that Mnesitheus

<note>A celebrated Athenian physician of the fourth century before our era.</note>
writes that there are three kinds of wine, dark, light and medium, which the Greeks call  <pb n="v2.p.517"/>  <foreign xml:lang="grc">kirro/s</foreign> or 'tawny'; and new, old and medium?

Therefore when Mnesitheus named a medium wine, which was neither new nor old—and many men speak as if all wine was either new or old—he meant that the medium wine had the power neither of the old nor of the new, and was therefore not to be considered wine at all, because it neither cooled nor heated. By <hi rend="italic">refrigerare</hi> (to cool), he means the same as the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">yu/xein.</foreign></p>

<!--<argument>-->

<p>A discourse of the philosopher Favorinus directed against those who are called Chaldaeans, and who profess to tell men's fortunes from the conjunction and movements of the stars and constellations.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>AGAINST those who call themselves <quote>Chaldaeans</quote> or <quote>astrologers,</quote>

<note>Literally, calculators of nativities; see also note on i. 9. 6.</note>
and profess from the movements and position of the stars to be able to read the future, I once at Rome heard the philosopher Favorinus discourse in Greek in admirable and brilliant language. But whether it was for the purpose of exercising, not vaunting, his talent, or because he seriously and sincerely believed what he said, I am unable to tell; but I promptly jotted down the heads of the topics and of the arguments which he used, so far as I could recall them immediately after leaving the meeting, and they were about to this effect:

<note>p. 44, Marres.</note>
That this science of the Chaldaeans was not of so great antiquity as they would have it appear; that the founders and authors of it were not those whom they themselves name, but that tricks and delusions of that kind were devised by jugglers and men who made a living and profit from  <pb n="v3.p.5"/>  their lies. And since they saw that some terrestrial phenomena known to men were caused by the influence and control of the heavenly bodies, as for example the ocean, as though a companion of the moon, grows old and resumes its youth along with her—from this, forsooth, they derived an argument for persuading us to believe that all human affairs, both the greatest and the least, as though bound to the stars and constellations, are influenced and governed by them. But Favorinus said that it was utterly foolish and absurd to suppose, because the tide of the ocean corresponds with the course of the moon, that a suit at law which one happens to have about an aqueduct with his neighbours, or with the man next door about a party wall, is also bound to heaven as if by a kind of chain and is decided by the stars. But even if by some divine power and purpose this could happen, yet he thought that it could by no means be grasped and understood in such a brief and scant span of life as ours by any human intellect, but he believed that some few things were conjectured <foreign xml:lang="grc">paxumere/steron,</foreign> (to use his own term), that is, <quote>somewhat roughly,</quote>

<note>In a rough and ready, superficial manner.</note>
with no sure foundation of knowledge, but in a loose, random and arbitrary manner, just as when we look at objects far away with eyes blinded by their remoteness from us. For the greatest difference between men and gods was removed, if man also had the power of foreknowing all future events. Furthermore, he thought that even the observation of the stars and constellations, which they declared to be the foundation of their knowledge, was by no means a matter of certainty. <quote>For if the original Chaldaeans,</quote> said he, <quote>who dwelt in the open plains, watched the movements and orbits of the stars their  <pb n="v3.p.7"/>  separations and conjunctions, and observed their effects, let this art continue to be practised, but let it be only under the same inclination of the heavens as that under which the Chaldaeans then were. For the system of observation of the Chaldaeans cannot remain valid, if anyone should wish to apply it to different regions of the sky. For who does not see,</quote> said he, <quote>how great is the diversity of the zones and circles of the heavens caused by the inclination and convexity of the earth? Why then should not those same stars, by which they maintain that all human and divine affairs are affected, just as they do not everywhere arouse cold and heat, but change and vary the weather, at the same time causing calm in one place and storm in another—why should they not, I say, produce one series of affairs and events in the land of the Chaldaeans, another among the Gaetulians, another on the Danube, and still another on the Nile? But,</quote> said he, <quote>it is utterly inconsistent to suppose that the mass and the condition of this vast height of air does not remain the same under one or another region of the heavens, but that in human affairs those stars always indicate the same thing from whatever part of the earth you may observe them.</quote> Besides, he expressed his surprise that anyone considered it a certainty that those stars which they say were observed by the Chaldaeans and Babylonians, or by the Egyptians, which many call <hi rend="italic">erraticae,</hi> or <quote>wandering,</quote> but Nigidius called <hi rend="italic">errones, or</hi> <quote>the wanderers,</quote>

<note>Fr. 87, Swoboda; the reference is to the planets.</note>
are not more numerous than is commonly assumed; for he thought it might possibly be the case that there were some other planets of equal power, without which a correct and  <pb n="v3.p.9"/>  final observation could not be completed, but that men could not see them because of their remarkable brilliance or altitude. ' For,' said he, <quote>some stars are visible from certain lands and are known to the men of those lands; but those same stars are not visible from every other land and are wholly unknown to other men. And granting,</quote> said he, <quote>both that only these stars ought to be observed, and that too from one part of the earth, what possible end was there to such observation, and what periods of time seemed sufficient for understanding what the conjunction or the orbits or the transits of the stars foretold? For if an observation was made in the beginning in such a manner that it was calculated under what aspect, arrangement and position of the stars anyone was born, and if thereafter his fortune from the beginning of his life, his character, his disposition, the circumstances of his affairs and activities, and finally also the end of his life were noted, and all these things as they had actually happened were committed to writing, and long afterwards, when the same stars were in the same aspect and position, it was supposed that those same things would happen to others who had been born at that same time;

<note>That is, the time when the stars were again in the same position. The point is, that observations made for one man, even though they came out right, were of no value, because of the long time that it took for the stars to reach the same positions that they had at the time of the earlier observations.</note>
if the first observations were made in that way,</quote> said he, <quote>and from such observations a kind of science was formed, it can by no means be a success. For let them tell me in how many years, pray, or rather in how many ages, the cycle of the observations could be completed.</quote> For he said that it was agreed among astrologers that those stars which they call <quote>wandering,</quote> which are supposed  <pb n="v3.p.11"/>  to determine the fate of all things, beginning their course together, return to the same place from which they set out only after an innumerable and almost infinite number of years, so that there could be no continuity of observation, and no literary record could endure for so long an epoch. And he thought that this point also ought to be taken into consideration, that one constellation presided at the time when a man was first conceived in his mother's womb, and another one ten months later when he came into the world, and he asked how it was consistent for a different indication to be made about the same person, if, as they themselves thought, a different position and order of the same stars gave different fortunes. But also at the time of marriage, from which children were expected, and at the very union of the husband and wife, he said that it ought to be indicated by a fixed and inevitable position of the stars, with what character and fortune men would be born; and, indeed, long before that, when the father and mother were themselves born, it ought to be foretold even then from their horoscope what offspring they would produce; and far, far back of that, even to infinity, so that, if that science rested on any foundation of truth, a hundred years ago, or rather at the beginning of heaven and earth, and then on in an unbroken series of predictions as long as generation followed generation, those stars ought to have foretold what character and fortune anyone would have who is born to-day. <quote>But how,</quote> said he, <quote>can it be believed that the fate and fortune foretold by the form and position of any one of the stars are  <pb n="v3.p.13"/>  fixed and attached to one particular individual, and that the same position of the stars is restored only after a long series of years, if the indications of the same man's life and fortunes in such short intervals, through the single degrees of his forefathers and through an infinite order of successions, are so often and so frequently pointed out as the same, although the position of the stars is not the same? But if this can happen, and if this contradiction and variation be admitted through all the epochs of antiquity in foretelling the origin of those men who are to be born afterwards, this inequality confounds the observation and the whole theory of the science falls to the ground.</quote> Moreover, he thought that the most intolerable thing was their belief that not only occurrences and events of an external nature, but even men's very deliberations, their purposes, their various pleasures, their likes and dislikes, the chance and sudden attractions and aversions of their feelings on trifling matters, were excited and influenced from heaven above; for example, if you happened to wish to go to the baths, and then should change your mind, and again should decide to go, that all this happens, not from some shifting and variable state of mind, but from a fateful ebb and flow of the planets. Thus men would clearly be seen to be, not <foreign xml:lang="grc">logika\ zw=a</foreign> or <quote>reasoning beings,</quote> as they are called, but a species of ludicrous and ridiculous puppets, if it be true that they do nothing of their own volition or their own will, but are led and driven by the stars. <quote>And if,</quote> said he, <quote>they affirm that it could have been foretold whether king Pyrrhus or Manius Curius was to be victorious in the battle, why, pray, do they not dare also to predict which of the  <pb n="v3.p.15"/>  players with dice or counters on a board will win? Or, forsooth, do they know important things, but not those which are unimportant; and are unimportant things more difficult to understand than the important? But if they claim knowledge of great matters and say that they are plainer and easier to be understood, I should like,</quote> said he, <quote>to have them tell me, in this observation of the whole world, in comparison with such mighty works of nature, what they regard as great in the trifling and brief fortunes and affairs of men. And I should like to have them answer this question also,</quote> said he: <quote>if the instant in which man at birth is allotted his destiny is so brief and fleeting, that at that same moment not more than one can be born with the same conjunction under the same circle of the heavens, and if therefore even twins have different lots in life, since they are not born at the same instant—I ask them to tell me,</quote> said he, <quote>how and by what plan they are able to overtake the course of that fleeting moment, which can scarcely be grasped by one's thoughts, or to detain and examine it, when in the swift revolution of days and nights even the briefest moments, as they say, cause great changes?</quote> Then, finally, he asked what answer could be made to this argument, that human beings of both sexes, of all ages, born into the world under different positions of the stars and in regions widely separated, nevertheless sometimes all perished together by the same kind of death and at the same moment, either from an earthquake, or a falling building, or the sack of a town, or the wreck of the same ship. <quote>This,</quote> said he, <quote>of course would never happen, if the natal influence assigned to the birth  <pb n="v3.p.17"/>  of each of them had its own peculiar conditions. But if,</quote> he said, <quote>they answer that even in the life and death of men who are born at different times certain events may happen which are alike and similar, through some similar conjunction of the stars at a later time, why may not sometimes everything become equal, so that through such agreement and similarity of the stars many a Socrates and Antisthenes and Plato may appear, equal in birth, in person, in talent, in character, in their whole life and in their death? But this,</quote> said he, <quote>can by no means whatever happen. Therefore they cannot properly use this argument against the inequality of men's births and the similarity of their death.</quote> He added that he excused them from this further inquiry: namely, if the time, the manner and the cause of men's life and death, and of all human affairs, were in heaven and with the stars, what would they say of flies, worms, sea urchins, and many other minute animals of land and sea? Were they too born and destroyed under the same laws as men? so that to frogs also and gnats either the same fates are assigned at birth by the movements of the constellations, or, if they do not believe that, there seemed to be no reason why that power of the stars should be effective with men and ineffectual with the other animals.</p>

<p>These remarks I have touched upon in a dry, unadorned, and almost jejune style. But Favorinus, such was the man's talent, and such is at once the copiousness and the charm of Greek eloquence, delivered them at greater length and with more charm, brilliance and readiness, and from time to  <pb n="v3.p.19"/>  time he warned us to take care lest in any way those sycophants should worm their way into our confidence by sometimes seeming to stumble upon, and give utterance to, something true. <quote>For they do not,</quote> said he, <quote>say anything that is tangible, definite or comprehensible, but depending upon slippery and roundabout conjecture, groping with cautious steps between truth and falsehood, as if walking in the dark, they go their way. And after making many attempts they either happen suddenly on the truth without knowing it, or led by the great credulity of those who consult them, they get hold by cunning of something true, and therefore obviously find it easier to come somewhere near the truth in past events than in those to come. Yet all the true things which they say through accident or cunning,</quote> said he, <quote>are not a thousandth part of the falsehoods which they utter.</quote></p>

<p>But besides these remarks which I heard Favorinus make, I recall many testimonies of the ancient poets, by which delusive fallacies of this kind are refuted. Among these is the following saying of Pacuvius:

<note>v. 407, Ribbeck<hi rend="sup">3</hi>.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Could men divine the future, they'd match Jove.</l></quote>  Also this from Accius, who writes:

<note>v. 169, Ribbeck<hi rend="sup">3</hi>.</note>
</p>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>I trust the augurs not, who with mere words</l> <l>Enrich men's ears, to load themselves with gold.</l></quote>

<p>Favorinus too, wishing to deter and turn away young men from such calculators of nativities and from certain others of that kind, who profess to reveal all the future by means of magic arts, concluded with arguments of this sort, to show that they ought by no means to be resorted to and consulted.  <pb n="v3.p.21"/>  <quote>They predict,</quote> said he, <quote>either adverse or prosperous events. If they foretell prosperity and deceive you, you will be made wretched by vain expectations; if they foretell adversity and lie, you will be made wretched by useless fears. But if they predict truly and the events are unhappy, you will thereby be made wretched by anticipation, before you are fated to be so; if on the contrary they promise prosperity and it conies to pass, then there will clearly be two disadvantages: the anticipation of your hopes will wear you out with suspense, and hope will in advance have reaped the fruit of your approaching happiness. Therefore there is every reason why you should not resort to men of that kind, who profess knowledge of the future.</quote></p>  </div>

<!--<argument>-->

<p>How Favorinus discoursed when I consulted hint about the duty of a judge.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>AT the time when I was first chosen by the praetors to be one of the judges in charge of the suits which are called <quote>private,</quote>

<note>See note on xii. 13. 1.</note>
I hunted up books written in both languages on the duty of a judge, in order that, being a young man, called from poets' tales and orators' perorations to preside in court, I might from lack of the <quote>living voice,</quote> as they say, gain legal lore from so-called <quote>mute counsellors.</quote> And with regard to postponements and delays and some other legal principles I was advised and helped by the Julian Law itself

<note>A law of Julius Caesar and Augustus regulating criminal processes.</note>
and by the commentaries of Masurius Sabinus

<note><hi rend="italic">Jur. Civ.</hi> iii. 3, Bremer.</note>
and some other jurists.

<note>ii. 2, p. 567, Bremer.</note>
But in  <pb n="v3.p.23"/>  those complicated cases which often come up, and in the perplexity arising from conflicting opinions, such books gave me no aid at all. For although the opinions of judges ought to be formed from the conditions of the cases before them, yet there are certain general principles and precepts by which, before hearing a case, the judge ought to guard and prepare himself against the uncertain event of future difficulties; as, for example, an inexplicable perplexity in coming to an opinion once befell me.</p>

<p>A sum of money was claimed before me, which was said to have been paid and counted out;

<note><hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> advanced or loaned by the claimant.</note>
but the claimant did not show this by documents or witnesses, but relied upon very slender <choice><corr>argumentis</corr><sic>arguments</sic></choice>. It was clear, however, that he was a thoroughly good man, of well-known and tested integrity and of blameless life, and many striking instances of his probity and honesty were presented. On the other hand, the man upon whom the claim was made was shown to be of no substance, of base and evil life, often convicted of lying, and full of treachery and fraud. Yet lie, along with his numerous advocates, noisily protested that the payment of the money ought to be shown in the usual way, by a <quote>receipt for payment,</quote> by a <quote>book of accounts,</quote> by <quote>producing a signature,</quote> by <quote>a sealed deed,</quote> or by the <quote>testimony of witnesses</quote>; and if it could be shown in none of these ways, that he ought surely to be dismissed at once and his accuser found guilty of blackmail. He maintained that the testimony relating to the life and conduct of the two parties was irrelevant; for this was a case of claiming money before a private judge, not a question of morals inquired into by the censors.</p>  <pb n="v3.p.25"/>

<p>Thereupon some friends of mine, whom I had asked to aid me with their advice, experienced men with a reputation gained in acting as advocates and in the business of the forum, who were always inclined to act in haste because of the suits everywhere demanding attention, declared there was no need of sitting longer and that there was no doubt that the defendant ought to be acquitted, since it could not be shown in any of the usual ways that he had received the money. But when I contemplated the men, one abounding in honesty, the other in baseness and of a most shameful and degraded life, I could not by any means be argued into an acquittal. I therefore ordered a postponement and from the bench I proceeded to go to the philosopher Favorinus, with whom I associated a great deal at Rome at that time. I told him the whole story of the suit and of the men, as it had been related to me, begging that with regard both to the matter about which I was then in doubt, as well as to others which I should have to consider in my position as judge, he should make me a man of greater wisdom in such affairs.</p>

<p>Then Favorinus, after commending my scrupulous hesitation and my conscientiousness said: <quote>The question which you are now considering may seem to be of a trifling and insignificant character. But if you wish me to instruct you as to the full duties of a judge, this is by no means a fit place or time; for such a discussion involves many intricate questions and requires long and anxious attention and consideration. For-to touch at once upon a few leading questions for your benefit-the first query relating to the duty of a judge is this. If a judge  <pb n="v3.p.27"/>  chance to have knowledge of a matter which is brought to trial before him, and the matter is clearly known and demonstrated to him alone from some external circumstance or event, before it has begun to be argued or brought into court, but nevertheless the same thing is not proved in the course of the trial, ought he to decide in accordance with what he knew beforehand, or according to the evidence in the case? This question also,</quote> said he, "is often raised, whether it is fitting and proper for a judge, after a case has been heard, if there seems to be an opportunity for compromising the dispute, to postpone the duty of a judge for a time and take the part of a common friend and peace-maker, as it were. And I know that this further is a matter of doubt and inquiry, whether a judge, when hearing a suit, ought to mention and ask about the things which it is for the interest of one of the parties to the suit to mention and inquire, even if the party in question neither mentions nor calls for them. For they say that this is in fact to play the part of an advocate, not of a judge.</p>

<p>"Besides these questions, there is disagreement also on this point, whether it is consistent with the Practice and office of a judge by his occasional remarks so to explain and set forth the matter and he case which is being tried, that before the time of his decision, as the result of statements which at he time are made before him in a confused and doubtful form, he gives signs and indications of the motions and feelings by which he is affected on each occasion and at every time. For those judges who give the impression of being keen and quick hink that the matter in dispute cannot be examined  <pb n="v3.p.29"/>  and understood, unless the judge by frequent questions and necessary interruptions makes his own opinion clear and grasps that of the litigants. But, on the other hand, those who have a reputation for calmness and dignity maintain that the judge ought not, before giving his decision and while the case is being pleaded by both parties, to indicate his opinion whenever he is influenced by some argument that is brought forward. For they say that the result will be, since one emotion of the mind after another must be excited by the variety of points and <choice><corr>argumentis</corr><sic>arguments</sic></choice>, that such judges will seem to feel and speak differently about the same case and almost at the same time.

<note><hi rend="italic">Tempore</hi> evidently refers to the whole period of the trial; Favorinus seems to use the word in a double sense to emphasize his point.</note>
</p>

<p><quote>But,</quote> said he, "about these and other similar discussions as to the duty of a judge I shall attempt to give you my views later, when we have leisure, and I will repeat the precepts of Aelius Tubero on the subject, which I have read very recently. But so far as concerns the money which you said was claimed before your tribunal, I advise you, by Heaven! to follow the counsel of that shrewdest of men, Marcus Cato; for he, in the speech which he delivered <hi rend="italic">For Lucius Turius against Gnaeus Gellius,</hi>

<note>li., Jordan.</note>
said that this custom had been handed down and observed by our forefathers, that if a question at issue between two men could not be proved either by documents or witnesses, then the question should be raised before the judge who was trying the case which of the two was the better man, and if they were either equally good or equally bad, that then the one upon whom the claim was made should be believed and the verdict should be given in his favour. But in this case about which you are in  <pb n="v3.p.31"/>  doubt the claimant is a person of the highest character and the one on whom the claim is made is the worst of men, and there are no witnesses to the transaction between the two. So then go and give credit to the claimant and condemn the one on whom the claim is made, since, as you say, the two are not equal and the claimant is the better man."</p>

<p>This was the advice which Favorinus gave me at that time, as became a philosopher. But I thought that I should show more importance and presumption than became my youth and humble merit, if I appeared to sit in judgment on and condemn a man from the characters of the disputants rather than from the evidence in the case; yet I could not make up my mind to acquit the defendant, and accordingly I took oath that the matter was not clear to me and in that way I was relieved from rendering a decision. The words of the speech of Marcus Cato which</p>

<p>Favorinus mentioned are these: <quote>And I have learnt this from the tradition of our ancestors: if anyone claim anything from another, and both are equally either good or bad, provided there are no witnesses to the transaction between the two, the one from whom the claim is made ought rather to be credited. Now, if Gellius had made a wager

<note>See note on vi. 11. 9.</note>
with Turio on the issue, ' Provided Gellius were not a better man than Turio,' no one, I think, would be so mad as to decide that Gellius is better than Turio; if Gellius is not better than Turio, the one from whom the claim is made ought preferably to be credited.</quote></p>  <pb n="v3.p.33"/>  </div>

<p>Whether Plato and Xenophon were rivals and not on good terms with each other.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>THOSE who have written most carefully and thoroughly about the life and character of Xenophon and Plato have expressed the belief that they were not free from certain secret and concealed feelings of enmity and rivalry of each other, and they have set forth some conjectural evidence of this, drawn from their writings. These are in fact of this sort: that Plato in his great number of works nowhere makes mention of Xenophon, nor, on the other hand, does Xenophon mention Plato in his writings, although both men, and in particular Plato in the dialogues which he wrote, mention many followers of Socrates. This too they thought was an indication of no sincerely friendly feeling: that Xenophon in opposition to that celebrated work of Plato, which he wrote on the best form of constitution and of governing a city-state, having barely read the two books of Plato's work which were first made public, proposed a different mode of government (to wit, a monarchy) in the work entitled <foreign xml:lang="grc">Paidei/as Ku/rou,</foreign> or <hi rend="italic">The Education of Cyrus.</hi> They say that Plato was so disturbed by that conduct and book of his, that having made mention of king Cyrus in one of his own books, in order to criticize and belittle Xenophon's work he said

that Cyrus was indeed a strong and active man, but <quote>had by no means had a fitting education</quote>; for these are Plato's words about Cyrus.</p>

<p>Moreover, they think that this also is added to  <pb n="v3.p.35"/>  what I have already said: that Xenophon, in the book which he wrote as records of the sayings and doings of Socrates,

<note><hi rend="italic">Memorabilia,</hi> i. l. ll.</note>
asserts that Socrates never discussed the causes and laws of the heavens and of nature, and that he never touched upon or approved the other sciences, called by the Greeks <foreign xml:lang="grc">maqh/mata</foreign> which did not contribute to a good and happy life; accordingly, he says that those who have attributed discourses of that kind to Socrates are guilty of a base falsehood.</p>

<p><quote>But when Xenophon wrote this,</quote> they say, <quote>The of course refers to Plato, in whose works Socrates discourses on physics, music and geometry.</quote> But if anything of this kind was to be believed, or even suspected, in noble and dignified men, I do not believe that the motive was hostility or envy, or a contest for gaining greater glory; for such considerations are wholly alien to the character of philosophers, among whom those two were in all men's judgment pre-eminent. What then is the reason for that opinion? Undoubtedly this: the mere equality and likeness of kindred talents, even though the desire and inclination of contention be absent, nevertheless create an appearance of rivalry. For when two or more men of great intellectual gifts, who have gained distinction in the same pursuit, are of equal or nearly equal fame, then there arises among their various partisans emulation in expressing an estimate of their efforts and merit. Then later, from the contention of others, the contagion of rivalry spreads to the men themselves, and while they are pressing on to the same goal of honour, the race is so even, or almost even,

<note>For <hi rend="italic">ambiguus</hi> in this sense see Virg. <hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> v. 326.</note>
that it comes imperceptibly under a <pb n="v3.p.37"/> suspicion of rivalry, not from any purpose of their own, but from the zeal of their partisans.

<note>They were not rivals, but both equally eager to attain <quote>virtue.</quote> Thus they seen like competitors in a race, and as they run so that you can hardly tell which leads, their partisans insist on regarding them as rivals.</note>
So then Xenophon and Plato, two stars of Socrates' charming philosophy, were believed to contend with and rival each other, because others strove to show that one or the other was the superior, and because two eminent characters, when they are labouring side by side for a lofty aim, beget a kind of appearance of rivalry and competition.</p>  </div>

<p>That Chrysippus skilfully and vividly represented the likeness of Justice in melodious and picturesque language.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>MOST worthily, by Heaven! and most elegantly did Chrysippus, in the first book of his work entitled <hi rend="italic">On Beauty and Pleasure,</hi> depict the face and eyes of Justice, and her aspect, with austere and noble word-painting. For he represents the figure of Justice, and says that it was usually represented by the painters and orators of old in about the following manner: <quote>Of maidenly form and bearing, with a stern and fearsome countenance, a keen glance of the eye, and a dignity and solemnity which was neither mean nor cruel, but awe-inspiring.</quote> From the spirit of this representation he wished it to be understood that the judge, who is the priest of Justice, ought to be dignified, holy, austere, incorruptible, not susceptible to flattery, pitiless and inexorable towards the wicked and guilty, vigorous, lofty, and powerful, terrible by reason of the force and majesty of equity and truth. Chrysippus' own words about Justice  <pb n="v3.p.39"/>  are as follows: <quote>She has the title of virgin as a symbol of her purity and an indication that she has never given way to evil-doers, that she has never yielded to soothing words, to prayers and entreaties, to flattery, nor to anything of that kind. Therefore she is properly represented too as stern and dignified, with a serious expression and a keen, steadfast glance, in order that she may inspire fear in the wicked and courage in the good; to the latter, as her friends, she presents a friendly aspect, to the former a stern face.</quote></p>

<p>I thought it the more necessary to quote these words of Chrysippus, in order that they might be before us for consideration and judgment, since, on hearing me read them, some philosophers who are more sentimental in their views called that a representation of Cruelty rather than of Justice.</p>  </div>

<p>The strife and contention of two eminent grammarians at Rome as to the vocative case of <hi rend="italic">egregius.</hi></p><!--</argument>-->

<p>ONCE upon a time, wearied with constant writing, I was walking in the park of Agrippa

<note>The <hi rend="italic">campus Agrippae,</hi> laid out by the famous minister of Augustus, was finished and dedicated by the emperor in 7 B.C. It extended from the line of the <hi rend="italic">aqua Virgo</hi> on the south at least as far as the modern via S. Claudio on the north, and from the via Lata to the slope of the Quirinal hill, although its eastern boundary is quite uncertain; see Platner, <hi rend="italic">Topog.,</hi><hi rend="sup">2</hi> p. 477.</note>
for the purpose of relieving and resting my mind. And there, as it chanced, I saw two grammarians of no small repute in the city of Rome, and was a witness of a violent dispute between them, one maintaining  <pb n="v3.p.41"/>  that <hi rend="italic">vir egregi</hi> was the proper form of the vocative case, the other <hi rend="italic">vir egregie.</hi></p>

<p>The argument of the one who thought that we should say <hi rend="italic">egregi</hi> was of this sort: <quote>Whatever nouns or words,</quote> said he, <quote>end in the nominative singular in the syllable <hi rend="italic">us</hi> preceded by <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> in the vocative case terminate in the letter <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">Caelius Caeli, modius modi, tertius terti, Accius Acci, Titius Titi,</hi> and the like; so then <hi rend="italic">egregious,</hi> since it ends in the syllable <hi rend="italic">us</hi> in the nominative and the letter <hi rend="italic">i</hi> precedes that syllable, must in the vocative singular have <hi rend="italic">i</hi> for the final letter, and therefore it is correct to say <hi rend="italic">egregi,</hi> not <hi rend="italic">egregie.</hi> For <hi rend="italic">divus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rivus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">clivus</hi> do not end in the syllable us, but in that which ought to be written with two us, and in order to indicate that sound a new letter was devised, which was called the <hi rend="italic">digamma.</hi></quote>

<note>The Greek digamma had practically the form of Latin F and the pronunciation of Latin V (the semi-vowel). The Romans used the character to represent the sound of <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> at first with the addition of the aspirate <hi rend="italic">h</hi> (as in <hi rend="italic">heehawed, C.I.L.</hi> i<hi rend="sup">2</hi>. 3 and xiv. 4123) and afterwards alone. Since V was used both for the vowel <hi rend="italic">u</hi> and the semi-vowel v, the emperor Claudius introduced an inverted digamma (<foreign xml:lang="grc">v</foreign>), to represent the latter sound; see Suet. <hi rend="italic">Claud.</hi> xii. 3 and (<hi rend="italic">e.g.) C.I.L.</hi> vi. 919. The writing of F for V, to which Gellius seems to refer, was apparently confined to a few grammarians; see Cassiodorus, vii. 148. 8 K and Priscian, ii, 11. 5 K.</note>
When the other heard this, he said: "<hi rend="italic">O egreie grammatice,</hi> or if you prefer, <hi rend="italic">egregissime,</hi> tell me, I pray you, what is the vocative case of, <hi rend="italic">inscius, impius, sobrius, ebrius, proprius, propitious, anxius,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">contrarius,</hi> which end in the syllable <hi rend="italic">us</hi> and have the letter <hi rend="italic">i</hi> before the final syllable? For shame and modesty prevent me from pronouncing them according to your rule." Now the other, overcome by the accumulation of so many words against him, remained silent for a time; but then he nevertheless rallied, and upheld and defended that same rule which he  <pb n="v3.p.43"/>  had laid down, maintaining that <hi rend="italic">proprius, propitius, anxius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">contrarius</hi> ought to have the same form in the vocative case as <hi rend="italic">adversarius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">extrarius;</hi> that <hi rend="italic">inscius</hi> also and <hi rend="italic">impius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ebrius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sobrius</hi> were somewhat less commonly, nevertheless more correctly, made to end in that same case in the letter <hi rend="italic">i</hi> rather than e. But as this contest of theirs was likely to be continued for some time, I did not think it worth while to listen to those same arguments any longer, and I left them shouting and wrangling.</p>  </div>

whether the wanderings of Ulysses were in the inner sea, as Aristarchus believed,

These things and many others of the same kind were included in that book. Hastening to return it to him at once, I said: <quote>I  <pb n="v3.p.47"/>  congratulate you, most learned sir, on this display of encyclopaedic erudition; but take back this precious volume, which does not have the slightest connection with my humble writings.

<p>GNAEUS POMP/EIUS was elected consul for the first time with Marcus Crassus. When he was on the point of entering upon the office, because of his long military service he was unacquainted with the method of convening and consulting the senate, and of city affairs in general. He therefore asked his friend Marcus Varro to make him a book of instructions (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ei)sagwgiko/s,</foreign> as Varro himself termed it), from which he might learn what he ought to say and do when he brought a measure before the House. Varro in letters which he wrote to Op  <pb n="v3.p.49"/>  pianus, contained in the fourth book of his <hi rend="italic">Investigations in Epistolary Form,</hi> says

<note>i, p. 195, Bipont.</note>
that this notebook which he made for Pompey on that subject was lost; and since what he had previously written was no longer in existence, he repeats in those letters a good deal bearing upon the same subject.

<note>i, p. 125, Bremer.</note>
</p>

<p>First of all, he tells us there by what magistrates the senate was commonly convened according to the usage of our forefathers, naming these: <quote>the dictator, consuls, praetors, tribunes of the commons, interrex, and prefect of the city.</quote> No other except these, he said, had the right to pass a decree of the senate, and whenever it happened that all those magistrates were in Rome at the same time, then he says that the first in the order of the list which I have just quoted had the prior right of bringing a matter before the senate; next, by an exceptional privilege, the military tribunes also who had acted as consuls,

<note>From 444 to 384 B.C. military tribunes with consular authority took the place of the consuls.</note>
and likewise the decemvirs,

<note>The <hi rend="italic">decemviri legibus scribundis,</hi> who drew up the <hi rend="italic">Twelve Tables</hi> in 450 B.C.</note>
who in their day had consular authority, and the triumvirs

<note>The second triumvirate of Antony, Octavian and Lepidus; cf. iii. 9. 4 and the note.</note>
appointed to reorganize the State, had the privilege of bringing measures before the House. Afterwards he wrote about vetoes, and said that the right to veto a decree of the senate belonged only to those who had the same authority

<note><hi rend="italic">Potestate</hi> is used in the technical sense. <quote>The <hi rend="italic">par potestas</hi> conferred on the colleague of the presiding officer the right to interpose his veto</quote> (Abbott, <hi rend="italic">Roman Political Institutions,</hi> § 274).</note>
as those who wished to pass the decree, or greater power. He then added a list of the places in which a decree of the senate might lawfully be made, and he showed and maintained that this was regular only  <pb n="v3.p.51"/>  in a place which had been appointed by an augur, and called a <quote>temple.</quote>

<note>A <hi rend="italic">templum</hi> (from <hi rend="italic">temno</hi>) was originally a sacred precinct.</note>
Therefore in the Hostilian Senate House

<note>The <hi rend="italic">curia Hostilia,</hi> on the Comitium (see iv. 5. 1 and note 3), was the earliest senate house, ascribed to Tullus Hostilius, the third king of Rome. It was restored by Sulla in 80 B.C., rebuilt by Faustus Sulla after its destruction by fire in 52 B.C. The <hi rend="italic">curia Julia</hi> was begun by Caesar in 45 B. c. The <hi rend="italic">curia Pompei,</hi> in which Caesar was murdered, was built by Pompey in 55 B.C., near his theatre. Whether it was an <hi rend="italic">exedra</hi> of his colonnade, or a separate building, is uncertain.</note>
and the Pompeian, and later in the Julian, since those were unconsecrated places, <quote>temples</quote> were established by the augurs, in order that in those places lawful decrees of the senate might be made according to the usage of our forefathers. In connection with which he also wrote this, that not all sacred edifices are temples, and that not even the shrine of Vesta was a temple.

<note>The shrine or temple of Vesta, in spite of its sacred character, was not a consecrated <hi rend="italic">temnplum.</hi> It was said to</note>
After this he goes on to say that a decree of the senate made before sunrise or after sunset was not valid, and that those through whom a decree of the senate was made at that time were thought to have committed an act deserving censure. Then he gives much instruction on the same lines: on what days it was not lawful to hold a meeting of the senate; that one who was about to hold a meeting of the senate should first offer up a victim and take the auspices; that questions relating to the gods ought to be presented to the senate before those affecting men; then further that resolutions should be presented indefinitely,

<note>That is, in general terms, as in Livy xxii. 1. 5, <hi rend="italic">cum</hi> (<hi rend="italic">consul</hi>) <hi rend="italic">de re public rettuliset, i.e.</hi> <quote>had proposed a general discussion of the interests of the State.</quote></note>
as affecting the general welfare, or definitely on specific cases; that a decree of the senate was made in two ways: either by division if there was general agreement, or if the matter was disputed, by calling for the opinion of each senator; furthermore the senators ought to have been built by Numa, and was certainly very ancient. It was burned and rebuilt several times, the last restoration being in A.D. 196 by Julia Domna, wife of Septimius Severus.  <pb n="v3.p.53"/>  be asked their opinions in order, beginning with the grade of consul. And in that grade in former times the one to be called upon first was always the one who had first been enrolled in the senate; but at the time when he was writing he said that a new custom had become current, through partiality and a desire to curry favour, of asking first for the opinion of the one whom the presiding officer wished to call upon, provided however that he was of consular rank.

<note>Cf. Suet. <hi rend="italic">Jul.</hi> xxi.</note>
Besides this he discoursed about seizure of goods

<note>In consequence of the issue of a writ of execution; see Mommsen, <hi rend="italic">Statsr.</hi> i. 160, and cf. Suet. <hi rend="italic">Jul.</hi> xvii. 2.</note>
and the imposing of a fine upon a senator who was not present when it was his duty to attend a meeting. These and certain other matters of that kind, first published in the book of which I spoke above, Marcus Varro treated in a letter written to Oppianus.</p>

<p>But when he says that a decree of the senate is commonly made in two ways, either by calling for opinions or by division, that does not seem to agree with what Ateius Capito has written in his <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies.</hi> For in Book VIIII Capito says

<note>Frag. 3, Huschke; 5, Bremer.</note>
that Tubero asserts

<note>Frag. 1, Huschke; <hi rend="italic">De Off. Sen.</hi> 1, Bremer.</note>
that no decree of the senate could be made without a division, since in all decrees of the senate, even in those which are made by calling for opinions, a division was necessary, and Capito himself declares that this is true.

<p>That it is written in the <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi> of Quintus Claudius that wood smeared with alum does not burn.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>THE rhetorician Antonius Julianus, besides holding forth on many other occasions, had once declaimed with marvellous charm and felicity. For such scholastic declamations generally show the characteristics of the same man and the same eloquence, but nevertheless are not every day equally happy. We friends of his therefore thronged about him on all sides and were escorting him home, when, as we were on our way up the Cispian Hill, we saw that a block of houses, built high with many stories, had caught fire, and that now all the neighbouring buildings were burning in a mighty conflagration. Then some one of Julianus' companions said: <quote>The income from city property is great, but the dangers are far greater. But if some remedy could be devised to prevent houses in Rome from so constantly catching fire, by Jove! I would sell my country property and buy in the city.</quote> And Julianus replied to him in his usual happy and graceful style: <quote>If you had read the nineteenth book of the <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi> of Quintus Claudius, that excellent and faithful writer, you would surely have learned from Archelaus, a praefect of king Mithridates, by what method and by what skill you might prevent fires, so that no wooden building of yours  <pb n="v3.p.61"/>  would burn, even though caught and penetrated by the flames.</quote></p>

<p>I inquired what this marvel of Quadrigarius

<note>That is, Quintus Claudius Quadrigarius; see § 4.</note>
was. He rejoined: <quote>In that book then I found it recorded, that when Lucius Sulla attacked the Piraeus in the land of Attica, and Archelaus, praefect of king Mithridates, was defending it against him, Sulla was unable to burn a wooden tower constructed for purposes of defence, although it had been surrounded with fire on every side, because Archelaus had smeared it with alum.</quote> The words of Quadrigarius in that book are as follows:

<note>Frag. 81, Peter<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
<quote>When Sulla had exerted himself for a long time, he led out his troops in order to set fire to a single wooden tower which Archelaus had interposed. He came, he drew near, he put wood under it, he beat off the Greeks, he applied fire; though they tried for a considerable time, they were never able to set it on fire, so thoroughly had Archelaus covered all the wood with alum. Sulla and his soldiers were amazed at this, and failing in his attempt, the general led back his troops.</quote></p>  </div>

<!--<argument>-->

<p>That Plato in the work which he wrote <hi rend="italic">On the Laws</hi> expressed the opinion that inducements to drink more abundantly and more merrily at feasts were not without benefit.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>A MAN from the island of Crete, who was living in Athens, gave out that he was a Platonic philosopher and desired to pass as one. He was, however, a man of no worth, a trifler, boastful of his command  <pb n="v3.p.63"/>  of Grecian eloquence, besides having a passion for wine which fairly made him a laughing stock. At the entertainments which it was the custom of us young men to hold at Athens at the beginning of each week, as soon as we had finished eating and an instructive and pleasant conversation had begun, this fellow, having called for silence that he might be heard, began to speak, and using a cheap and disordered rabble of words after his usual fashion, urged all to drink; and this he declared that he did in accordance with the injunction of Plato, maintaining that Plato in his work <hi rend="italic">On the Laws</hi> had written most eloquently in praise of drunkenness, and had decided that it was beneficial to good and strong men. And at the same time, while he was thus speaking, he drenched such wits as he had with frequent and huge beakers, saying that it was a kind of touchwood and tinder to the intellect and the faculties, if mind and body were inflamed with wine.</p>

<p>However, Plato in the first

<note>9, p. 637, A; 14, p. 647, E.</note>
and second

<note>9, p. 666, A; 12, p. 671, B.</note>
books of his work <hi rend="italic">On the Laws</hi> did not, as that fool thought, praise that shameful intoxication which is wont to undermine and weaken men's minds, although he did not disapprove of that somewhat more generous and cheerful inspiration of wine which is regulated by some temperate arbiters, so to speak, and presidents of banquets. For he thought that by the proper and moderate relaxation of drinking the mind was refreshed and renewed for resuming the duties of sobriety, and that men were gradually rendered happier and became readier to repeat their efforts. At the same time, if there were deep in their hearts any errors of inclination or desire,  <pb n="v3.p.65"/>  which a kind of reverential shame concealed, he thought that by the frankness engendered by wine all these were disclosed without great danger and became more amenable to correction and cure.</p>

<p>And in the same place Plato says this also: that exercises of this kind

<note>That is, in the moderate use of wine, explained by <hi rend="italic">adversum</hi> . . . <hi rend="italic">violentiam.</hi></note>
for the purpose of resisting the violence of wine, are not to be avoided and shunned, and that no one ever appeared to be altogether selfrestrained and temperate whose life and habits had not been tested amid the very dangers of error and in the midst of the enticements of pleasures. For when all the license and attractions of banquets are unknown, and a man is wholly unfamiliar with them, if haply inclination has led him, or chance has induced him, or necessity has compelled him, to take part in pleasures of that kind, then he is as a rule seduced and taken captive, his mind and soul fail to meet the test, but give way, as if attacked by some strange power. Therefore he thought that we ought to meet the issue and contend hand to hand, as in a kind of battle, with pleasure and indulgence in wine, in order that we may not be safe against them by flight or absence, but that by vigour of spirit, by presence of mind, and by moderate use, we may preserve our temperance and self-restraint, and at the same time by warming and refreshing the mind we may free it of whatever frigid austerity or dull bashfulness it may contain.</p>  <pb n="v3.p.67"/>  </div>

<p>What Marcus Cicero thought and wrote about the prefix in the verbs <hi rend="italic">aufugio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">aufcro;</hi> and whether this same preposition is to be seen in the verb <hi rend="italic">autumo.</hi></p><!--</argument>-->

<p>I READ a book of Marcus Cicero's entitled <hi rend="italic">The Orator.</hi> In that book when Cicero had said that the verbs <hi rend="italic">aifugio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">aufero</hi> were indeed formed of the preposition <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> and the verbs <hi rend="italic">fugio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fero,</hi> but that the preposition, in order that the word might be smoother in pronunciation and sound, was changed and altered into the syllable <hi rend="italic">au,</hi>

<note><hi rend="italic">Au</hi> is probably a different preposition from <hi rend="italic">ab;</hi> see <hi rend="italic">Archiv. f. lat. Lex. u. Gr.,</hi> x, p. 480, and xiii, pp. 7 f.</note>
and <hi rend="italic">aufulgio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">aufero</hi> began to be used for <hi rend="italic">abfugio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">abfero;</hi> when he had said this, I say, he afterwards in the same work wrote as follows of the same particle:

<note>§ 158.</note>
<quote>This preposition,</quote> he says, <quote>will be found in no other verb save these two only.</quote></p>

<p>But I have found in the <hi rend="italic">Commentary</hi> of Nigidius

<note>Frag. 51, Swoboda.</note>
that the verb <hi rend="italic">autumo</hi> is formed from the preposition <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> and the verb <hi rend="italic">aestumo</hi> (estimate) and that <hi rend="italic">autumo</hi> is a contracted form of <hi rend="italic">abaestumo,</hi> signifying <hi rend="italic">totum aestumo,</hi> on the analogy of <hi rend="italic">abnumero.</hi>

<note>The derivation of <hi rend="italic">autumo</hi> is uncertain; some take the original meaning to be <quote>divining</quote> and connect it with <hi rend="italic">avis;</hi> see <hi rend="italic">T.L.L. s.v.</hi> Walde rejects that derivation in favour of the one from <hi rend="italic">autem;</hi> cf. Fay, <hi rend="italic">Class. Quart.</hi> i. (1907) p. 25. Here the original meaning is assumed to be <quote>repeat, assert,</quote> and in fact <hi rend="italic">autumo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">itero</hi> are sometimes synonymous. The development of the meanings of <hi rend="italic">autuino</hi> was doubtless influenced by <hi rend="italic">aestumo,</hi> which has the same suffix.</note>
But, be it said with great respect for Publius Nigidius, a most learned man, this seems to be rather bold and clever than true. For <hi rend="italic">autumo</hi> does not only mean <quote>I think,</quote> but also <quote>I say,</quote> <quote>I am of the opinion,</quote> and <quote>I consider,</quote> with which verbs that preposition has no connection either in the composition of the  <pb n="v3.p.69"/>  word or in the expression of its meaning. Besides, Marcus Tullius, a man of unwearied industry in the pursuit of letters, would not have said that these were the only two verbs containing <hi rend="italic">au,</hi> if any third example could be found. But the following point is more worthy of examination and investigation, whether the preposition <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> is altered and changed into the syllable <hi rend="italic">au</hi> for the sake of making the pronunciation smoother, or whether more properly the particle <hi rend="italic">au</hi> has its own origin, and just as many other prepositions were taken from the Greeks, so this one also is derived from that source.

<note>See note 1, p. 66; it is not <quote>taken from the Greeks.</quote></note>

<p>The story of Ventidius Bassus, a man of obscure birth, who is reported to have been the first to celebrate a triumph over the Parthians.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>IT was lately remarked in the conversation of certain old and learned men that in ancient times many persons of most obscure birth, who were previously held in great contempt, had risen to the highest grade of dignity. Nothing that was said about anyone, however, excited so much wonder as the story recorded of Ventidius Bassus. He was born in Picenum in a humble station, and with his mother was taken prisoner by Pompeius Strabo,  <pb n="v3.p.71"/>  father of Pompey the Great, in the Social War,

<note>90–89 B.C. War was waged by the Italian allies against Rome. After a bitter contest, in which 300,000 men are said to have perished, the Romans were victorious, but by the <hi rend="italic">lex Plautia Papiria</hi> granted nearly all the demands of the allies, including the franchise.</note>
in the course of which Strabo subdued the Aesculani.

<note>Aesculum was the capital of the Picenates, one of the seven peoples who made up the allies.</note>
Afterwards, when Pompeius Strabo triumphed, the boy also was carried in his mother's arms amid the rest of the captives before the general's chariot. Later, when he had grown up, he worked hard to gain a livelihood, resorting to the humble calling of a buyer of mules and carriages, which he had contracted with the State to furnish to the magistrates who had been allotted provinces. In that occupation he made the acquaintance of Gaius Caesar and went with him to the Gallic provinces. Then, because he had shown commendable energy in that province, and later during the civil war had executed numerous commissions with promptness and vigour, he not only gained Caesar's friendship, but because of it rose even to the highest rank. Afterwards he was also made tribune of the commons, and then praetor, and at that time he was declared a public enemy by the senate along with Mark Antony. Afterwards, however, when the parties were united, he not only recovered his former rank, but gained first the pontificate and then the consulship.

<note>43 B.C.</note>
At this the Roman people, who remembered that Ventidius Bassus had made a living by taking care of mules, were so indignant that these verses

<note>p. 331, 7, Bährens; cf. Virg. <hi rend="italic">Catal. x.,</hi> believed by some to refer to Ventidius Bassus, but probably wrongly. See <hi rend="italic">Virgil, L.C.L.,</hi> ii., p. 499, n. 2.</note>

<p>Suetonius Tranquillus writes

<note>Frag. 210, Reiff.</note>
that this same Bassus was put in charge of the eastern provinces by Mark Antony, and that when the Parthians invaded Syria he routed them in three battles;

<note>39 and 38 B.C.</note>
that he was the first of all to celebrate a triumph over the Parthians, and was honoured when he died with a public funeral.</p>  </div>

<p>JUST as many other words, through the ignorance and stupidity of those who speak badly what they do not understand, are diverted and turned aside from their proper and usual meaning, so too has the signification of the verb <hi rend="italic">profligo</hi> been changed and perverted. For while it is taken over and derived from <hi rend="italic">adfligo,</hi> in the sense of <quote>bring to ruin and destruction,</quote> and while all who have been careful in their diction have always used the word to express <quote>waste</quote> and <quote>destroy,</quote> calling things that were cast down and destroyed <hi rend="italic">res profligatae,</hi> I now hear that buildings, temples, and many other things that are almost complete and finished are said to be <hi rend="italic">in profligato</hi> and the things themselves <hi rend="italic">profligata.</hi> Therefore that was a very witty reply, as Sulpicius Apollinaris has recorded in one of his <hi rend="italic">Letters,</hi> which a praetor, a man not without learning, made to a simpleton among a crowd of advocates.  <pb n="v3.p.75"/>  <quote>For,</quote> said he, <quote>when that impudent prater had made a request in these terms: 'All the business, renowned sir, about which you said that you would take cognizance to-day, because of your diligence and promptness is done (<hi rend="italic">profligata sunt</hi>); one matter only remains, to which I beg you to give attention.' Then the praetor wittily enough replied: 'Whether the affairs of which you say that I have taken cognizance are done (<hi rend="italic">profligata</hi>), I do not know; but this business which has fallen into your hands is undoubtedly done for (<hi rend="italic">profligatum est</hi>), whether I hear it or not.'</quote></p>

<p>But to indicate what those wish to express who use <hi rend="italic">profligatum</hi> in the sense of <quote>nearly done,</quote> those who have spoken good Latin used, not <hi rend="italic"><choice><corr>profligatum</corr><sic>profigatum</sic></choice>,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">adfectum,</hi> as for example Marcus Cicero, in the speech which he delivered <hi rend="italic">About the Consular Provinces.</hi> His words are as follows:

<p>An evident mistake in the second book of Cicero <hi rend="italic">On Glory,</hi> in the place where he has written about Hector and Ajax.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>IN Cicero's second book <hi rend="italic">On Glory</hi> there is an evident mistake, of no great importance-a mistake  <pb n="v3.p.77"/>  which it does not require a man of learning to detect, but merely one who has read the seventh book of Homer. Therefore I am not so much surprised that Marcus Tullius erred in that matter, as that it was not noticed later and corrected either by Cicero himself or by Tiro, his freedman, a most careful man, who gave great attention to his patron's books. Now, in that book the following passage occurs:

<note>II., frag. 1, p. 989, Orelli<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
<quote>The same poet says that Ajax, when about to engage with Hector in combat, arranges for his burial in case he should chance to be defeated, declaring that he wishes that those who pass his tomb even after many ages should thus speak:

<p>IT has been observed during a long period of human recollection, and found to be true, that for almost all old men the sixty-third year of their age Both were adopted by Augustus, and on the death of the young Marcellus were made <hi rend="italic">principes iuventutis,</hi> and thus designated as the successors of Augustus.  <pb n="v3.p.79"/>  is attended with danger, and with some disaster involving either serious bodily illness, or loss of life, or mental suffering.

Night before last, too, when I was reading a volume of letters of the deified Augustus, written to his grandson Gaius, and was led on by the elegance of the style, which was easy and simple, by Heaven without mannerisms or effort, in one of the letters I ran upon a reference to this very belief about that same year.

<quote>The leaders in gluttony and luxury declare that an entertainment is not elegant, unless, when you are eating with the greatest relish, your plate is removed and a better, richer dainty comes from the reserves.

<note>92 B.C.</note>
after that decree of the senate Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus and Lucius Licinius Crassus the censors issued the following edict for restraining the Latin rhetoricians:

<p>Why young men of noble rank at Athens gave up playing the pipes, although it was one of their native customs.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>ALCIBIADES the Athenian in his boyhood was being trained in the liberal arts and sciences at the home of his uncle, Pericles; and Pericles had ordered Antigenides, a player on the pipes, to be sent for, to teach the boy to play on that instrument, which was then considered a great accomplishment. But when the pipes were handed to him and he had put them to his lips and blown, disgusted at the ugly distortion of his face, he threw them away and broke them in two. When this matter was noised abroad, by the universal consent of the Athenians of that time the art of playing the pipes was given up.

<p>That the battle which Gaius Caesar fought on the plains of Pharsalus during the civil war was announced on the very same day at Patavium in Italy, and his victory foretold, by the divination of a seer.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>ON the day that Gaius Caesar and Gnaeus Pompeius engaged in battle in Thessaly during the civil war, an event occurred at Patavium in Transpadane Italy, which is deserving of record. A priest called Cornelius, a man of good birth, honoured for scrupulousness in his office and revered for the purity of his life, was suddenly seized by a prophetic inspiration and said that he saw a most furious battle taking place afar off; then he shouted out, just as if he were personally taking part in the engagement, that some were giving way, others pressing on; that he saw before him carnage, flight, flying weapons, a renewal of the engagement, an attack, groans and wounds; and later he suddenly exclaimed that Caesar was victorious.</p>

<p>At the time the prophecy of the priest Cornelius seemed unimportant and without meaning. Afterwards, however, it caused great surprise, since not only the time of the battle which was fought in Thessaly, and its predicted outcome, were verified, but all the shifting fortunes of the day and the very conflict of the two armies were represented by the gestures and words of the seer.

<p>Certain facts about the birth, life and character of the poet Euripides, and about the end of his life.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>THEOPOMPUS says

<note><hi rend="italic">F.H. G.</hi> i. 294.</note>
that the mother of the poet Euripides made a living by selling country produce. Furthermore, when Euripides was born, his father was assured by the astrologers that the boy, when he grew up, would be victor in the games; for that was his destiny. His father, understanding this to mean that he ought to be an athlete, exercised and strengthened his son's body and took him to Olympia to contend among the wrestlers. And at first he was not admitted to the contest because of his time of life,

<note>He was too old for the boys' races.</note>
but afterwards he engaged in the Eleusinian

<note>Athletic games in connection with the Eleusinian mysteries.</note>
and Thesean

<note>A festival held at Athens in the autumn in the month Pyanepsion, in honour of Theseus.</note>
contests and won crowns.  <pb n="v3.p.107"/>  Later, turning from attention to bodily exercise to the desire of training his mind, he was a pupil of the natural philosopher Anaxagoras and the rhetorician Prodicus, and, in moral philosophy, of Socrates. At the age of eighteen he attempted to write a tragedy. Philochorus relates

<note><hi rend="italic">F.H. G.</hi> i. 412.</note>
that there is on the island of Salamis a grim and gloomy cavern,

<note>These words are probably not part of the quotation.</note>
which I myself have seen, in which Euripides wrote tragedies. He is said to have had an exceeding antipathy towards almost all women, either because he had a natural disinclination to their society, or because he had had two wives at the same time (since that was permitted by a decree passed by the Athenians) and they had made wedlock hateful to him. Aristophanes also notices his antipathy to women in the first edition of the <hi rend="italic">Thesmophoriazousae</hi> in these verses:

<note>453 ff.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Now then I urge and call on all our sex</l> <l>This man to punish for his many crimes.</l> <l>For on us, women, he brings bitter woes,</l> <l>Himself brought up 'mid bitter garden plants.</l></quote>  But Alexander the Aetolian composed the following lines about Euripides:

<note><hi rend="italic">Anal. Alex.</hi> p. 247, Meineke.</note>
</p>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l part="I">The pupil of stout Anaxagoras,</l> <l>Of churlish speech and gloomy, ne'er has learned</l> <l>To jest amid the wine; but what he wrote</l> <l>Might honey and the Sirens well have known.</l></quote>

<p>When Euripides was in Macedonia at the court of Archelaus, and had become an intimate friend of the king, returning home one night from a dinner with the monarch he was torn by dogs, which were set  <pb n="v3.p.109"/>  upon him by a rival of his, and death resulted from his wounds.

<note>He died in 406 B.C.; according to another version of the story it was a band of women who tore him to pieces. Both tales are of doubtful authenticity; the one told by Gellius appears also in Athenaeus xiii. 597, but is denied in verses preserved in Suidas, <hi rend="italic">s.v.</hi> <foreign xml:lang="grc">u(pai/meke.</foreign></note>
The Macedonians treated his tomb and his memory with such honour that they used to proclaim: <quote>Never, Euripides, shall thy monument perish,</quote> also by way of self-glorification, because the distinguished poet had met his death and been buried in their land. Therefore when envoys, sent to them by the Athenians, begged that they should allow his bones to be moved to Athens, his native land, the Macedonians unanimously persisted in refusing.</p>  </div>

<p>A story of the distinguished leader Sertorius; of his cunning, and of the clever devices which he used to control and conciliate his barbarian soldiers.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>SERTORIUS, a brave man and a distinguished general, was skilled in using and commanding an army. In times of great difficulty he would lie to  <pb n="v3.p.111"/>  his soldiers, if a lie was advantageous, he would read forged letters for genuine ones, feign dreams, and resort to fictitious omens, if such devices helped him to keep up the spirits of his soldiers. the following story about Sertorius is particularly well known: A white hind of remarkable beauty, agility and swiftness was given him as a present by a man of Lusitania. He tried to convince everyone that the animal had been given him by the gods, and that inspired by the divine power of Diana, it talked with him, and showed and indicated what it was expedient to do; and if any command which he felt obliged to give his soldiers seemed unusually difficult, he declared that he had been advised by the hind. When he said that, all willingly rendered obedience, as if to a god. One day, when an advance of the enemy had been reported, the hind, alarmed by the hurry and confusion, took to flight and hid in a neighbouring marsh, and after being sought for in vain was believed to have perished. Not many days later, word was brought to Sertorius that the hind had been found. Then he bade the one who had brought the news to keep silence, threatening him with punishment in case he revealed the matter to anyone; and he ordered him suddenly on the following day to let the animal into the place where lie himself was with his friends. Then, next day, having called in his friends, he said that he had dreamed that the lost hind had returned to him, and after its usual manner had told him what ought to be done. Thereupoli he signed to the slave to do what he had ordered; the hind was let loose and burst into Sertorius' room, amid shouts of amazement.</p>  <pb n="v3.p.113"/>

<p>This credulity of the barbarians was very helpful to Sertorius in important matters. It is recorded that of those tribes which acted with Sertorius, although he was defeated in many battles, not one ever deserted him, although that race of men is most inconstant.</p>  </div>

<p>IN the first book of the work of Laelius Felix addressed <hi rend="italic">To Quintus Mucius</hi> it is said

that the <hi rend="italic">comitia calata,</hi> or <quote>convoked assembly,</quote> was held on behalf of the college of pontiffs for the purpose of installing the king

<note>That is, the <hi rend="italic">rex sacrorum;</hi> see note on x. 15. 21.</note>
or the flames. Of these assemblies some were those <quote>of the curies</quote>, others those <quote>of the centuries</quote>; the former were called together (<hi rend="italic">calari</hi> being used in the sense of <quote>convoke</quote>) by the curiate lictor, the latter by a horn blower.</p>  <pb n="v3.p.119"/>

<p>In that same assembly, which we have said was called <hi rend="italic">calata,</hi> or <quote>convoked,</quote> wills were customarily made and sacrifices annulled.

<note>See Mommsen, <hi rend="italic">Staatsr.</hi> iii, p. 307, n. 2.</note>
when the men were called into line for the purpose of fighting, a third the symbolic sale of a householder's property by means of the coin and balance.

<note>See note on xv. 13. 11.</note>
</p>

<p>In the same book of Laelius Felix this is written: <quote>One who orders a part of the people to assemble, but not all the people, ought to announce a council rather than an assembly. Moreover, tribunes do not summon the patricians, nor may they refer any question to them. Therefore bills which are passed on the initiative of the tribunes of the commons are properly called <hi rend="italic">plebiscita,</hi> or 'decrees of the commons,' rather than 'laws.' In former times the patricians were not bound by such decrees until the dictator Quintus Hortensius passed a law, providing that all the Quirites should be bound by whatever enactment the commons should pass.</quote>

<note>In 287 B.C.</note>
It is also written in the same book: <quote>When voting is done according to families of men,

<note>The <hi rend="italic">comitia curiata</hi> were organized on the basis of the thirty <hi rend="italic">curiae</hi> of the three original Roman tribes.

the assembly is called 'curiate'; when it is according to property and age, ' centuriate'; when according to regions and localities, 'tribal.' Further it impious for the assembly of the centuries to be held within the pomerium, because the army must be summoned outside of the city, and it is not lawful for it to be summoned within the city. Therefore it was customary for the  <pb n="v3.p.121"/>  assembly of the centuries to be held in the field of Mars, and the army to be summoned there for purposes of defence while the people were busy casting their votes.</quote></p>  </div>

And there is no doubt that he defended Sextus Roscius on a charge of murder the year after he spoke <hi rend="italic">In Defence of Quinctius;</hi> that is, at the age of twenty-seven, in the consulship of Lucius Sulla Felix and Metellus Pius, the former for a second time.</p>

that he pleaded for Sextus Roscius in the twenty-sixth year of his age. But the mistake of Nepos is greater than that of Fenestella, unless anyone is inclined to believe that Nepos, led by a  <pb n="v3.p.123"/>  feeling of friendship and regard, suppressed four years in order to increase our admiration of Cicero, by making it appear that he delivered his brilliant speech <hi rend="italic">In Defence of Roscius</hi> when he was a very young man.</p>

<p>This also has been noted and recorded by the admirers of both orators, that Demosthenes and Cicero delivered their first brilliant speeches in the courts at the same age, the former <hi rend="italic">Against Androtion</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Against Timocrates</hi> at the age of twenty-seven, the latter when a year younger <hi rend="italic">In Defence of Quinctius</hi> and at twenty-seven <hi rend="italic">In Defence of Sextus Roscius.</hi> Also, the number of years which they lived did not differ very greatly; Cicero died at sixty-three, Demosthenes at sixty.

<p>Whether the word <hi rend="italic">petorritum,</hi> applied to a vehicle, is Greek or Gallic.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>THOSE who approach the study of letters late in life, after they are worn out and exhausted by some other occupation, particularly if they are garrulous and of only moderate keenness, make themselves exceedingly ridiculous and silly by displaying their would-be knowledge. To this class that man surely belongs, who lately talked fine-spun nonsense about <hi rend="italic">petorrita,</hi> or <quote>four-wheeled wagons.</quote> For when the question was asked, what form of vehicle the <hi rend="italic">petorritum</hi> was, and from what language the word came, he falsely described a form of vehicle very unlike the real one; he also declared that the name was Greek and interpreted it as meaning <quote>flying wheels,</quote>

<p>When I had got together many copies of the <hi rend="italic">Commentaries</hi> of Probus, I did not find that spelling in them, and I do not believe that Probus used it anywhere else. For <hi rend="italic">petorritum</hi> is not a hybrid word derived in part from the Greek, but the entire word belongs to the people across the Alps; for it is a Gallic word. It is found in the fourteenth book of Marcus Varro's <hi rend="italic">Divine Antiquities,</hi> where Varro, speaking of <hi rend="italic">petorritum,</hi> says

<note>Frag. 108, Agahd.</note>
that it is a Gallic term.

<note>Gellius is right; <hi rend="italic">petorrita,</hi> like several other words connected with horses and carriages, is borrowed from the Gallic.

<p>THE island of Rhodes, of ancient fame, and the fairest and richest town in it were besieged and assaulted by Demetrius, a famous general of his time, who was surnamed <foreign xml:lang="grc">Poliorkhth/s,</foreign> or <quote>the taker of cities,</quote> from his skill and training in conducting sieges and the cleverness of the engines which he devised for the capture of towns.

<p>In this building was that famous picture of Ialysus,

<p>WHEN I was still young and a schoolboy, I heard that this Greek sentiment which I have subjoined was uttered by the philosopher Musonius, and since it is a true and brilliant saying, expressed briefly and roundly, I very willingly committed it to memory:

"If you accomplish anything noble with toil, the toil passes, but the noble deed endures. If you do anything shameful with pleasure, the pleasure passes, but the shame endures."</p>

<p>Later, I read that same sentiment in the speech of Marcus Cato which he delivered <hi rend="italic">At Numantia to the Knights.</hi> Although it is expressed somewhat loosely and diffusely compared with the Greek which I have given, yet, since it is prior in time and more ancient, it ought to seem worthy of greater respect.

<quote>Bear in mind, that if through toil you accomplish a good deed, that toil will quickly pass from you, the good deed will not leave you so long as you live; but if through pleasure you do anything dishonourable, the pleasure will quickly pass away, that dishonourable act will remain with you for ever.</quote></p>  <pb n="v3.p.133"/>  </div>

<p>The nature of the rule of the logicians in disputation and declamation, and the defect of that rule.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>THEY say that it is a rule of the dialectic art, that if there is inquiry and discussion of any subject, and you are called upon to answer a question which is asked, you should answer the question by a simple <quote>yes</quote> or <quote>no.</quote> And those who do not observe that rule, but answer more than they were asked, or differently, are thought to be both uneducated and unobservant of the customs and laws of debate. As a matter of fact this dictum undoubtedly ought to be followed in very many debates. For a discussion will become endless and hopelessly involved, unless it is confined to simple questions and answers. But there seem to be some discussions in which, if you answer what you are asked briefly and directly, you are caught in a trap. For if anyone should put a question in these words: <quote>I ask you to tell me whether you have given up committing adultery or not,</quote> whichever way you answer according to this rule of debate, whether you say <quote>yes</quote> or <quote>no,</quote> you will be caught in a dilemma, equally if you should say that you are an adulterer, or should deny it; for one who has not given up a thing has not of necessity ever done it. That then is a deceptive kind of catch-question, and can by no means lead to the inference and conclusion that he commits adultery who says that he has not given up doing it. But what will the defenders of that rule do in that dilemma, in which they must necessarily be caught, if they give a simple answer to the question? For  <pb n="v3.p.135"/>  if I should ask any one of them: <quote>Do you, or do you not, have what you have not lost? I demand the answer 'yes' or no,'</quote> whichever way he replies briefly, he will be caught. For if he says that he does not have what he has not lost, the conclusion will be drawn that he has no eyes, since he has not lost them; but if he says that he has it, it will be concluded that he has horns, because he has not lost them. Therefore it will be more cautious and more correct to reply as follows: <quote>I have whatever I had, if I have not lost it.</quote> But an answer of that kind is not made in accordance with the rule which we have mentioned; for more is answered than was asked. Therefore this proviso also is commonly added to the rule, that one need not answer catchquestions.</p>  </div>

<p>By what means Erasistratus, the physician, said that one could do for a time without eating, if food chanced to be lacking, and endure hunger; and his own words on that subject.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>I OFTEN spent whole days in Rome with Favorinus. His delightful conversation held my mind enthralled, and I attended him wherever he went, as if actually taken prisoner by his eloquence; to such a degree did he constantly delight me with his most agreeable discourse. Once when he had gone to visit a sick man, and I had entered with him, having conversed for some time in Greek about the man's illness with the physicians who chanced to be there at the time, he said: <quote>This ought not to seem surprising either, that although previously he was always  <pb n="v3.p.137"/>  eager for food, now after an enforced fast of three days all his former appetite is lost. For what Erasistratus has written is pretty nearly true,</quote> said he, <quote>that the empty and open fibres of the intestines, the hollowness of the belly within and the empty and yawning cavity of the stomach, cause hunger; but when these are either filled with food or are contracted and brought together by continued fasting, then, since the place into which the food is received is either filled or made smaller, the impulse to take food, or to crave it, is destroyed.</quote> He declared that Erasistratus also said that the Scythians too, when it was necessary for them to endure protracted hunger, bound a very tight bandage around their bellies. That by such compression of the belly it was believed that hunger could be prevented.</p>

<p>These things and many others of the kind Favorinus said most entertainingly on that occasion; but later, when I chanced to be reading the first book of Erasistratus' <hi rend="italic">Distinctions,</hi> I found in that book the very passage which 1 had heard Favorinus quote.

<note>p. 193, Fuchs.</note>
The words of Erasistratus on the subject are as follows: <quote>I reasoned therefore that the ability to fast for a long time is caused by strong compression of the belly; for with those who voluntarily fast for a long time, at first hunger ensues, but later it passes away.</quote> Then a little later: <quote>And the Scythians also are accustomed, when on any occasion it is necessary to fast, to bind up the belly with broad belts, in the belief that the hunger thus troubles them less; and one may almost say too that when the stomach is full, men feel no hunger for the reason that there is no vacuity in it, and likewise when it is greatly compressed there is no vacuity.</quote></p>  <pb n="v3.p.139"/>

<p>In the same book Erasistratus declares that a kind of irresistibly violent hunger, which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">bou/limos,</foreign> or <quote>ox-hunger,</quote> is much more apt to be felt on very cold days than when tile weather is calm and pleasant, and that the reasons why this disorder prevails especially at such times have not yet become clear to him. The words which he uses are these: <quote>It is unknown and requires investigation, both in reference to the case in question and in that of others who suffer from 'ox-hunger,' why this symptom appears rather on cold days than in warm weather.</quote></p>  </div>

<p>CINCIUS writes in his third book <hi rend="italic">On Military Science</hi>

<note>Frag. 12, Huschke; 2, Bermer.</note>
that the war-herald of the Roman people, when he declared war on the enemy and hurled a spear into their territory, used the following words: <quote>Whereas the Hermundulan people and the men of the Hermundulam people have made war against the Roman people and have transgressed against them, and whereas the Roman people has ordered war with the Hermundulan people and the men of the Hermundulans, therefore I and the Roman people declare and make war with the Hermundulan people and with the men of the Hermundulans.</quote></p>

<p>Also in the fifth book of the same Cincius <hi rend="italic">On</hi>  <pb n="v3.p.141"/>  <hi rend="italic">Military Science</hi> we read the following:

<note>Frag. 13, Huschke; 2, Bremer.</note>
"When a levy was made in ancient times and soldiers were enrolled, the tribune of the soldiers compelled them to take an oath in the following words dictated by the magistrate: 'In the army of the consuls Gaius Laelius, son of Gaius, and Lucius Cornelius, son of Publius, and for ten miles around it, you will not with malice aforethought commit a theft, either alone or with others, of more than the value of a silver sesterce in any one day. And except for one spear, a spear shaft, wood, fruit, fodder, a bladder, a purse and a torch, if you find or carry off anything there which is not your own and is worth more than one silver sesterce, you will bring it to the consul Gaius Laelius, son of Gaius, or to the consul Lucius Cornelius, son of Publius, or to whomsoever either of them shall appoint, or you will make known within the next three days whatever you have found or wrongfully carried off, or you will restore it to him whom you suppose to be its rightful owner, as you wish to do what is right."</p>

<p><quote>Moreover, when soldiers had been enrolled, a day was appointed on which they should appear and should answer to the consul's summons; then an oath was taken, binding them to appear, with the addition of the following exceptions: 'Unless there be any of the following excuses: a funeral in his family or purification from a dead body

<p>The meaning of <hi rend="italic">vestibulum</hi> and the various derivations proposed for the word.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>THERE are numerous words which we use commonly, without however clearly knowing what their proper and exact meaning is; but following an uncertain and vulgar tradition without investigating the matter, we seem to say what we mean rather than say it; an example is <hi rend="italic">vestibulum</hi> or <quote>vestibule,</quote> a word frequently met in conversation, yet not wholly clear to all who readily make use of it. For I have observed that some men who are by  <pb n="v3.p.145"/>  no means without learning think that the vestibule is the front part of the house, which is commonly known as the <hi rend="italic">atrium.</hi> Gaius Aelius Gallus, in the second book of his work <hi rend="italic">On the Meaning of Words relating to the Civil Law,</hi> says

<note>Frag. 5, Huschke; 23, Bremer.</note>
that the vestibule is not in the house itself, nor is it a part of the house, but is an open place before the door of the house, through which there is approach and access to the house from the street, while on the right and left the door is hemmed in by buildings extended to the street and the door itself is at a distance from the street, separated from it by this vacant space. Furthermore, it is often inquired what the derivation of this word is; but nearly everything that I have read on the subject has seemed awkward and absurd. But what I recall hearing from Sulpicius Apollinaris, a man of choice learning, is as follows: <quote>The particle <hi rend="italic">ve,</hi> like some others, is now intensive and now the reverse; for of <hi rend="italic">vetis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vehenens,</hi> the former is made by intensifying the idea of age, with elision,

<note>Properly syncope; from <hi rend="italic">ve + actas!</hi> On <hi rend="italic">vehemens</hi> see note on v. 12. 10 (i, p. 414).</note>
and the latter from the power and force of the mind. But <hi rend="italic">vescus,</hi> which is formed from the particle <hi rend="italic">ve</hi> and <hi rend="italic">esca,</hi> assumes the force of both opposite meanings. For Lucretius

<note>i. 326; see v. 12. 10 and note.</note>
uses <hi rend="italic">vescum salem,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">'</hi> devouring salt,' in one sense, indicating a strong propensity to eat, Lucilius

<note>v. 602, Marx.</note>
in the other sense, of fastidiousness in eating.

<note>Munro, on Lucr. i. 326, takes <hi rend="italic">vescus</hi> in the sense of <quote>slowly eating away</quote> which would correspond with Lucilius' use of the word.</note>
Those then in early times who made spacious houses left a vacant place before the entrance, midway between the door of the house and the street. There those who had come to pay their respects to the master of  <pb n="v3.p.147"/>  the house took their places before they were admitted, standing neither in the street nor within the house. Therefore from that standing in a large space, and as it were from a kind of 'standing place,' the name vestibule was given to the great places left, as I have said, before the doors of houses, in which those who had come to call stood, before they were admitted to the house.

<note>This derivation is correct, but <hi rend="italic">re-</hi> is used in the sense of <quote>apart.</quote></note>
But we shall have to bear in mind that this word was not always used literally by the early writers, but in various figurative senses, which however are so formed as not to differ widely from that proper meaning which we have mentioned, as for example in the sixth book of Vergil:

<note><hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> vi. 273.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Before the vestibule, e'en in Hell's very jaws,</l> <l>Avenging Cares and Grief have made their beds.</l></quote>  For he does not call the front part of the infernal dwelling the 'vestibule,' although one might be misled into thinking it so called, but he designates two places outside the doors of Orcus, the ' vestibule' and the <hi rend="italic">fauces,</hi> of which 'vestibule' is applied to the part as it were before the house itself and before the private rooms of Orcus, while <hi rend="italic">fauces</hi> designates the narrow passage through which the vestibule was approached.</quote>

<note>In the Roman house the term <hi rend="italic">faces</hi> was applied to the passageway leading from the front door into the atrium. The <hi rend="italic">fauces</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">vestibulum</hi> formed one continuous passageway, separated by the door, the <hi rend="italic">fauces</hi> being inside and the <hi rend="italic">vesti. bulum</hi> outside; see <hi rend="italic">Harv. Stud. Class. Phil.</hi> i. 1 <hi rend="italic">ff.</hi> and most modern handbooks. In § 10 <hi rend="italic">vestibulum</hi> is correctly defined; in § 12 the relative positions of <hi rend="italic">fauces</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vestibulum</hi> are inverted, and both are put <quote>outside the door.</quote> The <hi rend="italic">vestibulum</hi> can properly be said to be <quote>approached</quote> by the <hi rend="italic">fauces</hi> only <hi rend="italic">from within.</hi> Virgil probably used <hi rend="italic">fauces</hi> in its ordinary sense of <quote>jaws.</quote></note>

<p>Now Publius Nigidius, in the book which he wrote <hi rend="italic">On Sacrificial Meats,</hi> says

<note>Frag. 81, Swoboda.</note>
that not sheep alone are called <hi rend="italic">bidentes,</hi> but all victims that are two years old; yet he has not explained clearly why they are called <hi rend="italic">bidentes.</hi> But I find written in some <hi rend="italic">Notes on the Pontifical Law</hi>

<note>iii, p. 566, Bremer.</note>
what I had myself thought, that they were first called <hi rend="italic">bidennes,</hi> that is <hi rend="italic">biennes</hi> with the insertion of the letter <hi rend="italic">d;</hi> then by long use in speech the word became changed and from <hi rend="italic">bidennes</hi> was formed <hi rend="italic">bidentes,</hi> because the latter seemed easier and less harsh to pronounce.</p>

<p>However, Julius Hyginus, who seems not to have been ignorant of pontifical law, in the fourth book of his work <hi rend="italic">On Virgil,</hi> wrote

<note>Fr. 3, Fun.</note>
that those victims were called <hi rend="italic">bidentes</hi> which were of such an age that they had two prominent teeth.

<!--<argument>-->

<p>The meaning of what the logicians call <quote>an axiom,</quote> and what it is called by our countrymen; and some other things which belong to the elements of the dialectic art.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>WHEN I wished to be introduced to the science of logic and instructed in it, it was necessary to take up and learn what the dialecticians call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ei)sagwgai/</foreign> or <quote>introductory exercises.</quote>

<note>II. 194, Arn.</note>
Then because at first  <pb n="v3.p.159"/>  I had to learn about axioms, which Marcus Varro calls,

<note>Fr. 29, G. and S.</note>
now <hi rend="italic">proposita,</hi> or <quote>propositions,</quote> and now <hi rend="italic">proloquia,</hi> or <quote>preliminary statements,</quote> I sought diligently for the <hi rend="italic">Commentary on Proloquia</hi> of Lucius Aelius, a learned man, who was the teacher of Varro; and finding it in the library of Peace,

<note>Vespasian's Temple of Peace in the Forum Pacis.</note>
I read it. But I found in it nothing that was written to instruct or to make the matter clear, but Aelius

<note>p. 54. 19. Fun.</note>
seems to have made that book rather as suggestions for his own use than for the purpose of teaching others.</p>

<p>I therefore of necessity returned to my Greek books. From these I obtained this definition of an axiom: <foreign xml:lang="grc">lekto\n au)totele\s a)po/fanton o(/son a)f' au(tw=|.</foreign>

<note>An absolute and self-evident proposition.</note>
This I forbore to turn into Latin, since it would have been necessary to use new and as yet uncoined words, such as, from their strangeness, the ear could hardly endure. But Marcus Varro in the twenty-fourth book of his <hi rend="italic">Latin Language,</hi> dedicated to Cicero, thus defines the word very briefly:

<note>Fr. 29, G. and S.</note>
<quote><hi rend="italic">A proloquium</hi> is a statement in which nothing is lacking.</quote></p>

<p>But his definition will be clearer if I give an example. An axiom, then, or a preliminary proposition, if you prefer, is of this kind: <quote>Hannibal was a Carthaginian</quote>; <quote>Scipio destroyed Numantia</quote>; <quote>Milo was found guilty of murder</quote>; <quote>pleasure is neither a good nor an evil</quote>; and in general any saying which is a full and perfect thought, so expressed in words that it is necessarily either true or false, is called by the logicians an <quote>axiom,</quote> by Marcus Varro, as I have said, a <quote>proposition,</quote> but by Marcus Cicero

<note><hi rend="italic">Tusc. Disp.</hi> i. 14.</note>
a <hi rend="italic">pronuntiatum, or</hi> <quote>pronouncement,</quote>  <pb n="v3.p.161"/>  a word however which he declared that he used <quote>only until I can find a better one.</quote></p>

<p>But what the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">sunhmme/non a)ci/wma,</foreign> or <quote>a hypothetical syllogism,</quote>

<note>Literally, <quote>a connected axiom.</quote> See II. 213. Arn.</note>
some of our countrymen

<note>Aelius Stilo, Fr. 74, p. 75 Fun.</note>
call <hi rend="italic">adiunctum,</hi> others <hi rend="italic">conexum.</hi>

<note>Two connected sentences of which the second follows as the result of the first. 4 II. 218. Arn.</note>
The following are examples of this: <quote>If Plato is walking, Plato is moving</quote>; <quote>if it is day, the sun is above the earth.</quote> Also what they call <foreign xml:lang="grc">sumpeplegme/non,</foreign> or <quote>a compound proposition,</quote> we call <hi rend="italic">coniunctum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">copulatum;</hi> for example: <quote>Publius Scipio, son of Paulus, was twice consul and celebrated a triumph, and held the censorship, and was the colleague of Lucius Mummius in his censorship.</quote> But in the whole of a proposition of this kind, if one member is false, even if the rest are true, the whole is said to be false. For if to all those true statements which I have made about that Scipio I add <quote>and he worsted Hannibal in Africa,</quote> which is false, all those other statements which are made in conjunction will not be true, because of this one false statement which is made with them.</p>

<p>There is also another form, which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">diezeugme/non a)ci/wma,</foreign> or <quote>a disjunctive proposition,</quote> and we call <hi rend="italic">disiunctum.</hi> For example: <quote>Pleasure is either good or evil, or it is neither good nor evil.</quote>

<note>aut s.d. sum, <hi rend="italic">added by Hertz;</hi> aut s.d. est, <hi rend="italic">Skutsch.</hi></note>
Now all statements which are contrasted ought to be opposed to each other, and their opposites, which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)ntikei/mena,</foreign> ought also to be opposed. Of all statements which are contrasted, one ought to be true and the rest false. But if none at all of them is true, or if all, or more than one, are true, or if the contrasted things are not at odds, or if those which are opposed to each other are not contrary, then that is a false contrast and is called  <pb n="v3.p.163"/>  <foreign xml:lang="grc">paradiezeugme/non.</foreign> For instance, this case, in which the things which are opposed are not contraries: <quote>Either you run or you walk or you stand.</quote> These acts are indeed contrasted, but when opposed they are not contrary; for <quote>not to walk</quote> and <quote>not to stand</quote> and <quote><hi rend="italic">not</hi> to run</quote> are not contrary to one another, since those things are called <quote>contraries</quote> which cannot be true at the same time. But you may at once and at the same time neither walk, stand, nor run.</p>

<p>But for the present it will be enough to have given this little taste of logic, and I need only add by way of advice, that the study and knowledge of this science in its rudiments does indeed, as a rule, seem forbidding and contemptible, as well as disagreeable and useless. But when you have made some progress, then finally its advantages will become clear to you, and a kind of insatiable desire for acquiring it will arise; so much so, that if you do not set bounds to it, there will be great danger lest, as many others have done, you should reach a second childhood amid those mazes and meanders of logic, as if among the rocks of the Sirens.</p>  </div>

<p><hi rend="italic">SUSQUE dequefero, susque deque sum,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">susque deque habeo</hi>

<note>Susque deque, <quote>both up and down,</quote> is an expression denoting indifference.

So true is it that many of us hasten to use out-of-the-way words that we have stumbled upon, but not to learn their meaning.

<p>The meaning of <hi rend="italic">proletarii</hi> and <hi rend="italic">capite censi;</hi> also of <hi rend="italic">adsiduus</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Twelve Tables,</hi> and the origin of the word.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>ONE day there was a cessation of business in the Forum at Rome, and as the holiday was being joyfully celebrated, it chanced that one of the books of the <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi> of Ennius was read in an assembly of very many persons. In this book the following lines occurred:

<note><hi rend="italic">Ann.</hi> 183 ff.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>With shield and savage sword is Proletarius armed</l> <l>At public cost; they guard our walls, our mart and town.</l></quote>  Then the question was raised there, what <hi rend="italic">proletarius</hi> meant. And seeing in that company a man who was skilled in the civil law, a friend of mine, I asked him to explain the word to us; and when he rejoined that he was an expert in civil law and not in grammatical matters, I said: " You in particular ought to explain this, since, as you declare, you are skilled in civil law. For Quintus Ennius took this word from your <hi rend="italic">Twelve Tables,</hi> in which, if I remember aright, we have the following:

<note>i. 4.</note>
'For a freeholder let the protector

<note>The <hi rend="italic">vindex</hi> is here one who voluntarily agrees to go before the magistrate as the representative of the defendant, and thereby takes upon himself the action in the stead of the latter (Allen, <hi rend="italic">Remnants of Early Latin,</hi> p. 85).</note>
be a freeholder. For a proletariate citizen

<note>The <hi rend="italic">proletarii</hi> (cf. <hi rend="italic">proles</hi>) were <quote>child-producers,</quote> who made no other contribution to the State; see § 13.</note>
let whoso will be protector. <quote>We therefore ask you to consider that not one of the books of Quintus Ennius' <hi rend="italic">Annals,</hi> but the <hi rend="italic">Twelve</hi>  <pb n="v3.p.169"/>  <hi rend="italic">Tables</hi> are being read, and interpret the meaning of 'proletariate citizen' in that law.</quote> <quote>It is true,</quote> said he, <quote>that if I had learned the law of the Fauns and Aborigines, I ought to explain and interpret this. But since <hi rend="italic">proletarii, adsidui, sanates, vades, subvades,</hi> 'twenty-five asses,' 'retaliation,' and trials for theft 'by plate and girdle'

<note><hi rend="italic">XII Tab.</hi> i. 4, 5, 10; viii. 2, 4, 15. For <hi rend="italic">proletarii</hi> see note, p. 167. The <hi rend="italic">adsidui</hi> were <quote>permanent settlers,</quote> or taxpayers, belonging to one of the five upper Servian classes. The <hi rend="italic">sanates</hi> seem to have been clients or dependents of the wealthy Roman citizens. <hi rend="italic">Vades</hi> were sureties, who gave bail; <hi rend="italic">subvades,</hi> sub-sureties, who gave security for the bail. On <hi rend="italic">viginti quinque asses,</hi> the penalty for an assault, see xx. 1. 12; for <hi rend="italic">taliones, xx.</hi> 1. 14; and for <hi rend="italic">cum lance et licio,</hi> note on xi. 18. 9.</note>
have disappeared, and since all the ancient lore of the <hi rend="italic">Twelve Tables,</hi> except for legal questions before the court of the centumviri, was put to sleep by the Aebutian law,

<note>The date is unknown,</note>
I ought only to exhibit interest in, and knowledge of, the law and statutes and legal terms which we now actually use.</quote>"</p>

<p>Just then, by some chance, we caught sight of Julius Paulus passing by, the most learned poet within my recollection. We greeted him, and when he was asked to enlighten us as to the meaning and derivation of that word, he said: "Those of the Roman commons who were humblest and of smallest means, and who reported no more than fifteen hundred asses at the census, were called <hi rend="italic">proletarii,</hi> but those who were rated as having no property at all, or next to none, were termed <hi rend="italic">capite censi,</hi> or 'counted by head.' And the lowest rating of the <hi rend="italic">capite censi</hi> was three hundred and seventy-five asses. But since property and money were regarded as a hostage and pledge of loyalty to the State, and since there was in them a kind of guarantee and assurance of patriotism, neither the <hi rend="italic">proletarii</hi> nor the <hi rend="italic">capite censi</hi> were enrolled as soldiers except in some time of extraordinary disorder, because they had  <pb n="v3.p.171"/>  little or no property and money. However, the class of <hi rend="italic">proletarii</hi> was somewhat more honourable in fact and in name than that of the <hi rend="italic">capite censi;</hi> for in times of danger to the State, when there was a scarcity of men of military age, they were enrolled for hasty service,

<note>That is, to meet a <hi rend="italic">tumultus,</hi> <quote>a rebellion</quote> or irregular warfare. At first used as a military term, <hi rend="italic">tumultuarius</hi> later acquired a general sense; cf. <hi rend="italic">tumultuario rogo,</hi> <quote>on a hastily erected pyre,</quote> Suet. <hi rend="italic">Calig.</hi> lix.</note>
and arms were furnished them at public expense. And they were called, not <hi rend="italic">capite censi,</hi> but by a more auspicious name derived from their duty and function of producing offspring, for although they could not greatly aid the State with what small property they had, yet they added to the population of their country by their power of begetting children. Gaius Marius is said to have been the first, according to some in the war with the Cimbri in a most critical period for our country, or more probably, as Sallust says, in the Jugurthine war, to have enrolled soldiers from the <hi rend="italic">capite censi,</hi> since such an act was unheard of before that time. <hi rend="italic">Adsidaus</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Twelve Tables</hi>

<note>i. 4, 10.</note>
is used of one who is rich and well to do,

<note><hi rend="italic">locuples</hi> seems to be derived from <hi rend="italic">locus,</hi> in the sense of <quote>land,</quote> and the root <hi rend="italic">ple-</hi> of <hi rend="italic">pleo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">plenus.</hi></note>
either because he contributed 'asses' (that is, money) when the exigencies of the State required it, or from his 'assiduity' in making contributions according to the amount of his property."

<note>Both these derivations are fanciful; <hi rend="italic">adsiduus</hi> is connected with <hi rend="italic">adsideo,</hi> as the grammarian Caper knew (<hi rend="italic">Gram. Lat.</hi> vii. 108. 5, Keil), and means <quote>a permanent settler.</quote></note>
</p>

<p>Now the words of Sallust in the <hi rend="italic">Iugurthine War</hi> about Gaius Marius and the <hi rend="italic">capite censi</hi> are these:

<note><hi rend="italic">Jug.</hi> lxxxvi. 2.</note>
<quote>He himself in the meantime enrolled soldiers, not according to the classes, or in the manner of our forefathers, but allowing anyone to volunteer, for the most part the lowest class (<hi rend="italic">capite censos</hi>). Some say that he did this through lack of good men,  <pb n="v3.p.173"/>  others because of a desire to curry favour, since that class had given him honour and rank, and as a matter of fact, to one who aspires to power the poorest man is the most helpful.</quote></p>  </div>

<p>THE race of the Marsians in Italy is said to have sprung from the son of Circe.

<p>We see certain persons called <hi rend="italic">Psylli</hi> endowed with this same power. And when I had sought in ancient records for information about their name and race, I found at last in the fourth book of Herodotus

<note>iv. 173.</note>
this story about them: that the Psylli had once been neighbours in the land of Africa of the Nasamones, and that the South Wind at a certain season in their territories blew very long and hard; that because of that gale all the water in the regions which they inhabited dried up; that the Psylli, deprived of their water supply, were grievously incensed at the South Wind because of that injury and voted to take up arms and march against the South Wind as against an enemy, and demand restitution according to the laws of war. And when they had thus set out, the South Wind  <pb n="v3.p.175"/>  came to meet them with a great blast of air, and piling upon them mountainous heaps of sand, buried them all with their entire forces and arms.

<p><hi rend="italic">MUNICIPES</hi> and <hi rend="italic">municipia</hi> are words which are readily spoken and in common use, and you would never find a man who uses them who does not think that he understands perfectly what he is saying. But in fact it is something different, and the meaning is different. For how rarely is one of us found who, coming from a colony of the Roman people, does not say what is far removed from reason and from truth,  <pb n="v3.p.179"/>  namely, that he is <hi rend="italic">municeps</hi> and that his fellow citizens are <hi rend="italic">municipes?</hi> So general is the ignorance of what <hi rend="italic">municipia</hi> are and what rights they have, and how far they differ from a <quote>colony,</quote> as well as the belief that <hi rend="italic">coloniae</hi> are better off than <hi rend="italic">municipia.</hi> With regard to the errors in this opinion which is so general the deified Hadrian, in the speech which he delivered in the senate <hi rend="italic">In Behalf of the Italicenses,</hi>

<note><hi rend="italic">O.R.F.</hi><hi rend="sup">2</hi> p. 608. Italics was a city of Spain on the river Baetis, opposite Hispalis (Seville). It was founded by Scipio Africanus the Elder and peopled by his veterans; whence the name <quote>the Italian city.</quote> It was the birthplace of Trajan and Hadrian.</note>
from whom he himself came, discoursed most learnedly, showing his surprise that the Italicenses themselves and also some other ancient <hi rend="italic">municipia,</hi> among whom he names the citizens of Utica, when they might enjoy their own customs and laws, desired instead to have the rights of colonies. Moreover, he asserts that the citizens of Praeneste earnestly begged and prayed the emperor Tiberius that they might be changed from a colony into the condition of a <hi rend="italic">municipium,</hi> and that Tiberius granted their request by way of conferring a favour, because in their territory, and near their town itself, he had recovered from a dangerous illness.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Municipes,</hi> then, are Roman citizens from free towns, using their own laws and enjoying their own rights, merely sharing with the Roman people an honorary <hi rend="italic">munus,</hi> or <quote>privilege</quote>

<note>Such as serving in the legions and not among the auxiliaries.</note>
(from the enjoyment of which privilege they appear to derive their name), and bound by no other compulsion and no other law of the Roman people, except such as their own citizens have officially ratified.

<note><hi rend="italic">For fundus</hi> cf. xix. 8. 12.</note>
We learn besides that the people of Caere were the first <hi rend="italic">municipes</hi> without the right of suffrage, and that it was allowed them to assume the honour of Roman citizenship, but yet to be free from service and burdens, in return for receiving and guarding sacred  <pb n="v3.p.181"/>  objects during the war with the Gauls. Hence by contraries those tablets were called <hi rend="italic">Caerites</hi> on which the censors ordered those to be enrolled whom they deprived of their votes by way of disgrace.</p>

<p>But the relationship of the <quote>colonies</quote> is a different one; for they do not come into citizenship from without, nor grow from roots of their own, but they are as it were transplanted from the State and have all the laws and institutions of the Roman people, not those of their own choice. This condition, although it is more exposed to control and less free, is nevertheless thought preferable and superior because of the greatness and majesty of the Roman people, of which those colonies seem to be miniatures, as it were, and in a way copies;

<note>Their government was modelled on that of Rome, with a senate (<hi rend="italic">decuriones</hi>), two chief magistrates (<hi rend="italic">Ilviri iure dicundo</hi>), elected annually, etc.</note>
and at the same time because the rights of the municipal towns become obscure and invalid, and from ignorance of their existence the townsmen are no longer able to make use of them.</p>  </div>

<p><hi rend="italic">FESTINARE</hi> and <hi rend="italic">properare</hi> seem to indicate the same thing and to be used of the same thing.

<pb n="v3.p.183"/>  <quote>It is one thing to hasten (<hi rend="italic">properare</hi>), another to hurry (<hi rend="italic">festinare</hi>).

<note>p. xv, Müller.</note>
<quote><hi rend="italic">Festinat</hi> is derived from <hi rend="italic">for</hi> (to speak), since those idle folk who can accomplish nothing talk more than they act.</quote> But that seems too forced and absurd, nor can the first letter of the two words be of such weight that because of it such different words as <hi rend="italic">festino</hi> and <hi rend="italic">for</hi> should appear to be the same. But it seems more fitting and closer to explain <hi rend="italic">festinare</hi> as equivalent to <hi rend="italic">fessum esse</hi> or <quote>be wearied.</quote> For one who tires himself out by hastily attacking many things at once no longer hastens, but hurries.

<p>Some interesting and instructive remarks about that part of Geometry which is called <quote>Optics</quote>; of another part called <quote>Harmony,</quote> and also of a third called <quote>Metric.</quote></p><!--</argument>-->

<p>A PART of Geometry which relates to the sight is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">o)ptikh/</foreign> or <quote>Optics,</quote> another part, relating to the ears, is known as <foreign xml:lang="grc">kanonikh/</foreign> or <quote>Harmony,</quote> which musicians make use of as the foundation of their art. These are concerned respectively with the spaces and the intervals between lines and with the theory of musical numbers.</p>

<p>Optics effect many surprising things, such as the appearance in one mirror of several images of the same thing; also that a mirror placed in a certain position shows no image, but when moved to another spot gives reflections; also that if you look straight into a mirror, your reflection is such that your head  <pb n="v3.p.189"/>  appears below and your feet uppermost.

<note>The first effect is produced when the surface of a mirror is divided into numerous smaller mirrors. Pliny, <hi rend="italic">N. H.</hi> xxxiii. 129, describes cups, the interior of which was so fashioned as to give numerous reflections. The second is described (<hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi>) in Pausanias viii. 37. 7. The third is produced when one looks into a concave mirror from a certain distance. Magic mirrors of various kinds and properties were known in antiquity, as well as divination by means of mirrors. See <hi rend="italic">Trans. Numais. and Ant. Soc. of Phila.,</hi> 1910, pp. 187 ff.</note>
This science also gives the reasons for optical illusions, such as the magnifying of objects seen in the water, and the small size of those that are remote from the eye.</p>

<p>Harmony, on the other hand, measures the length and pitch of sounds. The measure of the length of a tone is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">r(uqmo/s,</foreign> or rhythm of its pitch, <foreign xml:lang="grc">me/los,</foreign> or <quote>melody.</quote> There is also another variety of Harmony which is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">metrikh/,</foreign> or <quote>Metric,</quote> by which the combination of long and short syllables, and those which are neither long nor short, and the verse measure according to the principles of geometry are examined with the aid of the ears. <quote>But these things,</quote> says Marcus Varro,

<note>p. 337, Bipont.</note>
<quote>we either do not learn at all, or we leave off before we know why they ought to be learned. But the pleasure,</quote> he says, <quote>and the advantage of such sciences appear in their later study, when they have been completely mastered; but in their mere elements they seem foolish and unattractive.</quote>

<p>A story about the lyre-player Arion, taken from the work of Herodotus.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>HERODOTUS has written

<note>i. 23.</note>
of the famous lyre-player Arion in terse and vigorous language and in simple and elegant style. <quote>Arion,</quote> says he, <quote>in days of old was a celebrated player upon the lyre. The  <pb n="v3.p.191"/>  town in which he was born was Methyma, but from the name of his country and the island as a whole he was a Lesbian. This Arion for the sake of his art was held in friendship and affection by Periander, king of Corinth.

<note>625–585 B.C.</note>
Later, he left the king, to visit the famous lands of Sicily and Italy. On his arrival there he charmed the ears and minds of all in the cities of both countries, and there he was enriched as well as being generally admired and beloved. Then later, laden with money and with wealth of all kinds, he determined to return to Corinth, choosing a Corinthian vessel and crew, as better known to him and more friendly.</quote> But Herodotus says that those Corinthians, having received Arion on board and put to sea, formed the plan of murdering him for the sake of his money. Then he, realizing that death was at hand, gave them possession of his money and other goods, but begged that they should at least spare his life. The sailors were moved by his prayers only so far as to refrain from putting him to death with their own hands, but they bade him at once, before their eyes, leap headlong into the sea. <quote>Then,</quote> says Herodotus, <quote>the poor man, in terror and utterly hopeless of life, finally made the one request that before meeting his end he might be allowed to put on all his costume, take his lyre, and sing a song in consolation of his fate. The sailors, though savage and cruel, nevertheless had a desire to hear him; his request was granted. Then afterwards, crowned in the usual way, robed and adorned, he stood upon the extreme stern and lifting up his voice on high sang the song called 'orthian.'

<note>This was a song in such a high key that it could be reached by few voices. In Aristophanes, <hi rend="italic">Knights,</hi> 1279 (<hi rend="italic">L.C.L.</hi> i, p. 247) the <foreign xml:lang="grc">o)/rqios no/mos</foreign> is played by a <quote>prince of harpers.</quote></note>
Finally, having finished his song, with his lyre and all his equipment, just as he stood and sang, he  <pb n="v3.p.193"/>  threw himself far out into the deep. The sailors, not doubting in the least that he had perished, held on the course which they had begun. But an unheard of, strange and miraculous thing happened.</quote> Herodotus asserts that a dolphin suddenly swam up amid the waves, dove under the floating man, and lifting his back above the flood, carried him and landed him at Taenarum in the Laconian land, with his person and adornment uninjured. Then Arion went from there straight to Corinth and, just as he was when the dolphin carried him, presented himself unexpectedly to king Periander and told him exactly what had occurred. The king did not believe the story but ordered that Arion be imprisoned as an impostor. He hunted up the sailors, and in the absence of Arion craftily questioned them, asking whether they had heard anything of Arion in the places from which they had come. They replied that the man had been in the land of Italy when they left it, that he was doing well there, enjoying the devotion and the pleasures of the cities, and that both in prestige and in money he was rich and fortunate. Then, in the midst of their story, Arion suddenly appeared with his lyre, clad in the garments in which he had thrown himself into the sea; the sailors were amazed and proved guilty, and could not deny their crime. This story is told by the Lesbians and the Corinthians, and in testimony to its truth two brazen images are to be seen near Taenarum, the dolphin carrying the man, who is seated on his back.</p>

<p>That Asinius Gallus and Largius Licinus criticized a saying of Cicero's in the speech which he delivered <hi rend="italic">For Marcus Caelius;</hi> and what may be said with truth and propriety in defence of that saying, in reply to those most foolish critics.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>JUST as there have been monsters of men who expressed impious and false opinions about the immortal gods, so there have been some so extravagant and so ignorant that they have dared to say that Marcus Cicero spoke without correctness, propriety, or consideration; among these are Asinius Gallus and Largius Licinus, and the latter's book even bears the outrageous title of <hi rend="italic">The Scourge of Cicero.</hi> Now the other things that they have censured are certainly not worth hearing or mentioning; but let us consider the value of this stricture of theirs, in which particularly they are, in their own opinion, very keen critics of language.</p>

<p>Marcus Cicero in his speech <hi rend="italic">For Marcus Caelius</hi>

<note><hi rend="italic">§6.</hi></note>
writes as follows: <quote>As to the charge made against his chastity and published by all his accusers, not in the form of actual charges, but of gossip and calumnies, Marcus Caelius will never take that so much to heart, as to repent that he was not born ugly.</quote> They think that Cicero has not used the proper word in saying <hi rend="italic">paeniteat,</hi> or <quote>repent,</quote> and they go so far as to add that it is almost absurd; <quote>for,</quote> they say,  <pb n="v3.p.199"/>  <quote>we regularly use <hi rend="italic">paenitere</hi> when things which we ourselves have done, or which have been done in accordance with our wish and design, later begin to displease us and we change our opinion about them.</quote> But that no one correctly says that he <quote>repents being born</quote> or <quote>repents being mortal,</quote> or <quote>because he feels pain from any chance injury or wound inflicted upon his body</quote>; for in such cases there is no design or choice on our part, but such things happen to us against our will by some necessity or force of nature. <quote>In the same way,</quote> they continue, <quote>it was not a matter of choice with Marcus Caelius with what person he was born; yet he says that ' he did not repent this,' as if there were in that circumstance ground for a feeling of repentance.</quote></p>

<p>This is in fact, as they say, the force of that word, and <hi rend="italic">paenitere</hi> is strictly used of none but voluntary acts, although our forefathers used that same word also in a different sense and connected <hi rend="italic">paenitere</hi> with the words <hi rend="italic">paene</hi> (almost) and <hi rend="italic">paenuria</hi> (want). But that is another question, and will be spoken of in another place.

<note>This promise is not fulfilled.</note>
But with regard to the point at issue, giving to <hi rend="italic">paenitere</hi> this same meaning which is commonly recognized, what Marcus Cicero said is not only not foolish, but in the highest degree elegant and witty. For since the adversaries and detractors of Marcus Caelius, inasmuch as he was of handsome person, made use of his appearance and figure to throw doubt upon his chastity, therefore Cicero, making sport of such an absurd charge as to impute to him as a fault the good looks which nature had given him, has deliberately adopted that very same false charge of which he is making fun, saying: <quote>Marcus Caelius is not sorry  <pb n="v3.p.201"/>  for not having been born ugly</quote>; so that by the very fact of speaking thus he might reproach his accusers and wittily show that they were doing an absurd thing in making Caelius' handsome person an accusation against him, just as if the person with which he was born depended upon his own volition.</p>  </div>

<p>WHENEVER I read the book of an early writer, I tried afterwards, for the purpose of quickening my memory, to recall and review any passages in the book which were worthy of note, in the way either of praise or censure; and I found it an exceedingly helpful exercise for ensuring my recollection of elegant words and phrases, whenever need of them should arise. For example, in the first book of the <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi> of Quintus Claudius, which I had read on the preceding two days, I noted these passages: <quote>The greater number,</quote> says he,

<quote>go to his own house and enjoy his possessions.</quote> <hi rend="italic">Frunisci,</hi> meaning <quote>enjoy,</quote> was somewhat rare in the days of Marcus Tullius and became still rarer after that time, and its Latinity was questioned by those who were unacquainted with our early literature. However, <hi rend="italic">fruniscor</hi> is not only good Latin, but it is more elegant and pleasing than <hi rend="italic">fruor,</hi> from which it is formed in the same way as <hi rend="italic">fatiscor</hi> from <hi rend="italic">fateor.</hi> Quintus Metellus Numidicus, who is known to have used the Latin tongue with purity and simplicity, in the letter which he sent when in exile <hi rend="italic">To the Domitii,</hi> wrote as follows: <quote>They indeed were cut off from every right and honour, I lack neither water nor fire and I enjoy (<hi rend="italic">fruiscor</hi>) the greatest glory.</quote> Novius, in his Atellan farce entitled <hi rend="italic">The Miser,</hi> uses this word:

<quote>get possession of (<hi rend="italic">copiantur</hi>) many arms and a great supply of provisions, and enormous booty.</quote> <hi rend="italic">Copiantur</hi> is a soldier's word, and you will not readily find it in the pleaders of civil suits; it is formed in the same way as <hi rend="italic">lignantur,</hi> or <quote>gather wood,</quote> <hi rend="italic">pabulantur,</hi> or <quote>forage,</quote> and <hi rend="italic">aquantur,</hi> or <quote>get water.</quote></p>

<p>Quadrigarius uses <hi rend="italic">sole occaso</hi> for <quote>at sunset.</quote>

<note><hi rend="italic">Id.</hi> 3.</note>
This expression has a flavour of antiquity which is not without charm, if one possesses an ear that is not dull and commonplace; furthermore the phrase occurs in the <hi rend="italic">Twelve Tables</hi> in the following passage:

<note>The phrase <hi rend="italic">in medium</hi> has various meanings, according to the context and the verb with which it is used; cf.

they consider that also a solecism; but if anyone examines these words with some care, that expression will seem to him the more correct and the more expressive; moreover in Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">qei=nai ei)s me/son,</foreign> is not an error. "After it was announced," he says,

<p>The words of Marcus Varro in the twenty fifth book of his <hi rend="italic">Humran Antiquities,</hi> in which he has interpreted a line of Homer contrary to the general opinion.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>IT happened in the course of conversations which we carried on about the dates of various inventions for human use, that a young man not without learning observed that the use of <hi rend="italic">spartum</hi> or <quote>Spanish broom</quote> also was for a long time unknown in the land of Greece and that it was imported from Spain many years after the taking of Ilium. One or two half-educated fellows who were present there, of the class that the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)gorai=oi,</foreign> or <quote>haunters of the market-place,</quote> laughed in derision of this statement, and declared that the man who had made it had read a copy of Homer which happened to lack the following verse:

</p>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>And rotted the ship's timbers, loosed the ropes (<foreign xml:lang="grc">spa/rta</foreign>).</l></quote>

<p>Then the youth, in great vexation, replied: <quote>It was not my book that lacked that line, but you who badly lacked a teacher, if you believe that <foreign xml:lang="grc">spa/rta</foreign> in that verse means what we call <hi rend="italic">spartum,</hi> or 'a  <pb n="v3.p.213"/>  rope of Spanish broom'</quote> They only laughed the louder, and would have continued to do so, had he not produced the twenty-fifth book of Varro's <hi rend="italic">Human Antiquities,</hi> in which Varro writes as follows of that Homeric word:

<note>Frag. 4, Mirsch.</note>
<quote>I believe that <foreign xml:lang="grc">spa/rta</foreign> in Homer does not mean <hi rend="italic">sparta,</hi> or 'Spanish broom,' but rather <foreign xml:lang="grc">spa/rtoi,</foreign> a kind of broom which is said to grow in the Theban territory. In Greece there has only recently been a supply of <hi rend="italic">spartum,</hi> imported from Spain. The Liburnians did not make use of that material either, but as a rule fastened their ships together with thongs,

<note>See <hi rend="italic">sutiles naves,</hi> Plin. <hi rend="italic">N. H.</hi> xxiv. 65.</note>
while the Greeks made more use of hemp, tow, and other cultivated plants (<hi rend="italic">sativis</hi>), from which ropes got their name of <hi rend="italic">sparta.</hi></quote> Since Varro says this, I have grave doubts whether the last syllable in the Homeric word ought not to have an acute accent; unless it be because words of this kind, when they pass from their general meaning to the designation of a particular thing, are distinguished by a difference in accent.</p>  </div>

<p>What the poet Menander said to Philemon, by whom he was often undeservedly defeated in contests in comedy; and that Euripides was very often vanquished in tragedy by obscure poets.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>IN contests in comedy Menander was often defeated by Philemon, a writer by no means his equal, owing to intrigue, favour, and partisanship.

that Euripides also, although he wrote seventy-five tragedies, was victor with only five,

<!--<argument>-->

<p>That it is by no mears true, as some meticulous artists in rhetoric affirm, that Marcus Cicero, in his book <hi rend="italic">On Friendship,</hi> made use of a faulty argument and postulated <quote>the disputed for the admitted</quote>; with a careful discussion and examination of this whole question.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>MARCUS CICERO, in the dialogue entitled <hi rend="italic">Laelius,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">On Friendship,</hi> wishes to teach us that friendship ought not to be cultivated in the hope and expectation of advantage, profit, or gain, but that it should be sought and cherished because in itself it is rich in virtue and honour, even though no aid and no advantage can be gained from it. This thought he has expressed in the following words, put into the mouth of Gaius Laelius, a wise man and a very  <pb n="v3.p.217"/>  dear friend of Publius Africanus

<note>§30.</note>
<quote>well, then, does Africanus need my help? No more do I need his. But I love him because of a certain admiration for his virtues; he in turn has affection for me perhaps because of some opinion which he has formed of my character; and intimacy has increased our attachment. But although many great advantages have resulted, yet the motives for our friendship did not arise from the hope of those advantages. For just as we are kindly and generous, not in order to compel a return—for we do not put favours out at interest, but we are naturally inclined to generosity —just so we think that friendship is to be desired, not because we are led by hope of gain, but because all its fruit is in the affection itself.</quote></p>

<p>When it chanced that these words were read in a company of cultured men, a sophistical rhetorician, skilled in both tongues, a man of some note among those clever and meticulous teachers known as <foreign xml:lang="grc">texnikoi,/</foreign> or <quote>connoisseurs,</quote> who was at the same time not without ability in disputation, expressed the opinion that Marcus Tullius had used an argument which was neither sound nor clear, but one which was of the same uncertainty as the question at issue itself; and he described that fault by Greek words, saying that Cicero had postulated <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)ufisbhtou/menon a)nti\ o(mologoume/nou,</foreign> that is, <quote>what was disputed rather than what was admitted.</quote></p>

<p><quote>For,</quote> said he, <quote>he took <hi rend="italic">benefci,</hi> 'the kindly,' and <hi rend="italic">liberales,</hi> 'the generous,' to confirm what he said about friendship, although that very question is commonly asked and ought to be asked, with what thought and purpose one who acts liberally and kindly is kind and generous. Whether it is  <pb n="v3.p.219"/>  because he hopes for a return of the favour, and tries to arouse in the one to whom he is kind a like feeling towards himself, as almost all seem to do; or because he is by nature kindly, and kindness and generosity gratify him for their own sakes without any thought of a return of the favour, which is as a rule the rarest of all.</quote> Furthermore, he thought that arguments ought to be either convincing, or clear and not open to controversy, and he said that the term <hi rend="italic">apodixis,</hi>

<note>That is, <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)po/deicis.</foreign></note>
or <quote>demonstration,</quote> was properly used only when things that are doubtful or obscure are made plain through things about which there is no doubt. And in order that he might show that the kind and generous ought not to be taken as an argument or example for the question about friendship, he said: <quote>By the same comparison and the same appearance of reason, friendship in its turn may be taken as an argument, if one should declare that men ought to be kindly and generous, not from the hope of a return, but from the desire and love of honourable conduct. For he will be able to argue in a very similar manner as follows: ' Now just as we do not embrace friendship through hope of advantage, so we ought not to be generous and kindly with the desire of having the favour returned.' He will indeed,</quote> said he, <quote>be able to say this, but friendship cannot furnish an argument for generosity, nor generosity for friendship, since in the case of each there is equally an open question.</quote></p>

<p>It seemed to some that this artist in rhetoric argued cleverly and learnedly, but that as a matter of fact he was ignorant of the true meaning of terms. For Cicero calls a man <quote>kind and generous</quote> in the  <pb n="v3.p.221"/>  sense that the philosophers believe those words ought to be used: not of one who, as Cicero himself expresses it, puts favours out at interest, but of one who shows kindness without having any secret reason which redounds to his own advantage. Therefore he has used an argument which is not obscure or doubtful, but trustworthy and clear, since if anyone is truly kind and generous, it is not asked with what motive he acts kindly or generously. For he must be called by very different names if, when he does such things, he does them for his own advantage rather than for that of another. Possibly the criticism made by this sophist might have some justification, if Cicero had said:

<note>As quoted in § 2.</note>
<quote>For as we do some kind and generous action, not in order to compel a return.</quote> For it might seem that anyone who was not kindly might happen to do a kind action, if it was done because of some accidental circumstance and not through a fixed habit of constant kindliness. But since Cicero spoke of <quote>kindly and generous people,</quote> and meant no other sort than that which we have mentioned before, it is <quote>with unwashed feet,</quote>

<note>Cf. i. 9. 8 (vol. i, p. 49) with the note, and Plautus, <hi rend="italic">Poen.</hi> 316, <hi rend="italic">illotis manibus.</hi> The reference is to washing before handling sacred objects or performing religious rites. <hi rend="italic">Et verbis</hi> is an addition by Gellius, in the sense of <quote>hasty, inconsiderate language.</quote></note>
as the proverb says, and unwashed words that our critic assails the argument of that most learned man.</p>  <pb n="v3.p.223"/>  </div>

<p>That what Verrius Flaccus wrote about <hi rend="italic">servus recepticius,</hi> in his second book <hi rend="italic">On the Obscurities of Marcus Cato,</hi> is false.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>MARCUS CATO, when recommending the Voconian law,

<note>His recommendation of this law is also mentioned by Cicero, <hi rend="italic">Cato Mai.</hi> 14, who discusses some features of the law in <hi rend="italic">Verr.</hi> ii. 1. 101 ff.; see also xx. 1. 23, below. The law, which in general had to do with inheritances, has been the subject of much discussion; one of its provisions was that no one should make a woman his heir.</note>
spoke as follows:

<note>p. 54, 5, Jordan.</note>
<quote>In the beginning the woman brought you a great dowry; then she holds back a large sum of money, which she does not entrust to the control of her husband, but lends it to her husband. Later, becoming angry with him, she orders a <hi rend="italic">servus recepticius,</hi> or ' slave of her own,' to hound him and demand the money.</quote></p>

<p>The question was asked what was meant by <hi rend="italic">servus recepticius.</hi> At once the books of Verrius Flaccus <hi rend="italic">On the Obscurities of Cato</hi> were asked for and produced. In the second book was found the statement

<note>p. xvi, Müller.</note>
that <hi rend="italic">servus recepticius</hi> was the name applied to a slave that was worthless and of no value, who, after being sold, was returned because of some fault and taken back. <quote>Therefore,</quote> says Flaccus, "a slave of that kind was bidden to hound her husband and demand the money, in order that the man's vexation might be greater, and the insult put upon him still more bitter, for the very reason that a worthless slave dunned him for the payment of money."</p>

<p>But with the indulgence and pardon of those, if such there be, who are influenced by the authority of Verrius Flaccus, this must be said. That <hi rend="italic">recepticius servus</hi> in the case of which Cato is speaking is something very different from what Verrius wrote. And this is easy for anyone to understand; for the situation is undoubtedly this: when the woman  <pb n="v3.p.225"/>  gave the dowry to her husband, what she retained of her property and did not give over to her husband she was said to <quote>hold back</quote> (<hi rend="italic">recipere</hi>), just as now also at sales those things are said to be <quote>held back</quote> which are set aside and not sold. This word Plautus also used in the <hi rend="italic">Trinumnus</hi> in this line:

<note>v. 194.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>But when he sold the house, this little place</l> <l>Behind it he held back (<hi rend="italic">recepit</hi>).</l></quote>  That is, when he sold the house, he did not sell a small part which was behind the house, but held it back. Cato himself too, wishing to describe the woman as rich, says: <quote>The woman brings a great dowry and holds back a large sum of money</quote>; that is, she gives a great dowry and retains possession of a large sum of money. From that property then which she kept for herself after giving her dowry, she lent money to her husband. When she happened to be vexed with her husband and determined to demand the money back, she appoints to demand it from him a <hi rend="italic">seruves recepticius,</hi> that is, a slave of her very own, whom she had held back with the rest of the money and had not given as part of her dowry, but had retained; for it was not right for the woman to give such an order to a slave of her husband, but only to one of her very own.</p>

<p>I forbear to say more in defence of this view of mine; for the opinion of Verrius and mine are before you, each by itself; anyone therefore may adopt whichever of the two seems to him the truer.</p>  <pb n="v3.p.227"/>  </div>

<p>These words from the Atinian law, <quote>the claim on whatever shall be stolen shall be everlasting,</quote> seemed to Publius Nigidius and Quintus Scaevola to have reference not less to a past theft than to a future one.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>THE words of the ancient Atinian law

<note>Different from the plebiscitum of xiv. 8. 2. The date is uncertain.</note>
are as follows:

<note><hi rend="italic">Fontes Iur. Rom., p.</hi> 45, 6.</note>
<quote>Whatever shall have been stolen, let the right to claim the thing be everlasting.</quote> Who would suppose that in these words the law referred to anything else than to future time? But Quintus Scaevola says

<note>Fr. 3, Huschke; <hi rend="italic">Iur. Civ.</hi> xvi. 5, Bremer.</note>
that his father

<note><hi rend="italic">Resp.</hi> 4, Bremer.</note>
and Brutus

<note><hi rend="italic">Resp.</hi> 5, Bremer.</note>
and Manilius,

<note><hi rend="italic">Resp.</hi> 5, Bremer.</note>
exceedingly learned men, inquired and were in doubt whether the law was valid in cases of future theft only or also in those already committed in the past; since <hi rend="italic">subruptum erit</hi> seems to indicate both times, past as well as future.</p>

<p>Therefore Publius Nigidius, the most learned man of the Roman State, discussed this uncertainty of theirs in the twenty-third book of his <hi rend="italic">Grammatical Notes.</hi>

<note>Fr. 34, Swoboda.</note>
And he himself too has the same opinion, that the indication of the time is indefinite, but he speaks very concisely and obscurely, so that you may see that he is rather making notes to aid his own memory than trying to instruct his readers.

<note>Cf. xvi. 8. 3.</note>
However, his meaning seems to be that <hi rend="italic">est</hi> and <hi rend="italic">erit</hi> are independent words; when they are used alone, they have and retain their own tense, but when they are joined with a past participle, they lose the force of their own tense, and are transferred to the past. For when I say <hi rend="italic">in campo est,</hi> or <quote>he is in the field,</quote> and <hi rend="italic">in comitio est,</hi> or <quote>he is in the comitium,</quote> I refer to the present time; also when I  <pb n="v3.p.229"/>  say <hi rend="italic">in campo erit</hi> (he will be in the field), or <hi rend="italic">in comitio erit</hi> (he will be in the comitium), I indicate future time: but when I say <hi rend="italic">factum est, scriptum est</hi> or <hi rend="italic">subruptum est,</hi> although the verb <hi rend="italic">est</hi> is in the present tense, it is nevertheless united with the past and ceases to be present.</p>

<p><quote>Similarly then,</quote> he says, <quote>with regard also to the wording of the law; if you divide and separate these two words <hi rend="italic">subruptum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">erit,</hi> so that you understand <hi rend="italic">subruptum erit</hi> as you would <hi rend="italic">certamen erit,</hi> that is, 'there will be a contest,' or <hi rend="italic">sacrificium erit</hi> (there will be a sacrifice), then the law will seem to have reference to an act completed in future time; but if you understand the two words to be united and mingled, so that <hi rend="italic">subruptum erit</hi> is not two words, but one, and is a single form of the passive inflection, then that word indicates past time no less than future.</quote></p>  </div>

<!--<argument>-->

<p>In conversation at the table of the philosopher Taurus questions of this kind were proposed and discussed: <quote>why oil congeals often and readily, wine seldom, vinegar hardly ever,</quote> and <quote>that the waters of rivers and springs freeze, while the sea does not.</quote></p><!--</argument>-->

<p>THE philosopher Taurus at Athens usually entertained us at dinner at the time of day when evening had already come on; for there that is the time for dining.

<note>In Rome the dinner-hour was considerably earlier, usually the ninth hour, or about three o'clock in the afternoon; see Hor. <hi rend="italic">Epist. 1.</hi> 7. 71; Mart. iv. 8. 6. To-day, too, the dinner-hour is later in Athens than in Rome, although the difference is not so great as in ancient times.</note>
The entire basis and foundation of the meal usually consisted of one pot of Egyptian beans, to which were added gourds cut in small pieces.</p>  <pb n="v3.p.231"/>

<p>One day when this dish had been brought and placed upon the table, and we were ready and awaiting the meal, Taurus ordered a slave-boy to pour some oil into the pot. The slave was a boy of Attic birth, at most eight years old, overflowing with the merry wit characteristic of his race and his time of life. He brought an empty Samian flask, from oversight, as he said, supposing there was oil in it, turned it up and, as he usually did, passed it with his hand over all parts of the pot; but no oil came out. The boy, in anger, looked savagely at the flask, shook it violently, and again turned it over the pot; and when we were all quietly and furtively laughing at his actions, he said in Greek, and excellent Attic Greek at that: <quote>Don't laugh; there's oil in it; but don't you know how cold it was this morning; it's congealed.</quote> <quote>You rascal,</quote> said Taurus with a laugh, <quote>run and fetch some oil.</quote></p>

<p>But when the boy had gone out to buy oil, Taurus, not at all put out by the delay, said: <quote>The pot needs oil, and, as I see, is intolerably hot; let us withhold our hands and meanwhile, since the slave has just told us that oil is in the habit of congealing, let us consider why oil congeals often and readily, but wine rarely.</quote> And he looked at me and bade me give my opinion. Then I replied that I inferred that wine congealed less quickly because it had in it certain seeds of heat and was naturally more fiery, and that was why Homer called

<note><hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> i. 462, etc.</note>
it <foreign xml:lang="grc">ai)/qoy,</foreign>

<note>In Homer this word, from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ai)qo/s,</foreign> <quote>fire</quote> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">o)/y,</foreign> <quote>eye,</quote> means <quote>fiery-looking</quote> or <quote>sparkling,</quote> rather than <quote>fiery.</quote> Gellius seems to be wrong so far as Homer is concerned, although some other writers used <foreign xml:lang="grc">ai)/qoy</foreign> in the sense of <quote>fiery,</quote> as applied to persons.</note>
and not, as some supposed, on account of its colour.</p>  <pb n="v3.p.233"/>

<p><quote>It is indeed,</quote> says Taurus, <quote>as you say. For it is well known that wine, when we drink it, warms the body. But oil is equally calorific and has no less power of warming the body. Besides, if those things which are warmer are frozen with greater difficulty, it follows that those which are colder freeze more readily. But vinegar is the most cooling of all things and yet it never freezes. Is the reason then for the quicker freezing of oil to be found in its lightness? For those things seem to congeal more readily which are lighter and smoother.</quote></p>

<p>Taurus says besides that it is also worth inquiring why the waters of rivers and streams freeze, while all the sea is incapable of freezing. <quote>Although Herodotus,</quote> said he, <quote>the writer of history, contrary to the opinion of almost all who have investigated these matters, writes

<note>iv. 28 (ii., p. 226, <hi rend="italic">L.C.L.</hi>).</note>
that the Bosphoric sea, which is called Cimmerian,

<note>The Cimmerian Bosphorus, the present Strait of Yenikale, connecting the Palus Maeotis (Sea of Azov) with the Pontus Euxinus or Black Sea.</note>

<p>Of the cypher letters which are found in the epistles of Gains Caesar, and of other secret forms of writing taken from ancient history; and what the Laconian <foreign xml:lang="grc">skuta/lh</foreign> is.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>THERE are volumes of letters of Gaius Caesar addressed to Gaius Oppius and Cornelius Balbus,  <pb n="v3.p.235"/>  who had charge of his affairs in his absence. In certain parts of these letters

<note>ii. p. 137, Dinter.</note>
there are found individual characters which are not connected to form syllables, but apparently are written at random; for no word can be formed from those letters. But a secret agreement had been made between the correspondents about a change in the position of the letters, so that, in writing, one name and position was given to one letter and another to another, but in reading its own place and force was restored to each of them.

<note>See Suet. <hi rend="italic">Jul.</hi> lvi. 6, who says that Caesar wrote <hi rend="italic">d</hi> for a, and so on with the other letters.</note>
But which letter was written for which was, as I have already said, agreed upon by those who devised this secret code. There is in fact a commentary of the grammarian Probus, <hi rend="italic">On the Secret meaning of the Letters appearing in the Epistles of Gains Caesar,</hi> which is a very careful piece of work.</p>

<p>But the ancient Lacedaemonians, when they wanted to conceal and disguise the public dispatches sent to their generals, in order that, in case they were intercepted by the enemy, their plans might not be known, used to send letters written in the following manner. There were two thin, cylindrical wands of the same thickness and length, smoothed and prepared so as to be exactly alike. One of these was given to the general when he went to war, the other the magistrates kept at home under their control and seal. When the need of more secret communication arose, they bound about the staff a thong of moderate thickness, but long enough for the purpose, in a simple spiral, in such a way that the edges of the thong which was twined around the stick met and were joined throughout. Then they wrote the dispatch on that thong across  <pb n="v3.p.237"/>  the connected edges of the joints, with the lines running from the top to the bottom. When the letter had been written in this way, the thong was unrolled from the wand and sent to the general, who was familiar with the device. But the unrolling of the thong made the letters imperfect and broken, and their parts and strokes

<note>See note on xiii. 31. 10, and <hi rend="italic">A.J.P.</hi> xlviii, No. 1.</note>
were divided and separated. Therefore, if the thong fell into the hands of the enemy, nothing at all could be made out from the writing; but when the one to whom the letter was sent had received it, he wound it around the corresponding staff, which he had, from the top to the bottom, just as he knew that it ought to be done, and thus the letters, united by encircling a similar staff, came together again, rendering the dispatch entire and undamaged, and easy to read. This kind of letter the Lacedaemonians called <foreign xml:lang="grc">skuta/lh.</foreign> I also read this in an ancient history of Carthage, that a certain famous man of that country —whether it was Hasdrubal or another I do not recall—disguised a letter written about secret matters in the following way: he took new tablets, not yet provided with wax, and cut the letters into the wood. Afterwards he covered the tablet with wax in the usual way and sent it, apparently without writing, to one to whom he had previously told his plan. The recipient then scraped off the wax, found the letters safe and sound inscribed upon the wood, and read them.</p>

<p>There is also in the records of Grecian history another profound and difficult method of concealment, devised by a barbarian's cunning. He was called Histiaeus and was born in the land of Asia in no mean station. At that time king Darius held  <pb n="v3.p.239"/>  sway in Asia. This Histiaeus, being in Persia with Darius, wished to send a confidential message to a certain Aristagoras in a secret manner. He devised this remarkable method of concealing a letter. He shaved all the hair from the head of a slave of his who had long suffered from weak eyes, as if for the purpose of treatment. Then he tattooed the forms of the letters on his smooth head. When in this way he had written what he wished, he kept the man at home for a time, until his hair grew out. When this happened, he ordered him to go to Aristagoras, adding: <quote>When you come to him, say that I told him to shave your head, as I did a little while ago.</quote> The slave, as he was bidden, came to Aristagoras and delivered his master's order. Aristagoras, thinking that the command must have some reason, did as he was directed. And thus the letter reached its destination.</p>  </div>

<p>What Favorinus thought of the verses of Virgil in which he imitated the poet Pindar in his description of an eruption of Mount Aetna; his comparison and evaluation of the verses of the two poets on the same theme.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>I REMEMBER that the philosopher Favorinus, when he had gone during the hot season to the villa of a friend of his at Antium, and I had come from Rome to see him, discoursed in about the following manner about the poets Pindar and Virgil. <quote>The friends and intimates of Publius Vergilius,</quote> said he, <quote>in the accounts which they have left us of his talents and his character, say that he used to declare that he produced verses after the manner and fashion of a  <pb n="v3.p.241"/>  bear. For he said that as that beast brought forth her young formless and misshapen, and afterwards by licking the young cub gave it form and shape, just so the fresh products of his mind were rude in form and imperfect, but afterwards by working over them and polishing them he gave them a definite form and expression.

<note>Cf. Suet. <hi rend="italic">Vita Verg.</hi> 22 (ii. p. 470, <hi rend="italic">L.C.L.</hi>).</note>
That this was honestly and truly said by that man of fine taste,</quote> said he, "is shown by the result. For the parts that he left perfected and polished, to which his judgment and approval had applied the final hand, enjoy the highest praise for poetical beauty; but those parts which he postponed, with the intention of revising them later, but was unable to finish because he was overtaken by death, are in no way worthy of the fame and taste of the most elegant of poets. It was for that reason, when he was laid low by disease and saw that death was near, that he begged and earnestly besought his best friends to burn the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid,</hi> which he had not yet sufficiently revised.</p>

<p><quote>Now among the passages,</quote> said Favorinus, <quote>which particularly seem to have needed revision and correction is the one which was composed about Mount Aetna. For wishing to rival the poem which the earlier poet Pindar composed about the nature and eruption of that mountain, he has heaped up such words and expressions that in this passage at least he is more extravagant and bombastic even than Pindar himself, who was thought to have too rich and luxuriant a style. And in order that you yourselves,</quote> said he, "may be judges of what I say, I will repeat Pindar's poem about Mount Aetna, so far as I can remember it:

<note><hi rend="italic">Pyth.</hi> i. 21 ff.</note>
<pb n="v3.p.243"/>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Mount Aetna, from whose inmost caves burst forth</l> <l>The purest fount of unapproachable fire.</l> <l>By day her rivers roll a lurid stream</l> <l>Of smoke, while 'mid the gloom of night red flame,</l> <l>On sweeping, whirleth rocks with crashing din</l> <l>Far down to the deep sea. And high aloft</l> <l>That monster

<note>The monster was the giant Typhoeus, or Typhon, who was struck by Zeus' thunder-bolt and buried under Aetna.</note>
flingeth fearful founts of fire,</l> <l>A marvel to behold or e'en to hear</l> <l>From close at hand.</l></quote>  Now hear the verses of Virgil, which I may more truly say that he began than finished:

<note><hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> iii. 570 ff.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>There lies a port, safe from the winds' approach,</l> <l>Spacious itself, but Aetna close at hand</l> <l>Thunders with crashes dire, and now hurls forth</l> <l>Skyward a dusky cloud with eddies black</l> <l>And glowing ash, and uplifts balls of flame</l> <l>And licks the stars; now spews forth rocks,</l> <l>The mountain's entrails torn, hurls molten crags</l> <l>Groaning to heaven, and seethes from depths profound.</l></quote>  <quote>Now in the first place,</quote> said Favorinus, <quote>Pindar has more closely followed the truth and has given a realistic description of what actually happened there, and what he saw with his own eyes; namely, that Aetna in the daytime sends forth smoke and at night fire; but Virgil, labouring to find grand and sonorous words, confuses the two periods of time and makes no distinction between them. Then the Greek has vividly pictured the streams of fire belched from the depths and the flowing rivers of smoke, and  <pb n="v3.p.245"/>  the rushing of lurid and spiral volumes of flame into the waters of the sea, like so many fiery serpents; but our poet, attempting to render <foreign xml:lang="grc">r(o/on kapnou= ai)/qwna,</foreign> 'a lurid stream of smoke,' has clumsily and diffusely piled up the words <hi rend="italic">atram nubem turbine piceo et favilla fomented,</hi> 'a dusky cloud smoking with eddies black and glowing ash,' and what Pindar called <foreign xml:lang="grc">krounoi/,</foreign> or 'founts,' he has harshly and inaccurately rendered by 'balls of flame.' Likewise when he says <hi rend="italic">sidearm lamb it,</hi> 'it licks the stars,' this also,</quote> he says, <quote>is a useless and foolish elaboration. And this too is inexplicable and almost incomprehensible, when he speaks of a 'black cloud smoking with eddies black and glowing ash.' For things which glow,</quote> said Favorinus, <quote>do not usually smoke nor are they black; unless <hi rend="italic">candenti</hi> ('glowing') is used vulgarly and inaccurately for hot ashes, instead of those which are fiery and gleaming. For <hi rend="italic">candens,</hi> of course, is connected with <hi rend="italic">candor,</hi> or 'whiteness,' not with <hi rend="italic">calor</hi> ('heat'). But when he says <hi rend="italic">saxa et scopulos eructari et erigi,</hi> 'that rocks and crags are spewed forth and whirled skyward,' and that these same crags at once <hi rend="italic">liquefieri et gemere atque glomerari ad auras,</hi> 'are molten and groan and are whirled to heaven,' this,</quote> he said, <quote>is what Pindar never wrote and what was never spoken by anyone; and it is the most monstrous of all monstrous descriptions.</quote>

<note>Not all modern critics would agree with Favorinus as to Virgil's last two lines, with their elaborate accommodation of sound to sense.</note>

<!--<argument>-->

<p>That Plutarch in his <hi rend="italic">Symposiacs</hi> defended the opinion of Plato about the structure and nature of the stomach, and of the tube which is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">traxei=a,</foreign> against the physician Erasistratus, urging the authority of the ancient physician Hippocrates.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>BOTH Plutarch

<note><hi rend="italic">Sympos.</hi> vii. 1.</note>
and certain other learned men have written that Plato was criticized by the famous physician Erasistratus,

<note>p. 194, Fuchs.</note>
because he said

<note><hi rend="italic">Tim.</hi> 44, p. 91, A; 31, p. 70, c.</note>
that drink went to the lungs and having sufficiently moistened them, flowed through them, since they are somewhat porous, and from there passed into the bladder. They declared that the originator of that error was Alcaeus, who wrote

<note>Frag. 39, Bergk<hi rend="sup">4</hi>.</note>
in his poems:  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Wet now the lungs with wine; the dog-star shines,</l></quote>  but that Erasistratus himself declared

<note>pp. 184 ff. and 194, Fuchs.</note>
that there were two little canals, so to speak, or pipes, and that they extended downward from the throat; that through one of these all food and drink passed and went into the stomach, and from there were carried into the belly, which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">h( ka/tw koili/a.</foreign> That there it is reduced and digested and then the drier excrement passes into the bowels, which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ko/lon,</foreign>

<note>The three places referred to are the stomach, the small intestine and the large intestine. Neither the Greek nor the Latin terms are always used consistently.</note>
and the moisture through the kidneys into the bladder. But through the other tube, which the Greeks call the <foreign xml:lang="grc">traxei=a a)rthri/a,</foreign> or <quote>rough windpipe,</quote> the breath passes from the lips into the lungs, and from there goes back into the mouth and nostrils, and along this same road a passage for the voice also is made; and lest drink  <pb n="v3.p.249"/>  or drier food, which ought to pass into the stomach, should fall from the mouth and slip into that tube through which the breath goes back and forth, and by such an accident the path of the breath should be cut off, there has been placed at these two openings by a kind of helpful device of nature, a sort of movable valve which is called the <quote>epiglottis,</quote> which alternately shuts and opens. This epiglottis, while we are eating and drinking, covers and protects <quote>the rough windpipe,</quote> in order that no particle of food or drink may fall into that path, so to speak, of the rising and falling breath; and on that account no moisture passes into the lungs, since the opening of the windpipe itself is well protected.</p>

<p>These are the views of the physician Erasistratus, as opposed to Plato. But Plutarch, in his <hi rend="italic">Symposiacs,</hi>

<note>vii. 1. 3.</note>
says that the originator of Plato's opinion was Hippocrates, and that the same opinion was held by Philistion of Locris

<note>Frag. 7, p. 112, Wellmann.</note>
and Dioxippus the pupil of Hippocrates, famous physicians of the olden time; also that the epiglottis, of which Erasistratus spoke, was not placed where it is to prevent anything that we drank from flowing into the windpipe; for fluid seems necessary and serviceable for refreshing and moistening the lungs; but it was placed there as a kind of controller and arbiter, to exclude or admit whatever was necessary for the health of the body; to keep away all foods from the windpipe and turn them to the stomach, but to divide what is drunk between the stomach and the lungs. And that part which ought to be admitted into the lungs through the windpipe the epiglottis does not let through rapidly and all at once, but when it has been checked and held back, as it were by a kind  <pb n="v3.p.251"/>  of dam, it allows it to pass gradually and little by little, and turns aside all the remainder into the other tube leading to the stomach.</p>  </div>

<p>Of ignoble subjects, called by the Greeks <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)/docoi,</foreign> or <quote>unexpected,</quote> argued by Favorinus for the sake of practice.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>NOT only the sophists of old, but the philosophers as well, took up ignoble subjects,

<note>See Pease, <quote>Things without Honor,</quote> <hi rend="italic">Class. Phil.</hi> xxi. pp. 27 ff. An example is Erasmus' <hi rend="italic">Praise of Folly.</hi></note>
or if you prefer, unexpected ones, <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)/docoi u(poqe/seis,</foreign> as the Greeks call them; and our friend Favorinus took a great deal of pleasure in descending to such subjects,

<note>Frag. 65, Marres.</note>
either thinking them suitable for stimulating his thoughts or exercising his cleverness or overcoming difficulties by practice. For example, when he attempted to praise Thersites and pronounced a eulogy upon the quartan ague,

<note>See note 1, p. 252.</note>
he said many clever and ingenious things on both topics, which he has left written in his works.</p>

<p>But in his eulogy of fever he even produced Plato as a witness, declaring that the philosopher wrote

<note><hi rend="italic">Tim.</hi> 10, p. 86 A.</note>
that one who after suffering from quartan ague got well and recovered his full strength, would afterwards enjoy surer and more constant health. And in that same eulogy he made this quip, which, of a truth, is not ungraceful: <quote>The following lines,</quote> he says, <quote>have met with the approval of many generations of men:

<note>Hesiod, <hi rend="italic">Works and Days,</hi> 825.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Sometimes a day is like a stepmother,</l> <l>And sometimes like a mother.</l></quote>  <pb n="v3.p.253"/>  The meaning of the verses is that a man cannot fare well every day, but fares well on one day and ill on another. Since it is true,</quote> he says, <quote>that in human affairs things are in turn, now good, now bad, how much more fortunate is this fever which has an interval of two days,

<note>Owing to the Roman method of inclusive reckoning, the quartan ague, occurring on every fourth day, had an interval of two days; see <hi rend="italic">Class Phil.</hi> viii. 1 ff.</note>

<!--<argument>-->

<p>How many and what varieties of meaning the particle <hi rend="italic">quin</hi> has, and that it is often obscure in the earlier literature.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>THE particle <hi rend="italic">quin,</hi> which the grammarians call a conjunction, seems to connect sentences in various ways and with divers meanings. For it seems to have one meaning when we say, as if chiding or questioning or exhorting, <hi rend="italic">quin venis?</hi> <quote>Why don't you come?</quote> <hi rend="italic">quin legis?</hi> <quote>Why don't you read?</quote> or <hi rend="italic">quin fugis?</hi> <quote>Why don't you flee?</quote>; but it has a different meaning when we affirm, for example, that <quote>there is no doubt but that (<hi rend="italic">quin</hi>) Marcus Tullius is the most eloquent of all men,</quote> and still a third, when we add something which seems contradictory to a former statement: <quote>Isocrates did not plead causes, not but that he thought it useful and honourable so to do.</quote> In the last of these sentences the meaning is not very different from that which is found in the third book of Marcus Cato's <hi rend="italic">Origins:</hi>

<note>Frag. 73, Peter<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
<quote>these I describe last, not but that they are good and valiant peoples.</quote>

<note>This rather difficult example I do not find in our grammars.</note>
Also in the second book of the <hi rend="italic">Origins</hi> Marcus Cato has used this particle in a very similar manner:

<note><hi rend="italic">Id.</hi> 36.</note>
<quote>He did not consider it enough to have slandered him privately, without openly defaming his character.</quote></p>  <pb n="v3.p.255"/>

<p>I have noted, besides, that Quadrigarius in the eighth book of his <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi> has used that particle in a very obscure manner. I quote his exact words:

<note>Frag. 70, Peter<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
<quote>He came to Rome; he barely succeeds in having a triumph voted.</quote>

<note><hi rend="italic">Quin</hi> = <quote>why not</quote>; see note 4 below.</note>
Also in the sixth book of the same writer's <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi> are these words:

<note><hi rend="italic">Id.</hi> 58.</note>
<quote>It lacked little but that (<hi rend="italic">quin</hi>) they should leave their camp and yield to the enemy.</quote> Now I am quite well aware that someone may say off-hand that there is no difficulty in these words; for <hi rend="italic">quin</hi> in both passages is used for <hi rend="italic">ut,</hi> and the meaning is perfectly plain if you say: <quote>He came to Rome; he with difficulty brought it about that a triumph should be voted</quote>;

<note>This translation, which Gellius rightly rejects, neglects the negative in <hi rend="italic">quin.</hi> Both examples from Quadrigarius might be explained as dubitative questions in the paratactic form; <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> <quote>Why should not a triumph be granted him?</quote></note>
and also in the other passage, <quote>It almost happened that they left their camp and yielded to the enemy.</quote> Let those who are so ready find refuge in changing words which they do not understand, but let them do so with more modesty, when the occasion permits.</p>

<p>Only one who has learned that this particle of which we are speaking is a compound and formed of two parts, and that it does not merely have the function of a connective but has a definite meaning of its own,

<note><hi rend="italic">quin</hi> is formed from <hi rend="italic">qui,</hi> the ablative of the interrogative and relative stem <hi rend="italic">qui-,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">-ne,</hi> <quote>not.</quote> It is used in both dependent and independent sentences. See Lane, <hi rend="italic">Lat. Gr.</hi><hi rend="sup">2</hi> 1980 ff.</note>

<p>That Carneades the Academic purged his stomach with hellebore when about to write against the dogmas of Zeno the Stoic; and of the nature and curative powers of white and black hellebore.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>WHEN Carneades, the Academic philosopher, was about to write against the books of the Stoic Zeno, he cleansed the upper part of his body with white hellebore, in order that none of the corrupt humours of his stomach might rise to the abode of his mind and weaken the power and vigour of his intellect; with such care and such preparation did this man of surpassing talent set about refuting what Zeno had written. When I had read of this in Grecian history, I inquired what was meant by the term <quote>white hellebore.</quote></p>

<p>Then I learned that there are two kinds of hellebore distinguished by a difference in colour, white and black; but that those colours are distinguished neither in the seed of the hellebore nor in its plant, but in the root; further, that with white hellebore the stomach and upper belly

<note>The small intestine, see note on xvii. 11. 2.</note>
are purged by vomiting; by the black the so-called lower belly is loosened,

<note>The large intestine.</note>
and the effect of both is to remove the noxious humours in which the causes of diseases are situated. But that there is danger lest, when every avenue of the body is opened, along with the causes of disease the juices on which the principle of life depends should also pass away, and the man should perish from exhaustion because of the destruction of the entire foundation of natural nourishment.</p>  <pb n="v3.p.261"/>

<p>But Plinius Secundus, in his work <hi rend="italic">On Natural History,</hi> wrote

<note>xxv. 52.</note>
that hellebore could be taken with the greatest safety in the island of Anticyra.

<note>There were three places of this name, all celebrated for their hellebore, which was regarded as a cure for insanity. One was in Locris, on the Corinthian Gulf; the second was on the Maliac Gulf at the foot of Mt. Oeta. The third, usually considered the most important, was a town of Phocis on the Corinthian Gulf. See <hi rend="italic">Thes. Ling. Lat. s.v.,</hi> where Plin. <hi rend="italic">N.

That for this reason Livius Drusus, the former tribune of the commons, when he was suffering from the so-called <quote>election</quote> disease,

<note>See note on xvi. 4. 4.</note>
sailed to Anticyra, drank hellebore in that island, and was thus cured of the ailment.</p>

<p>I have read besides that the Gauls, when hunting, dip their arrows in hellebore, because the wild animals that are struck and killed by arrows thus treated become tenderer for eating; but because of the contagion of the hellebore they are said to cut out a large piece of flesh around the wounds made by the arrows.</p>  </div>

<note>66–63 B.C.</note>
was proficient in the languages of the twenty-five races which he held under his sway. He never spoke to the men of all those nations through an interpreter, but whenever it was necessary for him to address any one of them, he used his language and speech with as much skill as if he were his fellow-countryman.</p>  <pb n="v3.p.265"/>  </div>

<p>What Epictetus the philosophers used to say to worthless and vile men, who zealously followed the pursuit of philosophy; and the two words whose remembrance he enjoyed as by far the most salutary in all respects.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>I HEARD Favorinus say that the philosopher Epictetus declared

<note>Frag. 10, p. 410, Schenkl., <hi rend="italic">L.C.L.</hi> II, p. 452 ff.</note>
that very many of those who professed to be philosophers were of the kind <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)/neu tou= pra/ttein, me/xri tou= le/gein,</foreign> which means <quote>without deeds, limited to words</quote>; that is, they preached but did not practise. But that is still more severe which Arrian, in his work <hi rend="italic">On the Dissertations of Epictetus,</hi>

<note>ii. 19; cf. Gell. i. 2. 8.</note>
has written that this philosopher used to say. <quote>For,</quote> says Arrian, <quote>when he perceived that a man without shame, persistent in wickedness, of abandoned  <pb n="v3.p.267"/>  character, reckless, boastful, and cultivating everything else except his soul—when he saw such a man taking up also the study and pursuit of philosophy, attacking natural history, practising logic and balancing and investigating many problems of that kind, he used to invoke the help

<note>That is, he used some phrase equivalent to <hi rend="italic">pro deum atque hominum fidem</hi> (Heaven help us!).</note>
of gods and men, and usually amid his exclamations chided the man in these terms: 'O man, where are you storing these things? Consider whether the vessel be clean. For if you take them into your self-conceit, they are lost; if they are spoiled, they become urine or vinegar or something worse, if possible.'</quote> Nothing surely could be weightier, nothing truer than these words, in which the greatest of philosophers declared that the learning and precepts of philosophy, flowing into a base and degenerate man, as if into a soiled and filthy vessel, are turned, altered, spoiled, and as he himself more cynically expresses it, become urine or, if possible, something worse than urine. Moreover, that same Epictetus, as we also heard from Favorinus, used to say that there were two faults which were by far the worst and most disgusting of all, lack of endurance and lack of self-restraint, when we cannot put up with or bear the wrongs which we ought to endure, or cannot restrain ourselves from actions or pleasures from which we ought to refrain. <quote>Therefore,</quote> said he, <quote>if anyone would take these two words to heart and use them for his own guidance and regulation, he will be almost without sin and will lead a very peaceful life.

<p>A passage taken from the <hi rend="italic">Symposium</hi> of Plato, skilful. harmonious and fitting in its rhythm and structure, which for the sake of practice I have turned into the Latin tongue.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>THE <hi rend="italic">Symposium</hi> of Plato was being read before the philosopher Taurus. Those words of Pausanias in which, taking his turn among the banqueters, lie eulogizes love, I admired so much that I even resolved to commit them to memory. And tile words, if I remember rightly, are as follows

<note>Symlpos. p. SO, E.</note>
"Every action is of this nature: in and of itself, when done, it is neither good nor bad; for example, what we are now doing, drinking, or singing, or arguing. Not one of these things is in itself good, but it may become so by the way in which it is done. Well and rightly done, it becomes a good action; wrongly done, it becomes shameful. It is the same with love; for not all love is honourable or worthy of raise, but only that which leads us to love worthily." When these words had been read, thereupon Taurus said to me: <quote>Ho! you young rhetorician</quote>— for so he used to call me in the beginning, when I was first admitted to his class, supposing that I had come to Athens only to work up eloquence

<note>This would seem to imply that Gellius went to Athens on completing his studies in Rome; see Introd. p. xv.</note>
— <quote>do you see this syllogism, full of meaning, brilliant, well rounded and constructed in brief and smooth numbers with a kind of symmetrical turn? Can you quote us so aptand so melodiously formed a passage from the works of your rhetoricians? But yet  <pb n="v3.p.271"/>  I advise you to look upon this rhythm as an incidental feature; for one must penetrate to the inmost depths of Plato's mind and feel the weight and dignity of his subject matter, not be diverted to the charm of his diction or the grace of his expression.</quote></p>

<p>This admonition of Taurus as to Plato's style not only did not deter me, but even encouraged me to try to equal the elegance of the Greek in a Latin rendering; and just as there are small and insignificant animals which through wantonness imitate everything which they have seen or heard, just so I had the assurance, not indeed to rival those qualities which I admired in Plato's style, but to give a shadowy outline of them, such as the following, which I patterned on those very words of his: <quote>Every act, in general,</quote> he says, <quote>is of this nature; it is in itself neither base nor honourable; as, for example, the things which we ourselves are now doing, drinking, singing, arguing. For none of these things is honourable in itself, but it becomes so by the manner in which it is done; if it is done rightly and honourably, it is then honourable; but if it is not rightly done, then it is shameful. It is the same with love; thus not every kind of love is honourable, not every kind is deserving of praise, but only that which leads us to love honourably.</quote></p>  <pb n="v3.p.273"/>  </div>

<p>The times after the foundling of Rome and before the second war with Carthage at which distinguished Greeks and Romans flourished.

<note>Leuze has shown (see Biogr. Note, i. p. xxiv) that, besides the <hi rend="italic">Chroica</hi> of Cornelius Nepos, Gellius made use of Varronian sources, which used a different chronology. According to the source which he followed, Gellius' dates are reckoned from 751 (Nepos) or 753 B.C. (Varro) as the date of the founding of Rome. He does not, however, confuse these epochs in speaking of the same event. In my notes the Varronian chronology is followed, except as otherwise indicated; for full details see the article of Leutze.</note>
</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>I WISHED to have a kind of survey of ancient times, and also of the famous men who were born in those days, lest I might in conversation chance to make some careless remark about the date and life of celebrated men, as that ignorant sophist did who lately, in a public lecture, said that Carneades the philosopher

<note>Carneades, who was one of the envoys sent from Athens to Rome in 155 B.C., lived more than a hundred years after the death of Alexander.</note>
was presented with a sum of money by king Alexander, son of Philip, and that Panaetius the Stoic was intimate with the elder Africanus.

<note>Panaetius, born about 185 B.C., was the teacher and personal friend of the younger Africanus.</note>
In order, I say, to guard against such errors in dates and periods of time, I made notes from the books known as <hi rend="italic">Chroicles</hi>

<note><hi rend="italic">Chronic</hi> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">xronika/</foreign>) were chronological lists of historical events. The <hi rend="italic">Chronica</hi> of Nepos seem to have given the important dates in foreign, as well as in Roman, history, including mythology.</note>
of the times when those Greeks and Romans flourished who were famous and conspicuous either for talent or for political power, between the founding of Rome and the second Punic war.

<note>218–202 B.C.</note>
And these excerpts of mine, made in various and sundry places, I have now put hastily together. For it was not my endeavour with keen and subtle care to compile a catalogue of the eminent men of both nations who lived at the same time, but merely to strew these <hi rend="italic">Nights</hi> of mine  <pb n="v3.p.275"/>  lightly here and there with a few of these flowers of history.

<note>After his usual fashion, Gellius tries to present his material in an entertaining form by introducing the anecdote of the ignorant sophist, by freedom of treatment, and by condensation; also by the arrangement of his matter.</note>
Moreover, it seemed sufficient in this survey to speak of the dates of a few men, from which it would not be difficult to infer the periods also of many more whom I did not name.</p>

<p>I shall begin, then, with the illustrious Solon; for, as regards Homer and Hesiod, it is agreed by almost all writers, either that they lived at approximately the same period, or that Homer was somewhat the earlier; yet that both lived before the founding of Rome, when the Silvii were ruling in Alba, more than a hundred and sixty years after the Trojan war, as Cassius has written

<note>Frag. 8, Peter<hi rend="sup">2</hi>; <hi rend="italic">F.H.G.</hi> iii, p. 688.</note>
about Homer and Hesiod in the first book of his <hi rend="italic">Annals,</hi> but about a hundred and sixty years before the founding of Rome, as Cornelius Nepos says of Homer in the first book of his <hi rend="italic">Chronicles.</hi>

<note>Frag. 2, Peter<hi rend="sup">2</hi>. Nepos' date is 910 B.C., that of Cassius (Hemina), 1024. Both are too late, for literary and archæological evidence indicate the end of the twelfth century before our era as the time of the Homeric poems. See <hi rend="italic">Amer. Journ. of Phil.</hi> xlvi (1925), pp. 26 ff.</note>
Well then, we are told that Solon, one of the famous sages,

<note>About 639–559 B.C. For the seven sages see vol. i, p. 10, n. 2.</note>
drew up laws for the Athenians when Tarquinius Priscus was king at Rome,

<note>616–578 B.C., traditional chronology.</note>
in the thirtythird year of his reign.

<note>See the critical note.</note>
Afterwards, when Servius Tullius was king,

<note>578–534 B.C.</note>
Pisistratus was tyrant at Athens, Solon having previously gone into voluntary exile, since he had not been believed when he predicted that tyranny. Still later, Pythagoras of Samos came to Italy, when the son of Tarquinius was king, he who was surnamed the Proud,

<note>534–510 B.C.</note>
and at that same time  <pb n="v3.p.277"/>  Hipparchus, son of Pisistratus and brother of the tyrant Hippias, was slain at Athens by Harmodius and Aristog, iton.

<note>514 B. C.</note>
And Cornelius Nepos adds

<note>Frag. 4, Peter<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
that when Tullus Hostilius was king at Rome

<note>673–641 B.C.</note>
Archilochus was already illustrious and famous for his poems.

<note>Flourished about 650 B.C.</note>
</p>

<p>Then, in the two hundred and sixtieth year after the founding (of Rome, or not much later, it is recorded that the Persians were vanquished by the Athenians in the famous battle of Marathon under the lead of Militiades,

<note>490 B.C., but Gellius, here following Nepos. puts it in 493.</note>
who after that victory was condemned by the Athenians and died in the public prison. At that time Aesthylus. the tragic poet, flourished at Athens.

<note>He lived from 525 to 456 B.C.</note>
In Rome, at about the same time, the commons, as the result of a secession, for the first time elected their own tribunes and aediles;

<note>494 B.C.</note>
and not much later Gnaeus Marcius Coriolanus, harassed and exasperated by the tribunes of the commons, turned traitor to the republic and joined the Volscians, who were then our enemies,

<note>Leuze suggests that Gellius so arranged his material as to show that at a time when the Greeks were lighting epochmaking battles the Romans were warring with comparatively insignificant Italian peoples.</note>
and lade war upon the Roman people. Then a few years later, King Xerxes was beaten and put to flight by the Athenians and a good part of Greece, under the lead of Themistocles, in the sea-fight at Salamis.

<note>480 B.C. Gellius is here using a Varroian source; Nepos' date would be 483.</note>
About three

<note>That is, in the fourth year; see note on xvii. 12. 5 (p 252).</note>
years afterwards, in the consulship of Menenius Agrippa and Marcus Horatius Pulvillus, during the war with Veii, the patrician Fabii, three hundred and six in number, along with their dependents,

<note>Some 4000 in number. This was in 477 B.C.</note>
were all ambushed at the river Cremera and slain.</p>  <pb n="v3.p.279"/>

<p>At about that time Empedocles of Agrigentum was eminent in the domain of natural philosophy.

<note>Flourished about 450 B.C. In § 14–15 Leuze sees the chronology of Fabius Pictor.</note>
But at Rome at that epoch it is stated that a board of ten was appointed

<note>451 B.C.</note>
to codify laws, and that at first they compiled ten tables, to which afterwards two more were added.</p>

<p>Then the great Peloponnesian war began in Greece, which Thucydides has handed down to memory, about three hundred and twenty-three years after the founding of Rome.

<note>431 B.C.</note>
At that time Olus Postumius Tubertus was dictator at Rome, and executed his own son, because he had fought against the enemy contrary to his father's order. The people of Fidenae and the Aequians were then at war with the Roman people.

<note>See note on § 11, above. Here the contrast is still more marked.</note>
During that period Sophocles, and later Euripides, were famous and renowned as tragic poets, Hippocrates as a physician, and as a philosopher, Democritus; Socrates the Athenian was younger than these,

<note>Born 469 B.C.</note>
but was in part their contemporary.</p>

<p>Somewhat later, when the military tribunes with consular authority were in power

<note>407 B.C. They were first chosen in 444, but were compelled to resign. From 404 B.C. (407, Nepos) to 367 the series of military tribunes was interrupted by only two consular years. Gellius here records changes in the form of government of Athens, Syracuse and Rome.</note>
at Rome, about the three hundred and forty-seventh year after the founding of the city, the notorious thirty tyrants were imposed upon the Athenians by the Lacedaemonians, and in Sicily the elder Dionysius was tyrant.

<note>404 B.C.</note>
A few years later, at Athens, Socrates was condemned to death and executed in prison by means of poison. At about the same time, at Rome,  <pb n="v3.p.281"/>  Marcus Furius Camillus was dictator and took Veii. Not long afterwards came the war with the Senones, when the Gauls captured Rome with the exception of the Capitol.

<note>390 B.C.; 387. Varro.</note>
</p>

<p>Not long after these events the astronomer Eudoxus was famed in the land of Greece, the Lacedaemonians were defeated by the Athenians at Corinth under the lead of Phormio,

<note>429 B.C.</note>
and at Rome Marcus Manlius, who during the siege of the Capitol had repulsed the Gauls as they were climbing up its steep cliffs, was convicted of having formed the design of making himself king. Marcus Varro says

<note><hi rend="italic">Annales</hi> iii, frag. 2. Peter<hi rend="sup">2</hi>. In 384 B.C.</note>
that he was condemned to death and hurled from the Tarpeian rock; but Cornelius Nepos has written

<note><hi rend="italic">Chron.,</hi> frag. 5, Peter.<hi rend="sup">2</hi></note>
that he was scourged to death. In the very same year, which was the seventh after the recovery of the city, it is recorded that the philosopher Aristotle was born.

<note>384 B.C.</note>
</p>

<p>Next, some years after the war with the Senones, the Thebans defeated the Lacedaemonians at Leuctra

<note>371 B.C.</note>
under the lead of Epaminondas, and a little later in the city of Rome the law of Licinius Stolo provided for the elections of consuls also from the plebeians,

<note>317 B.C.</note>
whereas before that time it was not lawful for a consul to be chosen except from the patrician <choice><corr>familiis</corr><sic>families</sic></choice>.</p>

<p>Then, about the four hundredth year after the founding of the city, Philip, son of Amyntas and father of Alexander, became king of Macedonia. At that time Alexander was born,

<note>356 B.C.</note>
and a few years later the philosopher Plato went to the court of the younger Dionysius, tyrant of Sicily; then some little time afterwards Philip defeated the Athenians in the great battle at Chaeronea.

<note>338 B.C.</note>
At that time the  <pb n="v3.p.283"/>  orator Demosthenes sought safety in flight from the battlefield, and when he was bitterly taunted with his flight he jestingly replied in the well-known verse:

<note>Menander, <hi rend="italic">Monost.</hi> 45.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>The man who runs away will fight again.</l></quote>  Later Philip fell victim to a conspiracy; but Alexander, who succeeded him,

<note>336 B.C. Quint. xi. 2. 50</note>
crossed over into Asia and the Orient, to subdue the Persians. But another Alexander, surnamed Molossus, came into Italy intending to make war on the Roman people —for already the fame of Roman valour and success was beginning to be conspicuous among foreign nations—but he died before beginning the war. We have learned that on his way to Italy that Molossus said that he was going against the Romans as a nation of men, but the Macedonian was going against the Persians as one of women. Later, the Macedonian Alexander, having subdued the greater part of the east, died

<note>323 B.C.</note>
after a reign of eleven years. Not long after this the philosopher Aristotle ended his life,

<note>322 B.C.</note>
and a little later, Demosthenes;

<note>322 B.C.</note>
at about that same time the Roman people engaged in a dangerous and protracted war with the Samites and the consuls Tiberius Veturius and Spurius Postumius were surrounded by the Samites in a perilous position near Caudium and being sent under the yoke were allowed to depart only when they had made a shameful treaty;

<note>321 B.C.</note>
and when for that reason the consuls by vote of the people were surrendered to the Samites through the fetial priests, they were not accepted.</p>

<p>Then, about four hundred and seventy years after the founding of the city, war was begun with king  <pb n="v3.p.285"/>  Pyrrhus.

<note>280 B.C.</note>
At that time Epicurus the Athenian and Zeno of Citium were famed as philosophers, and at the same time the censors at Rome, Gains Fabricius Luscinus and Quintus Aemilius Papus, expelled from the senate Publius Cornelius Rufinus, who had twice been consul and dictator; and they recorded as the reason for that censure the fact that they had learned of his using ten pounds' weight of silverware at a dinner.</p>

<p>Then, in about the four hundred and ninetieth year after the founding of Rome, when the consuls were Appius Claudius, surnamed Caudex, brother of the celebrated Appius the Blind, and Marcus Fluvius Flaccus, the first war with the Carthaginians broke out,

<note>264 B.C.</note>
and not long afterwards Callimachus, the poet of Cyrene, was famous at the court of king Ptolemy at Alexandria. A little more than twenty years later, when peace had been made with the Carthaginians and the consuls were C. Claudius Centho, son of Appius the Blind, and Marcus Sempronius Tuditanus, the poet Lucius Livius was the very first to put plays upon the stage at Rome,

<note>240 B.C.</note>
more than a hundred and sixty years after the death of Sophocles and Euripides and about fifty-two years after the death of Menander. The consuls Claudius and Tuditanus were followed by Quintus Valerius and Gaius Mamilius, in whose year the poet Quintus Ennius was born,

<note>239 B.C.</note>
as Marcus Varro has written in the first book of his work <hi rend="italic">On Poets;</hi>

<note>p. 259, Bipont.</note>
and he adds that at the age of sixty-seven Ennius had written the twelfth <hi rend="italic">Book of the Annals,</hi> and that Ennius himself says so in that same book.</p>

<p>Five hundred and nineteen years after the <pb n="v3.p.287"/> founding of Rome, Spurius Carvilius Ruga, at the advice of his friends, was the first Roman to divorce his wife, on the ground that she was barren and that he had taken oath before the censors that he married for the purpose of having children.

<note>235 B.C. In iv. 3 Gellius gave the date as 231, following a different chronology. Dionysius of Halicarnassus agrees with the former (Varronian) chronology. On the formula <hi rend="italic">liberty quaerundorum causa</hi> see note on iv. 3. 2 (vol. i, p. 322).</note>
In that same year the poet Naevius exhibited plays to the people,

<note>235 B.C.</note>
and Marcus Varro says

<note>p. 259, Bipont.</note>
in the first book of his work <hi rend="italic">On Poets</hi> that Naevius served in the first Punic war and that the poet himself makes that statement in the poem which he wrote on that same war. But Porcius Licinius says

<note>Frag. 1, Bährens.</note>
in the following verses that Rome was later in taking up the poetic art:</p>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>In the second Punic war with winged flight</l> <l>The Muse to Romulus' warrior nation came.</l></quote>

<p>Then, about fifteen years later, war was begun with the Carthaginians,

<note>218 B.C.</note>
and not very long after that Marcus Cato was famous as a political orator and Plautus as a dramatic poet; and at that same time Diogenes the Stoic, Carneades the Academic, and Critolaus the Peripatetic were sent by the Athenians as envoys to the senate of the Roman people on public business. Not very long after this came Quintus Ennius, and then Caecilius and Terence,

<note>These three poets died respectively in 169, 168 and 159 B.C., before the coming of the envoys to Rome in 155 B.C. Since Gellius announced the second Punic war as his limit, Leuze believes that he added this section from memory.</note>
and afterwards Pacuvius

<note>Pacuvius (220–130 B.C.) was older than Terence, but outlived him. Terence's comedies were produced between 166 and 160 B.C.; he died in 159, but the date of his birth is uncertain.</note>
and when  <pb n="v3.p.289"/>  Pacuvius was already an old man, Accius and then Lucilius, who was still more famous through his criticisms of the poems of his predecessors.</p>

<p>But I have gone too far, since the limit that I set for these little notes was the second Punic war.</p>

<!--<argument>-->

<p>Discussions held by a Stoic philosopher and in opposition by a Peripatetic, with Favorinus as arbiter; and the question at issue was, how far virtue availed in determining a happy life and to what extent happiness was dependent on what are called external circumstances</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>THERE were two friends of Favorinus, philosophers of no little note in the city of Rome; one of them was a follower of the Peripatetic school, the other of the Stoic. I was once present when these men argued ably and vigorously, each for his own beliefs, when we were all with Favorinus at Ostia. And we were walking along the shore in springtime, just as evening was falling.</p>

<p>And on that occasion the Stoic mantatined

<note>III. 56, Arn.</note>
that man could enjoy a happy life only through virtue, and that the greatest wretchedness was due to wickedness only, even though all the other blessings, which are called external, should be lacking to the virtuous man and present with the wicked. The Peripatetic, on the other hand, admitted that a wretched life was due solely to vicious thoughts and wickedness, but he believed that virtue alone was by no means sufficient to round out all the parts of a happy life, since the complete use of one's limbs, good health, a reasonably attractive person, property, good repute, and all the other advantages of body and fortune seemed necessary to make a perfectly happy life.</p>  <pb n="v3.p.295"/>

<p>Here the Stoic made outcry against him, and maintaining that his opponent was advancing two contrary propositions, expressed his surprise that, since wickedness and virtue were two opposites, and a wretched and a happy life were also opposites, he did not preserve in each the force and nature of an opposite, but believed that wickedness alone was sufficient to cause an unhappy life, at the same time declaring that virtue alone was not sufficient to guarantee a happy life. And he said that it was especially inconsistent and contradictory for one who maintained that a life could in no way be made happy if virtue alone were lacking, to deny on the other hand that a life could be happy when virtue alone was present, and thus to take away from virtue when present and demanding it, that honour which he gave and bestowed upon virtue when lacking.</p>

<p>Thereupon the Peripatetic, in truth very wittily, said: <quote>Pray pardon me, and tell me this, whether you think that an amphora

<note>Somewhat less than 6 gallons.</note>
of wine from which a congius

<note>A little less than 6 pints.</note>
has been taken, is still an amphora?</quote> <quote>By no means,</quote> was the reply, <quote>can that be called an amphora of wine, from which a congius is missing.</quote> When the Peripatetic heard this, he retorted: <quote>Then it will have to be said that one congius makes an amphora of wine, since when that one is lacking, it is not an amphora, and when it is added, it becomes an amphora. But if it is absurd to say that an amphora is made from one single congius, it is equally absurd to say that a life is made happy by virtue alone by itself, because when virtue is lacking life can never be happy.</quote></p>

<p>Then Favorinus, turning to the Peripatetic, said:  <pb n="v3.p.297"/>  <quote>This clever turn which you have used about the congius of wine is indeed set forth in the books; but, as you know, it ought to be regarded rather as a neat catch than as an honest or plausible argument. For when a congius is lacking, it indeed causes the amphora not to be of full measure; but when it is added and put in, it alone does not make, but completes, an amphora. But virtue, as the Stoics say, is not an addition or a supplement, but it by itself is the equivalent of a happy life, and therefore it alone makes a happy life, when it is present.</quote></p>

<p>These and some other minute and knotty arguments each advanced in support of his own opinion, before Favorinus as umpire. But when the first night-lights appeared and the darkness grew thicker, we escorted Favorinus to the house where he was putting up; and when he went in, we separated.</p>  </div>

Accordingly, a number of us Romans who had come to Greece, and who attended the same lectures and devoted ourselves to the same teachers, met at the same dinner-table. Then the one who was giving the entertainment in his turn,

<note>Cf. note on vii. 13. 2.</note>
offered as a prize for solving a problem  <pb n="v3.p.299"/>  the work of some old Greek or Roman writer and a crown woven from laurel, and put to us as many questions as there were guests present. But when he had put them all, the question which each was to discuss and the order of speaking were determined by lot. Then, when a question was correctly answered, the reward was a crown and a prize; if it was not correctly answered, it was passed on to the next in the allotment, and this process was repeated throughout the circle. If no one could answer a particular question, the crown was dedicated to the god in whose honour the festival was held. Now the questions that were proposed were of this kind: an obscure saying of some early poet, amusing rather than perplexing; some point in ancient history; the correction of some tenet of philosophy which was commonly misinterpreted, the solution of some sophistical catch, the investigation of a rare and unusual word, or of an obscure use of the tense of a verb of plain meaning.</p>

<p>And I recollect that once seven questions were put, the first of which was an explanation of these verses in the <hi rend="italic">Saturae</hi> of Quintus Ennius,

<note>vv. 59 ff., Vahlen<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
in which one word is very neatly used in many different senses. They run as follows:</p>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Who tries with craft another to deceive,</l> <l>Deceives himself, if he says he's deceived</l> <l>Whom he'd deceive. For if whom you'd deceive</l> <l>Perceives that he's deceived, the deceiver 'tis</l> <l>Who is deceived, if 'other's not deceived.

<note>Rendered as follows by R. J. E. Tiddy in Gordon, <hi rend="italic">English Literature and the Classics,</hi> p. 206: <quote>The man who thinks to score a pretty score off another, says that he has scored off him off whom he would score—but he hasn't all the same. For he who thinks he's scoring, but isn't all the same, is scored off himself—and so the other scores.</quote></note>
</l></quote>

<p>The second question was how it ought to be understood and interpreted that Plato in the State  <pb n="v3.p.301"/>  which he planned in his books

<note><hi rend="italic">Rep,</hi> p. 457, etc.; 460), 468.</note>
said <foreign xml:lang="grc">koina\s ta\s gunai=kas,</foreign> that is, declared that women <quote>should be common property,</quote> and that the rewards of the bravest men and the greatest warriors should be the kisses of boys and maidens. In the third place this was asked, in what words the fallacy of the following catches consisted and how they could be made out and explained: <quote>What you have not lost, that you have. You have not lost horns; therefore you have horns.</quote> Also another catch: <quote>What I am, that you are not. I am a man; therefore you are not a man.</quote> Then it was inquired what was the solution of this sophistry: <quote>When I lie and admit that I lie, do I lie or speak the truth?</quote> Afterwards this question was put, why the patricians are in the habit of entertaining one another on the Megalensia,

<note>The festival of Magna Mater, on April 4, established in 204 B.C.</note>
and the plebeians on the Cerealia.

<note>The festival of Ceres, on April 19.</note>
Next came this question: <quote>What one of the early poets used the verb <hi rend="italic">verant,</hi> in the sense of 'they speak the truth '?</quote> The sixth question was, what kind of plant the <quote>asphodel</quote> was, which Hesiod mentioned in the following lines:

<note><hi rend="italic">Works and Days,</hi> 40. Cf. Horace, <hi rend="italic">Odes,</hi> i. 31. 16:  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l part="F">me pascunt olivae,</l> <l>Me cichorea levesque malvae.</l></quote></note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>O fools! who know not how much half exceeds the whole,

<note>Hesiod means that a simple and frugal life is the best. He had shared his father's property with his brother Perses; but Perses went to law and through the partiality of the judges got possession of the whole inheritance. He soon wasted it, and Hesiod, through his thrift, was able to come to his help. Hence the expression became proverbial. Cicero, on seeing a bust of his brother Quintus, who was of short stature, said: <quote>Half of my bother is greater than the whole.</quote> (Macrob. <hi rend="italic">Sat.</hi> ii. 3. 4.)</note>
</l> <l>Or that the asphodel and mallow make fine food.</l></quote>  And also what Hesiod meant when he said that the half was more than the whole. The last of all the  <pb n="v3.p.303"/>  questions was this: of what tense the verbs <hi rend="italic">scripserim, legerim</hi> and <hi rend="italic">venerim</hi> are, perfect or future, or both.</p>

<p>When these questions had been put in the order that I have mentioned, and had been discussed and explained by the several guests on whom the lots fell, we were all presented with crowns and books, except for the one question about the verb <hi rend="italic">verant.</hi> For at the time no one remembered that the word was used by Quintus Ennius in the thirteenth book of his <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi> in the following line:

<note>v. 380, Vallen<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Do seers speak truth (<hi rend="italic">verant</hi>), predicting life's extent?</l></quote>  Therefore the crown for this question was presented to Saturn, the god of that festival.</p>  </div>

<p>What the orator Aeschines, in the speech in which he accused Timarchus of unchastity, said that the Lacedaemonians decided about the praiseworthy suggestion of a most unpraiseworthy man</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>AESCHINES, the most acute and sagacious of the orators who gained renown in the Athenian assemblies, in that cruel, slanderous and virulent speech in which he severely and directly accused Timarchus of unchastity, says that a man of advanced years and high character, a leader in that State, once gave noble and distinguished counsel to the Lacedaemonians.</p>

The advice which he gave, and the course which he said ought to be followed, were approved and accepted by all, and a decree of the people was about to be passed in accordance with his opinion. Thereupon one of that body of leading citizens whom the Lacedaemonians, because of the prestige of their age and rank, reverenced as judges and directors of public policy,

<note>Cf. Cic. <hi rend="italic">De Senectute,</hi> 20, apud Lacedaemonios quidem ii qui amplissimum magistratum geruiit, ut sunt, sic etiam nominantur, senes, referring to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">gerousi/a.</foreign></note>
sprang up in a spirit of anger and vexation, and said: ' What prospect, Lacedaemonians, or what hope, pray, will there be that this city and this State can longer be secure and invincible, if we follow counsellors whose past life is like that of this man? Even if this advice is honourable and noble, let us not, I pray you, allow it to be disgraced by the pollution of its most shameful author.' And when he had said this, he selected a man conspicuous before all others for his courage and justice, but a poor speaker and without eloquence, and bade him, with the consent and at the request of all, to deliver that opinion of the eloquent man in the best language he could command, in order that, without mention of the former speaker, the vote and decree of the people might be passed under the name of him alone who had last made that proposition. And the action which that most sagacious old man had recommended was taken. So the good advice endured, but its base author was displaced.</quote></p>  <pb n="v3.p.307"/>  </div>

<p>How Sulpicius Apollinaris made fun of a man who asserted that he alone understood Sallust's histories, by inquiring the meaning of these words in Sallust: <hi rend="italic">incertum, stolidior an vacnior.</hi></p><!--</argument>-->

<p>WHEN I was already a young man at Rome, having laid aside the purple-bordered toga of boyhood, and was on my own account seeking masters of deeper knowledge, I happened to be with the booksellers in Shoemaker's Street at the time when Sulpicius Apollinaris, the most learned man of all within my memory, in the presence of a large gathering made fun of a boastful fellow who was parading his reading of Sallust, and turned him into ridicule with that kind of witty irony which Socrates used against the sophists. For when the man declared that he was the one and only reader and expositor of Sallust, and openly boasted that he did not merely search into the outer skin and obvious meaning of his sentences, but delved into and thoroughly examined the very blood and marrow of his words, then Apollinaris, pretending to embrace and venerate his learning, said: <quote>Most opportunely, my good master, do you come to me now with the blood and marrow of Sallust's language. For yesterday I was asked what in the world those words of his meant which he wrote in the fourth book of his <hi rend="italic">Histories</hi> about Gnaeus Lentulus, of whom he says that it is uncertain whether he was more churlish or more unreliable</quote>; and he quoted the very words, as Sallust wrote them:

<note><hi rend="italic">list.</hi> iv. 1, Maur.</note>
<quote>But Gnaeus Lentulus, his colleague, surnamed Clodianus, a man of patrician family—and it is not at all easy to say whether he  <pb n="v3.p.309"/>  was more churlish or more unreliable—proposed a bill for exacting the money which Sulla had remitted to the purchasers of property.</quote></p>

<p>Apolinaris therefore asserted that it was asked of him, and that he had not been able to answer tile question, what was meant by <hi rend="italic">vanior</hi> and what by <hi rend="italic">stolidior,</hi> since Sallust seemed to have separated the words and contrasted them with each other, as if they were different and unlike and did not both designate the same fault; and therefore he asked that the man would tell him the meaning and origin of the two words.</p>

<p>Then the other, showing by a grin and a grimace that he despised both the subject of the inquiry and the questioner himself; said: <quote>I am accustomed to examine and explain the marrow and blood of ancient and recondite words, as I said, not of those which are in common use and trite. Surely a man is more worthless and stupid than Gnaeus Lentulus himself, if he does not know that <hi rend="italic">vanitas</hi> and <hi rend="italic">stoliditas</hi> indicate the same kind of folly.</quote> But having said that, he left us in the very midst of our discussion and began to sneak off: Then we laid hold on him and pressed him, and in particular Apollinaris begged him to discourse at greater length and more plainly upon the difference, or, if he preferred, on the similarity of the words, and not to begrudge the information to one who was eager to learn.</p>

<p>Then the fellow, realizing by this time that he was being laughed at, pleaded an engagement and made off But we afterwards learned from Apollinaris that the term <hi rend="italic">rani</hi> was properly applied, not as in common parlance to those who were foolish or dull or silly, but, as the most learned of the ancients  <pb n="v3.p.311"/>  had used them, to liars, deceivers, and those who cleverly devised light and empty statements in place of those which were true and earnest. But that those were called <hi rend="italic">stolidi</hi> who were not so much foolish and witless as austere, churlish and disagreeable, such men as the Greeks called <foreign xml:lang="grc">moxqhroi/,</foreign> <quote>ugly fellows,</quote> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">fortikoi/,</foreign> <quote>common</quote> or <quote>vulgar folk.</quote> He also said that the roots and derivations of these words were to be found in the books of Nigidius.

<p>That Quintus Ennius, in the seventh book of his <hi rend="italic">Annals,</hi> wrote <hi rend="italic">quadrupes eques,</hi> and not <hi rend="italic">quadrupes equus,</hi> as many read it.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>A NUMBER of us young men, friends of his, were at Puteoli with the rhetorician Antonius Julianus, a fine man in truth and of distinguished eloquence, and we were spending the summer holidays in amusement and gaiety, amid literary diversions and seemly and improving pleasures. And while we were there, word was brought to Julianus that a certain reader, a man not without learning, was reciting the <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi> of Ennius to the people in the theatre in a very refined and musical voice. <quote>Let us go,</quote> said he, <quote>to hear this ' Ennianist.' whoever he may be</quote>; for that was the name <hi rend="italic">by</hi> which the man wished to be called.</p>  <pb n="v3.p.313"/>

<p>When at last we had found him reading amid loud applause—and he was reading the seventh book of the <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi> of Ennius—we first heard him wrongly recite the following lines:

<note>vv. 232 ff. Vahlen<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Then with great force on rush the four-footed horse (<hi rend="italic">equus</hi>)</l> <l part="I">And elephants,</l></quote>  and without adding many more verses, he departed amid the praises and applause of the whole company.</p>

<p>Then Julianus, as he came out of the theatre, said: <quote>What think you of this reader and his fourfooted horse? For surely he read it thus:  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Denique vi magna quadrupes equus atque elephant</l> <l part="I">Proiciunt sese.</l></quote>  Do you think that, if he had had a master and instructor worth a penny, he would have said <hi rend="italic">quadrupes equus</hi> and not <hi rend="italic">quadrupes eqces?</hi> For no one who has given any attention to ancient literature doubts that Ennius left it written in that way.</quote> When several of those who were present declared that they had read <hi rend="italic">quadrupes equus,</hi> each with his own teacher, and wondered what was the meaning oft quadrupes eques, Julianus rejoined: " I could wish, my worthy young friends, that you had read Quintus Ennius as accurately as did Publius Vergilius, who, imitating this verse of his in <hi rend="italic">The Georgics,</hi> used <hi rend="italic">eques</hi> for <hi rend="italic">equus</hi> in these lines:

<note>Julianus gave this meaning to <hi rend="italic">equitem,</hi> but the modern editors give it the usual one of <quote>horseman.</quote></note>
full armed, to gallop o'er the plain</l> <l part="I">And round his paces proud.</l></quote>  In this passage, unless one is foolishly and silkily captious, <hi rend="italic">equiter</hi> can be taken in no other sense than that of 'horse,' for many of the early writers called the man who sat upon a horse <hi rend="italic">eques</hi> and also the horse on which he sat. Hence <hi rend="italic">equitare</hi> also, which is derived from the word <hi rend="italic">eques, equitis,</hi> was said both of the man who rode the horse and of the horse which carried the man. Lucilius, indeed, a man conspicuous for his command of the Latin language, says <hi rend="italic">equum equitare</hi> in these lines:

<note>vv. 1284 ff. Marx, who reads <hi rend="italic">ecum</hi> for <hi rend="italic">equum.</hi></note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>With what we see the courser run and trot,</l> <l>With this he runs and trots. Now, 'tis with eyes</l> <l>We see him trot; hence with his eyes he trots.

<note>Similar sophistries were indulged in by Chrysippus (<hi rend="italic">Diog. Laert.</hi> vii. 180 ff.) and other philosophers. See Marx <hi rend="italic">ad loc.</hi></note>
</l></quote>  <quote>But,</quote> said Apollinaris, <quote>I was not content with these examples, and in order that it might not appear uncertain and doubtful, but clear and evident, whether Ennius wrote <hi rend="italic">equus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">eques,</hi> I procured at great trouble and expense, for the sake of examining one line, a copy of heavy and venerable antiquity, which it was almost certain had been edited by the hand of Lampadio;

<note>C. Octavius Lampadio edited the <hi rend="italic">Bellum Punicum</hi> of Naevius and divided the poem into seven books; see Suet. <hi rend="italic">Gr.</hi> ii. (<hi rend="italic">L. C. L.</hi> ii, p. 399). Apparently he also edited Ennius.</note>
and in that copy I found <hi rend="italic">eques</hi> and not <hi rend="italic">equus</hi> written in that line.</quote>"</p>  <pb n="v3.p.317"/>

<p>This at the time Julianus explained to us, along with other problems, clearly and courteously. But afterwards I ran upon the very same remarks in some very well-known handbooks.</p>  </div>

<p>That Aelius Melissus, in the book to which he gave the title <hi rend="italic">On Correctness of Speech,</hi> and which on its publication he called a horn of plenty, wrote something that deserves neither to be said nor heard, when he expressed the opinion that <hi rend="italic">matrona</hi> and <hi rend="italic">mater familias</hi> differ in meaning, thus making a distinction that is wholly groundless.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>WITHIN my memory Aelius Melissus held the highest rank among the grammarians of his day at Rome; but in literary criticism he showed greater boastfulness and sophistry than real merit. Besides many other works which he wrote, he made a book which at the time when it was issued seemed to be one of remarkable learning. The title of the book was designed to be especially attractive to readers, for it was called <hi rend="italic">Correct Language.</hi> Who, then, would suppose that he could speak correctly or with propriety unless he had learned those rules of Melissus? From that book I take these words: <quote><hi rend="italic">Matrona,</hi> 'a matron,' is a woman who has given birth once; she who has done so more than once is called mater <hi rend="italic">familias,</hi> 'mother of a family'; just so a sow which has had one litter is called <hi rend="italic">porcetra;</hi> one which has had more, <hi rend="italic">scrofa.</hi></quote> But to decide whether Melissus thought out this distinction between <hi rend="italic">matrona</hi> and <hi rend="italic">mater familias</hi> and that it was his own conjecture, or whether he read what someone else had written, surely requires soothsayers. For with regard to  <pb n="v3.p.319"/>  <hi rend="italic">porcetra</hi> he has, it is true, the authority of Pomponius in the Atellan farce which bears that very title

<note>p. 295, Ribbeck<hi rend="sup">3</hi>.</note>
but that <quote>matron</quote> was applied only to a woman who had given birth once, and <quote>mother of a family</quote> only to one who had done so more than once, can be proved by the authority of no ancient writer. Indeed, that seems much more probable which competent interpreters of ancient terms have written, that <quote>matron</quote> was properly applied to one who had contracted a marriage with a man, so long as she remained in that state, even though children were not yet born to them; and that she was so called from the word <hi rend="italic">mater,</hi> or <quote>mother,</quote> a state which she had not yet attained, but which she had the hope and promise of attaining later. <hi rend="italic">Matrimonium</hi> itself, or <quote>marriage,</quote> has the same derivation; but that woman only is called <quote>mother of the household</quote>

<note><hi rend="italic">Mater familias</hi> is the feminine equivalent of <hi rend="italic">pater familias.</hi> The latter was <quote>father of the household</quote> in authority, although he was not the actual father of all its members. In <hi rend="italic">C.I.L.</hi> vi. 1035, Julia, wife of Septimius Severus, is called <hi rend="italic">mater Augusti nostri et castrorum et senatus et patriae.</hi></note>

<p>How Favorinus treated a man who made an unseasonable inquiry about words of ambiguous meaning; and in that connection the different meanings of the word <hi rend="italic">contio.</hi></p><!--</argument>-->

<p>DOMITIUS was a learned and famous grammarian in the city of Rome, who was given the surname  <pb n="v3.p.321"/>  <hi rend="italic">Insanus,</hi> or <quote>The Madman,</quote> because he was by nature rather difficult and churlish. When our friend Favorinus, in my company, chanced to have met this Domitius at the temple of Carmentis, Favorinus said: <quote>I pray you, master, tell me whether I was in error in saying <hi rend="italic">contiones,</hi> when I wanted to turn <foreign xml:lang="grc">dhmhgori/ai</foreign> into Latin; for I am in doubt and should be glad to be informed whether any of the men of old who spoke with special elegance used <hi rend="italic">contio</hi> of words and of a speech.</quote>

<note><hi rend="italic">Contio,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">coventio</hi> ( =<hi rend="italic">conventio</hi>) meant first an assembly, then a speech to an assembly, and finally the place of meeting. It is used in the sense of a speech by Cicero, Caesar, and other good writers.</note>
Then Domitius, with excited voice and expression, replied: <quote>There is absolutely no hope left of anything good, when even you distinguished philosophers care for nothing save words and the authority for words. But I will send you a book, in which you will find what you ask. For I, a grammarian, am inquiring into the conduct of life and manners, while you philosophers are nothing but <hi rend="italic">mortualia, or</hi> 'winding sheets,' as Marcus Cato says:

<note>Frag. incert. 19, Jordan.</note>
for you collect glossaries and word-lists, filthy, foolish, trifling things, like the dirges of female hired mourners. And I could wish,</quote> said he, <quote>that all we mortals were dumb! for then dishonesty would lack its chief <choice><corr>instrumenti</corr><sic>instrument</sic></choice>.</quote> When we had left him, Favorinus said: <quote>We approached this man at an unseasonable time. For he seems to me to be clearly mad. Know, however,</quote> said he, <quote>that the disorder which is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">melagxoli/a,</foreign> or 'melancholia,' does not attack small or contemptible minds, but it is in a way a kind of heroic affliction and its victims often speak the truth boldly, but without regard to time or moderation. For example, what think you of this which he just said of philosophers? If Antisthenes or Diogenes  <pb n="v3.p.323"/>  had said it, would it not have seemed worthy of remembrance?</quote></p>

<p>But a little later Domitius sent Favorinus the book which he had promised—I think it was one by Verrius Flaccus—in which the following was written with regard to questions of that kind:

<note>Festus, p. xvi, Müller.</note>
that <hi rend="italic">senatus</hi> (senate) was used both of a place and of persons; <hi rend="italic">civitas</hi> (state) of a situation and a town, also of the rights of a community, and of a body of men; further that <hi rend="italic">tribus</hi> (tribes) and <hi rend="italic">decuriae</hi> (decuries) designated places, privileges and persons, and that <hi rend="italic">contio</hi> had three meanings: the place and tribunal from which speaking was done, as Marcus Tullius in his speech, <hi rend="italic">In Reply to the Address of Quintus Metelius,</hi> says:

<note>Frag. 4, p. 946, Orelli.</note>
<quote>I mounted the tribunal (<hi rend="italic">contionem</hi>); the people assembled.</quote> It also signifies an assembly of the people gathered together, since the same Marcus Tullius says in his <hi rend="italic">Orator</hi>:

<note>§ 168.</note>
<quote>I have often heard audiences (<hi rend="italic">contiones</hi>) cry out, when words ended in a proper rhythm; for the ears expect the thought to be expressed in harmonious words.</quote> It likewise designated the speech itself which was made to the people.

<note>See note 1, p. 320. Gellius has given the meanings in the wrong order.</note>
</p>

<p>Examples of these uses were not given in that book. But afterwards I found and showed to Favorinus at his request instances of all these meanings in Cicero, as I remarked above, and in the most elegant of the early writers; but that which he especially desired, an example of <hi rend="italic">contio</hi> used for words and of a speech, I pointed out in the title of a book by Cicero, which he had called <hi rend="italic">In Reply to the Address of Quintus Metellus;</hi> for there <hi rend="italic">Contionem</hi>  <pb n="v3.p.325"/>  surely means nothing else than the speech itself which was delivered by Metellus.</p>  </div>

<p>The meaning of the word <hi rend="italic">insecenda</hi> in Marcus Cato; and that <hi rend="italic">insecenda</hi> ought to be read rather than <hi rend="italic">insequenda,</hi> which many prefer.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>IN an old book, containing the speech of Marcus Cato <hi rend="italic">On Ptolemy against Thermus,</hi> were these words:

<note>p. 42. 6, Jordan.</note>
<quote>But if he did everything craftily, everything for the sake of avarice and pelf, such abominable crimes as we have never heard of or read of, he ought to suffer punishment for his acts. . .</quote> The question was raised what <hi rend="italic">insecenda</hi> meant. Of those who were present at the time there was one who was a dabbler in literature and another who was versed in it; that is to say, one was teaching the subject, the other was learned in it.

<note>On the distinction between <hi rend="italic">litterator</hi> and <hi rend="italic">litteratus</hi> see Suet. <hi rend="italic">Gram.</hi> iv. (ii. p. 401 f. <hi rend="italic">L.C.L.</hi>).</note>
These two disagreed with each other, the grammarian maintaining that <hi rend="italic">insequenda</hi> ought to be written: <quote>For,</quote> said he, <quote><hi rend="italic">insequenda</hi> should be written, not <hi rend="italic">insecenda,</hi> since <hi rend="italic">insequens</hi> means . . . and <hi rend="italic">inseque</hi> has come down to us in the sense of 'proceed to say,' and accordingly <hi rend="italic">insequor</hi> was written by Ennius in the following verses:

<note><hi rend="italic">Ann.</hi> 326 f., Vahlen<hi rend="sup">2</hi>, who reads <hi rend="italic">insece.</hi></note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Proceed, O Muse, when Rome with Philip warred,</l> <l>To tell the valorous deeds our leaders wrought.</l></quote></quote></p>

<p>But the other, more learned, man declared that there was no mistake, but that it was written correctly and properly, and that we ought to trust Velius Longus, a man not without learning, who  <pb n="v3.p.329"/>  wrote in the commentary which he composed <hi rend="italic">On the Use of Archaic Terms,</hi> that <hi rend="italic">inseque</hi> should not be read in Ennius, but <hi rend="italic">insece;</hi> and that therefore the early writers called what we term <hi rend="italic">narrationes,</hi> or <quote>tales,</quote> <hi rend="italic">insectiones;</hi> that Varro also explained this verse from the <hi rend="italic">Menaechmi</hi> of Plautus:

<note>v. 1047.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Nihilo minus esse videtur sectius quam somnia,</l></quote>  as follows: <quote>they seem to me no more worth telling than if they were dreams.</quote> Such was their discussion.</p>

<p>I think that both Marcus Cato and Quintus Ennius wrote <hi rend="italic">insecenda</hi> and <hi rend="italic">insece</hi> without <hi rend="italic">u.</hi> For in the library at Patrae

<note>A city of Achaia, near the entrance to the Corinthian Gulf, modern Patras.</note>
I found a manuscript of Livius Andronicus of undoubted antiquity, entitled <foreign xml:lang="grc">)Odu/sseia,</foreign> in which the first line contained this word without the letter <hi rend="italic">u</hi>:

<note>Frag. 1, Bahrens.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Tell me (<hi rend="italic">insece</hi>), O Muse, about the crafty man,</l></quote>  translated from this line of Homer:

<note><hi rend="italic">Odyss.</hi> i. 1.</note>
</p>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l><foreign xml:lang="grc">)/Andra moi e)/nnepe, Mou=sa, polu/tropon.</foreign></l></quote>

<p>On that point then I trust a book of great age and authority. For the fact that the line of Plautus has <hi rend="italic">sectius quam somnia</hi> lends no weight to the opposite opinion. However, even if the men of old did say <hi rend="italic">insece</hi> and not <hi rend="italic">inseque,</hi> I suppose because it was lighter and smoother, yet the two words seem to have the same meaning. For <hi rend="italic">sequo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sequor</hi> and likewise <hi rend="italic">secta</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sectio</hi> differ in the manner of their use, but anyone who examines them closely will find that their derivation and meaning are the same.</p>  <pb n="v3.p.331"/>

<p>The teachers also and interpreters of Greek words think that in  <cit><quote rend="blockquote"> <l><foreign xml:lang="grc">a)/ndra moi e)/nnepe, Mou=sa,</foreign>

<p>That those persons are in error who think that in testing for fever the pulse of the veins is felt, and not that of the arteries.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>IN the midst of the summer's heat I had withdrawn to the country house of Herodes, a man of senatorial rank, at a place in the territory of Attica which is called Cephisia, abounding in clear waters and groves. There I was confined to my bed by an attack of diarrhoea, accompanied by a high fever. When the philosopher Calvisius Taurus, and some others who were disciples of his, had come there from Athens to visit me, the physician who had been found there and who was sitting by me at the time, began to tell Taurus what discomfort I suffered and with what variations and intervals the fever came and went. Then in the course of the conversation remarking that I was now getting better, he said to Taurus: <quote>You too may satisfy yourself of this, <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)a\n</foreign>  <pb n="v3.p.333"/>  <foreign xml:lang="grc">a(/yh| au)tou= th=s flebo/s,</foreign> which in our language certainly leans: <hi rend="italic">si attigeris venam illius;</hi> that is, 'if you will put your finger on his vein.'</quote></p>

<p>The learned men who accompanied Taurus were shocked by this careless language in calling an artery a vein, and looking on him as a physician of little value, showed their opinion by their murmurs and expression. Whereupon Taurus, very mildly, as was his way, said: <quote>We feel sure, my good sir, that you are not unaware of the difference between veins and arteries; that the veins have no power of motion and are examined only for the purpose of drawing off blood, but that the arteries by their motion and pulsation show the condition and degree of fever. But, as I see, you spoke rather in common parlance than through ignorance; for I have heard others, as well as you, erroneously use the term 'vein' for 'artery.' Let us then find that you are more skilled in curing diseases than in the use of language, and with the favour of the gods restore this man to us by your art, sound and well, as soon as possible.</quote></p>

<p>Afterwards when I recalled this criticism of the physician, I thought that it was shameful, not only for a physician, but for all cultivated and liberally educated men, not to know even such facts pertaining to the knowledge of our bodies as are not deep and recondite, but which nature, for the purpose of maintaining our health, has allowed to be evident and obvious. Therefore I devoted such spare time as I had to dipping into those books on the art of medicine which I thought were suited to instruct me, and from them I seem to have learned, not only many other things which have to do with human experience, but also concerning veins and arteries what I  <pb n="v3.p.335"/>  may express as follows: A <quote>vein</quote> is a receptacle, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)ggei=on,</foreign> as the physicians call it, for blood mingled and combined with vital breath, in which the blood predominates and the breath is less. An <quote>artery</quote> is a receptacle for the vital breath mingled and combined with blood, in which there is more breath and less blood. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Sfugmo/s</foreign> (pulsation) is the natural and involuntary expansion and contraction in the heart and in the artery. But the ancient Greek physicians defined it thus: <quote>An involuntary dilation or contraction of the pulse and of the heart.</quote></p>  </div>

<p>Words from the poems of Furius of Antium which were ignorantly criticised by Caesellius Vindex; a quotation of the very verses which include the words in question.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>I CERTAINLY do not agree with Caesellius Vindex, the grammarian, though in my opinion he is by no means without learning. But yet this was a hasty and ignorant statement of his, that the ancient poet Furius of Antium had degraded the Latin language by forming words of a kind which to me did not seem inconsistent with a poet's license nor to be vulgar or unpleasant to speak and utter, as are some others which have been harshly and tastelessly fashioned by distinguished poets.</p>

<p>The expressions of Furius which Caesellius censures are these: that he uses <hi rend="italic">lutescere</hi> of earth which has turned into mud, <hi rend="italic">noctescere</hi> of darkness that has arisen like that of night, <hi rend="italic">virescere</hi> of recovering former strength, describes the wind curling the blue sea and making it shine by <hi rend="italic">purpurat,</hi> and uses <hi rend="italic">opulescere</hi> for becoming rich.</p>  <pb n="v3.p.337"/>

<p>I have added the very lines from the poems of Furius in which these words occur:

<p>That our forefathers had the custom of changing passive verbs and turning them into active.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>THIS also used to be regarded as a kind of elegance in composition, to use active verbs in place of those which had a passive form and then in turn to substitute the former for the latter. Thus Juventius in a comedy says:

</p>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>I care not if my cloak resplendent be, or spot.

<p>Is not this far more graceful and pleasing than if he said <hi rend="italic">maculetur,</hi> <quote>if it be spotted</quote>? Plautus also says in a similar way:

<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>What's wrong?—This cloak doth wrinkle (<hi rend="italic">rugat</hi>), I'm ill clad.</l></quote>  <pb n="v3.p.339"/>  Also Plautus uses <hi rend="italic">pulveret,</hi> not of making dusty, but of being dusty:

<p>The retort which the philosopher Diogenes made, when he was challenged by a logician with an impudent sophistry.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>AT Athens during the Saturnalia we engaged in a pleasant and improving diversion of this kind: when a number of us who were interested in the same study had met at the time of the bath, we discussed the catch questions which are called <quote>sophisms,</quote> and each one of us cast them before the company in his turn, like knuckle-bones or dice. The prize for solving a problem, or the penalty for failing to understand it, was a single sestertius. From the money thus collected, as if it had been won at dice, a little dinner was provided for all of us who had taken part in the game. Now the sophisms were somewhat as follows, although they cannot be expressed very elegantly in Latin, or even without clumsiness: <quote>What snow is, that hail is not; but snow is white, therefore hail is not white.</quote> A somewhat similar one is this: <quote>What man is, that a horse is not; man is an animal, therefore a horse is not an animal.</quote> The one who was called upon by the throw of the dice to solve and refute the sophistry was expected to tell in what part of the proposition and in what word the fallacy consisted, and what ought not to be granted and conceded; if he did not succeed, he was fined one sestertius. The fine contributed to the dinner.</p>

<p>I must tell you how wittily Diogenes paid back a sophism of that kind which I have mentioned above, proposed with insulting intent by a logician of the Platonic school. For when the logician had  <pb n="v3.p.343"/>  asked: <quote>You are not what I am, are you?</quote> and Diogenes had admitted it, he added: <quote>But I am a man.</quote> And when Diogenes had assented to that also and the logician had concluded: <quote>Then you are not a man,</quote> Diogenes retorted: <quote>That is a lie, but if you want it to be true, begin your proposition with me.</quote></p>  </div>

<p>CERTAIN numerical figures which the Greeks call by definite terms have no corresponding names in Latin.

For what name could one give to a number which is said to be <hi rend="italic">hemiolios</hi> or <hi rend="italic">epitritos?</hi> But <hi rend="italic">hemiolios</hi> is a number which contains in itself some other whole number and its half, as three compared with two, fifteen with ten, thirty with twenty; <hi rend="italic">epitritos</hi> is a number which contains another whole number and its third part, as four compared with three, twelve with nine, forty with thirty.

<p>The reply of a certain philosopher, when he was asked why he turned pale in a storm at sea.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>WE were sailing from Cassiopa

<note>A town in the north-eastern part of Corcyra, also called Cassiope.</note>
to Brundisium over the Ionian sea, violent, vast and storm-tossed. During almost the whole of the night which followed our first day a fierce side-wind blew, which had filled our ship with water. Then afterwards, while we were all still lamenting, and working hard at the pumps, day at last dawned. But there was no less danger and no slackening of the violence of the wind; on the contrary, more frequent whirlwinds, a black sky, masses of fog, and a kind of fearful cloud-forms, which they called <hi rend="italic">typhones,</hi>

<note>Typhon, according to Hesiod, was a son of Typhoeus (see note on xvii. 10. 9) and father of the winds; but by later poets he was identified with Typhos or Typhoeus. His name was given to the violent storms called typhoons.</note>
or <quote>typhoons,</quote> seemed to hang over and threaten us, ready to overwhelm the ship.</p>

<p>In our company was an eminent philosopher of the Stoic sect, whom I had known at Athens as a man of no slight importance, holding the young men who were his pupils under very good control. In the midst of the great dangers of that time and that tumult of sea and sky I looked for him, desiring to know in what state of mind he was and whether he was unterrified and courageous. And then I beheld  <pb n="v3.p.351"/>  the man frightened and ghastly pale, not indeed uttering any lamentations, as all the rest were doing, nor any outcries of that kind, but in his loss of colour and distracted expression not differing much from the others. But when the sky cleared, the sea grew calm, and the heat of danger cooled, then the Stoic was approached by a rich Greek from Asia, a man of elegant apparel, as we saw, and with an abundance of baggage and many attendants, while he himself showed signs of a luxurious person and disposition. This man, in a bantering tone, said: <quote>What does this mean, Sir philosopher, that when we were in danger you were afraid and turned pale, while I neither feared nor changed colour?</quote> And the philosopher, after hesitating for a moment about the propriety of answering him, said: <quote>If in such a terrible storm I did show a little fear, you are not worthy to be told the reason for it. But, if you please, the famous Aristippus, the pupil of Socrates, shall answer for me,

<note><hi rend="italic">Frag. Phil. Graec.</hi> ii. 407. 16.</note>
who on being asked on a similar occasion by a man much like you why he feared, though a philosopher, while his questioner on the contrary had no fear, replied that they had not the same motives, for his questioner need not be very anxious about the life of a worthless coxcomb, but he himself feared for the life of an Aristippus.</quote></p>

<p>With these words then the Stoic rid himself of the rich Asiatic. But later, when we were approaching Brundisium and sea and sky were calm, I asked him what the reason for his fear was, which he had refused to reveal to the man who had improperly addressed him. And he quietly and courteously replied: <quote>Since you are desirous of knowing, hear  <pb n="v3.p.353"/>  what our forefathers, the founders of the Stoic sect, thought about that brief but inevitable and natural fear, or rather,</quote> said he, <quote>read it, for if you read it, you will be the more ready to believe it and you will remember it better.</quote> Thereupon before my eyes he drew from his little bag the fifth book of the <hi rend="italic">Discourses</hi> of the philosopher Epictetus, which, as arranged by Arrian, undoubtedly agree with the writings of Zeno and Chrysippus.</p>

<p>In that book I read this statement, which of course was written in Greek

<note>Frag. 9, p. 408, Schenkl., <hi rend="italic">L.C.L.</hi> II. 448 ff.</note>
: <quote>The mental visions, which the philosophers call <foreign xml:lang="grc">fantasi/ai</foreign> or 'phantasies,' by which the mind of man on the very first appearance of an object is impelled to the perception of the object, are neither voluntary nor controlled by the will, but through a certain power of their own they force their recognition upon men; but the expressions of assent, which they call <foreign xml:lang="grc">sugkataqe/seis,</foreign> by which these visions are recognized, are voluntary and subject to man's will. Therefore when some terrifying sound, either from heaven or from a falling building or as a sudden announcement of some danger, or anything else of that kind occurs, even the mind of a wise man must necessarily be disturbed, must shrink and feel alarm, not from a preconceived idea of any danger, but from certain swift and unexpected attacks which forestall the power of the mind and of reason. Presently, however, the wise man does not approve ' such phantasies,' that is to say, such terrifying mental visions (to quote the Greek, 'he does not consent to them nor confirm them'), but he rejects and scorns them, nor does he see in them anything that ought to excite fear. And they say that there is this difference between  <pb n="v3.p.355"/>  the mind of a foolish man and that of a wise man, that the foolish man thinks that such ' visions ' are in fact as dreadful and terrifying as they appear at the original impact of them on his mind, and by his assent he approves of such ideas as if they were rightly to be feared, and 'confirms' them; for <foreign xml:lang="grc">prosepidoca/zei</foreign> is the word which the Stoics use in their discourses on the subject. But the wise man, after being affected for a short time and slightly in his colour and expression, 'does not assent,' but retains the steadfastness and strength of the opinion which he has always had about visions of this kind, namely that they are in no wise to be feared but excite terror by a false appearance and vain alarms.</quote></p>

<p>That these were the opinions and utterances of Epictetus the philosopher in accordance with the beliefs of the Stoics I read in that book which I have mentioned, and I thought that they ought to be recorded for this reason, that when things of the kind which I have named chance to occur, we may not think that to fear for a time and, as it were, turn white is the mark of a foolish and weak man, but in that brief but natural impulse we yield rather to human weakness than because we believe that those things are what they seem.</p>  </div>

<p>That of the five senses of the body two in particular we share with beasts; and that pleasure which comes from hearing, sight and smell is base and reprehensible, but that which comes from taste and touch is the most shameful of all, since the last two are felt also by beasts, the others only by mankind.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>MEN have five senses, which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ai)sqh/seis,</foreign> by which mental or bodily pleasure is  <pb n="v3.p.357"/>  evidently sought: taste, touch, smell, sight, hearing. From all of these the enjoyment of any immoderate pleasure is regarded as base and reprehensible. But excessive pleasure from taste or touch in the opinion of philosophers is the basest of all things, and those in particular who have given themselves up to those two animal pleasures the Greeks call by terms of the gravest reproach either <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)kratei=s</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)ko/lastoi</foreign>; we call them either <hi rend="italic">incontinences</hi> (incontinent) or <hi rend="italic">intemperantes</hi> (intemperate); for if you should desire to have a closer translation of <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)ko/lastoi,</foreign> the equivalent will be too unusual. But those two pleasures of taste and touch, namely, gluttony and venery, are the only ones common to man with the lower animals, and therefore whoever is enslaved to these beastly pleasures is regarded as in the number of brutes and beasts; the remaining pleasures proceeding from the other three senses seem to be peculiar to man alone.</p>

<p>I have added the words of Aristotle the philosopher on this subject,

<note><hi rend="italic">Problemata,</hi> xxviii. 7.</note>
in order that the authority of that renowned and illustrious man might turn us from such shameful pleasures: <quote>Why are they called incontinent who indulge to excess in the pleasures of taste and touch? For both those who are immoderate in venery and those who are immoderate in the enjoyment of food are such. But of the latter, some find this gratification in the tongue and others in the throat, and it was for that reason that Philoxenos prayed to have the throat of a crane. Is it because the pleasures derived from such sources are common to us with the other animals? And being thus common they are the most dishonourable and more than the other pleasures, or alone, objects of  <pb n="v3.p.359"/>  reproach, so that we censure a man who is addicted to them and call him incontinent and incorrigible because he is enslaved to the meanest of pleasures. Now, there being five senses, the other animals are gratified by the two which have been mentioned only, but from the others they either enjoy no pleasure at all, or they merely experience it incidentally.</quote> Who, then, having any human modesty, would take pleasure in those two delights of venery and gluttony, which are common to man with the hog and the ass? Socrates indeed used to say that many men wish to live in order to eat and drink, but that he ate and drank in order to live. Hippocrates, moreover, a man of divine wisdom, believed of venery that it was a part of the horrible disease which our countrymen call <hi rend="italic">comitialis,</hi> or <quote>the election disease</quote>;

<p>FAVORINUS the philosopher used to say that it was more shameful to be praised faintly and coldly than to be censured violently and severely: <quote>For,</quote> said he, <quote>the man who reviles and censures you is regarded as unjust and hostile towards you in proportion to the bitterness of his invective, and therefore he is usually not believed.

<p>Why the bowels are loosened by sudden terror; also why fire provokes urine.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>THERE is a work of Aristotle, entitled <hi rend="italic">Physical Questions,</hi> which is most delightful, and filled with choice knowledge of all kinds. In this book he inquires

<note>xxvii. 10; vii. 3.</note>
why it happens that those who are seized with sudden fear of some great catastrophe commonly suffer at once from looseness of the bowels. He also inquires why it happens that one who has stood for some time before a fire is overtaken with a desire to make water. And he says that the cause of the loosening and discharge of the bowels because of fear is due to the fact that all terror is cold producing, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">yuxropoio/s,</foreign> as he calls it, and that by the effect of that cold it drives and expels all the blood and heat from the surface of the skin and at the same time causes those who fear to grow pale, because the blood leaves the face. <quote>Now this blood and heat,</quote> he says, <quote>being driven inwards, usually moves the bowels and stimulates them.</quote> For the frequent urinating caused by nearness to a fire he gave this reason: <quote>The fire dissolves the solid matter, as the sun does snow.</quote></p>  </div>

<p>A statement from the works of Aristotle, that snow-water is a very bad thing to drink; and that ice is formed from snow.

<note>This is not what Aristotle said, but that water formed from ice was unwholesome, see § 5 and 9. See crit. note 1, p. 362.</note>
</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>IN the hottest season of the year with some companions and friends of mine who were students of  <pb n="v3.p.363"/>  eloquence or of philosophy, I had withdrawn to the country-place of a rich friend at Tibur. There was with us a good man of the Peripatetic school, well trained and especially devoted to Aristotle. When we drank a good deal of water made of melted snow, he tried to restrain us and rather severely scolded us. He cited us the authority of famous physicians and in particular of the philosopher Aristotle, a man skilled in all human knowledge, who declared that snow-water was indeed helpful to grain and trees, but was a very unwholesome drink for human beings, and that it gradually produced wasting diseases in the body, which made their appearance only after a long time.</p>

<p>This counsel he gave us repeatedly in a spirit of prudence and goodwill. But when the drinking of snow-water went on without interruption, from the library of Tibur, which at that time was in the temple of Hercules and was well supplied with books, he drew out a volume of Aristotle and brought it to us, saying: <quote>At least believe the words of this wisest of men and cease to ruin your health.</quote></p>

<p>In that book it was written

<note>Frag. 214, Rose.</note>
that water from snow was very bad to drink, as was also that water which was more solidly and completely congealed, which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">kru/stallos,</foreign> or <quote>clear ice</quote>; and the following reason was there given for this: <quote>That when water is hardened by the cold air and congeals, it necessarily follows that evaporation takes place and that a kind of very thin vapour, so to speak, is forced from it and comes out of it. But its lightest part,</quote> he said, <quote>is that which is evaporated; what remains is heavier and less clean and wholesome,  <pb n="v3.p.365"/>  and this part, beaten upon by the throbbing of the air, takes on the form and colour of white foam. But that some more wholesome part is forced out and evaporated from the snow is shown by the fact that it becomes less than it was before it congealed.</quote></p>

<p>I have taken a few of Aristotle's own words from that book, and I quote them: <quote>Why is the water made from snow or ice unwholesome? Because from all water that is frozen the lightest and thinnest part evaporates. And the proof of this is that when it melts after being frozen, its volume is less than before. But since the most wholesome part is gone, it necessarily follows that what is left is less wholesome.</quote> After I read this, we decided to pay honour to the learned Aristotle. And so I for my part immediately declared war upon snow and swore hatred against it,1 while the others made truces with it on various terms.</p>  </div>

<p>That shame drives the blood outward, while fear checks it.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>IN the <hi rend="italic">Problems</hi> of the philosopher Aristotle is the following passage:

<note>Frag. 243, Rose.</note>
<quote>Why do men who are ashamed turn red and those who fear grow pale; although these emotions are similar? Because the blood of those who feel shame flows from the heart to all parts of the body, and therefore comes to the surface; but the blood of those who fear rushes to the heart, and consequently leaves all the other parts of the body.</quote></p>

<p>When I had read this at Athens with our friend  <pb n="v3.p.367"/>  Taurus and had asked him what he thought about that reason which had been assigned, he answered: <quote>He has told us properly and truly what happens when the blood is diffused or concentrated, but he has not told us why this takes place. For the question may still be asked why it is that shame diffuses the blood and fear contracts it, when shame is a kind of fear and is defined by the philosophers as 'the fear of just censure.'

<p>THE poet Julius Paulus, a worthy man, very learned in early history and letters, inherited a small estate in the Vatican district. He often invited us there to visit him and entertained us very pleasantly and generously with vegetables and fruits. And so one mild day in autumn, when Julius Celsinus and I had dined with him, and after hearing the <hi rend="italic">Alcestis</hi> of Laevius read at his table were returning to the city just before sunset, we were ruminating on the rhetorical figures and the new or striking use of words in that poem of Laevius', and as each word occurred that was worthy of notice with reference to its future use by ourselves,

<note>This is characteristic of the archaistic period in which Gellius lived.</note>
we committed it to memory.</p>

<p>Now the passages which then came to mind were of this sort:

<note>Frag. 8, Bahrens.</note>

We also observed

<note>Frag. 9, Bährens.</note>
that he spoke of an extinct race as <hi rend="italic">oblittera</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">oblitterata,</hi> and that he characterized enemies who broke treaties as <hi rend="italic">foedifragi,</hi> not <hi rend="italic">foederifragi;</hi> that he called the blushing Aurora <hi rend="italic">pudoricolor,</hi> or <quote>shame-coloured</quote> and Memnon, <hi rend="italic">nocticolor,</hi> or <quote>night-coloured</quote>; also that he used <hi rend="italic">forte</hi> for <quote>hesitatingly,</quote> and said <hi rend="italic">silenta loca,</hi> or <quote>silent places,</quote> from the verb <hi rend="italic">sileo;</hi> further, that he used <hi rend="italic">pulverulenta</hi> for <quote>dusty</quote> and <hi rend="italic">pestilenta</hi> for <quote>pestilent,</quote> the genitive case instead of the ablative with <hi rend="italic">careo; magno impete,</hi> or <quote>mighty onset,</quote> instead of <hi rend="italic">impetu;</hi> that he used <hi rend="italic">fortescere</hi> for <hi rend="italic">fortem fieri,</hi> or <quote>become brave,</quote> <hi rend="italic">dolentia</hi> for <hi rend="italic">dolor,</hi> or <quote>sorrow,</quote> <hi rend="italic">avens</hi> for <hi rend="italic">libens,</hi> or <quote>desirous</quote>; that he spoke of <hi rend="italic">curae intolerantes,</hi> or <quote>unendurable cares,</quote> instead of <hi rend="italic">intolerandae, manciolae tenellae,</hi> or <quote>tender hands,</quote> instead of <hi rend="italic">manus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">quis tam siliceo</hi> for <quote>who is of so flinty a heart?</quote> He also says <hi rend="italic">fiere inpendio infit,</hi> meaning<hi rend="italic">fieri inpense incipit,</hi> or <quote>the expense begins to be great,</quote> and he used <hi rend="italic">accipetret</hi>

<p>We entertained ourselves on our way with these notes on Laevius' diction.

<p>An inquiry whether <hi rend="italic">harena, caelum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">triticum</hi> are found in the plural; also whether <hi rend="italic">quadrigae, inimicitiae,</hi> and some other words, occur in the singular.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>WHEN I was a young man at Rome, before I went to Athens, I often paid a visit to Cornelius Fronto, when I had leisure from my masters and my lectures, and enjoyed his refined conversations, which abounded besides in excellent information. Whenever I saw him and heard him speak, I almost never failed to come away improved and better informed. An example is the following little talk of his, held one day on a trivial subject, it is true, but yet not without importance for the study of the Latin language. For when an intimate friend of his, a learned man and an eminent poet of the day, said that he had been cured of dropsy by the use of hot sand (<hi rend="italic">calentes harenae</hi>), thereupon Fronto in jesting fashion said: "You are indeed freed of your complaint, but not of the complaint of improper language. For Gaius Caesar, the famous life-dictator and father-in-law of Gnaeus Pompeius, from whom the family and the name of the Caesars are derived, a man of wonderful talent, surpassing all others of his time in the purity of his diction, in the work <hi rend="italic">On Analogy,</hi> which he dedicated to Marcus Cicero, wrote

<note>ii. p. 126, Dinter.</note>
that <hi rend="italic">harenae</hi> is an improper term, since <hi rend="italic">harena</hi> ought never to be  <pb n="v3.p.373"/>  used in the plural,

<note><hi rend="italic">Harenae</hi> is used by Virgil, Horace, and Ovid (<hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> Hor. <hi rend="italic">Odes,</hi> i. 28. 1; iii. 4. 31; Virg. <hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> i. 107); also by Seneca the philosopher Tacitus, Suetonius (<hi rend="italic">Aug.</hi> lxxx.) and other post-Augustan prose-writers and poets.</note>
any more than <hi rend="italic">caelum</hi> (heaven) and <hi rend="italic">triticum</hi> (wheat). But on the other hand he thinks that <hi rend="italic">quadrigae,</hi> even though it be a single chariot, that is, one team of four horses yoked together, ought always to be used in the plural number, like <hi rend="italic">arma</hi> (arms), <hi rend="italic">moenia</hi> (walls), <hi rend="italic">comitia</hi> (election) and <hi rend="italic">inimicitiae</hi> (hostility)—unless, my finest of poets, you have anything to say in reply, to excuse yourself and show that you have not made an error."</p>

<p><quote>With regard to <hi rend="italic">caelum,</hi></quote> said the poet, <quote>and <hi rend="italic">triticum</hi> I do not deny that they ought always to be used in the singular, nor with regard to <hi rend="italic">arma, moenia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">comitia,</hi> that their use ought to be confined to the plural; but we will inquire rather about <hi rend="italic">inimicitiae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">quadigae.</hi> And perhaps in the case of <hi rend="italic">quadrigae</hi> I shall yield to the authority of the early writers: but what reason is there why Caesar should think that <hi rend="italic">inimicitia</hi> was not used by the ancients, as were <hi rend="italic">inscientia</hi> (ignorance) and <hi rend="italic">impotentia</hi> (impotence) and <hi rend="italic">iniuria</hi> (injury), and ought not to be used by us, when Plautus, that glory of the Latin tongue, even used <hi rend="italic">delicia</hi> in the singular number instead of <hi rend="italic">deliciae?</hi> For he says:

<note><hi rend="italic">Poen.</hi> 365.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>O my delight, my darling (<hi rend="italic">delicia</hi>).</l></quote>  Furthermore Quintus Ennius, in that most famous book of his, said:

<note><hi rend="italic">Achilles,</hi> 12, p. 120, Vahlen<hi rend="sup">2</hi>.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Such is my habit; plain upon my brow</l> <l>Friendship I bear and enmity (<hi rend="italic">inmicitiam</hi>) to see.</l></quote>  <pb n="v3.p.375"/>  But pray, who else has written or said that <hi rend="italic">harenae</hi> is not good Latin? And therefore I beg of you, if Gaius Caesar's book is accessible, that you have it brought, in order that you may judge with how much confidence he makes this statement.</quote></p>

<p>At the time, the first book <hi rend="italic">On Analogy</hi> being brought, I committed to memory these few words from it; for, first asserting that neither <hi rend="italic">caelum, triticum,</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">harena</hi> admitted a plural meaning, Caesar said: <quote>Do you not think that it happens from the nature of these things that we say ' one land' and 'several lands,' 'city' and 'cities,' 'command' and 'commands,' and that we cannot convert <hi rend="italic">quadrigae</hi> into the form of a singular noun or <hi rend="italic">harena</hi> into a plural?</quote></p>

<p>When these words had been read, Fronto said to the poet: <quote>Does it not seem to you that Gaius Caesar has decided against you as to the status of this word with sufficient clearness and force?</quote> Thereupon the poet, greatly impressed by the authority of the book, said: <quote><hi rend="italic">If</hi> it were lawful to appeal from Caesar, I would now appeal from this book of his. But since he has neglected to give the reason for his opinion, I now ask you to tell on what ground you think it an error to say <hi rend="italic">quadriga</hi> and <hi rend="italic">harenae.</hi></quote> Then Fronto replied as follows: <quote><hi rend="italic">Quadrigae</hi> is always confined to the plural number, even though there be only one horse, since four horses yoked together are called <hi rend="italic">quadrigae,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">quadriugae,</hi> and certainly a term which designates many horses ought not to be included under the oneness expressed by the singular number. The same reasoning must be applied to <hi rend="italic">harena,</hi> but in a different form; for since <hi rend="italic">harena,</hi> though used in the singular number, <pb n="v3.p.377"/> nevertheless indicates the multiplicity and abundance of the minute parts of which it consists, <hi rend="italic">harenae</hi> seems to be an ignorant and improper usage, as if the word needed a plural form,. when its collective nature makes it natural for it to be used in the singular. But,</quote> said he, <quote>I have said this, not in order to give my authority and signature to this opinion and rule, but that I might not leave the view of that learned man, Caesar, unsupported. For while <hi rend="italic">caelum,</hi> or 'sky,' is always used in the singular, but <hi rend="italic">mare,</hi> or 'sea,' and <hi rend="italic">terra,</hi> or 'land,' not always, and <hi rend="italic">pulvis,</hi> or 'dust,' <hi rend="italic">ventus,</hi> or 'wind,' and <hi rend="italic">fumus,</hi> or 'smoke,' not always, why did the early writers sometimes use <hi rend="italic">indutiae,</hi> or 'truce,' and <hi rend="italic">caerimoniae,</hi> or 'ceremony,' in the singular, but never <hi rend="italic">feriae,</hi> or 'holiday,' <hi rend="italic">nundinae,</hi> or 'market day,' <hi rend="italic">inferiae,</hi> or 'offering to the dead,' and <hi rend="italic">exsequiae,</hi> or ' obsequies'? Why may <hi rend="italic">mel,</hi> or 'honey,' and <hi rend="italic">vinum,</hi> or 'wine,' and other words of that kind, be used in the plural, but not <hi rend="italic">lacte</hi> (milk)?

<note>The classical form is, of course, <hi rend="italic">lac. Lacte</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lact</hi> occur in early Latin, and the use of <hi rend="italic">lacte</hi> here is an archaism, which was not understood by some of the scribes; see crit. note 2.</note>
All these questions, I say, cannot be investigated, unravelled, and thrashed out by men of affairs in so busy a city; indeed, I see that you have been delayed even by these matters of which I have spoken, being intent, I suppose, on some business. So go now and inquire, when you chance to have leisure, whether any orator or poet, provided he be of that earlier band—that is to say, any classical or authoritative writer, not one of the common herd—has used <hi rend="italic">quadriga</hi> or <hi rend="italic">harenae.</hi></quote> Now Fronto asked us to look up these words, I think, not because he thought that they were to be found in any books of the early writers, but to rouse in us an interest in reading for the purpose of hunting down rare words. The one, then, which  <pb n="v3.p.379"/>  seemed the rarest, <hi rend="italic">quadriga,</hi> I found used in the singular number in that book of Marcus Varro's <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi> which is entitled <hi rend="italic">Ecdemeticus.</hi> But I sought with less interest for an example of the plural <hi rend="italic">harenae,</hi> because, except Gaius Caesar, no one among learned men has used that form, so far as I can recall.

<note>The plural is used by Ovid, Virgil, and Horace; and by later poets and prose-writers; <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> Suetonius, <hi rend="italic">Aug.</hi> lxxx. (i., p. 246, <hi rend="italic">L.C.L.</hi>).</note>

<p>The very neat reply of Antonius Julianus to certain Greeks at a banquet.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>A YOUNG man of equestrian rank from the land of Asia, gifted by nature, well off in manners and fortune, with a taste and talent for music, was celebrating the anniversary of the day on which he began life by giving a dinner to his friends and teachers in a little country place near the city. There had come with us then to that dinner the rhetorician Antonius Julianus, a public teacher of young men, who spoke in the Spanish manner,

<note>Cf. facundia rabida iurgiosaque, § 7.</note>
but was very eloquent, besides being well acquainted with our early literature. When there was an end of eating and drinking, and the time came for conversation, Julianus asked that the singers and lyre-players be produced, the most skilful of both sexes, whom he knew that the young man had at hand. And when the boys and girls were brought in, they sang in a most charming way several odes of Anacreon and Sappho, as well as some erotic elegies of more recent poets that were sweet and graceful. But we were especially pleased with some delightful verses of Anacreon, written in his old age,

<note><hi rend="italic">Poetae Lyrici Graeci,</hi> iii., p. 298, Bergk<hi rend="sup">4</hi>.</note>
which I noted down, in order that sometimes the toil and worry of this task of mine might find relief in the sweetness of poetical compositions:</p>  <pb n="v3.p.381"/>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Shaping the silver, Hephaestus,</l> <l>Make me no panoply, pray;</l> <l>What do I care for war's combats?</l> <l>Make me a drinking cup rather,</l> <l>Deep as you ever can make it;</l> <l>Carve on it no stars and no wains;</l> <l>What care I, pray, for the Pleiads,</l> <l>What for the star of Bootes?</l> <l>Make vines, and clusters upon them,</l> <l>Treading them Love and Bathyllus,</l> <l>Made of pure gold, with Lyaeus.</l></quote>

<p>Then several Greeks who were present at that dinner, men of refinement and not without considerable acquaintance also with our literature, began to attack and assail Julianus the rhetorician as altogether barbarous and rustic, since he was sprung from the land of Spain, was a mere ranter of violent and noisy speech, and taught exercises in a tongue which had no charm and no sweetness of Venus and the Muse; and they asked him more than once what he thought of Anacreon and the other poets of that kind, and whether any of our bards had written such smooth-flowing and delightful poems; <quote>except,</quote> said they, <quote>perhaps a few of Catullus and also possibly a few of Calvus; for the compositions of Laevius were involved, those of Hortensius without elegance, of Cinna harsh, of Memmius rude, and in short those of all the poets without polish or melody.</quote></p>

<p>Then Julianus, filled with anger and indignation, spoke as follows in behalf of his mother tongue, as if for his altars and his fires: <quote>I must indeed grant you  <pb n="v3.p.383"/>  that in such licentiousness and baseness you would outdo Alcinus

<note>Probably (see crit. note) another form of Alcinous, King of the Phaeacians. He is not represented by Homer as <quote>licentious and base,</quote> but that opinion arose at a later time. Cf. Horace, <hi rend="italic">Epist.</hi> i. 2. 28 ff.</note>
and that as you outstrip us in the pleasures of adornment and of food, so you do also in the wantonness of your ditties. But lest you should condemn us, that is, the Latin race, as lacking in Aphrodite's charm, just as if we were barbarous and ignorant, allow me, I pray, to cover my head with my cloak (as they say Socrates did when making somewhat indelicate remarks), and hear and learn that our forefathers also were lovers and devoted to Venus before those poets whom you have named.</quote></p>

<p>Then lying upon his back with veiled head, he chanted in exceedingly sweet tones some verses of Valerius Aedituus, an early poet, and also of Porcius Licinus and Quintus Catulus; and I think that nothing can be found neater, more graceful, more polished and more terse than those verses, either in Greek or in Latin:</p>

<p>The verses of Aedituus are as follows:

<note>Frag. 1, Bährens.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>When, Pamphila, I try to tell my love,</l> <l>What shall I ask of you? Words fail my lips,</l> <l>A sudden sweat o'erflows my ardent

<note><hi rend="italic">Subidus</hi> occurs only here, and its meaning is not certain It seems to be connected with the verb <hi rend="italic">subo,</hi> <quote>burn with love,</quote> but some regard it as the opposite of <hi rend="italic">insubidus,</hi> <quote>foolish, stupid,</quote> in which case it might be translated <quote>conscious</quote> The alliteration and assonance in this epigram are noteworthy.</note>
breast;</l> <l>Thus fond and silent, I refrain and die.</l> <l>And he also added other verses of the same poet,</l> <l>no less sweet than the former ones:

<note>Frag. 2, Bährens.</note>
</l></quote>  <pb n="v3.p.385"/>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>O Phileros, why a torch, that we need not?</l> <l>Just as we are we'll go, our hearts aflame.</l> <l>That flame no wild wind's blast can ever quench,</l> <l>Or rain that falls torrential from the skies;</l> <l>Venus herself alone can quell her fire,</l> <l>No other force there is that has such power.</l></quote>  He also recited the following verses of Porcius Licinus:

<note>Frag. 5, Bährens.</note>
<quote rend="blockquote"> <l>O shepherds of the lambs, the ewes' young brood,</l> <l>Seek ye for fire? Come hither; man is fire.</l> <l>Touch I the wood with finger-tip, it burns;</l> <l>Your flock's a flame, all I behold is fire.</l></quote>  The verses of Quintus Catulus were these:

<note>Frag. 1, Bährens.</note>
</p>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>My soul has left me; it has fled, methinks,</l> <l>To Theotimus; he its refuge is.</l> <l>But what if I should beg that he refuse</l> <l>The truant to admit, but cast it out?</l> <l>I'll go to him; but what if I be caught?</l> <l>What shall I do?

<p>That the words <hi rend="italic">praeter propter,</hi> which are in common use, were found also in Ennius.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>I REMEMBER that I once went with Julius Celsinus the Numidian to visit Cornelius Fronto, who was then seriously ill with the gout. When we arrived and were admitted, we found him lying on a Greek  <pb n="v3.p.387"/>  couch, and sitting around him a large number of men famous for learning, birth or fortune. By his side stood several builders, who had been summoned to construct some new baths and were exhibiting different plans for baths, drawn on little pieces of parchment. When he had selected one plan and specimen of their work, he inquired what the expense would be of completing that entire project. And when the architect had said that it would probably require about three hundred thousand sesterces, one of Fronto's friends said, <quote>And another fifty thousand, more or less (<hi rend="italic">praeterpropter</hi>).</quote> Then Fronto, interrupting the conversation which he had begun to hold about the expense of the baths, and looking at the friend who had said that another fifty thousand would be needed <hi rend="italic">praeterpropter,</hi> asked him what that word meant. And the friend replied: <quote>'That word is not my own, for you may hear many men using it; but what the word means you must ask from a grammarian, not from me</quote>; and at the same time he pointed out a grammarian of no little fame as a teacher at Rome, who was sitting there with them. Then the grammarian, surprised by the uncertainty about a familiar and much used word, said: <quote>We inquire about something which does not at all deserve the honour of investigation, for this is some utterly plebeian expression or other, better known in the talk of mechanics than in that of cultivated men.</quote></p>

<p>But Fronto, raising his voice and with a more earnest expression, said: <quote>Sir, does this word seem to you so degraded and utterly faulty, when Marcus  <pb n="v3.p.389"/>  Cato

<note>Frag. inc. 53, Jordan.</note>
and Marcus Varro,

Consequently, he at once asked that the <hi rend="italic">Iphigenia</hi> of Quintus Ennius be brought and in a chorus of that tragedy we read these lines:

</l></quote>

<p>When this had been read there, then Fronto said to the grammarian, who was already wavering: <quote>Have you heard, most worthy master, that your Ennius used <hi rend="italic">praeterpropter,</hi> and that too in an expression of opinion resembling the austerest diatribes of the philosophers? We beg you then to tell us, since we are now investigating a word used by Ennius, what the hidden meaning is in this line:  <pb n="v3.p.391"/>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>Aimless we drift, we live but more or less.</l></quote></quote></p>

<p>And the grammarian, in a profuse sweat and blushing deeply, since many of the company were laughing long and loud at this, got up, saying as he left: <quote>I will tell you at a later time, when we are alone, Fronto, in order that ignorant folk may not hear and learn.</quote> And so we all rose, leaving the consideration of the word at that point.</p>  </div>

<p>He gives some amatory verses of Plato, with which the philosopher amused himself when he was a very young man and was contending for the tragic prize.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>HERE are two Greek verses that are famous and deemed worthy of remembrance by many learned men because of their charm and graceful terseness. There are in fact not a few ancient writers who declare that they are the work of the philosopher Plato, with which he amused himself in his youth, while at the same time he was beginning his literary career by writing tragedies.

<p>A discourse of Herodes Atticus on the power and nature of pain, and a confirmation of his view by the example of an ignorant countryman who cut down fruit-trees along with thorns.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>I ONCE heard Herodes Atticus, the ex-consul, holding forth at Athens in the Greek language, in which he far surpassed almost all the men of our time in distinction, fluency, and elegance of diction. He was speaking at the time against the <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)pa/qeia,</foreign> or <quote>lack of feeling</quote> of the Stoics, in consequence of having been assailed by one of that sect, who alleged that he did not endure the grief which he felt at the death of a beloved boy with sufficient  <pb n="v3.p.395"/>  wisdom and fortitude. The sense of the discourse, so far as I remember, was as follows: that no man, who felt and thought normally, could be wholly exempt and free from those emotions of the mind, which he called <foreign xml:lang="grc">pa/qh,</foreign> caused by sorrow, desire, fear, anger and pleasure; and even if he could so resist them as to be free from them altogether, he would not be better off, since his mind would grow weak and sluggish, being deprived of the support of certain emotions, as of a highly necessary stimulus. For he declared that those feelings and impulses of the mind, though they become faults when excessive, are connected and involved in certain powers and activities of the intellect; and therefore, if we should in our ignorance eradicate them altogether, there would be danger lest we lose also the good and useful qualities of the mind which are connected with them. Therefore he thought that they ought to be regulated, and pruned skilfully and carefully, so that those only should be removed which are unsuitable and unnatural, lest in fact that should happen which once (according to the story) befell an ignorant and rude Thracian in cultivating a field which he had bought.</p>

<p><quote>When a man of Thrace,</quote> said he, <quote>from a remote and barbarous land, and unskilled in agriculture, had moved into a more civilized country, in order to lead a less wild life, he bought a farm planted with olives and vines. Knowing nothing at all about the care of vines or trees, he chanced to see a neighbour cutting down the thorns which had sprung up high and wide, pruning his ash-trees almost to  <pb n="v3.p.397"/>  their tops, pulling up the suckers of his vines which had spread over the earth from the main roots, and cutting off the tall straight shoots on his fruit and olive trees. He drew near and asked why the other was making such havoc of his wood and leaves. The neighbour answered; 'In order to make the field clean and neat and the trees and vines more productive.' The Thracian left his neighbour with thanks, rejoicing that he had gained some knowledge of farming. Then he took his sickle and axe; and thereupon in his pitiful ignorance the fellow cuts down all his vines and olives, lopping off the richest branches of the trees and the most fruitful shoots of the vines, and, with the idea of clearing up his place, he pulls up all the shrubs and shoots fit for bearing fruits and crops, along with the brambles and thorns, having learnt assurance at a ruinous price and acquired boldness in error through faulty imitation. Thus it is,</quote> said Herodes, <quote>that those disciples of insensibility, wishing to be thought calm, courageous and steadfast because of showing neither desire nor grief, neither wrath nor joy, root out all the more vigorous emotions of the mind, and grow old in the torpor of a sluggish and, as it were, nerveless life.</quote></p>  </div>

<p>That what we call <hi rend="italic">pumiliones</hi> the Greeks term <foreign xml:lang="grc">na/noi.</foreign></p><!--</argument>-->

<p>CORNELIUS FRONTO, Festus Postumius, and Sulpicius Apollinaris chanced to be standing and talking together in the vestibule of the Palace;

<note>The palace of the Caesars on the Palatine Hill at Rome.</note>
and I, being near by with some companions, eagerly  <pb n="v3.p.399"/>  listened to their conversations on literary subjects. Then said Fronto to Apollinaris: <quote>I pray you, Sir, inform me whether I was right in forbearing to call men of excessively small stature <hi rend="italic">nam</hi> and in preferring the term <hi rend="italic">pumiliones;</hi> for I remembered that the latter word appears in the books of early writers, while I thought that <hi rend="italic">nam</hi> was vulgar and barbarous.</quote> <quote>It is true,</quote> replied Apollinaris, that the word <hi rend="italic">nam</hi> is frequent in the language of the ignorant vulgar; yet it is not barbarous, but is thought to be of Greek origin; for the Greeks called men of short and low stature, rising but little above the ground, <foreign xml:lang="grc">na/noi,</foreign> or 'dwarfs,' using that word by the application of a certain etymological principle corresponding with its meaning,

<note>That is, a short word for short people. The derivation of <foreign xml:lang="grc">na/nos,</foreign> from which <hi rend="italic">nam</hi> comes, is uncertain. <hi rend="italic">Pumilio</hi> is connected by some with <foreign xml:lang="grc">pugmali/wn.</foreign> = <foreign xml:lang="grc">pugmai=os,</foreign> <quote>thumbing</quote>; cf. Lat. <hi rend="italic">pugnus: by</hi> others with <hi rend="italic">peter</hi> and <hi rend="italic">probes.</hi></note>
and if my memory is not at fault,<quote>said he,</quote>it occurs in the comedy of Aristophanes entitled <foreign xml:lang="grc">(Olka/des,</foreign>

<p>"But this word would have been given citizenship by you, or established in a Latin colony, if you had deigned to use it, and it would be very much more acceptable than the low and vulgar words which Laberius introduced into the Latin language."

<note>See xvi. 7.</note>
Thereupon Postumius Festus said to a Latin grammarian, a friend of Fronto's: <quote>Apollinaris has told us that <hi rend="italic">nam</hi> is a Greek word; do you inform us whether it is good Latin, when it is used, as it commonly is, of small mules or ponies, and in what author it is found.</quote> And that grammarian, a man very well versed in knowledge of the early literature, said: <quote>If I am not committing sacrilege in giving  <pb n="v3.p.401"/>  my opinion of any Greek or Latin word in the presence of Apollinaris, I venture to reply to your inquiry, Festus, that the word is Latin and is found in the poems of Helvius Cinna, a poet neither obscure nor without learning</quote> And he gave the verses themselves,

<p>That Marcus Varro and Publius Nigidius, the most learned Romans of their time, were contemporaries of Caesar and Cicero, and that the commentaries of Nigidius, because of their obscurity and subtlety, did not become popular.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>THE time of Marcus Cicero and Gaius Caesar had few men of surpassing eloquence, but in encyclopaedic learning and in the varied sciences by which humanity is enobled it possesses two towering figures in Marcus Varro and Publius Nigidius. Now the records of knowledge and learning left in written form by Varro are familiar and in general use, the observations of Nigidius, however, are not so widely known, but their obscurity and subtlety have caused them to be neglected, as of little practical value. As a specimen I may cite what I read a short time ago in his work entitled <hi rend="italic">Grammatical Notes;</hi> from this book I have made a few extracts, as an example of the nature of his writings. When discussing the nature and order of the letters

<note>Properly <quote>sounds.</quote></note>
which the grammarians call <hi rend="italic">vocales,</hi> or  <pb n="v3.p.403"/>  <quote>vowels,</quote> he wrote the following, which I leave unexplained, in order to test my readers' powers of application:

<note>Frag. 53, Swoboda.</note>
<quote><hi rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi rend="italic">o,</hi></quote> he says, <quote>always stand first in diphthongs, <hi rend="italic">i</hi> and <hi rend="italic">u</hi> always second, <hi rend="italic">e</hi> both follows and precedes; it precedes in <hi rend="italic">Euripus,</hi> follows in <hi rend="italic">Aemilius.</hi> If anyone supposes that <hi rend="italic">u</hi> precedes in the words <hi rend="italic">Valeriuis, Vannonis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Volusius,</hi> or that <hi rend="italic">i</hi> precedes in <hi rend="italic">iampridem</hi> (long ago), <hi rend="italic">iecur</hi> (liver), <hi rend="italic">iocis</hi> (joke), and <hi rend="italic">iucundus</hi> (agreeable), he will be wrong, for when these letters precede, they are in fact not vowels.</quote>

<note>They are semi-vowels.</note>
These words also are from the same book:

<note>Frag. 54, Swoboda.</note>
<quote>Between the letters <hi rend="italic">n</hi> and g another element is introduced, as in the words <hi rend="italic">aguis</hi> (snake), <hi rend="italic">angari,</hi>

<hi rend="italic">ancora</hi> (anchor), <hi rend="italic">increpat</hi> (chides), <hi rend="italic">incurrit</hi> (runs upon), and <hi rend="italic">ingenuus</hi> (free-born). In all these we have, not a true <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> but a so-called <hi rend="italic">n adullerinum.</hi>

<note>Since the sound of <hi rend="italic">v</hi> was that of French <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> German <hi rend="italic">ü,</hi> the Greeks were compelled to use <hi rend="italic">ou</hi> for the long <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> In Latin the genuine diphthong <hi rend="italic">ei</hi> had changed to <hi rend="italic">ī</hi> before the period of our earliest records; an example is <hi rend="italic">dīco</hi> for <hi rend="italic">deico</hi> (cf. <foreign xml:lang="grc">dei/knumi</foreign>).

<p>A discussion of the jurist Sextus Caecilius and the philosopher Favorinus about the laws of the <hi rend="italic">Twelve Tables.</hi></p><!--</argument>-->

<p>SEXTUS CAECILIUS was famed for his knowledge, experience and authority in the science of jurisprudence and in understanding and interpreting the laws of the Roman people. It happened that as we were waiting to pay our respects to Caesar,

<note>That is, Antoninus Pius.</note>
the philosopher Favorinus met and accosted Caecilius in the Palatine square

<note>The <hi rend="italic">Area Palatina</hi> was originally the space bounded on the west by the <hi rend="italic">Domus Tiberiana,</hi> or Palace of Tiberius, and the <hi rend="italic">Domus Augustana;</hi> as time went on, it must have been bounded and restricted by other parts of the Imperial Palace.</note>
in my presence and that of several others. In the conversation which they carried on at the time mention was made of the laws of the decemvirs, which the board of ten appointed by the people for that purpose wrote and inscribed upon twelve tablets.

<note>These laws were set up in the Forum on ten tablets of bronze in 451 B.C., to which two more tablets were added in 450.</note>
</p>

<p>When Sextus Caecilius, who had examined and studied the laws of many cities, said that they were drawn up in the most choice and concise terms, Favorinus rejoined: <quote>It may be as you say in the greater part of those laws; for I read your twelve tables with as eager interest as I did the twelve books of Plato <hi rend="italic">On the Laws.</hi> But some of them seem to me to be either very obscure or very cruel, or on the other hand too mild and lenient, or by no means to be taken exactly as they are written.</quote></p>  <pb n="v3.p.409"/>

<p><quote>As for the obscurities,</quote> said Sextus Caecilius, <quote>let us not charge those to the fault of the makers of the laws, but to the ignorance of those who cannot follow their meaning, although they also who do not fully understand what is written may he excused. For long lapse of time has rendered old words and customs obsolete, and it is in the light of those words and customs that the sense of the laws is to be understood. As a matter of fact, the laws were compiled and written in the three hundredth year after the founding of Rome,

<note>The chronology of Nepos; see note on § 3, above, and on the chapter heading of xvii. 21.</note>
and from that time until to-day is clearly not less than six hundred years. But what can be looked upon as cruel in those laws? Unless you think a law is cruel which punishes with death a judge or arbiter appointed by law, who has been convicted of taking a bribe for rendering his decision,

<note>ix. 3.</note>
or which hands over a thief caught in the act to be the slave of the man from whom he stole,

<note>viii. 4.</note>
and makes it lawful to kill a robber who comes by night.

<note>viii. 12.</note>
Tell me, I pray, tell me, you deep student of philosophy, whether you think that the perfidy of a juror who sells his oath contrary to all laws, human and divine, or the intolerable audacity of an open theft, or the treacherous violence of a nocturnal footpad, does not deserve the penalty of death?</quote></p>

<p><quote>Don't ask me,</quote> said Favorinus, <quote>what I think. For you know that, according to the practice of the sect to which I belong,

<note>He probably refers to the Pyrronian sceptics, about whose beliefs he wrote a work in ten books; see xi. 5. 5.</note>
I am accustomed rather to inquire than to decide. But the Roman people is a judge neither insignificant nor contemptible, and  <pb n="v3.p.411"/>  while they thought that such crimes ought to be punished, they yet believed that punishments of that kind were too severe; for they have allowed the laws which prescribed such excessive penalties to die out from disuse and old age. Just so they considered it also an inhuman provision, that if a man has been summoned to court, and being disabled through illness or years is too weak to walk, 'a covered waggon he need not spread';

<note>That is, with a pallet for lying upon.</note>
but the man is carried out and placed upon a beast of burden and conveyed from his home to the praetor

<note>At that time one of the two chief magistrates, corresponding to the consuls of later times.</note>
in the comitium, as if he were a living corpse. For why should one who is a prey to illness, and unable to appear, be haled into court at the demand of his adversary, clinging to a draught animal? But as for my statement that some laws were excessively lenient, do not you yourself think that law too lax, which reads as follows with regard to the penalty for an injury:

<note>viii. 4.</note>
'If anyone has inflicted an injury upon another, let him be fined twenty-five asses'? For who will be found so poor that twenty-five asses would keep him from inflicting an injury if he desired to? And therefore your friend Labeo also, in the work which he wrote <hi rend="italic">On the Twelve Tables,</hi>

<note>Frag. 25, Hushke; 3, Bremer.</note>
expressing his disapproval of that law, says:

<note>There seems to be a lacuna in the text; see crit. note.</note>
One Lucius Veratius was an exceedingly wicked man and of cruel brutality. He used to amuse himself by striking free men in the face with his open hand. A slave followed him with a purse full of asses; as often as he had buffeted anyone, he ordered twenty-five asses to be counted out at once, according to the provision of the <hi rend="italic">Twelve Tables'</hi>  <pb n="v3.p.413"/>  Therefore,</quote> he continued, <quote>the praetors afterwards decided that this law was obsolete and invalid and declared that they would appoint arbiters to appraise damages. Again, some things in those laws obviously cannot, as 1 have said, even be carried out; for instance, the one referring to retaliation, which reads as follows, if my memory is correct: 'If one has broken another's limb, there shall be retaliation, unless a compromise be made.' Now not to mention the cruelty of the vengeance, the exaction even of a just retaliation is impossible. For if one whose limb has been broken by another wishes to retaliate by breaking a limb of has injurer, can he succeed, pray, in breaking the limb in exactly the same manner? In this case there first arises this insoluble difficulty. What about one who has broken another's limb unintentionally? For what has been done unintentionally ought to be retaliated unintentionally. For a chance blow and an intentional one do not fall under the same category of retaliation. How then will it be possible to imitate unintentional action, when in retaliating one has not the right of intention, but of unintention? But if he break it intentionally, the offender will certainly not allow himself to be injured more deeply or more severely; but by what weight and measure this can be avoided, I do not understand. Nay more, if retaliation is taken to a greater extent or differently, it will be a matter of absurd cruelty that a counter-action for retaliation should arise and an endless interchange of retaliation take place. But that enormity of cutting and dividing a man's body, if an individual is brought to trial for debt and adjudged to several creditors,

<note>The law reads: <hi rend="italic">fertiis nundinis partis secanto. Si plus minusve secuerunt, se fraude esto,</hi> <quote>on the third market day (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> after about two weeks; see note on § 49, below) let them cut him into pieces. If they have cut more or less (than their proper share), let it be without prejudice (to them).</quote></note>
I do not care to remember, and I am  <pb n="v3.p.415"/>  ashamed to mention it. For what can seem more savage, what more inconsistent with humanity, than for the limbs of a poor debtor to be barbarously butchered and sold, just as to-day his goods are divided and sold?</quote></p>

<p>Then Sextus Caecilius, throwing both arms about Favorinus, said: " You are indeed the one man within my memory who is most familiar both with Greek and with Roman lore. For what philosopher is skilled and learned in the laws of his sect to the extent to which you are thoroughly versed in our decemviral legislation? But yet, I pray you, depart for a little from that academic manner of arguing of yours, and laying aside the passion for attacking or defending anything whatever according to your inclination, consider more seriously what is the nature of the details which you have censured, and do not scorn those ancient laws merely because there are many of them which even the Roman people have now ceased to use. For you surely are not unaware that according to the manners of the times, the conditions of governments, considerations of immediate utility, and the vehemence of the vices which are to be remedied, the advantages and remedies offered by the laws

<note><hi rend="italic">Oportuitates</hi> refers to the advantage or assistance which the laws afford to meet the special needs of defence; <hi rend="italic">moedellas,</hi> to the remedies they furnish for the cure of vice and crime.</note>
are often changed and modified, and do not remain in the same condition; on the contrary, like the face of heaven and the sea, they vary according to the seasons of circumstances and of fortune. What seemed more salutary than that law of Stolo limiting the number of acres? What more expedient than the bill of Voconius regulating the inheritances of women? What was thought so necessary for checking the luxury of the citizens as the law of Licinius  <pb n="v3.p.417"/>  and Fannius and other sumptuary laws? Yet all these have been wiped out and buried by the wealth of the State, as if by the waves of a swelling sea. But why did that law appear to you inhumane which in my opinion is the most humane of all; that law, namely, which provides that a beast be furnished for a sick or aged man who is called into court? The words of that law, 'if he summon him to court,'

<note>The first provision of the law <hi rend="italic">is: Si in ius vocat, ito,</hi> <quote>if he summon him to court, let him go.</quote> Here the words <quote><hi rend="italic">Si . . . vocat</hi></quote> are used merely to designate the law.</note>
are as follows:

<note>i. 1, 3.</note>
If disease or age be a hindrance, let the summoner provide a beast; if he does not wish, he need not spread a covered waggon.' Do you by any chance suppose that <hi rend="italic">morhus</hi> (disease) here means a dangerous sickness with a high fever and ague, and that <hi rend="italic">iumentum</hi> (beast) means only one animal, capable of carrying someone on his back; and is it for that reason that you think it was inhumane for a man lying sick-a-bed at his home to be placed upon a beast and hurried off to court? That is by no means the case, my dear Favorinus. For <hi rend="italic">morbus</hi> in that law does not mean a serious complaint attended with fever, but some defect of weakness and indisposition, not involving danger to life. On the contrary, a more severe disorder, having the power of material injury, the writers of those laws call in another place,

<note>ii. 2.</note>
not morbus alone, but morbus sonticus, or 'a serious disease.'

<note>See xvi. 4. 4 and the note.</note>
<hi rend="italic">iumentum</hi> also does not have only the meaning which it has at present, but it might even mean a vehicle drawn by yoked animals; for our forefathers formed <hi rend="italic">iumentum</hi> from <hi rend="italic">iungo.</hi> Furthermore <hi rend="italic">arcera</hi> was the name for a waggon, enclosed and shut in on all sides like a great chest (<hi rend="italic">arca</hi>),

<note>The derivation of <hi rend="italic">arcera</hi> from <hi rend="italic">area</hi> seems to be generally accepted.</note>
and  <pb n="v3.p.419"/>  strewn with robes, and in it men who were too ill or old used to be carried lying down. What cruelty then does there seem to you to be in deciding that a waggon ought to be furnished for a poor or needy man who was called into court, if haply through lameness or some other mischance he was unable to walk; and in not requiring that ' a closed carriage' be luxuriously strewn,

<note>See note on § 11, above.</note>
when a conveyance of any kind was sufficient for the invalid? And they made that decision, in order that the excuse of a diseased body might not give perpetual immunity to those who neglected their obligations and put off suits at law; but foolishly."</p>

<p>"They assessed inflicted injuries at twenty-five asses. They did not, my dear Favorinus, by any means compensate all injuries by that trifling sum, although even that small number of asses meant a heavy weight of copper; for the as which the people then used weighed a pound. But more cruel injuries, such as breaking a bone, inflicted not only on freemen but even on slaves, they punished with a heavier fine,

<note>viii. 3.</note>
and for some injuries they even prescribed retaliation. This very law of retaliation, my dear sir, you criticized somewhat unfairly, saying with facetious captiousness that it was impossible to carry it out, since injury and retaliation could not be exactly alike, and because it was not easy to break a limb in such a way as to be an exact <hi rend="italic">aequilibrium,</hi> or 'balance,' as you put it, of the breaking of the other man's. It is true, my dear Favorinus, that to make exact retaliation is very difficult. But the Ten, wishing by retaliation to diminish and abolish such violence as beating and injuring, thought that men ought to be restrained  <pb n="v3.p.421"/>  by the fear of such a penalty; and they did not think that so much consideration ought to be had for one who broke another's limb, and refused to compromise by buying off retaliation, as to consider that the question ought to be raised whether he broke it intentionally or not, nor did they make the retaliation in such a case exactly equivalent or weigh it in a balance; but they aimed rather at exacting the same spirit and the same violence in breaking the same part of the body, but not also the same result, since the degree of intention can be determined, but the effect of a chance blow cannot."</p>

<p>"But if this is as I say, and as the condition of fairness itself dictates, those mutual retaliations that you imagined were certainly rather ingenious than real. But since you think that even this kind of punishment is cruel, what cruelty, pray, is there in doing the same thing to you which you have done to another? especially when you have the opportunity of compromising, and when it is not necessary for you to suffer retaliation unless you choose that alternative. As for your idea that the praetors' edict was preferable in taking cognizance of injuries, I want you to realize this, that this retaliation also was wont of necessity to be subject to the discretion of a judge. For if a defendant, who refused to compromise, did not obey the judge who ordered retaliation, the judge considered the case and fined the man a sum of money; so that, if the defendant thought the compromise hard and the retaliation cruel, the severity of the law was limited to a fine. It remains for me to answer your belief that the cutting and division of a man's body is most inhuman. It was by the exercise and cultivation of  <pb n="v3.p.423"/>  all the virtues that the Roman people sprang from a lowly origin to such a height of greatness, but most of all and in particular they cultivated integrity and regarded it as sacred, whether public or private. Thus for the purpose of vindicating the public honour it surrendered its consuls, most distinguished men, to the enemy,

<note>In the Samnite war, after the battle of the Caudine Forks in 321 B.C.</note>
thus it maintained that a client taken under a man's protection should be held dearer than his relatives and protected against his own kindred, nor was any crime thought to be worse than if anyone was convicted of having defrauded a client. This degree of faith our forefathers ordained, not only in public functions, but also in private contracts, and particularly in the use and interchange of borrowed money; for they thought that this aid to temporary need, which is made necessary by the common intercourse of life, was lost, if perfidy on the part of debtors escaped with a slight punishment. Therefore in the case of those liable for an acknowledged debt thirty days were allowed for raising the money to satisfy the obligation, and those days the Ten called 'legitimate,' as if they formed a kind of <hi rend="italic">moratorium,</hi> that is to say, a cessation and interruption of judicial proceedings, during which no legal action could be taken against them."</p>

<p>"Then later, unless they had paid the debt, they were summoned before the praetor and were by him made over to those to whom they had been adjudged; and they were also fastened in the stocks or in fetters. For that, I think, is the meaning of these words:

<note>iii. 1–4.</note>
For a confessed debt and for judgment duly pronounced let thirty days be the legitimate time. Then let there  <pb n="v3.p.425"/>  be a laying on of hands, bring him to court. If he does not satisfy the judgment, or unless someone in the presence of the magistrate intervenes as a surety, let the creditor take him home and fasten him in stocks or in fetters. Let him fasten him with not less than fifteen pounds weight, or if he wish, with more.

<note>F. D. Allen, <hi rend="italic">Remnants of Early Latin,</hi> p. 86, suggested that <hi rend="italic">minore</hi> and <hi rend="italic">maiore</hi> probably ought to change places.</note>
If the prisoner wishes, he may live at his own expense. If he does not, the creditor shall give him a pound of meal each day. If he wishes, he may give more.' In the meantime the right of compromising the case was allowed,

<note>iii. 5.</note>
and if they did not compromise it, debtors were confined for sixty days. During that time on three successive market-days

<note>The <hi rend="italic">nundinae,</hi> or market days, came on every ninth day, reckoned in the Roman fashion. The time between two market days was the French <quote>huit jours</quote> and our <quote>week.</quote> <hi rend="italic">Terliis nundinis,</hi> counting the one at the beginning of the period (in the Roman fashion), would be about two weeks (actually seventeen days).</note>
they were brought before the praetor and the amount of the judgment against them was announced. But on the third day

<note>iii. 6.</note>
they were capitally condemned or sent across the Tiber to be sold abroad. But they made this capital punishment horrible by a show of cruelty and fearful by unusual terrors, for the sake, as I have said, of making faith sacred. For if there were several, to whom the debtor had been adjudged, the laws allowed them to cut the man who had been made over to them in pieces, if they wished, and share his body. And indeed I will quote the very words of the law, less haply you should think that I shrink from their odium:

<note>iii. 6.</note>
'On the third market day,' it says, 'let them cut him up; if they have cut more or less, let them not be held accountable.' Nothing surely is more merciless, nothing less humane, unless, as is evident on the face of it, such a cruel punishment was threatened in order that they  <pb n="v3.p.427"/>  might never have to resort to it. For nowadays we see many condemned and bound, because worthless men despise the punishment of bondage; but I have never read or heard of anyone having been cut up in ancient days, since the severity of that law could not be scorned. Or do you suppose, Favorinus, that if the penalty provided by the <hi rend="italic">Twelve Tables</hi>

<note>viii. 23.</note>
for false witness had not become obsolete, and if now, as formerly, one who was convicted of giving false witness was hurled from the Tarpeian Rock, that we should see so many guilty of lying on the witness stand? Severity in punishing crime is often the cause of upright and careful living. The story of the Alban Mettius Fufetius

<note>He was the ruler of Alba Longa in the time of Tullus Hostilius, the third king of Rome (673–641 B.C.).</note>
is not unknown even to me, although I read few books of that kind. Since he had treacherously broken a pact and agreement made with the king of the Roman people, he was bound to two four-horse teams and torn asunder as the horses rushed in opposite directions. Who denies that this is an unusual and cruel punishment? but see what the most refined of poets says:

</p>  <quote rend="blockquote"> <l>But you, O Alban, should have kept your word."</l></quote>

<p>Specimens of letters of King Alexander and the philosopher Aristotle. just as they were written; with a rendering of the same into Latin.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>THE philosopher Aristotle, the teacher of king Alexander, is said to have had two forms of the lectures and instructions which he delivered to his pupils. One of these was the kind called <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)cwterika/,</foreign>  <pb n="v3.p.433"/>  or <quote>exoteric,</quote> the other <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)kroatika/,</foreign> or <quote>acroatic.</quote>

<note><hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> esoteric, or inner, for the initiated only. The term was originally applied to Aristotle's acrobatic (or acroamatic) writings, which were not made public, as were his exoteric <hi rend="italic">Dialogues,</hi> but were read to hearers only (cf. <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)kou/w</foreign>) and were of a strictly scientific character. Except for the fragments of his <hi rend="italic">Dialogues,</hi> all the works of Aristotle which have come down to us are of the latter class.</note>
Those were called <quote>exoteric</quote> which gave training in rhetorical exercises, logical subtlety, and acquaintance with politics; those were called <quote>acroatic</quote> in which a more profound and recondite philosophy was discussed, which related to the contemplation of nature or dialectic discussions. To the practice of the <quote>acroatic</quote> training which I have mentioned he devoted the morning hours in the Lyceum,

<note>See note on vii. 16. 1 (ii, p. 135).</note>
and he did not ordinarily admit any pupil to it until he had tested his ability, his elementary knowledge, and his zeal and devotion to study. The exoteric lectures and exercises in speaking lie held at the same place in the evening and opened them generally to young men without distinction. This he called <foreign xml:lang="grc">deilino\s</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="grc">peri/patos,</foreign> or <quote>the evening walk,</quote> the other which I have mentioned above, <foreign xml:lang="grc">e(wqino/s,</foreign> or <quote>the morning walk</quote>;

<note>Hence the term <quote>peripatetics,</quote> from <foreign xml:lang="grc">peripate/w,</foreign> <quote>walk up and down.</quote></note>
for on both occasions he walked as he spoke. He also divided his books on all these subjects into two divisions, calling one set <quote>exoteric,</quote> the other <quote>acroatic.</quote></p>

<p>When King Alexander knew that he had published those books of the <quote>acroatic</quote> set, although at that time the king was keeping almost all of Asia in a state of panic by his deeds of arms, and was pressing King Darius himself hard by attacks and victories, yet in the midst of such urgent affairs he sent a letter to Aristotle, saying that the philosopher had not done right in publishing the books and so revealing to the  <pb n="v3.p.435"/>  public the acroatic training, in which he himself had been instructed. <quote>For in what other way,</quote> said he, <quote>can I excel the rest, it that instruction which I have received from you becomes the common property of all the world? For I would rather be first in learning than in wealth and power.</quote></p>

<p>Aristotle replied to him to this purport: <quote>Know that the acroatic books, which you complain have been made public and not hidden as if they contained secrets, have neither been made public nor hidden, since they can be understood only by those who have heard my lectures.</quote></p>

<p>I have added copies of both letters, taken from the book of the philosopher Andronicus.

<note>Frag. 662, Rose.</note>
I was particularly charmed with the slender thread of elegant brevity in the letter of each.</p>  <quote rend="blockquote"> "<l>Alexander to Aristotle, Greeting.</l></quote>

<p><quote>You have not done right in publishing your acroatic lectures; for wherein, pray, shall I differ from other men, if these lectures, by which I was instructed, become the common property of all?

<p>When I had recited these verses from Ennius, the grammarian rejoined: <quote>Now I believe you. But I would have you believe me, when I say that Quintus Ennius learned this, not from his reading of the poets, but from someone learned in the law. Do you too then go and learn from the same source as Ennius.</quote></p>

<p>I followed the advice of this teacher, when he referred me to another from whom I could learn what he ought to have taught me himself: And I thought that I ought to include in these notes of mine what I have learned from jurists and their writings, since those who are living in the midst of affairs and among men ought not to be ignorant of the commoner legal expressions. <hi rend="italic">Manum conserere,</hi> <quote>to lay on hands.</quote> . . . For with one's opponent to lay hold of and claim in the prescribed formula anything about which there is a dispute, whether it be a field or something else, is called <hi rend="italic">vindicia,</hi> or <quote>a claim.</quote> A seizing with the hand of the thing or place in question took place in the presence of the praetor according to the <hi rend="italic">Twelve Tables,</hi> in which it was written

"If any lay on hands in the presence of the magistrate."

But when the boundaries of Italy were extended and the praetors were greatly occupied with legal business, they found it hard to go to distant places to settle claims. Therefore it became  <pb n="v3.p.451"/>  usual by silent consent, though contrary to the <hi rend="italic">Twelve Tables,</hi> for the litigants not to lay on hands in court in the presence of the praetor, but to call for <quote>a laying on of hands according to law</quote>; that is, that the one litigant should summon the other to the object in question, to lay hands on it according to law, and that they should go together to the field under dispute and bring some earth from it to the city to the praetor's court, for example one clod, and should lay claim to that clod, as if it were the whole field. Accordingly Ennius, wishing to describe such action, said that restitution was demanded, not by legal processes, such as are carried on before a praetor, nor by a laying on of hands according to law, but by war and the sword, and by genuine and resistless violence; and he seems to have expressed this by comparing that civil and symbolic

<p>The meaning of the word <hi rend="italic">sculna,</hi> used by Marcus Varro.</p><!--</argument>-->

<p>PUBLIUS LAVINIUS is the author of a carefully written book, entitled <hi rend="italic">On Vulgar Words.</hi> In it he wrote that <hi rend="italic">scublna</hi> was a colloquial form for <hi rend="italic">seculna,</hi> <quote>for which,</quote> says he, <quote>more elegant speakers use <hi rend="italic">sequester,</hi> or' arbiter.'</quote> Each of these words is derived from <hi rend="italic">sequor,</hi> because both parties <quote>follow</quote> the decision of the arbiter who is chosen. Lavinius  <pb n="v3.p.453"/>  reminds us in the same book that <hi rend="italic">sculna</hi> was written in the division of Marcus Varro's <hi rend="italic">Logistorica</hi> entitled <hi rend="italic">Caius.</hi>
