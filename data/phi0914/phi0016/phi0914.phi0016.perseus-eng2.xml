                    <p> Successful operations against the Volscians, and Aequans, and Praenestines.
                        Four tribes were added. Marcus Manlius, who had defended the Capitol from
                        the Gauls, being condemned for aspiring to regal power, is thrown from the
                        Tarpeian rock; in commemoration of which circumstance a decree of the senate
                        was passed, that none of the Manlian family should henceforward bear the
                        cognomen of Marcus. Caius Licinius and Lucius Sextius, tribunes of the
                        people, proposed a law that consuls might be chosen from among the commons;
                        and after a violent contest, succeeded in passing that law, notwithstanding
                        the opposition of the patricians, the same tribunes of the commons being for
                        five years the only magistrates in the state; and Lucius Sextius was the
                        first consul elected from the commons. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> THE transactions of the Romans, from the
                    building of the city of Rome to the capture of the same city, first under kings,
                    then under consuls, and dictators, and decemvirs, and consular tribunes, their
                    wars abroad, their dissensions at home, I have exhibited in five books:
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> matters obscure, as well by reason of
                    their very great antiquity, like objects which from their great distance are
                    scarcely perceptible, as also because in those times the use of letters, the
                    only faithful guardian of the memory of events, was inconsiderable and rare:
                    and, moreover, whatever was contained in the commentaries of the pontiffs, and
                    other public and private records, were lost for the most part in the burning of
                    the city. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Henceforwards, from the second
                    origin of the city, which sprung up again more healthfully and vigorously, as if
                    from its root, its achievements at home and abroad, shall be narrated with more
                    clearness and authenticity. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> But it now stood
                    erect, leaning chiefly on the same support, Marcus Furius, by which it had bean
                    first raised; nor did they suffer him to lay down the dictatorship until the end
                    of the year. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> It was not agreeable to them,
                    that <pb n="392" xml:id="p.392"/> the tribunes during whose time of office the
                    city had been taken, should preside at the elections for the following year: the
                    administration came to an interregnum. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Whilst
                    the state was kept occupied in the employment and constant labour of repairing
                    the city, in the mean time a day of trial was named by Caius Marcius, tribune of
                    the people, for Quintus Fabius, as soon as he went out of office, because whilst
                    an ambassador he had, contrary to the law of nations, appeared <milestone
                        n="7??" unit="section"/> in arms against the Gauls, to whom he had been sent
                    as a negotiator: from which trial death removed him so opportunely that most
                    people thought it voluntary. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The interregnum
                    commenced. Publius Cornelius Scipio was interrex, and after him Marcus Furius
                    Camillus. He nominates as military tribunes with consular power, Lucius Valerius
                    Publicola a second time, Lucius Virginius, Publius Cornelius, Aulus Manlius,
                    Lucius Aemilius, Lucius Postumius. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> These
                    having entered on their office immediately after the interregnum, consulted the
                    senate on no other business previous to that which related to religion. In the
                    first place they ordered that the treaties and laws which could be found, should
                    be collected; (these consisted of the twelve tables, and some laws made under
                    the kings.) <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Some of them were publicly
                    promulgated; but such as appertained to religious matters were kept secret
                    chiefly by the pontiffs, that they might hold the minds of the people fettered
                    by them. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Then they began to turn their
                    attention to the subject of desecrated days; and the day before the fifteenth
                    day of the calends of August, remarkable for a double disaster, (as being the
                    day on which the Fabii were slain at Cremera, and afterwards the disgraceful
                    battle attended with the ruin of the city had been fought at Allia,) they called
                    the Allian day from the latter disaster, and they rendered it remarkable for
                    transacting no business whether public or private. <milestone n="12"
                        unit="section"/> Some persons think, that because Sulpicius, the military
                    tribune, had not duly offered sacrifice on the day after the ides of July, and
                    because, without having obtained the favour of the gods, the Roman army had been
                    exposed to the enemy on the third day after, an order was also made to abstain
                    from all religious undertakings on the day following the ides: thence the same
                    religious observance was derived with respect to the days following the calends
                    and the nones. </p>
                <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> But it was not long allowed them to consult in
                    quiet re- <pb n="393" xml:id="p.393"/> garding the means of raising the city,
                    after so grievous a fall. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> On the one side
                    their old enemies, the Volscians, had taken up arms, to extinguish the Roman
                    name: on the other, some traders brought [intelligence] that a conspiracy of the
                    leading men of Etruria from all the states had been formed at the temple of
                    Voltumna. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> A new cause of terror also had been
                    added by the defection of the Latins and Hernicians, who, since the battle
                    fought at the lake Regillus, had remained in friendship with the Roman people
                    with fidelity not to be questioned. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    Accordingly, when such great alarms surrounded them on every side, and it became
                    apparent to all that the Roman name laboured not only under hatred with their
                    enemies, but under contempt also with their allies; <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> it was resolved that the state should be defended under the
                    same auspices, as those under which it had been recovered, and that Marcus
                    Furius should be nominated dictator. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> He, then
                    dictator, nominated Caius Servilius Ahala master of the horse; and a suspension
                    of all public business being proclaimed, he held a levy of the juniors, in such
                    a manner as to divide them into centuries after they had sworn allegiance to
                    him. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The army, when raised and equipped with
                    arms, he divided into three parts. One part he opposed to Etruria in the
                    Veientian territory; another he ordered to pitch their camp before the city.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> A military tribune, Aulus Manlius,
                    commanded the latter; those who were sent against the Etrurians, Lucius Aemilius
                    commanded. The third part he led in person against the Volscians; and not far
                    from Lanuvium, (the place is called ad Maecium,) he set about storming their
                    camp. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Into these, who set out to the war from
                    motives of contempt, because they thought that all the Roman youth were cut off
                    by the Gauls, the fact of having heard that Camillus was appointed to the
                    command struck such terror, that they fenced themselves with a rampart, and the
                    rampart itself with trees piled up together, lest the enemy might by any means
                    reach to the works. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> When Camillus observed
                    this, he ordered fire to be thrown into the fence opposed to him; and it so
                    happened that a very strong wind was turned towards the enemy. <milestone n="11"
                        unit="section"/> He therefore not only opened a passage by the fire, but the
                    flames being directed against the camp, by the vapour also and the smoke, and by
                    the crackling of the green timber as it burned, he so confounded the enemy that
                    the Romans had less diffi- <pb n="394" xml:id="p.394"/> culty in passing the
                    rampart into the camp of the Volscians, than they had experienced in climbing
                    over the fence which had been consumed by the fire. <milestone n="12"
                        unit="section"/> The enemy being routed and cut down, after the dictator had
                    taken the camp by assault, he gave up the booty to the soldiers, which was so
                    much the more agreeable, as it was less expected, the commander being by no
                    means profusely generous. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Then having pursued
                    them in their flight, after he had depopulated the entire Volscian land, he at
                    length in the seventieth year forced the Volscians to a surrender. <milestone
                        n="14" unit="section"/> After his victory he passed from the Volscians to
                    the Aequans, who were also preparing for hostilities: he surprised their army at
                    Bolae, and having attacked not only their camp, but their city also, he took
                    them at the first onset. </p>
                <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> When such fortune manifested itself on that
                    side where Camillus, the life and soul of the Roman interest, was, a great alarm
                    had fallen on another quarter. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> For almost all
                    Etruria, taking up arms, were besieging Sutrium, allies of the Roman people,
                    whose ambassadors having applied to the senate, imploring aid in their distress,
                    obtained a decree, that the dictator should at the earliest opportunity bear aid
                    to the Sutrians. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> And when the circumstances of
                    the besieged would not suffer them to brook the delay of this hope, and the
                    small number of the townsmen were spent with labour, watching, and wounds, all
                    which fell heavily on the same individuals, and when, the city being delivered
                    up to the enemy by a capitulation, they were leaving their habitations in a
                    miserable train, being discharged without their arms with only a single garment;
                    at that juncture Camillus happened to come up at the head of the Roman army.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> And when the mournful crowd prostrated
                    themselves at his feet, and the address of the leading men, wrung from them by
                    extreme necessity, was followed by the weeping of women and boys, who were
                    dragged along by the companions of their exile, he bade the Sutrians to give
                    over their lamentations: that he brought with him grief and tears to the
                    Etrurians. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> He then orders the baggage to be
                    deposited, and the Sutrians to remain there with a small guard left with them,
                    and the soldiers to follow him in arms. Having thus proceeded to Sutrium with
                    his army disencumbered, he found, as he expected, every thing in disorder, as
                    usually happens in success; no advanced guard before the walls, the gates lying
                    open, and the conquerors dispersed, carrying out <pb n="395" xml:id="p.395"/>
                    the booty from the houses of the enemy. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    Sutrium is therefore taken a second time on the same day; the Etrurians, lately
                    victorious, are cut down in every quarter by their new enemy, nor is time
                    afforded them to collect and form one body, or even to take up arms. <milestone
                        n="7" unit="section"/> When each pushed eagerly towards the gates, to try if
                    by any chance they could throw themselves into the fields, they found the gates
                    shut for the dictator had given those orders in the first instance. <milestone
                        n="8" unit="section"/> Upon this some took up arms, others, who happened to
                    be armed before the tumult came on them, called their friends together in order
                    to make battle; which would have been kindled by the despair of the enemy, had
                    not criers, sent in every direction through the city, issued orders that their
                    arms should be laid down, that the unarmed should be spared, and that no one
                    should be injured except those who were armed. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>

                    recalled by a decree of the senate from Veii, who, from a dislike to building at

                    And at first there was a murmuring on their part disregarding the order; then a

                    private persons (for the want felt of accommodation stimulated them) hastening
                    to complete the work; and within a year a new city was erected. <milestone n="7"

                    to war, (for they owned themselves conquered,) but from motives of animosity, to
                    lay waste their territories, lest they should leave them any strength for new
                    designs; the other into the territory of Tarquinii. Here Cortuosa and
                    Contenebra, towns belonging to the Etrurians, were taken by storm and
                    demolished. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> At Cortuosa there was no contest;
                    having attacked it by surprise, they took it at the first shout and onset; the

                    it was continual labour, abated neither by night nor by day, that reduced them.

                    opportunity was afforded to the Romans of entering the city. It was the wish of
                    the tribunes that the spoil should be made public property; but the order [that
                    such should be so] was too late for their determination. <milestone n="11"

                    the reserve troops also. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Nor was it merely the
                    ardour of the soldiers animated by the presence of their general that made this
                    impression, but because nothing was more terrible to the minds of the Volscians,
                    than the sight of Camillus which happened to present itself. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> Thus, in whatever direction he went, he carried certain
                    victory with him. This was particularly evident, when, hastily mounting his
                    horse, he rode with a footman's shield to the left wing, which <pb n="401"
                        xml:id="p.401"/> was almost giving way, by the fact of showing him elf he
                    restored the battle, pointing out the rest of the line gaining the victory.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Now the result was decided, but the flight
                    of the enemy was impeded by their great numbers, and the wearied soldiers would
                    have had tedious work in putting so great a number to the sword, when rain
                    suddenly falling with a violent storm, put an end to the pursuit of the victory
                    which was now decided, rather than to the battle. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> Then the signal for retreat being given, the fall of night
                    put an end to the war, without further trouble to the Romans. For the Latins and
                    Hernicians, having abandoned the Volscians, marched to their homes, having
                    attained results corresponding to their wicked measures. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> The Volscians, when they saw themselves deserted by those
                    through reliance on whom they had resumed hostilities, abandoned their camp, and
                    shut themselves up within the walls of Satricum. Camillus at first prepared to
                    surround them by lines of circumvallation, and to prosecute the siege by a mound
                    and other works. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> But seeing that this was
                    obstructed by no sally from the town, and considering that the enemy possessed
                    too little spirit for him to wait in tedious expectation of victory under the
                    circumstances, after exhorting his soldiers not to waste themselves by tedious
                    labours, as [they had done] when besieging Veii, that the victory was in their
                    hands, he attacked the walls on every side, amid the great alacrity of the
                    soldiers, and took the town by scalade. The Volscians, having thrown down their
                    arms, surrendered themselves. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> But the general's thoughts were fixed on a
                    higher object, on Antium: [he knew] that that was the great aim of the
                    Volscians, and main source of the late war. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    But because so strong a city could not be taken without great preparations,
                    engines and machines, leaving his colleague with the army, he set out for Rome,
                    in order to advise the senate to have Antium destroyed. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> In the middle of his discourse, (I suppose that it was the
                    wish of the gods that the state of Antium should last a longer time,)
                    ambassadors came from Nepete and Sutrium, soliciting aid against the Etrurians,
                    urging that the time for giving them aid would soon pass by. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> Thither did fortune avert the force of Camillus from
                    Antium; for as those places were situate opposite Etruria, and were barriers or
                    gates as it were on that side, both they had a wish to get possession of them,
                    whenever they meditated any new enter- <pb n="402" xml:id="p.402"/> prise, and
                    the Romans to recover and secure them. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    Wherefore the senate resolved to treat with Camillus, that he would relinquish
                    Antium and undertake the Etrurian war. The city troops, which Quinctius had
                    commanded, are decreed to him. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Though he would
                    have preferred the army which was in the Volscian territory, as being tried and
                    accustomed to him, he made no objection: he only demanded Valerius as his
                    associate in command. Quinctius and Horatius were sent against the Volscians, as
                    successors to Valerius. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Furius and Valerius,
                    having set out from the city to Sutrium, found one part of the town already
                    taken by the Etrurians, and on the other part, the approaches to which were
                    barricaded, the townsmen with difficulty repelling the assault of the enemy.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Both the approach of aid from Rome, as
                    also the name of Camillus, universally respected both with the enemy and the
                    allies, sustained their tottering state for the present, and afforded time for
                    bringing them relief. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Accordingly Camillus,
                    having divided his army, orders his colleague to lead round his troops to that
                    side which the enemy already possessed, and to assault the walls; not so much
                    from any hope that the city could be taken by scalade, as that, by turning away
                    the enemy's attention to that quarter, both the townsmen who were wearied with
                    fighting might have some relaxation of their toil, and that he himself might
                    have an opportunity of entering the city without a contest. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> This having been done on both sides, and the double terror
                    now surrounding the Etrurians, when they saw that the walls were assailed with
                    the utmost fury, and that the enemy were within the walls, they threw themselves
                    out in consternation, in one body, by a gate which alone happened not to be
                    guarded. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Great slaughter was made on them as
                    they fled, both in the city and through the fields. The greater number were
                    slain within the walls by Furius' soldiers: those of Valerius were more alert
                    for the pursuit; nor did they put an end to the slaughter until night, which
                    prevented them from seeing. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Sutrium being
                    recovered and restored to the allies, the army was led to Nepete, which having
                    been received by capitulation, was now entirely in the possession of the
                    Etrurians. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> It appeared probable, that there would be more

                    because the surrender had been made in consequence of a party of the Nepesinians
                    having betrayed the state. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> It was determined,
                    however, that a message should be sent to their leading men, to separate
                    themselves from the Etrurians, and that they themselves should evince that
                    strict fidelity, which they had implored from the Romans. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> Whence as soon as an answer was brought that there was
                    nothing in their power, that the Etrurians occupied the walls and the guards of
                    the gates, first, terror was struck into the townsmen by laying waste their
                    land; <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> then, when the faith of the capitulation
                    was more religiously observed than that of the alliance, the army was led up to
                    the walls with fascines of bushes collected from the fields, and the ditches
                    being filled, the scaling ladders were raised, and the town was taken at the
                    first shout and attack. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Proclamation was then
                    made to the Nepesinians, that they should lay down their arms, and orders were
                    given that the unarmed should be spared. The Etrurians, armed and unarmed, were
                    put to the sword without distinction: of the Nepesinians also the authors of the
                    surrender were beheaded. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> To the unoffending
                    multitude their property was restored, and the town was left with a garrison.
                    Thus having recovered two allied cities from the enemy, the tribunes marched
                    back their victorious army to Rome. During the same year restitution was
                    demanded from the Latins and Hernicians, and the cause was asked why they had
                    not during some years supplied soldiers according to stipulation. <milestone
                        n="7" unit="section"/> An answer was given in a full assembly of both
                    nations, <quote> that neither the blame was public, nor was there any design in
                        the circumstance of some of their youth having served among the Volscians.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> That these individuals, however,
                        suffered the penalty of their improper conduct, and that none of them had

                        their continual terror from the Volscians, which pest adhering to their

                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Which answer being reported to the senate,

                    originated on the part of the Volscians, to which was added a revolt of the

                    attained such eminence that he treated not as colleagues but as mere tools the

                    would form a just estimate, his country could not have been recovered by Marcus
                    Furius from the siege of the enemy, had not the Capitol and citadel been first

                    of the other's glory, a man's share appertained to all the soldiers who
                    conquered along with him; that in his victory no man living was a sharer.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> His mind puffed by these notions, and

                    prominent as he thought it should, he, the first of all the patricians, became a

                    contracted by building, a circumstance most destructive even to the rich. The

                    of which year peace with foreign countries afforded every opportunity both to

                    additional courage, that the dictator had not ventured to the same extent
                    against him, as Quinctius Cincinnatus had done in the case of Spurius Maelius,
                    and because the dictator had not only endeavoured to avoid the unpopularity of
                    his imprisonment by abdicating the dictatorship, but not even the senate could
                    bear up against it. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Elated by these
                    considerations, and at the same time exasperated, he set about inflaming the

                    within the walls, the country should be burned forthwith, and when all places
                    should be desolated, siege should be laid to the city. <milestone n="5"

                    Allia having been plundered, that fortress also was abandoned, and considering
                    the walls scarcely secure, they shut themselves up within the town of Praeneste.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> There were eight towns besides under the

                    carried round to these also; and these being taken one after the other without
                    much difficulty, the army was led to Velitrae. This also was taken by storm.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> They then came to Praeneste, the main
                    source of the war. That town was obtained, not by force, but by capitulation.
                    Titus Quinctius, being once victorious in a pitched battle, having taken also
                    two camps belonging to the enemy, and nine towns by storm, and Praeneste being
                    obtained by surrender, returned to Rome: and in his triumph brought into the

                    Jupiter and Minerva, and a tablet fixed under it, as a monument of his exploits,

                    it was at first agreeable to them that a dictator should be appointed; then when
                    intelligence was received from the Volscian country that matters were quiet, and
                    it appeared manifest that they knew not how to take advantage of victory and of
                    opportunity, the army and generals were recalled from thence also; and there was

                    was, that the Praenestines, having stirred up some of the states of the Latins,
                    renewed hostilities. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> During the same year new
                    colonists were enrolled for Setia, the colony itself complaining of the paucity
                    of men. Domestic tranquillity, which the influence of the plebeian military
                    tribunes and the respect shown to them among their own party procured, was a

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The commencement of the following year blazed
                    forth with violent sedition, the military tribunes with consular power being
                    Spurius Furius, Quintus Servilius a second time, Caius Licinius, Publius

                    debt was both the ground-work and cause of the disturbance: for the purpose of
                    ascertaining which Spurius Servilius Priscus and Quintus Clœlius Siculus, being
                    appointed censors, were prevented by war from proceeding in the business.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> For alarming news at first, then the
                    flight [of the country people] from the lands, brought intelligence that the

                    putting a check to the domestic feuds, that on the contrary the tribunitian
                    power became even more vehement in obstructing the levy; until these conditions
                    were imposed on the patricians, that no one was to pay tribute as long as the

                    was no delay with respect to the levy. New legions being enlisted, it was
                    resolved that two armies should be led into the Volscian territory, the legions
                    being divided. Spurius Furius and Marcus Horatius proceed to the right, towards
                    the sea-coast and Antium; Quintus Servilius and Lucius Geganius to the left, to
                    Ecetra towards the mountains. On neither side did the enemy meet them.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Devastation was therefore committed, not
                    similar to that straggling kind which the Volscian had practised by snatches
                    under the influence of trepidation after the manner of a banditti, relying on
                    the dissensions among the enemy and dreading their valour; but committed with
                    the full meed of their resentment by a regular army, more severe also by reason
                    of their continuance. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> For the incursions had
                    been made by the Volscians on the skirts of the borders, as they were afraid
                    lest an army might in the mean time come forth from Rome: the Romans, on the
                    contrary, had a motive for tarrying in the enemy's country, in order to entice
                    them to an engagement. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> All the houses
                    therefore on the lands, and some villages also, being burnt down, not a

                    of men and cattle, which was outside the walls, being driven off, the troops

                    the enemy, legal proceedings began to be instituted anew; and so remote was all
                    hope of relieving the former debt, that a new one was now contracted by a tax
                    for building a wall of hewn stone bargained for by the censors: <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> to which burden the commons were obliged to submit, because

                    <pb n="431" xml:id="p.431"/> By the same influence they succeeded in raising
                    three armies against the Latins and Volscians, who with combined forces were
                    encamped at Satricum, all the juniors being bound by the military oath without

                    Publius Valerius and Lucius Aemilius led to Satricum. <milestone n="6"

                    on level ground, they immediately engaged; and before the victory was
                    sufficiently declared, the battle, which held out fair hopes of success, was put
                    a stop to by rain accompanied by a violent storm of wind. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> On the following day the battle was renewed; and for a
                    considerable time the Latin troops particularly, who had learned the Roman
                    discipline during the long confederacy, stood their ground with equal bravery
                    and success. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> A charge of cavalry broke their
                    ranks; when thus confused, the infantry advanced upon them; and as much as the
                    Roman line advanced, so much were the enemy dislodged from their ground; and
                    when once the battle gave way, the Roman prowess became irresistible. <milestone

                    was two miles distant, not for their camp, they were cut down chiefly by the

                    The night succeeding the battle, they betake themselves to Antium in a march
                    resembling a flight; and though the Roman army followed them almost in their
                    steps, fear however possessed more swiftness than anger. <milestone n="11"
                        unit="section"/> Wherefore the enemy entered the walls before the Roman
                    could annoy or impede their rear. After that several days were spent in laying
                    waste the country, as the Romans were neither supplied with military engines to

                    Antians and the Latins; when the Antians, overcome by misfortunes and reduced by
                    a war, in which they had both been born and had grown old, began to think of a

                    long peace, their spirits being still fresh, rendered the Latins more determined
                    to persevere in the war. There was an end to the contest, when it became evident
                    to both parties that neither would stand in the way of the other <pb n="432"
                        xml:id="p.432"/> so as to prevent them from following out their own views.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The Latins by departing redeemed
                    themselves from a share in what they deemed a dishonourable peace. <milestone

                    presence impeded their salutary counsels, surrender their city and lands to the
                    Romans. The resentment and rage of the Latins, because they were neither able to
                    damage the Romans in war, nor to retain the Volscians in arms, vented itself in
                    setting fire to the city of Satricum, which had been their first place of
                    retreat after their defeat; nor did any other building in that city remain,
                    since they cast firebrands indiscriminately into those sacred and profane,
                    except the temple of Mother Matuta. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> From that
                    neither the sanctity of the building itself, nor respect for the gods, is said
                    to have restrained them, but an awful voice, emitted from the temple with
                    threats of dismal vengeance, unless they removed their abominable fires to a
                    distance from the temples. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Fired with this
                    rage, their impetuosity carried them on to Tusculum, under the influence of'
                    resentment, because, having abandoned the general association of the Latins,
                    they joined themselves not only in alliance with the Romans, but also as members
                    of their state. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> As they unexpectedly rushed in
                    at the gates, which were lying open, the town, except the citadel, was taken at
                    the first shout. The townsmen with their wives and children took refuge in the
                    citadel, and sent messengers to Rome, to inform the senate of their situation.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> An army was led to Tusculum with no less
                    expedition than was worthy of the honour of the Roman people. Lucius Quinctius
                    and Servius Sulpicius, military tribunes, commanded it. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> They beheld the gates of Tusculum shut, and the Latins,
                    with the feelings of besiegers and besieged, on the one side defending the walls
                    of Tusculum, on the other hand attacking the citadel; they struck terror and
                    felt it at the same time. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The arrival of the
                    Romans produced a change in the minds of both parties: it turned the Tusculans
                    from great alarm into the utmost alacrity, and the Latins from almost assured
                    confidence of soon taking the citadel, as they were masters of the town, to very
                    slender hope of even their own safety. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> A
                    shout is raised by the Tusculans from the citadel; it is answered by a much
                    louder one from the Roman army. The Latins are hard pressed on both sides: they
                    neither withstand the force of the Tusculans pouring down on them from the
                    higher ground; nor are they <pb n="433" xml:id="p.433"/> able to repel the

                    were then broken open; and when the two enemies pressed them both in front and
                    in the rear, nor did there remain any strength for fight, nor any room for
                    running away, between both they were all cut to pieces to a man. Tusculum being

                    increase every day; as the ability to pay was prevented by the very fact that it

                    magistracies: and the patricians seemed to have for ever recovered the
                    possession of an honour that had been only usurped by the commons for a few
                    years. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> A trifling cause, as generally happens,
                    which had the effect of producing a mighty result, intervened to prevent the

                    Ambustus, an influential man, both among persons of his own station, and also
                    with the commons, because he was by no means considered a despiser of persons of
                    that order, had been married, the elder to Servius Sulpicius, the younger to
                    Caius Licinius Stolo, a distinguished person, but still a plebeian; and the fact

                    of Servius Sulpicius. military tribune, a lictor of Sulpicius, when he returned
                    home from the forum, rapped at the door, as is usual, with the rod. When the

                    From the number of persons attending on her, and asking her commands, her
                    sister's match, I suppose, appeared to her to be a fortunate one, and she
                    repined at her own, according to that erroneous feeling, by which every one is

                    remedy in their public and private consultations except the protest, which had
                    been tried in many previous contests, they gained over their colleagues to

                        what else is it, if the chickens do not feed? <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> if they come out too slowly from the coop? if a bird
                        chaunt an unfavourable note? These are trifling: but by not despising these
                        trifling matters, our ancestors have raised this state to the highest
                        eminence. Now, as if we had no need of the favour of the gods, we violate
                        all religious ceremonies. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Wherefore let
                        pontiffs, augurs, kings of the sacrifices be appointed at random. Let us
                        place the tiara of Jupiter's flamen on any person, provided he be a man. Let
                        us hand over the ancilia, the shrines, the gods, and the charge of the
                        worship of the gods, to those <pb n="445" xml:id="p.445"/> to whom it is
                        impious to commit them. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Let not la s be
                        enacted, nor magistrates elected under auspices. Let not the senate give
                        their approbation, either to the assemblies of the centuries or of the
                        Curiae. Let Sextius and Licinius, like Romulus and Tatius, reign in the city
                        of Rome, because they give away as donations other persons' money and lands.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> So great is the charm of plundering
                        the possessions of other persons: nor does it occur to you that by the one
                        law vast wilds are produced throughout the lands by expelling the
                        proprietors from their territories; by the other credit is destroyed, along
                        with which all human society ceases to exist. <milestone n="12"

                        ought to be rejected by you. Whatever ye may do, I pray the gods to render

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The speech of Appius merely had this effect,
                    that the time for passing the propositions was deferred. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> The same tribunes, Sextius and Licinius, being re-elected
                    for the tenth time, succeeded in passing a law, that of the decemvirs for
                    religious matters, one half should be elected from the commons. Five patricians
                    were elected, and five out of the plebeians; and by that step the way appeared
                    opened to the consulship. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The commons, content
                    with this victory, yielded to the patricians, that, all mention of consuls being
                    omitted for the present, military tribunes should be elected. Those elected
                    were, Aulus and Marcus Cornelius a second time, Marcus Geganius, Publius
                    Manlius, Lucius Veturius, and Publius Valerius a six h time. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> When, except the siege of Velitrae, a matter rather of a
                    slow than dubious result, there was no disquiet from foreign concerns among the
                    Romans; the sudden rumour of a Gallic war being brought, influenced the state to
                    appoint Marcus Furius dictator for the fifth time. He named Titus Quinctius
                    Pennus master of the horse. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Claudius asserts
                    that a battle was fought that year with the Gauls, on the banks of the Anio; and
                    that then the famous battle was fought on the bridge, in which Titus Manlius,
                    engaging with a Gaul by whom he had been challenged, slew him in the sight of
                    the two armies and despoiled him of his chain. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    But I am induced by the authority of several writers to believe that those
                    things happened not less than ten years later; but that in this year a pitched
                    battle was fought with the Gauls by the dictator, Marcus Furius, in the
                    territory of Alba. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The victory was either <pb
                        n="446" xml:id="p.446"/> doubtful nor difficult to the Romans, though from
                    the recollection of the former defeat the Gauls had diffused great terror. Many
                    thousands of the barbarians were slain in the field, and great numbers in the
                    storming of the camp. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The rest dispersing,
                    making chiefly for Apulia, saved themselves from the enemy, both by continuing
                    their flight to a great distance, as also because panic and terror had scattered
                    them very widely. A triumph was decreed to the dictator with the concurrence of
                    the senate and commons. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Scarcely had he as yet
                    finished the war, when a more violent disturbance awaited him at home; and by
                    great struggles the dictator and the senate were overpowered, so that the
                    measures of the tribunes were admitted; and the elections of the consuls were
                    held in spite of the resistance of the nobility, at which Lucius Sextius was
                    made consul, the first of plebeian rank. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> And
                    not even was that an end of the contests. Because the patricians refused to give
                    their approbation, the affair came very near a secession of the people, and
                    other terrible threats of civil contests: <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    when, however, the dissensions were accommodated on certain terms through the
                    interference of the dictator; and concessions to the commons were made by the
                    nobility regarding the plebeian consul; by the commons to the nobility, with
                    respect to one praetor to be elected out of the patricians, to administer
                    justice in the city. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The different orders
                    being at length restored to concord after their long-continued animosity, when
                    the senate were of opinion that for the sake of the immortal gods they would
                    readily do a thing deserving, and that justly, if ever on any occasion before,
                    that the most magnificent games should be performed, and that one day should be
                    added to the three; <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> the plebeian aediles
                    refusing the office, the young patricians cried out with one accord, that they,
                    for the purpose of paying honour to the immortal gods, would readily undertake
                    the task, so that they were appointed aediles. <milestone n="14" unit="section"
                    /> And when thanks were returned to them by all, a decree of the senate passed,
                    that the dictator should ask of the people two persons as aediles from among the
                    patricians; that the senate should give their approbation to all the elections
                    of that year. </p>
