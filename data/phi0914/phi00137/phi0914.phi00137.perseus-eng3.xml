                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> After the new consuls had taken office and
                        the obligations of religion had been discharged the position of the
                        Aetolians took precedence of all other subjects of discussion in the senate.
                        Their envoys pressed for an audience as the period of the armistice was
                        drawing to a close, and they were backed up by T. Quinctius, who had by that
                        time returned to Rome. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Knowing that they
                        had more to hope from the clemency of the senate than from the strength of
                        their case, they adopted a suppliant attitude and brought up their former
                        good services as a counterpoise to their recent misdoings. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> However, while in the House, they were subjected to a
                        fire of questions from all sides, the senators endeavouring to force from
                        them a confession of guilt rather than definite replies, and after they were
                        ordered to withdraw they gave rise to a very lively debate. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> The feeling of resentment against them was stronger
                        than that of compassion, for the senate were embittered against them not
                        only as enemies, but as a wild race whose hand was against every man.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The debate went on for several days,
                        and it was finally decided that peace should neither be granted to them nor
                        refused. They were offered two alternatives: either to place themselves
                        unreservedly in the hands of the senate or to pay a fine of 1000 talents and
                        have the same friends and enemies as Rome. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        When they endeavoured to get some idea of the matters in regard to which
                        they were to be at the senate's disposal they got no definite reply. The
                        same day they were sent away from the City without having obtained peace and
                        were ordered to leave Italy within the fortnight. </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Then the question of the consular
                        provinces came up. Both the consuls wanted Greece. Laelius possessed great
                        influence in the senate, and when it was decided that the consul should
                        either ballot or come to a mutual agreement about their provinces he
                        observed that he and his colleague would act more gracefully if they left
                        the matter to the judgment of the senate rather than to the chances of the
                        ballot. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Scipio said in reply that he
                        should consider what he ought to do, and after a private conversation with
                        his brother, who insisted upon his leaving the matter in the hands of the
                        senate, he told his colleague that he would do what he advised. <milestone
                            n="9" unit="section"/> This method of procedure as being either
                        unprecedented or resting on precedents of which no record survived was
                        expected to lead to a debate, but P. Scipio Africanus declared that if the
                        senate decreed Greece to his brother Lucius he would serve under him.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> This declaration met with universal
                        approval and put an end to any further discussion. The senate were glad of
                        the opportunity of finding out which would receive most help-Antiochus from
                        the vanquished Hannibal or the consul and legions of Rome from his
                        vanquisher Scipio, and they almost unanimously decreed Greece to Scipio and
                        Italy to Laelius. </p>

                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The praetors then balloted for their
                        provinces. L. Aurunculeius received the urban and Cneius Fulvius the alien
                        jurisdiction; L. Aemilius Regillus the command of the fleet; P. Junius
                        Brutus the administration of Etruria; M. Tuccius, Apulia and Bruttium; and
                        C. Atinius, Sicily. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The consul to whom
                        Greece had been decreed, in addition to the army of two legions which he was
                        to take over from Manius Acilius, was further reinforced by 3000 Roman
                        infantry and 100 cavalry and allied troops to the number of 5000 infantry
                        and 200 cavalry. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> It was further decided
                        that after he had arrived in his province he should, if he thought it
                        expedient, take his army into Asia. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The
                        other consul was supplied with an entirely fresh army, two Roman legions and
                        15,000 infantry and 600 cavalry from the allies. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> Q. Minucius had written to say that his province was
                        pacified and the whole of the Ligurians had made their surrender; he was now
                        ordered to take his army into the country of the Boii and hand it over to P.
                        Cornelius, who was acting as proconsul. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        The city legions which had been raised the previous year were to be
                        withdrawn from the territory of which the Boii had been mulcted after their
                        defeat and given to the praetor M. Tuccius. These, reinforced by 15,000
                        allied infantry and 600 cavalry, were to occupy Apulia and Bruttium.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> A. Cornelius, who had commanded in
                        Bruttium as praetor during the past year, received instructions to transfer
                        his legions to Aetolia if the consul approved and hand them over to Manius
                        Acilius in case he wished to remain there, but if Acilius preferred to
                        return to Rome, Cornelius was to keep that army in Aetolia. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> It was further arranged that C. Atinius Labeo should
                        take over the province of Sicily and the army of occupation from M. Aemilius
                        and raise reinforcements if he wished to do so in the island itself to the
                        number of 2000 infantry and 100 cavalry. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                        P. Junius Brutus was to raise a new army for service in Etruria consisting
                        of one Roman legion and 10,000 infantry and 400 cavalry of allied troops.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> L. Aemilius, to whom the naval
                        command had fallen, was to receive from his predecessor, M. Junius, twenty
                        ships of war with their crews and to enlist in addition 1000 seamen and 2000
                        infantry soldiers to serve as marines. With his fleet thus manned he was to
                        proceed to Asia and take over the fleet which C. Livius had commanded. The
                        praetors commanding in the two Spains were continued in office and retained
                        their armies. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Sicily and Sardinia were
                        each required to supply two-tenths of their corn harvest for the year;
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> the whole of the corn from Sicily was
                        to be transported to Aetolia for the use of the army, that from Sardinia was
                        to go partly to Rome and partly to Aetolia, like the corn from Sicily. </p>

                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="3" type="chapter">
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Before the consuls left for their
                        provinces it was resolved that various portents should be expiated according
                        to the directions of the pontiffs. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The
                        temple of Juno-Lucina in Rome was struck so seriously by lightning that the
                        pediment and great doors were much damaged. At Puteoli, one of the gates and
                        numerous portions of the wall were similarly struck and two men killed.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> At Nursea it was definitely reported
                        that a thunderstorm suddenly burst out of a cloudless sky; there also two
                        men were killed, both freemen. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The people
                        of Tusculum announced that a shower of earth had fallen in their district,
                        and at Reate a mule was said to have had a foal. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> These portents were duly expiated and the Latin
                        Festival was celebrated a second time owing to the Laurentians not having
                        received their due portion of the sacrifice. <milestone n="6" unit="section"
                        /> To allay the religious fears which these various incidents aroused, a
                        solemn intercession was offered, as directed by the Keepers of the Sacred
                        Books, to those deities which, after consulting the rolls, they named.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Ten free-born boys and ten maidens,
                        all of whose fathers and mothers were alive, were employed about that
                        sacrifice, and the Keepers of the Sacred Books offered up sacrifices of
                        sucklings in the night. Before his departure, P. Cornelius Scipio erected an
                        arch on the Capitol facing the road up to the temple, with seven gilded
                        human statues and two equestrian ones. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> He
                        also set up in front of the arch two marble basins. During this time
                        forty-three of the Aetolian leading men, including Damocritus and his

                        from Ptolemy and Cleopatra to offer their congratulations on the expulsion
                        of Antiochus from Greece by the consul Acilius, and to urge the senate to
                        send an army into Asia, as not only in Asia but even throughout Syria there
                        was a universal feeling of alarm. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The two

                        under P. Africanus, were waiting for the consul on his departure and gave in
                        their names for active service. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> At the
                        time of the consul's departure, whilst the Games of Apollo were being
                        celebrated, the daylight was obscured, though the sky was clear, by the moon
                        passing under the orb of the sun. L. Aemilius Regillus set out at the same

                        thirty quinqueremes and twenty triremes. This step was due to a report that
                        since the naval battle Antiochus was fitting out a considerably larger fleet
                        than he had on that occasion. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> When the

                        serious than the losses inflicted on them by the Achaeans who were harrying
                        the whole of their sea-board which faced the Peloponnese. <milestone n="7"

                        knew that this was what they were expecting, and he thought the better

                        commenced an attack on Lamia. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> This place
                        had almost been destroyed by Philip, and as the inhabitants were not
                        apprehending any similar attempt, Acilius thought he might successfully

                        was considerable confusion and alarm, but a stouter resistance was offered
                        than any one would have believed possible in such sudden danger. The men
                        fought from the walls, the women carried up to them stones and missiles of
                        every description, and though the scaling-ladders were placed at very many
                        points against the walls, the defence was maintained for that day.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Towards noon Acilius gave the signal
                        for retiring, and took his troops back into camp, where they took food and
                        rest. Before he dismissed his staff, he warned his men to be armed and ready
                        before daybreak, and told them that till they had carried the city he should
                        not take them back to camp. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> As on the
                        previous day, he delivered several simultaneous assaults, and as the

                        fail, he took the city in a few hours. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The
                        booty found there was partly sold and partly divided amongst the soldiers.
                        After the capture a council of war was held to decide what was to be done
                        next. No one was in favour of going on to Naupactus as long as the Aetolians
                        held Mount Corax. However, to avoid wasting the summer in inaction, and to
                        prevent the Aetolians, after they had failed to obtain peace from the
                        senate, from enjoying it through his own lack of enterprise, Acilius
                        determined to attack Amphissa. He marched the army over Mount Oeta.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> and when he reached the city he did
                        not, as at Lamia, attempt a combined assault upon the entire circuit of the
                        walls, but he commenced a regular siege. The rams were brought up at several
                        points, and though the walls were being battered, the townsmen made no
                        attempt to prepare or invent anything to meet this kind of engine.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> All their hopes lay in their arms and
                        their courage; they made frequent sorties and harassed the detached posts

                        cavalry; he had already reached the Maliac Gulf, and had sent a detachment
                        to Hypata to demand the surrender of that city. The reply was that the
                        inhabitants refused to do so without the sanction of the national council of
                        Aetolia. Not wishing to lose time in the siege of Hypata while Amphissa was
                        still holding out, he sent his brother Africanus on in advance and marched
                        on Amphissa. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Just before their arrival the
                        citizens had abandoned their city, which was now to a large extent denuded
                        of its walls, and had retreated, combatants and non-combatants alike, into
                        the citadel which they held to be impregnable. <milestone n="4"

                        place. A deputation from Athens arrived there to intercede for the
                        Aetolians, and went first to Publius Scipio, who had, as stated above, gone
                        on in advance, and then to the consul. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                        They received a conciliatory reply from Africanus, who was keeping Asia and
                        Antiochus in view and trying to find some honourable pretext for abandoning
                        the Aetolian war. He told them that they must endeavour to persuade the
                        Aetolians as well as the Romans to prefer peace to war. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> In consequence of the representations of the Athenians,
                        a large deputation of Aetolians very soon came from Hypata and had an
                        interview with Africanus. Their hopes of peace were considerably raised by
                        what he said to them, as he pointed out how many tribes and nations in Spain
                        and subsequently in Africa had thrown themselves on his protection, and how
                        he had left everywhere nobler memorials of his clemency and kindness than of
                        his military successes. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> They had to all

                        senate. This unexpected treatment was a great blow to the Aetolians, for
                        they saw that they had gained nothing either through the intervention of the
                        Athenians or the considerate reply of Africanus. </p>

                        they might have to suffer in person. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> So
                        they instructed the same deputation to go back to the consul and Africanus,
                        and implore them, if they were willing really to grant them peace and not
                        simply dangle it before their eyes and cheat the hopes of their unhappy
                        nation, either to reduce the sum fixed for them to pay, or make the

                        The Athenian deputation followed them to Hypata. The Aetolians had
                        completely lost heart after so many rebuffs and were deploring in unavailing
                        lamentation the hard fortune of their nation, when Echedemus, the leader of

                        should ask for a six months' truce so that they might send envoys to Rome.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The delay, he pointed out, would in no
                        way aggravate their present distress which had reached the extreme point,
                        and many things might happen in the interval to lighten it. Acting on his
                        advice the same delegates were sent again. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                        They first obtained an interview with P. Scipio and through his
                        instrumentality they obtained from the consul a truce for the time they

                        accompanied them on their march. He displayed great tact and refinement,
                        qualities which recommended him to Africanus, who, singularly distinguished

                        They had various grievances; the presence of the ships in their winter

                        grievance; the scarcity of corn was an additional and a serious grievance.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Owing to this scarcity the Roman force

                        Eumenes had brought with him, and set sail for the Hellespont in order to
                        make preparations for the transport of the army which he was expecting to

                        offered sacrifice to Minerva, after which he gave a gracious audience to
                        deputations from the neighbouring towns of Elaeus, Dardanus and Rhoeteum,
                        who came to place their respective localities under the protection of Rome.
                        From there he sailed to the mouth of the Hellespont, and stationing ten

                        presently their senate and magistrates came forward to make a formal

                        either to place full confidence in or absolutely to decline. He sailed to
                        Panhormus, a harbour in Samos, and stayed there to examine the proposal more
                        closely. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Messages passed to and fro
                        between them, but Pausistratus was not quite reassured until Polyxenidas

                        Polyxenidas was living under an autocrat he would never dare to give what he
                        had signed with his own hand as evidence against him. Then the plan of the
                        pretended treachery was arranged. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                        Polyxenidas said that he would not make any further preparations whatever,
                        he would not keep any large number of rowers with the fleet, some of the
                        vessels he should haul up on land, ostensibly for repairs, others <milestone

                        few he should keep at sea outside the port of Ephesus, so that if
                        circumstances compelled him to go out he could expose them to battle. When
                        Pausistratus heard that Polyxenidas was going to disperse his fleet in this
                        way, he followed suit. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> One division of

                        the traitor. Polyxenidas still further misled him by hauling up a certain
                        number of ships and repairing the dockyards as though intending to haul up
                        others. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> When the rowers were called up

                        closed and that the naval service had never been more carefully looked
                        after. Pausistratus was so completely obsessed by the deception practiced

                        not to complete his dispositions so much as to prevent the fleet from being

                        inward from the sea like two horns, form the harbour. He expected to repulse
                        the enemy easily by attacking him from both sides, but the sight of Nicander
                        on the land above upset his plan, and suddenly changing his tactics he
                        ordered all to go on board. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> There was

                        terrifying sight of these flames enabled them to clear a way through the

                        an island called Macris for the purpose of catching any stragglers from the
                        fleet as it sailed past, or attacking, at advantage the hindmost ships.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> When he saw that the fleet was
                        scattered by the storm he thought that his chance of attacking them had

                        for him to approach them. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> He now steered
                        for the island of Aethalia, intending to attack them the next day while they
                        were putting into Samos. Towards evening a few Roman ships gained a deserted
                        harbourage in the island, and the rest of the fleet, after tossing on the

                            unit="section"/> Here they learnt from the peasants that the enemy's
                        fleet was lying at Aethalia, and a council of war was held to decide whether
                        they should seek a decision at once or wait for the Rhodian contingent.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> It was decided to put off the
                        encounter and they returned to their base at Corycus. Polyxenidas also,
                        after waiting in vain, returned to Ephesus. Now that the sea was clear of
                        the hostile ships the Romans sailed to Samos. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> The Rhodian fleet arrived a few days later, and to show
                        that the Romans had only been waiting for them, they left at once for
                        Ephesus to bring about a decisive battle, or if the enemy declined battle,
                        to force an admission that he was afraid to fight, which would very
                        materially influence the attitude of the various cities. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> They lay off the entrance to the harbour with the ships
                        all abreast in a long line. As no enemy appeared, one division of the fleet
                        anchored at the harbour mouth, the other disembarked its marines who
                        proceeded to devastate the country far and wide. <milestone n="9"

                        the garrison of Ephesus, made a sortie, took a large part of the plunder
                        from them and drove them back to the ships. <milestone n="10" unit="section"
                        /> The next day the Romans planted an ambuscade about half-way between the

                        to draw the Macedonian outside the walls. Suspecting what had happened no
                        one came out, and they marched back to their ships. <milestone n="11"
                            unit="section"/> As the enemy shunned an encounter either on land or
                        sea, the fleet returned to Samos. From this port the praetor despatched two
                        vessels belonging to the Italian allies and two Rhodian ships under the

                        light infantry to harass the enemy without meeting him in a regular
                        engagement. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> When he found in these
                        encounters that he was in no way a match for his foe, he retired within his
                        walls and the investment of the city commenced. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> Antiochus left Apamea just about this time and encamped
                        first at Sardis and then at the head of the Caicus, not far from Seleucus'
                        camp, with a vast army drawn from various nations, the most formidable of
                        whom were the Gaulish mercenaries, about 4000 strong. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> These, with a small admixture of other troops, were
                        sent to devastate every part of the territory of Pergamum. As soon as news
                        of this reached Samos, Eumenes, summoned home by this war within his
                        borders, sailed direct to Elea, where a body of cavalry and light infantry
                        were in readiness. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Feeling himself safe
                        with these, he hurried on to Pergamum before the enemy were aware or had
                        made any movement to oppose him. Here again the fighting was confined to
                        skirmishes, as Eumenes firmly declined to risk a decisive action. <milestone

                        moved from Samos to Elea to support the king. When Antiochus received
                        intelligence that troops were landed at Elea and that such a large naval
                        force was concentrated in a single harbour, and at <milestone n="10??"

                        the Hellespont, he thought that the time had come for discussing terms of
                        peace, before he was beset both by land and sea. <milestone n="11"
                            unit="section"/> There was some rising ground over against Elea, and he
                        selected this for the site of his camp. Leaving all his infantry there, and
                        his cavalry, of which he had 6000, he went down <milestone n="12??"
                            unit="section"/> into the plain which extended to the walls of Elea, and
                        sent a herald to Aemilius to inform him that he wished to open up
                        negotiations for peace with him. </p>

                        present. The Rhodians were not disinclined for peace, but Eumenes said that
                        no peace proposals could be honourably entertained at that moment, nor could
                        any final settlements be made. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> "How," he
                        asked, "shall we, beleaguered and shut within our walls, listen with honour
                        to any terms of peace? Or who will regard any peace settlement as valid if
                        made without the consent of the consul, the authority of the senate and the

                        question to you-If peace be made through you, are you going to return at

                        learn what the consul thinks, what decision the senate comes to, what order
                        the people make? <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> It remains, then, that
                        you must stay in Asia and, all active operations suspended, your troops must
                        be sent into winter quarters to drain the resources of your allies by the

                        then, if the supreme powers so decide, we must begin the war all over again,
                        whereas, if our strong offensive were in no way slackened or hampered by
                        delay, we could have brought it to a close, if the gods so willed it, before
                        winter sets in." <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> This argument prevailed,
                        and Antiochus was told that, till the consul arrived, there could be no

                        his efforts to procure peace fruitless, Antiochus proceeded to devastate the
                        lands of the people of Elea and then those belonging to Pergamum. Here he
                        left Seleucus and continued his march with the intention of attacking
                        Adramytteum, till he reached the rich district known as the "Plain of

                        with war experience, and under the command of Diophanes, a pupil of
                        Philopoemen, the foremost Greek general of his day. Two days were devoted to
                        resting the men and horses, and also to keeping the enemy's advanced posts
                        under observation and ascertaining at what points and at what hours they

                        troops made it a practice to advance up to the foot of the hill on which the
                        city stands. In this way they acted as a screen, and the plundering parties
                        behind them were not interfered with, as none came out of the city, not even
                        to attack the advanced posts with missiles at long range. <milestone n="4"

                        betaking themselves to games and sports, others feeding under the shade of

                        on the hill, and ordered his men to arm themselves and be in readiness at
                        the gate. He then went to Attalus and told him that he had made up his mind
                        to attack the enemy. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> With very great
                        reluctance Attalus gave his consent, for he saw that he would have to fight
                        with 100 cavalry against 600 and 1000 infantry against 4000. Diophanes went
                        out from the gate and took up a position not far from the enemy's advanced

                        several hours the two sides were on the alert, as though in expectation of

                        thirty-seven vessels of larger build; amongst them were three hepteres and
                        four hexeres. There were in addition to these ten triremes. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> They, too, discovered from an observation post that the
                        enemy were not far off. On the morrow, as soon as it was light, the two
                        fleets left their anchorage, prepared to fight on that day. As soon as the
                        Rhodians had rounded the point which projects into the sea from Sida, both
                        fleets came at once in sight of each other. <milestone n="7" unit="section"
                        /> The left division of the king's fleet which stood out to sea was under
                        Hannibal's command, the right under that of Apollonius, one of the court
                        nobles, and they already had their ships in line. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> The Rhodians came on in a long column, Eudamus' ship
                        leading, Chariclitus closing the rear and Pamphilidas commanding the centre.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> When Eudamus saw that the enemy were
                        in line and prepared to engage, he too put out to the open sea and signalled
                        to the ships which followed to move into line as they came up, keeping their
                        order. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> This at first led to some
                        confusion as he had gone sufficiently far out to sea to allow of all the
                        ships coming into line towards the land, and in his extreme haste he had
                        only five ships with him when he met Hannibal, the rest were not following,
                        but were, as ordered, getting into line. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                        On the extreme left there was no further room towards the land, and they
                        were still in confusion when the fighting began on the right with Hannibal.

                        their own practiced seamanship took away all fear from the Rhodians in a
                        moment. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Each ship in turn steered towards
                        the open sea and so allowed room on the land side for the one which followed
                        it, and whenever any of them closed with an enemy vessel with its beak
                        foremost, it either tore a hole in its prow or sheared off its oars, or
                        else, where it found a clear way through the line, it passed it and attacked
                        its stern. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> What caused the greatest alarm
                        was the sinking of one of the hepteres at a single stroke by a much smaller
                        Rhodian vessel; and on this, the right division were showing unmistakable
                        signs of preparing for flight. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Hannibal,
                        on the other hand, in the open sea, was closing with a large number of ships
                        on Eudamus, and in spite of the Rhodian's superiority in all other respects,
                        would have hemmed him in had not the signal which is customarily used to
                        call a scattered fleet together been given from the commander's ship. All
                        the ships which had won the day on the right immediately rushed to their
                        comrades' help. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Now it was Hannibal and
                        the ships round him which took to flight; the Rhodians, however, were unable
                        to pursue them as most of the rowers were out of health, and therefore more
                        quickly tired. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Whilst they were recruiting
                        their strength with food as they lay on the water, Eudamus from the turret
                        of his ship was watching the enemy as they employed their open ships to tow
                        away the damaged and crippled ones, not much more than twenty getting away
                        uninjured. He called for silence and then said, "Come and feast your eyes on
                        a wonderful sight." <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> They all got up, and
                        after watching the hurried flight of the enemy exclaimed, with almost one
                        voice, that they ought to follow them up. Eudamus' own ship had been
                        repeatedly struck, so he ordered Pamphilidas and Chariclitus to go in
                        pursuit as far as they could do so with safety. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> They kept up the chase for a considerable time, but
                        when Hannibal drew near the <milestone n="9??" unit="section"/> land they
                        were afraid of being wind-bound off the enemy shores, and so they returned
                        to Eudamus with the captured heptere which had been struck in the beginning
                        of the battle, and with some difficulty they succeeded in towing it to
                        Phaselis. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> From there they sailed back to
                        Rhodes, not so much delighted at their victory as angry with one another
                        because they had not sunk or captured the whole of the hostile fleet, when
                        it was in their power to do so. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> So deeply
                        did Hannibal feel this one defeat that though he was very anxious to join
                        the king's fleet as soon as he could, he did not venture to sail beyond the
                        coast of Lycia, and to prevent <milestone n="12??" unit="section"/> him from
                        being at liberty to do this the Rhodians sent Chariclitus with twenty ships
                        of war to Patara and the harbour of Megiste. <milestone n="13"
                            unit="section"/> Eudamus received instructions to return to the Romans
                        at Samos with seven of the largest vessels out of his fleet and use all the

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The news of the victory followed by the
                        appearance of the Rhodians caused much rejoicing amongst the Romans;
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> it was quite evident that if the
                        Rhodians were relieved from that cause of anxiety they would make all the
                        seas in that part of the world safe. But the departure of Antiochus from
                        Sardis and the danger of his seizing the cities on the coast forbade their
                        abandoning the defence of the shores of Ionia and Aeolis. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> Consequently, they sent Pamphilidas with four ships to
                        reinforce the fleet off Patara. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Antiochus
                        had been busy collecting contingents from all the cities round him, and had
                        also sent a letter to Prusias the king of Bithynia. In this despatch he
                        bitterly complained of the Roman expedition to Asia; they had come, he
                        wrote, to deprive them all of their crowns so that there might be no
                        sovereignty but that of the Romans anywhere in the world; <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> Philip and Nabis had been reduced to submission; he,

                        like a spreading conflagration they would envelop all, as each lay nearest
                        to the one already overthrown. Now that Eumenes had voluntarily accepted the
                        yoke of servitude, it would be but a step from Antiochus to Bithynia.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Prusias was much perturbed by this
                        letter, but any doubts or suspicions which it might have created were set at
                        rest by a letter from the consul and still more so by one from the consul's
                        brother, Africanus. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> In this letter he
                        showed how it was the uniform practice of the Roman people to enhance the
                        dignity of their royal allies by bestowing every honour upon them, and
                        quoted instances of his own policy in order to persuade Prusias to show
                        himself worthy of his friendship. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The
                        chieftains whom he had taken under his protection in Spain he had left with
                        the title of kings; <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Masinissa he had
                        established on his throne and on that of Syphax, who had expelled him, as
                        well, and now he was not only by far the most prosperous monarch in Africa,
                        but the peer in greatness and power of any monarch in the world. <milestone
                            n="11" unit="section"/> Philip and Nabis, who had been enemies and whom
                        T. Quinctius had conquered, had still their thrones left them; in the case
                        of Philip even the payment of tribute had been remitted during the past
                        year, his son who had been a hostage was restored to him, and he had been
                        allowed to recapture some cities outside Macedonia without any interference
                        from the Roman generals. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Nabis, too,
                        would have retained his honour and dignity had not his own madness and the
                        treachery of the Aetolians proved fatal to him. Such was the tenor of
                        Africanus' communication. What did most to determine the king's attitude was
                        a visit from C. Livius, the late commandant of the fleet. <milestone n="13"
                            unit="section"/> He came on a special mission from Rome and made the

                        more inviolable and secure his friendship would be in their eyes than in

                        Prusias as an ally, Antiochus left Sardis for Ephesus in order to inspect
                        the fleet which had been fitted out and in readiness for several months.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> It was the impossibility of offering
                        an effective resistance to the Roman army with the two Scipios in command
                        rather than any naval successes in the past or any well-grounded confidence
                        he felt at the time which made him interest himself in his fleet. For the
                        moment, however, there were some things to encourage him. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> He had learned that a large part of the Rhodian fleet
                        was at Patara and that Eumenes had gone with all his ships to the Hellespont
                        to meet the consul. The destruction of the Rhodian fleet at Samos, as the
                        result of treachery, also did something to raise his spirits. <milestone
                            n="4" unit="section"/> These considerations led him to send Polyxenidas
                        with his fleet to try the chances of battle at all hazards, whilst he
                        himself led his forces to Notium. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> This
                        place belongs to Colophon and is about two miles distant from it and
                        overlooks the sea. He wanted to get Colophon itself into his power, for it
                        was so near Ephesus that he could take no action by sea or land which was
                        not visible to the people of Colophon who at once informed the Romans.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> When once the Romans heard that Notium
                        was besieged he felt sure that they would bring up their fleet from Samos to
                        help their ally, and this would give Polyxenidas his opportunity. </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Accordingly he commenced the siege of the
                        city in regular form; his lines were extended equally in two directions down
                        to the sea; on both sides he carried the agger and the vineae up to the
                        walls and the battering-rams with their shelters were placed in position.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Appalled at these dangers the people
                        of Colophon sent to L. Aemilius at Samos to implore him for his own honour

                        Samos, the last thing he was expecting was that Polyxenidas, after being
                        twice challenged by him in vain, would give him an opportunity of fighting.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> He also felt it a humiliation to be
                        tied and bound to the assistance of besieged Colophon whilst the fleet of

                        supplies. This island was a Roman granary and all the transports from Italy
                        directed their course thither. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Coasting
                        round from the city to the opposite side of the island which looks north
                        towards Chios and Erythrae, they were on the point of sailing across when
                        the praetor received a despatch informing him that a large quantity of corn
                        from Italy had reached Chios, but that the vessels laden with wine had been
                        detained by storms. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> At the same time a
                        report was brought to the effect that the Teians had furnished the king's

                        Aemilius was now half-way across, but he at once diverted his course to Teos
                        with the intention of making use of the provisions prepared for the enemy,
                        with the consent of the townsmen, or if not, prepared to treat them as

                        piratical barques and cutters. They had been plundering along the coast of
                        Chios and were returning with booty of every description. When they saw the
                        fleet they took to flight and owing to their vessels being lighter and built
                        especially for the purpose and also because they were nearer the land, they
                        outsailed their pursuers. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Before the Roman

                        the praetor, hoping to force their ships out of the harbour, followed them
                        though he was unacquainted with the locality. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> Myonnesus stands on a headland between Teos and Samos,
                        the point itself is a conical-shaped hill running up from a fairly broad
                        base into a sharp peak. It is approached from the land side by a narrow
                        path, and shut in from the sea by cliffs, which have been so worn away at
                        their base by the waves that in some places the overhanging rocks project
                        beyond the ships lying at anchor beneath them. <milestone n="8"

                        should be exposed to attacks from the pirates on the overhanging cliffs, but
                        lay near the enemy through the day. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Just
                        before nightfall they abandoned their fruitless task and the next day
                        arrived at Teos. After the ships had been drawn up in the Geraesticum-a
                        harbour behind the city-the praetor sent out his men to plunder the
                        surrounding country. </p>

                        on before their eyes they sent a deputation, wearing suppliant emblems, to
                        the Roman commander. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> In reply to their
                        protestations of innocence as to any hostility in either word or deed
                        against the Romans, he charged them with having assisted the enemy with
                        whatever supplies they needed, and told them how much wine they had promised
                        to Polyxenidas, and that if they would furnish the Roman fleet with the same
                        quantity he would recall his soldiers from their raid. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> On the return of the deputation with this stern reply
                        the townsmen were summoned by the magistrates to an assembly that they might
                        consult as to what they should do. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                        Polyxenidas meantime had heard that the Romans had moved from Samos and,
                        after chasing the pirates to Myonnesus, had anchored their ships in the
                        harbour and were plundering the Teian district. <milestone n="5"

                        without betraying his movements, cast anchor at an island opposite
                        Myonnesus-the seafaring men call it Macris-on the very day, as it happened,
                        that the Romans reached Teos. </p>
                    <p>

                        out what they were doing, and was at first in great hopes of defeating the
                        Romans by the same maneuver as that by which he had worsted the Rhodian
                        fleet at Samos, namely by blocking the mouth of the harbour. <milestone
                            n="7" unit="section"/> The situation was much the same, the harbour is
                        so shut in by the converging headlands that it is difficult for two ships to
                        come out abreast. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Polyxenidas intended to
                        seize these headlands during the night and, after stationing ten ships off
                        each to make a flank attack on the enemy vessels as they came out, he was
                        going to land the troops from the rest of his fleet, as he had done at
                        Panhormus, and overpower the Romans on sea and land alike. His plan would
                        have succeeded but for the movements of the Roman fleet. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> As the Teians had undertaken to comply with the
                        praetor's requirements it was thought more convenient, for the purpose of
                        taking the supplies on board, to move into the other harbour in front of the
                        city. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Eudamus also, it is stated, drew
                        attention to the disadvantages of the first harbour after two ships had
                        smashed their oars by fouling one another in the narrow entrance. <milestone
                            n="11" unit="section"/> A further consideration which weighed with the
                        praetor and induced him to change his moorings, was the danger which
                        threatened him from the land, as Antiochus had his standing camp at no great
                        distance. </p>

                        the city, the sailors and soldiers went ashore to obtain for each ship its
                        share of the provisions, and especially of the wine. <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> Not a single man was aware of the proximity of
                        Polyxenidas. Towards midday a countryman was brought before the praetor, and
                        reported that a fleet had been lying in front of the island of Macris for
                        two days, and that a few hours ago some of the vessels looked as if they
                        were preparing to sail. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The praetor was
                        considerably alarmed at this unexpected intelligence, and ordered the
                        trumpeters to sound the assembly, so that those who were dispersed over the
                        fields might come back, whilst the military tribunes were sent into the city
                        to hurry the soldiers and sailors on board. <milestone n="4" unit="section"
                        /> The disorder was just like that caused by an outbreak of fire or the
                        capture of a city: some were running into the city to recall their comrades,
                        others were running out of the city to rejoin their ships, and amidst
                        confused orders, wild shouting, and the braying of the trumpets, there was a
                        general rush to the ships. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Hardly anyone
                        could make out his own ship or get near it for the tumult, and the confusion
                        might have been attended with serious danger both on sea and land had it not
                        been for the prompt action of the praetor. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        Leaving Eudamus to conduct his own operations, Aemilius led the way out of
                        the harbour into the open sea, and meeting each ship as it came up, assigned
                        its place in the line. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Eudamus with his
                        Rhodians remained along shore, in order that they might embark without
                        confusion and each ship sail out as soon as it was ready. Thus the first
                        line was formed under the praetor's eye, the Rhodians brought up the rear,
                        and the combined fleet sailed out to sea in battle formation, as though the
                        enemy were actually in sight. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> They were
                        between Myonnesus and the point of Corycus when they got their first view of
                        the enemy. The king's fleet, which was advancing in a long column, two ships
                        abreast, also deployed into line and extended its left far enough to be able
                        to envelop the Roman right. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> When Eudamus
                        saw this, and realised that the Romans could not make their line equal in
                        length to that of the enemy, and that their right would be enveloped, he
                        speeded up his ships, which were by far the swiftest in the whole fleet, and
                        after extending his line as far as the enemy's, placed his own vessel
                        opposite to that of Polyxenidas. </p>

                        action. On the side of the Romans eighty ships were engaged, twenty-two of
                        which were Rhodian vessels. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The enemy
                        fleet numbered eighty-nine, and of the largest classes of ships they had
                        three with six tiers of oars and two with seven. The Romans were far
                        superior in the stoutness of their ships and the bravery of their men; the
                        Rhodians equally had the advantage in the handiness of their vessels, the
                        skill of their helmsmen, and the training and discipline of the oarsmen.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> But they created the greatest alarm
                        among the enemy by their fire-ships; the one thing which saved them at
                        Panhormus proved here also the most effective means of victory. <milestone
                            n="4" unit="section"/> When the king's ships swerved aside through fear
                        of the flames, they were unable to ram the hostile ships with their beaks,
                        and at the same time laid themselves open to be struck on the side;
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> any ship that did close with another
                        was covered with the fire poured upon it, and they were thrown into greater
                        confusion by the fire than by the actual fighting. Still, as usual, the
                        fighting power of the soldiers was the main factor in the contest.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The Romans broke through the enemy's
                        centre, and then working round they attacked from the rear the ships which
                        were engaged with the Rhodians, and in a very short space of time Antiochus'
                        centre and the ships of the left division were being surrounded and sunk.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Those on the right, as yet intact,
                        were more alarmed at the defeat of their comrades than at any danger which
                        threatened them. But when they saw their other vessels in the midst of the
                        enemy ships and Polyxenidas deserting his fleet and fleeing with all sails
                        set, they promptly hoisted their topsails, as the wind was favourable for
                        those making for Ephesus, and took to flight, after losing forty-two ships
                        in the battle, thirteen of which fell into the enemy's hands, the rest being
                        either burnt or sunk. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Two Roman ships were
                        complete wrecks, several were damaged. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> One
                        Rhodian vessel was captured through a remarkable accident. On ramming a
                        Sidonian vessel the blow shook the anchor out of the ship on to the prow of
                        the other, which it held with its fluke as though with a grapple. <milestone

                        backed water to get clear of the enemy, but the anchor chain dragged, and
                        becoming entangled with the oars, swept off all those on one side of the
                        ship. Thus weakened it was captured by the very ship which had been rammed
                        and made fast to it. Such, in its main features, was the sea fight at
                        Myonnesus. </p>

                        Driven from the mastery of the sea, he despaired of being able to defend his
                        distant possessions and, adopting a policy which events subsequently proved
                        to be a mistaken one, he withdrew his garrison from Lysimachia to prevent
                        its being cut off by the Romans. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> It would
                        not only have been easy to defend Lysimachia against the first attack of the
                        Romans, but the place could have stood a siege through the whole winter and
                        this check would have reduced the besiegers to sore straits for provisions.
                        Meantime there might have been some opportunity for coming to terms and
                        securing peace. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Nor was Lysimachia the
                        only place which he gave up to the enemy after his naval defeat; he also
                        raised the siege of Colophon and retired to Sardis. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> From here he sent to Cappadocia to ask help from
                        Ariarathes, and to every place where he could possibly collect troops. His

                        Ephesus and formed his ships in line before the harbour. When he had thus
                        forced from the enemy a final admission of their renunciation of sea power
                        he sailed to Chios, whither he was directing his course before the naval
                        battle. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Here the damaged ships were
                        repaired, and as soon as this work was finished he sent L. Aemilius Scaurus
                        to the Hellespont with thirty ships to convey the army across. By way of an
                        honourable distinction he gave the Rhodians a share of the plunder and also
                        the spoils of the naval battle, and then told them they might go home.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Before doing so they took an active
                        part in transporting the consul's troops, and not till this task was
                        completed did they return home. The Roman fleet sailed from Chios to
                        Phocaea. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> This city lies in the innermost
                        part of a bay; it is oblong in shape and the walls enclose a space of about

                        After they had fallen the Roman soldiers began to fight their way over the

                        clear they found more help from their arms and courage than from their

                        were exposed compelled the praetor to sound the retire, as he was unwilling

                        all quarters to repair and strengthen what had been laid in ruins.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Q. Antonius, who had been sent by the
                        praetor, appeared amongst them while they were thus engaged, <milestone

                        that the Romans were more anxious than they were that the struggle should
                        not end in the destruction of their city; if they were willing to desist
                        from their madness they would have it in their power to surrender on the
                        same terms as they had formerly obtained from C. Livius. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> On hearing this they asked for a five days' armistice
                        in which to deliberate, and meantime they tried to find out what prospect of
                        help there was from Antiochus. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The envoys
                        they had sent to the king brought back word that they must not look for any
                        support from him, and on this they at last opened their gates after
                        stipulating that they should not be treated as enemies. <milestone n="11"
                            unit="section"/> After the praetor had announced his wish that those who
                        had surrendered should be spared, and whilst the standards were being borne
                        into the city, shouts of protest were raised everywhere amongst the troops,
                        who were furious at the Phocaeans, who had never been loyal allies but
                        always bitter enemies, getting off with impunity. At this cry, as though the
                        praetor had given the signal, the men ran off in all directions to sack the
                        city. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> At first Aemilius tried to stop
                        them and call them back by telling them that it was captured and not
                        surrendered cities that were sacked, and even in the case of these the
                        decision rested with the general, not with the soldiers. <milestone n="13"
                            unit="section"/> When he saw that passion and greed were too strong for
                        his authority, he sent heralds through the city with orders to summon all
                        free men into the forum where they would be safe from injury, and so far as
                        his authority extended he kept his word. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                        He restored to them their city, their lands and their laws, and as winter

                        board the ships which had been drawn up at the different points and crossed
                        over without hindrance or opposition as though to friendly shores.

                        remaining by the Hellespont made him very sanguine of obtaining favourable

                        indeed such were the king's instructions. His hopes rested mainly on him,
                        for Scipio's greatness of soul and the consciousness that he had enough of
                        glory made him most gentle and considerate. <milestone n="4" unit="section"
                        /> All the world, too, knew what he had been when victorious in Spain and in
                        Africa, and there was also the fact that his son had been made a prisoner

                        or when or by what mischance he had been taken prisoner the authorities
                        differ as they do in most other matters. Some assert that it was at the
                        beginning of the war when he was intercepted by the king's ships on his
                        voyage from Chalcis to Oreum; <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> others say
                        that after the landing in Asia he was sent with a troop of Fregellan cavalry
                        to reconnoitre towards the king's camp, and that when a large body of
                        cavalry galloped out to meet him, he retreated and in the confusion fell
                        from his horse and with two other troopers was overpowered, and under these
                        circumstances was brought to the king. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> It
                        is generally admitted that the youth could not have been treated and courted
                        with greater kindness and generosity even if peace with Rome still prevailed
                        and the personal ties of hospitality between the king and the Scipios had

                        as follows: "Many embassies have passed to and fro on the question of peace,
                        and have been fruitless; I entertain strong hopes of gaining it from the
                        very fact that those negotiators gained nothing. For the difficulty in
                        former discussions was the position of Smyrna, Lampsacus, Alexandra Troas
                        and the European city of Lysimachia. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Of
                        these Lysimachia has already been evacuated by the king, so that you cannot
                        say that he holds anything in Europe. He is prepared to give up those which
                        are in Asia, and any others in his dominions which the Romans wish to claim
                        on the ground that they are on the side of Rome. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> He is also prepared to pay half the cost of the war."
                        These were the proposed conditions of peace. <milestone n="5" unit="section"
                        /> In the rest of his speech he advised the council to remember the
                        uncertainty of human affairs, to make a moderate use of their own good
                        fortune, and not treat the misfortunes of others oppressively. <milestone

                        that was an immense empire; it was easier to extend it by single
                        acquisitions than to hold it together in its entirety. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> If, however, they wanted to annex some part of Asia,
                        provided it was defined by clearly ascertained boundaries, the king would,
                        for the sake of peace and concord, allow his own sense of moderation and
                        equity to give way before the Roman greed for territory. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> These arguments in favour of peace, which the speaker
                        thought so convincing, the Romans regarded as so much trifling. <milestone
                            n="9" unit="section"/> They considered it only just that the king, who
                        was responsible for starting the war, should bear the whole cost of it, and
                        that his garrisons should be withdrawn, not only from Ionia and Aeolis, but
                        from all the <milestone n="10??" unit="section"/> cities in Asia, which
                        should be as free as all the liberated cities in Greece, and this could only

                            unit="section"/> I shall look upon my son as the greatest gift which the

                        lines while he was waiting, he surrounded his camp with a fosse six cubits
                        deep and twelve wide, and outside the fosse he threw up a double rampart, on
                        the inner edge he constructed a wall flanked at <milestone n="11??"

                        the king was at Thyatira, and he marched for five successive days till he
                        came down into the Hyrcanian plain. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> When
                        he heard that Antiochus had moved from there he followed in his track, and
                        encamped on the western bank of the Phrygius at a distance of four miles
                        from the enemy. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Here a force of about 1000
                        cavalry mostly Gallograeci, together with some Dahae and mounted archers
                        from other tribes, made a tumultuous rush across the river and charged the
                        Roman advanced posts. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> At first, as they
                        were unprepared, there was some confusion, but as the battle went on and the
                        numbers of the Romans grew with the reinforcements from the camp close by,
                        the king's troops, wearied and outnumbered, endeavoured to effect their
                        retreat across the river. Before they entered the stream, however, a
                        considerable number were killed by their adversaries, who were in close
                        pursuit. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> For the next two days all was
                        quiet, neither side making any attempt to cross the river. On the third day
                        the whole of the Roman army crossed in a body, and formed camp about two and
                        a half miles from the enemy. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Whilst they
                        were measuring out the area of the camp and busy entrenching it,
                        considerable alarm and confusion were created by the approach of a picked
                        force of 3000 infantry and cavalry. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Those
                        forming the advanced guard were much fewer in number, but they maintained a

                        the working-parties in the camp, and as the fighting progressed they
                        repulsed the enemy, after killing 100 of them and taking 100 prisoners.

                        advantage of the ardour of the soldiers. If the enemy would not come out,
                        they were ready to charge over the fosses and rampart and rush the camp, for
                        it was not as though they had to fight with so many thousands of men, but
                        rather to slaughter so many thousands of cattle. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> Cn. Domitius was sent to reconnoitre the ground and
                        find out at what point the enemy's rampart could be best approached, and
                        after he had brought definite and complete information it was decided to
                        move the camp on the morrow nearer the enemy. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> On the third day the standards were advanced into the
                        middle of the plain and the line formed. Antiochus, on his side, felt that
                        he ought not to hesitate any longer lest he should depress the spirits of
                        his own men and raise the hopes of the enemy by declining battle. <milestone
                            n="7" unit="section"/> He led his forces out just far enough from his
                        camp to make it appear that he intended to fight. </p>
                    <p> The Roman army was practically uniform as regards both the men and their
                        equipment; there were two Roman legions and two of Latins and allies, each
                        containing 5000 men. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The Romans occupied
                        the centre, the Latins the wings. The standards of the hastati were in
                        front, then came those of the principes, and last of all the triarii.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Beyond these, whom we may call the
                        regulars, the consul drew up on his right, level with them, the auxiliary
                        troops of Eumenes who were incorporated with the Achaean caetrati, amounting
                        to about 3000 men; beyond them again were stationed nearly 3000 cavalry, 800
                        of which were furnished by Eumenes, the rest being Romans. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> Outside these were posted the Trallian and Cretan
                        horse, each body numbering 500 troopers. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                        The left wing was not considered to need so much support as it rested on the
                        river and was protected by the precipitous banks; four squadrons of cavalry,
                        however, were lined up at that end. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> This
                        was the total strength which the Romans brought into the field. In addition
                        to these, however, there was a mixed force of Macedonians and Thracians,
                        2000 in all, who had followed as volunteers; they were left to guard the
                        camp. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> The sixteen elephants were placed
                        in reserve behind the triarii; they could not possibly stand against the
                        king's elephants, of which there were fifty-four, and the African elephants
                        are no match for the Indian elephants even when the numbers are equal, for
                        the latter are much larger and fight with more determination. </p>

                        from many nations and presented the greatest dissimilarity both in the men
                        and their equipment. There were 16,000 infantry in the Macedonian fashion.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> known as the "phalanx." These formed
                        the centre, and their front consisted of ten divisions; between each
                        division stood two elephants. They were thirty-two ranks deep. <milestone
                            n="3" unit="section"/> This was the main strength of the king's army and
                        it presented a most formidable appearance, especially with the elephants
                        towering high above the men. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The effect
                        was heightened by the frontlets and crests on the animals, and the towers on

                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> On the right of the phalanx Antiochus
                        stationed 1500 Gallograeci infantry, and with them were linked up 3000
                        cavalry, clad in mail armour and known as "cataphracti." <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> These were supported by the "agema," another body of

                        and men drawn from many tribes in that part of the world. <milestone n="7"

                        Ariarathes, next to whom were posted a miscellaneous force numbering 2700.
                        Then came 3000 cataphracti and the king's <milestone n="11??" unit="section"

                        themselves and their horses, but otherwise closely resembling the

                        Lydians. In front of this mass of cavalry were scythe chariots and the

                        Seated on these were Arabian archers provided with narrow swords four cubits

                        The centre was entrusted to three commanders, Minnio, Zeuxis and Philip; the

                        The morning haze, which as the day advanced lifted into clouds, obscured the
                        atmosphere, and then a drizzling rain coming with the south wind wetted
                        everything. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> This did not inconvenience the
                        Romans much, but it was a serious disadvantage to the king's troops. As the
                        Roman line was of only moderate length, the indistinctness of the light did
                        not obstruct the view over the whole of it, and as it consisted almost
                        entirely of heavy-armed troops, the fine rain had no effect on their weapons
                        which were swords and javelins. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The king's
                        line, on the other hand, was of such an enormous length that it was
                        impossible to see the wings from the centre, let alone the fact that the

                        of each other, and the wetting mist relaxed their bows and slings and the

                        trusted to his scythe chariots to throw the enemy ranks into utter
                        confusion, but they only turned the danger against their own side.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> These chariots were armed in the
                        following manner: On either side of the pole where the yoke-bar was fastened
                        spikes were fixed which projected forward like horns, ten cubits long, so as
                        to pierce anything that came in their way, and at each end of the yoke-bar
                        two scythes projected, one on a level with the bar so as to cut off sideways
                        anything it came against, the other turned towards the ground to catch those
                        lying down or trying to get under it. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                        Similarly two scythes pointing in opposite directions to each end of the

                    <p> The chariots thus armed were stationed, as I have already said, in front of

                        driven through their own men. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> When he saw
                        this, Eumenes, who was quite familiar with their mode of fighting, and knew
                        how much their assistance would be worth when once the horses were
                        terrified, ordered the Cretan archers, the slingers and javelin men, in
                        conjunction with some troops of cavalry, to run forward, not in close order
                        but as loosely as possible, and discharge their missiles simultaneously from
                        every side. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> What with the wounds
                        inflicted by the missiles and the wild shouts of the assailants, this
                        tempestuous onslaught so scared the horses that they started to gallop
                        wildly about the field as though without bit or bridle. <milestone n="11"
                            unit="section"/> The light infantry and slingers and the active Cretans
                        easily avoided them when they dashed towards them, and the cavalry increased
                        the confusion and panic by affrighting the horses and even the camels, and
                        to this was added the shouts of those who had not gone into action.
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The chariots were driven off the
                        field, and now that this silly show was got rid of the signal was given, and

                        chariots that they took to flight and exposed the whole line as far as the

                        broken the Roman horse made a charge against these, and many of them did not

                        thrown into disorder the demoralisation reached the centre. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> Here the ranks were broken and they were prevented from
                        using their extraordinarily long spears-the Macedonians call them
                        "sarisae"-by their own comrades who ran back for shelter amongst them.
                        Whilst they were in this disorder the Romans advanced against them and
                        discharged their javelins. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Even the
                        elephants posted between the divisions of the phalanx did not deter them,
                        accustomed as they were in the African wars to evade the charge of the beast
                        and attack its sides with their javelins or, if they could get nearer to it,
                        hamstring it with their swords. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The centre
                        front was now almost entirely beaten down and the reserves, having been
                        outflanked, were being cut down from the rear. At this juncture the Romans
                        heard in another part of the field the cries of their own men in flight,
                        almost at the very gates of their camp. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                        Antiochus from his position on his right wing had noticed that the Romans,
                        trusting to the protection of the river, had only four squadrons of cavalry
                        in position there, and these, keeping in touch with their infantry. had left
                        the bank of the river exposed. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> He attacked
                        this part of the line with his auxiliaries and cataphracti, and not only
                        forced back their front, but wheeling round along the river, pressed on
                        their flank until the cavalry were put to flight and the infantry, who were
                        next to them, were driven with them in headlong flight to their camp. </p>

                        with his camp guard-there were 2000 of them, brave soldiers-offered a firm
                        resistance to the king who was in eager pursuit, and Attalus, who was on the

                        victorious on both wings. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Making their way

                        not only trampled to death by the animals, but having lost all formation

                        peace with Rome wherever Hannibal is, and before all else we demand his

                        the Aetolian, the prime mover in the Aetolian war, who instigated you to

                        reliance on you. With him you will hand over Mnasilochus the Acarnanian, and

                        that it is not so easy for the pride of monarchs to be brought down from the

                        were accordingly made for the despatch of delegates to Rome. The consul
                        distributed his army in winter quarters at Magnesia on the Maeander, at

                        from Placentia and Cremona in Gaul, and were introduced to the senate by L.
                        Aurunculeius. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> They complained of the
                        scarcity of men; some had been carried off by the casualties of war, others
                        by illness, and some had left owing to the annoyance from the Gauls in their
                        neighbourhood. The senate decreed that the consul C. Laelius should, if he
                        approved, draw up a list of 6000 families to be distributed between the two
                        colonies, and L. Aurunculeius was to nominate the commissioners for settling
                        the new colonists. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Those nominated were

                        consular elections was approaching, the consul C. Laelius returned from

                        senate had made before his arrival, he enrolled colonists to reinforce the
                        population of Cremona and Placentia, and he also brought forward a proposal
                        which the senate adopted for founding two new colonies on land which had

                        received at this time from L. Aemilius giving an account of the naval battle
                        at Myonnesus, and stating that L. Scipio had transported his army into Asia.

                        might bring success and happiness to the Republic. The consul received

                        candidate, but he was everywhere unpopular, owing to his having left his

                        senate as to whether he might do so. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The

                        secured the requisite majority of votes. Fulvius, on the following day,
                        co-opted Cn. Manlius; he had succeeded in getting Lepidus defeated, and
                        Messala was at the bottom of the poll. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The

                        courage from this, and refused to carry out the commands laid upon them;
                        their leaders went to Macedonia, Dardania and Thrace to raise a force of
                        mercenaries. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Valerius goes on to say that
                        it was reported that A. Terentius Varro and M. Claudius Lepidus were sent by
                        the propraetor A. Cornelius from Achaia to carry this news to Rome.

                        on this among other matters, and asked from whom they had heard that the
                        Roman commanders were made prisoners by Antiochus and their army destroyed,
                        and that they stated in reply that they had been so informed by their

                        no other authority for this story, and whilst in my opinion it lacks

                        before the senate, their own interest and the situation in which they were
                        placed demanded that they should make a full admission of guilt and a humble
                        request for pardon, whether for their error or their crime. <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> Instead of this they began by recounting the services
                        they had rendered to the Roman people and contrasting the courage they had
                        themselves shown in fighting against Philip with that of the Romans.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> This insolence offended the ears of
                        their audience, and their raking up old and forgotten incidents reminded the
                        senators how much more they had done to injure Rome than to benefit her.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Thus the men who needed compassion
                        only evoked irritation and anger. They were asked by one senator whether
                        they would place themselves at the disposal of the Roman people, by another
                        whether they would have the same friends and enemies as Rome, and on their
                        making no reply they were ordered to leave the House. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> The senate were unanimous in insisting that as the
                        Aetolians were still entirely on the side of Antiochus and their aggressive
                        temper depended solely on their hopes of him, they were unmistakably enemies
                        to Rome, and, as such, war must be waged against them and their defiant
                        spirit crushed. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> What made them still more
                        angry was the duplicity of the Aetolians in suing for peace whilst they were
                        actually carrying war into Dolopia and Athamania. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> Manius Acilius, the conqueror of Antiochus and the
                        Aetolians, proposed a resolution which the senate adopted, namely that the

                        a fortnight. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> A. Terentius Varro was sent
                        to escort them on the road, and they were warned that if any Aetolian
                        delegates went to Rome except with the permission of the Roman commander and
                        accompanied by a Roman officer, they would be treated as enemies. With this

                        the choice of rewards were left to him he would, now that he had the
                        privilege of consulting the Roman senate, gladly avail himself of the advice
                        of the highest order in the State, so that his desires might not be thought
                        extravagant or his requests lacking in modesty. As, however, it was they who
                        were to be the givers, he thought it much more fitting that they should
                        themselves determine the extent of their munificence towards his brothers
                        and himself. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Notwithstanding this protest
                        the senators continued to press him to state his wishes. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> This friendly contest lasted some time, the senate
                        ready to grant whatever the king asked for, and the king maintaining a
                        modest reserve, each leaving the decision to the other and animated by a
                        courtesy in which neither party would be outdone. As no definite conclusion
                        was reached the king at last left the House, but the senators adhered to
                        their opinion that it was absurd to suppose that the king should not know
                        what expectations he entertained or what requests he had come to make.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> He knew best what would be most
                        advantageous to his dominions, he was much more familiar with Asia than the
                        senate were; he must therefore be recalled and forced to express his real
                        sentiments and wishes. </p>

                        obligation for so great a kindness will hold them nominally as allies but

                        pretend that it does not in any way concern their interests, and that you

                        the past. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Do not let these professions
                        deceive you, you will have to be on your guard, lest you not only lower the

                        place those who have borne arms against you in a better position than those

                        regards myself, I would rather be thought by anyone to have yielded within
                        the limits of my rights, so far as other things are concerned, than to have
                        shown excessive obstinacy in maintaining them; but when it is a question of
                        being worthy of your friendship, of giving you every proof of affection and
                        goodwill, of upholding the honour which comes from you-in such a contest I
                        cannot resign myself to defeat. This is the most precious inheritance I have
                        received from my father. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> He was the first
                        of all who dwell in Greece or Asia to be admitted to your friendship, and he
                        preserved it with unbroken and unchanging loyalty to the end of his life.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Nor was it only in heart that he was a
                        good and faithful friend. He took his part in all the wars that you have

                        supplies of all kinds to an extent beyond anything which your other allies

                        the richest part of the dominions of Syphax to it you have made him the most

                        matter was discussed with them, but they refused to agree to the proposal.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Antipater appealed to the provisions
                        of the treaty and maintained that it was a violation of those provisions;
                        the Rhodians were trying to secure, not Soli alone, but the whole of
                        Cilicia, and wanted to transcend the limits of the Taurus. <milestone n="9"

                        strongly the king's envoy had opposed the concession, and further assured
                        them that if the Rhodians thought that the matter touched their honour and
                        dignity the senate would find an easy way of overcoming the legate's
                        obstinacy. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> This evoked still more profuse

                        upsetting the peace. So the status of Soli remained unchanged. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Deservedly, therefore, was the utmost
                        possible honour paid to the immortal gods for having made a crushing victory
                        an easy one also, and a triumph was decreed to the commander. <milestone
                            n="2" unit="section"/> He celebrated this on the last day of the
                        intercalary month, the day before March 1st. As a spectacle his triumph was
                        a grander one than that of his brother Africanus, but to anyone who recalls
                        the circumstances and forms an estimate of the risk incurred in each of the
                        two battles, it <milestone n="3??" unit="section"/> can bear no comparison
                        with it any more than you can compare the two Roman generals with each other
                        or Antiochus as a strategist with Hannibal. <milestone n="4" unit="section"
                        /> In the procession were borne 224 military standards, 134 models of towns,
                        1231 tusks of ivory, 234 golden crowns, 137,420 pounds of silver, 224,000
                        Attic tetrachmas, 331,070 "cistophori," 140,000 gold pieces of Macedonian
                        coinage, 1424 pounds' weight of chased and embossed silver plate and 1024
                        pounds of similar articles in gold. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Among
                        the prisoners were generals, prefects, and nobles attached to Antiochus'
                        court, as many as thirty-two of these were led before the victor's chariot.
                        Each legionary soldier received 25 denarii, each centurion twice and each
                        trooper three times this amount, and after the triumph they all received
                        double pay and a double ration of corn. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        The consul had given them the same allowance after the battle in Asia. His
                        triumph was celebrated about a year after he had gone out of office. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The consul Cn. Manlius landed in Asia and
                        the praetor Q. Fabius Labeo joined the fleet almost at the same time; the
                        consul, however, did not lack material for a war, in this case with the
                        Gauls. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Through the defeat of Antiochus the
                        sea had been cleared of the enemy, and Q. Fabius was considering what he
                        ought to devote himself to so that he might not appear to have received a
                        province where there was nothing to do. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He
                        thought the best thing to do would be to sail across to Crete. Cydonia was
                        at war with Gortynia and Gnossus, and it was reported that a large number of
                        Roman and Italian prisoners were kept in slavery all over the island.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Fabius set sail from Ephesus and as
                        soon as he touched the coast of Crete he sent messengers to the various
                        cities requiring them to lay down their arms, search out all the prisoners
                        in their towns and villages and bring them in. They were also to send
                        representatives to him with whom he could settle matters which concerned the
                        common interests of Crete and Rome. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The
                        Cretans took no notice of these orders and, with the exception of Gortynia,
                        no city restored the prisoners. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Valerius
                        Antias tells us that as many as 4000 prisoners were restored out of the
                        whole island, as hostilities were threatened in case of non-compliance, and
                        he adds that was the sole reason why Fabius, who had done nothing else
                        whatever, induced the senate to grant him a triumph. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> Fabius sailed back to Ephesus and from there despatched
                        three ships to the coast of Thrace with orders for the withdrawal of
                        Antiochus' garrisons from Aenos and Maronea in order that these might be
                        free cities. </p>
