                    <p> A law was passed concerning the intermarriage of the patricians and ple-
                        beians, after strong resistance on the part of the patricians. Military
                        tribunes with consular power. Censors created. Restoration of the lands
                        unjustly taken from the people of Ardea. Spurius Melius, sus- pected of
                        aiming at regal power, is slain by C. Servilius Ahala by order of Quintius
                        Cincinnatus, dictator. Cornelius Cossus, having killed Tolumnius, king of
                        the Veientes, offers the second <foreign xml:lang="la">spolia

                    <p> Duration of the censorship, originally five years, limited to one year and a
                        half. Fidenae reduced, and a colony settled there. The colonists destroyed
                        by the Fidenatians, who are subsequently conquered by Ma- mercus Aemilius,
                        dictator. A conspiracy of the slaves put down. Pos- tumius, a military
                        tribune, slain by the army for his cruelties. Pay from the treasury first
                        given to the soldiers. Operations against the Volscians, Fidenatians, and
                        Faliscians. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> MARCUS Genucius and Caius Curtius followed
                    these as consuls. The year was disturbed both at home and abroad. For at the
                    commencement of the year Caius Canuleius, tribune of the people, proposed a law
                    concerning the intermarriage of the patricians and commons; <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> by which the patricians considered that their blood would
                    be contaminated, and the privileges of birth would be confounded; and a hint at
                    first lightly suggested by the tribunes, that it should be lawful that one of
                    the consuls should be elected from the commons, afterwards proceeded so far,
                    that the nine tribunes proposed a bill, "that the people should have the power
                    of electing the consuls, whether they wished, from the commons or the
                    patricians. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> But they thought that if that were
                    done, the supreme authority would not only be shared with the lowest ranks, but
                    be wholly transferred from the nobility to the commons. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> With joy therefore the patricians heard that the people of
                    Ardea had revolted in consequence of the injustice of the taking away their
                    land, and that the Veientians had laid <pb n="250" xml:id="p.250"/> waste the
                    frontiers of the Roman territory, and that the Volscians and Aequans murmured on
                    account of the fortifying of Verrugo; so much did they prefer an unsuccessful
                    war to an ignominious peace. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> These tidings
                    therefore being received and with exaggerations, in order that during the din of
                    so many wars the tribunitian proceedings might be suspended, they order the
                    levies to be held, preparations to be made for war and arms with the utmost
                    activity; with more energy, if possible, than had been used in the consulship of
                    Titus Quintius. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Then Caius Canuleius declared
                    aloud in brief terms in the senate, that <quote> the consuls wished in vain to
                        divert the commons from attention to the new laws; that they never should
                        hold a levee while he lived, before the commons had first ratified the laws
                        proposed by him and his colleagues; </quote> and he instantly summoned them
                    to an assembly. </p>
                <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Both the consuls incited the senate against
                    the tribune, and the tribune the people against the consuls at one and the same
                    time. The consuls denied <quote> that tribunitian frenzies could any longer be
                        endured; that they were now come to a crisis; that more hostilities were
                        being stirred up at home than abroad. That this happened not more through
                        the fault of the commons than of the patricians; nor more through that of
                        the tribunes than of the consuls. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> That the
                        matter for which there was a reward in the state thrived always with the
                        greatest proficiency; <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> that thus it was
                        that men became meritorious in peace, thus in war. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> That at Rome the highest reward was for sedition; that
                        had ever been the source of honour both to individuals and to collective
                        bodies. They should remember in what condition they had received the majesty
                        of the senate from their forefathers, in what condition they were about to
                        transmit it to their children; that, like the commons, they should have it
                        in their power to boast that it was improved in degree and in splendour.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> That there was no end, nor would there
                        be, so long as the promoters of sedition were rewarded with honour in
                        proportion as sedition was successful. What and how important schemes Caius
                        Canuleius had set on foot! <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> that he was
                        introducing confounding of family rank, a disturbance of the auspices both
                        public and private, that nothing may remain pure, nothing uncontaminated;
                        that, all distinction being abolished, no one might know either himself or
                        those he be- longed to. For what other tendency had those promiscuous <pb
                            n="251" xml:id="p.251"/> intermarriages, except that intercourse between
                        commons and patricians might be made common after the manner of wild beasts;
                        so that of the offspring each may be ignorant of what blood he may be, of
                        what form of religion he was; that he may belong half to the patricians,
                        half to the commons, not being homogeneous even with himself? <milestone
                            n="7" unit="section"/> That it appeared not enough, that all things
                        divine and human should be confounded; that those disturbers of the common
                        people were now preparing to (seize) the consulship; and first that they
                        sounded people's sentiments in mere conversation on the project of having
                        one consul appointed from the commons; <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                        that now the proposition was brought forward, that the people may appoint
                        the consuls, whether they pleased from the patricians or from the people;
                        and that they would appoint no doubt every most turbulent person. The
                        Canuleii, therefore, and the Icilii would be consuls. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> (They expressed a hope) that Jupiter, the best and
                        greatest, would not suffer the imperial majesty of the sovereign power to
                        descend to that; and that they would certainly die a thousand deaths rather
                        than such a disgrace should be incurred. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                        They were certain that their ancestors, could they have divined that the
                        commons would become not more placable to them, but more intractable, by
                        making successive demands still more unreasonable, after they had obtained
                        the first, would have rather submitted to any struggle, than have suffered
                        such laws to be saddled on them.. Because it was then conceded to them with
                        respect to tribunes, the concession was made a second time. <milestone
                            n="11" unit="section"/> There was no end to it; tribunes of the commons
                        and patricians could not subsist in the same state; either the one order or
                        the other office must be abolished; and that a stop should be put to
                        presumption and temerity rather late than never. (Was it right) that they,
                        by sowing discord, should with impunity stir up the neighbouring states
                        against us? <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> and then prevent the state
                        from arming and defending itself against those evils which they may have
                        brought on us? and after they have almost sent for the enemy, not suffer the
                        armies to be levied against the enemies? <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                        But Canuleius may have the audacity to declare openly in the senate that,
                        unless the patrician suffer the laws proposed by himself as victorious, to
                        be enacted, he would prevent the levy from being held. What else was this,
                        but threatening that he would betray his country; that he would <pb n="252"
                            xml:id="p.252"/> suffer it to be attacked and captured? What courage
                        would that expression afford, not to the Roman commons, but to the
                        Volscians, Aequans, and the Veientians! <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                        would they not hope that, under the generalship of Canuleius, they should be
                        able to scale the Capitol and citadel, if with the deprivation of privilege
                        and majesty, the tribunes should rob the patricians of their courage also?
                        That the consuls were prepared to act against the wicked schemes of their
                        countrymen, before they would act against the arms of the enemy. </quote>
                </p>
                <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Just when these matters were going on in the
                    senate, Canuleius thus declaimed in favour of his laws and against the consuls:
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> " Frequently even before now I think I
                    have observed how much the patricians despised you, Romans, how unworthy they
                    deemed you to dwell in the one city and within the same walls with them;
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> but on the present occasion most clearly,
                    in their having risen up so determinedly in opposition to those propositions of
                    ours: in which what else do we do, but remind them that we are their fellow
                    citizens, and that though we possess not the same power, we inhabit the same
                    city? <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> In the one we demand intermarriage, a
                    thing which is usually granted to neighbours and foreigners: we have granted
                    even to vanquished enemies the right of citizenship, which is more than the
                    right of intermarriage. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> In the other we
                    propose nothing new; we only reclaim and demand that which is the people's; that
                    the Roman people may confer honours on whomsoever they may please. <milestone
                        n="6" unit="section"/> And what in the name of goodness is it for which they
                    embroil heaven and earth? why was almost an attack made on me just now in the
                    senate? why do they say that they will not restrain themselves from violence,
                    and threaten that they will insult an office, sacred and inviolable? <milestone
                        n="7" unit="section"/> Shall this city no longer be able to stand, and is
                    the empire at stake, if the right of free suffrage is granted to the Roman
                    people, to confer the consulship on whomsoever they may please, and if a
                    plebeian, though he may be worthy of the highest honour, is not precluded from
                    the hope of attaining that honour? and is this of the same import, whether a
                    plebeian be made a consul, as if any one were to propose a slave or the son of a
                    slave to be consul? <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Do you perceive in what
                    contempt you live? they would take from you a participation in this light, if it
                    were permitted them. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> That you breathe, that
                    you enjoy the faculty of speech, that you possess the forms of human beings,
                    excites their indignation. Nay <pb n="253" xml:id="p.253"/> even, as I hope for
                    mercy, they say that it is contrary to religion that a plebeian should be made

                    several days in a state of interregnum. The interrex and senate strive that the
                    elections of consuls be held; the tribunes of the people, and the people
                    themselves, that elections of the military tribunes be held. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> The patricians succeeded, because both the commons, sure to
                    confer the one or the other honour on patricians, gave up a needless contest,
                    and the leaders of the commons preferred those elections at which no account was
                    to be taken of them (as candidates) to those at which they should be passed by
                    as unworthy. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The tribunes of the commons also
                    gave up the contest without a decision, as a compliment to the chiefs of the
                    patricians. Titus Quintius Barbatus, the interrex, elects consuls Lucius
                    Papirius Mugillanus, Lucius Sempronius Atratinus. During their consulship, the
                    treaty was renewed with the Ardeans; and that is a record to prove, that they
                    were consuls in that year, though they are not to be found among the ancient
                    annals, <pb n="259" xml:id="p.259"/> nor in the books of the magistrates.

                    existed at the commencement of the year, on that account, though these consuls
                    were substituted, the names of the consuls were left out, just as if the

                    were undoubtedly consuls, scil. Marcus Geganius Macerinus a second time, Titus

                    year was the commencement of the censorship, a thing which arose from an humble
                    origin, which afterwards increased so much in importance, that n it was vested
                    the regulation of the morals and discipline of Rome, the senate and the
                    centuries of the knights, the distinction of honour and of ignominy were under

                    could neither be deferred, nor had the consuls leisure to discharge their duty,
                    when wars impended from so many states. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> An
                    observation was made by the senate, <quote> that an office laborious in itself,
                        and one little suited to the consular office, required a magistrate for
                        itself, to whose authority should be submitted the duties of the several
                        scribes, the custody and care of the records, as well as the adjustment of
                        the form to be adopted in the census. </quote>
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> And inconsiderable though the proposal might
                    be, still the senate receive it with great pleasure, because it increased the
                    number of patrician magistrates in the state, judging also that that would come
                    to pass, which really did occur, viz. that the influence of those who should
                    preside, and the honour of the office would derive on it additional authority
                    and dignity. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The tribunes also, considering
                    the discharge of the duty (as was really the case) as necessary rather than the
                    duty itself, as being attended with lustre, did not indeed offer opposition,
                    lest they should through perverseness show a disposition to thwart them even <pb

                    Sempronius, concerning whose consulate doubts are entertained, that in that

                    the more powerful. For the guardians, having harangued openly in the forum among

                    The arms and war at home seemed insufficient to both parties. The nobles called

                    misfortunes began with famine; whether it was that the season was unfavourable
                    to the crops, or that the cultivation of the land was relinquished for the
                    allurements of the city, and of public harangues; for both causes are assigned.

                    in preserving liberty than in the discharge of his own peculiar province:
                    although in the end he bore away the well-earned gratitude of the people as well
                    as the glory of having lowered the price of provisions. <milestone n="9"

                    since even the consulship would have to be taken from the patricians against

                    should be reported to the senate by the president of the markets, which required

                    should be introduced more particularly in the case of a man who was a patrician;
                    or that the commons did not afterwards maintain, or at least attempt, that
                    privilege once conceded to them. But the legal provision made a few years
                    before, viz. that it should not be lawful for the tribunes to choose a
                    colleague, refutes beyond every thing else the false inscription on the statue.

                    Spurius Antius, Lucius Roscius, Roman ambassadors, who came to inquire into the
                    reason of this new line of conduct. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Some
                    palliate the guilt of the king; that an ambiguous expression of his, during a
                    lucky throw of dice, having been mistaken by the Fidenatians, as if it seemed to
                    be an order for their execution, had been the cause of the ambassadors' death.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> An incredible tale; that his thoughts
                    should not have been drawn away from the game on the arrival of the Fidenatians,
                    his new allies, when consulting him on a murder tending to violate the law of
                    nations; and that the act was not afterwards viewed by him with horror.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> It is more probable that <pb n="270"
                        xml:id="p.270"/> he wished the state of the Fidenatians to be so compromised
                    by their participation in so great a crime, that they might not afterwards look
                    to any hope from the Romans. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Statues of the
                    ambassadors, who were slain at Fidenae, were set up in the rostra at the public
                    expense. A desperate struggle was coming on with the Veientians and Fidenatians,
                    who, besides that they were neighbouring states, had commenced the war with so
                    heinous a provocation. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Therefore, the commons
                    and their tribunes being now quiet, so as to attend to the general welfare,
                    there was no dispute with respect to the electing of Marcus Geganius Macerinus a
                    third time, and Lucius Sergius Fidenas, as consuls; so called, I suppose, from
                    the war which he afterwards conducted. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> For he
                    was the first who fought a successful battle with the king of the Veientians on
                    this side of the Anio, nor did he obtain an unbloody victory. Greater grief was
                    therefore felt from the loss of their countrymen, than joy from the defeat of
                    the enemy: and the senate, as in an alarming crisis, ordered Mamercus Aemilius
                    to be appointed dictator. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> He appointed as his
                    master of the horse from the college of the preceding year, in which there had
                    been tribunes of the soldiers with consular power, Lucius Quintius Cincinnatus,
                    a youth worthy of his parent. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> To the levy
                    held by the consuls were added the old centurions well versed in war, and the
                    number of those lost in the late battle was made up. The dictator ordered Lucius
                    Quintius Capitolinus and Marcus Fabius Vibulanus to attend him as his
                    lieutenants-general. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Both the higher powers,
                    and the man suitable to such powers, caused the enemy to move from the Roman
                    territory to the other side of the Anio, and continuing their retrograde
                    movement, they took possession of the hills between Fidenae and the Anio, nor
                    did they descend into the plains until the troops of the Faliscians came to
                    their aid; then at length the camp of the Etrurians was pitched before the walls
                    of Fidenae. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The Roman dictator took his post
                    at no great distance from thence at the conflux on the banks of both rivers,
                    lines being run across between them, as far as he was able to follow by a
                    fortification. Next day he marched out his army into the field. </p>

                        xml:id="p.271"/> earnestly demanded battle; the Veientians and Fidenatians
                    placed more hope in protracting the war. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    Tolumnius, though the measures of his own subjects were more agreeable to him,
                    proclaims that he would give battle on the following day lest the Faliscians
                    might not brook the service at so great a distance from their home. <milestone
                        n="3" unit="section"/> The dictator and the Romans took additional courage
                    from the fact of the enemy having declined giving battle: and on the following
                    day, the soldiers exclaiming that they would attack the camp and the city, if an
                    opportunity of fighting were not afforded them, the armies advance on both sides
                    into the middle of a plain between the two camps. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> The Veientians, having the advantage in numbers, sent
                    around a party behind the mountains to attack the Roman camp during the heat of
                    the battle. The army of the three states stood drawn up in such a manner, that
                    the Veientians occupied the right wing, the Faliscians the left, whilst the
                    Fidenatians constituted the centre. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The
                    dictator charged on the right wing against the Faliscians, Quintius Capitolinus
                    on the left against the Veientians, and the master of the horse with the cavalry
                    advanced in the centre. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> For a short time all
                    was silence and quiet, the Etrurians being determined not to engage unless they
                    were compelled, and the dictator looking back towards a Roman fort, until a
                    signal should be raised, as had been agreed on, by the augurs, as soon as the
                    birds had given a favourable omen. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> As soon as
                    he perceived this, he orders the cavalry first to charge the enemy, after
                    raising a loud shout; the line of infantry following, engaged with great fury.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> In no quarter did the Etrurian legions
                    withstand the shock of the Romans. The cavalry made the greatest resistance; and
                    the king himself, far the bravest of the cavalry, charging the Romans whilst
                    they were pursuing in disorder in every direction, prolonged the contest. </p>

                    against this single foe with spear presented; and after having struck and

                    throws him back again with the boss of his shield, and with repeated thrusts
                    pins him to the earth. He then stripped off the spoils from the lifeless body;
                    and having cut off his head and carrying it on the point of his spear, he puts
                    the enemy to rout through terror on seeing their king slain. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> Thus the line of cavalry, which alone had rendered the
                    combat doubtful, was beaten. The dictator pursues closely the routed legions,
                    and drove them to their camp with slaughter. The greater number of the
                    Fidenatians, through their knowledge of the country, made their escape to the
                    mountains. Cossus, having crossed the Tiber with the cavalry, carried off great
                    plunder from the Veientian territory to the city. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> During the battle there was a fight also at the Roman camp
                    against a party of the forces, which, as has been already mentioned, had been

                    Vibulanus first defends his lines by a ring; then, whilst the enemy were wholly

                    right, he suddenly attacks them with the triarii: and a panic being thus struck
                    into them there was less slaughter, because they were fewer, but their flight
                    was no less disorderly than it had been on the field of battle. </p>

                    spoils in the temple of Jupiter Feretrius, near the spoils of Romulus, which,
                    having been the first called <hi rend="italics">opima,</hi> were the only ones
                    at that time; <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> and he attracted the eyes of all

                    the people. Following all the Roman writers, I have represented Aulus Cornelius

                    know no general but the person under whose auspices the war is conducted, the
                    inscription itself written on the spoils proves, against both me and them, that
                    Cossus was consul when he took them. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Having
                    once heard Augustus Caesar, the founder or restorer of all our temples, on

                    rebuilt, aver that he himself had read the said inscription on the linen
                    breastplate, I thought it would be next to sacrilege to rob Cossus of such a
                    testimony respecting his spoils as that of Caesar, the renovator of the temple
                    itself. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Whether the mistake is chargeable on
                    the very ancient annals and the linen books of the magistrates, deposited in the

                    which have Aulus Cornelius Cossus consul with Titus Quintius Pennus, in the

                        unit="section"/> For there is this additional proof, that a battle so
                    celebrated could not be transferred to that year; that the three years before

                    consequence of a pestilence and a scarcity of grain; so that some annals, as if

                    despatch: and Caius Julius the consul being left to guard the city, and Lucius
                    Julius master of the horse, for the sudden exigencies of the war, lest any thing
                    which they might want in the camp should cause delay, the dictator, repeating
                    the words after Aulus Cornelius the chief pontiff, vowed the great games on
                    account of the sudden war; <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> and having set out
                    from the city, after dividing his army with the consul Quintius, he came up with
                    the enemy. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> As they had observed two separate
                    camps of the enemy at a small distance one from the other, they in like manner
                    encamped separately about a mile from them, the dictator towards Tusculum, the
                    consul towards Lanuvium. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    <pb n="281" xml:id="p.281"/> Thus they had their four armies, as many fortified
                    posts, having between them a plain sufficiently extended not only for excursions
                    to skirmish, but even for drawing up the armies on both sides in battle-array.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> From the time camp was brought close to
                    camp, they ceased not from light skirmishing, the dictator readily allowing his
                    soldiers, by comparing strength, to entertain beforehand the hope of a general
                    vic- tory, after they had gradually essayed the result of slight skirmishes.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Wherefore the enemy, no hope being now
                    left in a regular engagement, attacked the consuls' camp in the night, and bring
                    the matter to the chance of a doubtful result. The shout which arose suddenly
                    awoke not only the consuls' sentinels and then all the army, but the dictator
                    also. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> When circumstances required instant
                    exertion, the consul evinced no deficiency either in spirit or in judgment. One
                    part of the troops reinforce the guards at the gates, another man the rampart
                    around. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> In the other camp with the dictator,
                    inasmuch as there is less of confusion, so much the more readily is it observed,
                    what is required to be done. Despatching then forthwith a reinforcement to the
                    consuls' camp, to which Spurius Postumius Albus is appointed lieutenant-general,
                    he himself with a part of his forces, making a small circuit, proceeds to a
                    place entirely sequestered from the bustle, whence he might suddenly attack the
                    enemy's rear. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Quintus Sulpicius, his
                    lieutenant-general, he appoints to take charge of the camp; to Marcus Fabius as
                    lieutenant he assigns the cavalry, and orders that those troops, which it would
                    be difficult to manage amid a nightly conflict, should not stir before
                    day-light. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> All the measures which any other
                    prudent and active general could order and execute at such a juncture, he orders
                    and executes with regularity; that was an extraordinary specimen of judgment and
                    intrepidity, and one deserving of no ordinary praise, that he despatched Marcus
                    Geganius with some chosen troops to attack the enemy's camp, whence it had been
                    ascertained that they had departed with the greater part of their troops.

                    Tricipitinus. During their consulate nothing worth mentioning occurred. The

                    that matter was left to Lucius Sergius, <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> and
                    Quintus Servilius and Mamercus Aemilius. Some of them were sent into banishment
                    to Ostia, because it did not appear sufficiently clear why during these days
                    they had been absent from Fidenae. A number <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> of
                    new settlers was added, and the land of those who had fallen in war was assigned
                    to them. There was very great distress that year in consequence of drought;
                    there was not only a deficiency of rain; but the earth also destitute of its
                    natural moisture, scarcely enabled the rivers to flow. In some places the

                    ceremonies of expiation for the purpose of obtaining the favour of the gods. A
                    charge was then given to the aediles, that they should see that no other than

                    Veientians at Nomentum and Fidenae; and after that a truce, not a peace, had
                    been concluded; of which both the time had expired and they had renewed
                    hostilities before the expiration. Heralds however were sent; and when according

                    was not <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> listened to. Then arose a dispute
                    whether a war should be declared by order of the people, or whether a decree of

                    by threatening that they would stop the levy, so far prevailed that the consuls
                    should take the sense of the people concerning the war. All the centuries voted
                    for it. In this particular also the commons showed a superiority by gaining this

                    received them in their confusion and turning their backs. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> There was more disgrace therefore than loss. The state,
                    unaccustomed to defeat, was become melancholy; they hated the tribunes, they
                    insisted on a dictator, the hopes of the state now seemed to rest on him. When a
                    religious scruple interfered here also, lest a dictator could not be appointed
                    except by a consul, the augurs on being consulted removed that scruple.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Aulus Cornelius nominated Mamercus
                    Aemilius, and he himself was nominated by him master of the horse. So little did

                    their affairs from a family unmeritedly censured, as soon as the condition of

                    of Etruria, boasting that three Roman generals had been beaten by them in an
                    engagement, though they could not effect a public co-operation in their designs,
                    procured volunteers from all quarters allured by the hope of plunder. <milestone

                    as they had on a former occasion with that of the ambassadors, they join the

                        unit="section"/> There was great consternation at Rome. The army being
                    recalled from Veii, and that same army dispirited in consequence of their

                    posted along the walls, and a suspension of all civil business is proclaimed in
                    the forum, and the shops were closed; and every place becomes more like to a

                        of the Roman army, but by the disagreement of the generals, they now dreaded
                        the Veientian enemy, six times vanquished, and Fidenae, which was almost

                    manage affairs at Rome, a contest suddenly sprung up among the tribunes. Each
                    represented himself as a fitter person to take the lead in the war, and scorned

                    some in quest of plunder having straggled away through carelessness from the

                    respectable families, considering they were plebeians. Two of them choose each a
                    consul, to be watched by them with unremitting assiduity; to one is assigned the
                    charge sometimes of restraining, sometimes of exciting, the commons by his
                    harangues. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Neither the consuls effected the
                    levy, nor the tribunes the election which they desired. Then fortune inclining
                    to the cause of the people, expresses arrive that the Aequans had attacked the
                    citadel of Carventa, the soldiers who were in garrison having straggled away in
                    quest of plunder, and had put to death the few left to guard it; that others
                    were slain as they were returning to the citadel, and others who were dispersed
                    through the country. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> This circumstance,
                    prejudicial to the state, added force to the project of the tribunes. For,
                    assailed by every argument to no purpose that they would then at length desist
                    from obstructing the war when they yielded neither to the public storm, nor to
                    the odium themselves, they succeed so far as to have a decree of he senate
                    passed for the election of military tribunes; <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    with an express stipulation, however, that no candidate should be considered,
                    who was tribune of the people that year, and that no one should be re-elected
                    plebeian tribune for the year following; the senate undoubtedly pointing at the
                    Icilians, whom they suspected of aiming at the consular tribuneship as the
                    reward of their turbulent tribuneship of the commons. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> Then the levy began to proceed, and preparations for war

                    facts in which they do not disagree are to be received as certain, that they
                    retired from the citadel of Carventa, after having carried on the attack for a
                    long time to no purpose: that Verrugo in the Volscian country was taken by the
                    same army, and that great devastation had been made, and considerable booty
                    captured both amongst the Aequans and in the Volscian territory. </p>

                    for, contrary to the expectation of all, three patricians were elected military

                    Caius Servilius Ahala. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> They say that an
                    artifice was employed by the patricians (with which the Icilii charged them even
                    at the time); that by intermixing a crowd of unworthy candidates with the
                    deserving, they turned away the thoughts of the people from the plebeian through
                    the disgust excited by the remarkable meanness of some. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> Then tidings are brought that the Volscians and Aequans,
                    whether the retention of the citadel of Carventa raised their hopes, or the loss
                    of the garrison at Verrugo excited their resentment, united in making
                    preparations for war with the utmost energy: <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    that the Antians were the chief promoters of the project; that their ambassadors
                    had gone about the states of both these nations, upbraiding their dastardly
                    conduct; that shut up within their walls, they had on the preceding year
                    suffered the Romans to carry their depredations throughout their country, and
                    the garrison of Verrugo to be overpowered. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    That now not only armed troops but colonies also were sent into their
                    territories; and that not only the Romans distributed among themselves and kept
                    their property, but that they had made a present to the Hernici of Ferentinum
                    what had been taken from them. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> After their
                    minds were inflamed by these remonstrances, according as they made applications
                    to each, a great number of young men were enlisted. Thus the youth of all the
                    states were drawn together to Antium: there they pitched their camp and awaited
                    the enemy. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> When these accounts are reported at
                    Rome with much greater alarm than the circumstance warranted, the senate
                    instantly ordered a <pb n="315" xml:id="p.315"/> dictator to be nominated, which
                    was their last resource in perilous circumstances. <milestone n="9"

                    patricians, complaining fruitlessly that the military tribunes would not conform
                    to the judgment of the senate, at last appealed even to the tribunes of the

                    on a similar occasion. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The plebeian tribunes,
                    overjoyed at the dissension among the patricians, said, <quote> that there was

                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Then Ahala Servilius, military tribune, say,
                    "that he had remained silent for so long a time, not because he was uncertain as

                    accord yield to the authority of the senate, rather than suffer the tribunitian
                    power to be suppliantly appealed to against them. That even then, if

                    honour sometimes were to those who evinced no desire for them. The war was in no
                    respect a memorable one. The enemy were beaten at Antium in one, and that an
                    easy battle; the victorious army laid waste the Volscian territory; their fort
                    at the lake Fucinus was taken by storm, and in it three thousand men made
                    prisoners; the rest of the Volscians being driven within the walls, <milestone
                        n="8" unit="section"/> and not defending the lands. The dictator having
                    conducted the war in such a manner as to show that he was not negligent of

                    election of consuls, (through pique, I suppose, for the appointment of a
                    dictator,) issued a proclamation for the election of military tribunes. Then
                    indeed the perplexity of the <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> patricians
                    became still greater, as seeing their cause betrayed by their own party.
                    Wherefore, as on the year before, by bringing forward as candidates the most
                    unworthy individuals from amongst the plebeians, they produced a disgust against
                    all, even those who were deserving; so then by engaging such of the patricians

                    the Veientians were distressed by intestine dissension, restitution would not be

                    In the Volscian territory also a disaster was sustained in the loss of the

                    account of an insolent answer of the Veientian senate, who, when the ambassadors

                    unarmed. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The vanquished were therefore obliged
                    to fight, there being no hope for those who gave way, when a pro- <pb n="319"

                    with arms in their hands should be injured, induced all the remaining multitude
                    voluntarily to lay down their arms; of whom two thousand five hundred are taken
                    alive. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Fabius kept his soldiers from the

                        unit="section"/> When they came, the three armies plundered the town, which
                    was enriched with wealth of many years' accumulation; and this generosity of the
                    commanders first reconciled the commons to the patricians. <milestone n="11"
                        unit="section"/> It was afterwards added, by a liberality towards the people
                    on the part of the leading men the most seasonable ever shown, that before any
                    mention should be made of it by the commons or tribunes, the senate should
                    decree that the soldiers should receive pay out of the public treasury, whereas
                    up to that period every one had discharged that duty at his own expense. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> It is recorded that nothing was ever received
                    by the commons with so much joy; that they ran in crowds to the senate-house,
                    and caught the hands of those coming out, and called them fathers indeed;
                    acknowledging that the result of such conduct was that no one would spare his
                    person or his blood, whilst he had any strength remaining, in defence of a
                    country so liberal. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Whilst the prospect of
                    advantage pleased them, that their private property should remain unimpaired at
                    the time during which their bodies should be devoted and employed for the
                    interest of the commonwealth, it further increased their joy very much, and
                    rendered their gratitude for the favour more complete, because it had been
                    offered to them voluntarily, without ever having been agitated by the tribunes
                    of the commons, or made the subject of a demand in their own conversations.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The tribunes of the commons, the only
                    parties who did not participate in the general joy and harmony prevailing
                    through the different ranks, denied <quote> that this measure would prove so

                        </note> as they themselves might imagine. That the measure at first sight
                        was better than it would prove by experience. For from what source was that
                        money to be raised, except by levying a tax on the people. <pb n="320"
                            xml:id="p.320"/> That they were generous to some therefore at the
                        expense of others; and even though others may endure it, those who had
                        already served out their time in the service, would never endure that others
                        should serve on better terms than they themselves had served; and <milestone

                        the expense of their own service, and then that of others. </quote> By these
                    arguments they influenced a part of the commons. At last, when the tax was now
                    announced, the tribunes publicly declared, that they <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> would afford protection to any one who should refuse to
                    contribute his proportion for the pay of the soldiers. The patricians persisted
                    in supporting a matter so happily commenced. They themselves were the first to
                    contribute; and because there was as yet no <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    coined silver, some of them conveying their weighed brass to the treasury in
                    waggons, rendered their contribution very showy. After the senate had
                    contributed with the utmost punctuality according <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> to their rated properties, the principal plebeians, friends
                    of the nobility, according to a concerted plan, began to contribute. And when
                    the populace saw these men highly applauded by the patricians, and also looked
                    up to as good citizens by men <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> of the military
                    age, scorning the support of the tribunes, an emulation commenced at once about
                    paying the tax. And the law being passed about declaring war against the
                    Veientians, the new military tribunes with consular power marched to Veii an
                    army consisting in a great measure of volunteers. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The tribunes were Titus Quintius Capitolinus,
                    Publius Quintius Cincinnatus, Caius Julius Julus a second time, Aulus Manlius,
                    Lucius Furius Medullinus a second time, and Manius Aemilius Mamercinus.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> By these Veii was first invested. A little
                    before the commencement of this siege, when a full meeting of the Etrurians was
                    held at the temple of Voltumna, it was not finally determined whether the
                    Veientians were to be supported by the public concurrence of the whole
                    confederacy. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The siege was less vigorous in
                    the following year, some of the tribunes and their army being called off to the
                    Volscian war. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The military tribunes with
                    consular power in this year were Caius Valerius Potitus a third time, Manius
                    Largius Fidenas, Publius Cornelius Maluginensis, Cneius Cornelius Cossus, Kaeso
                    Fabius Ambustus, Spurius Nautius Rutilus a second time. A pitched battle <pb
                        n="321" xml:id="p.321"/> was fought with the Volscians between Ferentinum
                    and Ecetra; the result of the battle was favourable to the Romans. <milestone
                        n="5" unit="section"/> Artena then, a town of the Volscians, began to be
                    besieged by the tribunes. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Thence during an
                    attempt at a sally, the enemy being driven back into the town, an opportunity
                    was afforded to the Romans of forcing in; and every place was taken except the
                    citadel. Into the fortress, well protected by nature, a body of armed men
                    retired. Beneath he fortress many were slain and made prisoners. <milestone
                        n="7" unit="section"/> The citadel was then besieged; nor could it either be
                    taken by storm, because it had a garrison sufficient for the size of the place,
                    nor did it hold out any hope of surrender, all the public corn having been
                    conveyed to the citadel before the city was taken; <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> and they would have retired from it, being wearied out, had
                    not a slave betrayed the fortress to the Romans: the soldiers being admitted by
                    him through a place difficult of access, took it; by whom when the guards were
                    being killed, the rest of the multitude, overpowered with sudden panic,
                    surrendered. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> After demolishing both the
                    citadel and city of Artena, the legions were led back from the Volscian
                    territory; and the whole Roman power was turned against Veii. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> To the traitor, besides his freedom, the property of two
                    families was given as a reward. His name was Servius Romanus. There are some who
                    think that Artena belonged to the Veientians, not to the Volscians. <milestone
                        n="11" unit="section"/> What occasions the mistake is that there was a city
                    of the same name between Caere and Veii. But the Roman kings destroyed it; and
                    it belonged to the Caeretians, not to the Veientians. The other of the same
                    name, the demolition of which has been mentioned, was in the Volscian territory.
