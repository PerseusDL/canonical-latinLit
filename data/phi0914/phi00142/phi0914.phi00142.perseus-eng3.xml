                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The first business of the new consuls was
                        to consult the senate about their provinces and armies. It was decreed that
                        they should both have Liguria for their province and they were each to raise
                        two fresh legions for service in that province and also 10,000 infantry and
                        600 cavalry from the Latin allies. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> They
                        were also required to call up 3000 Roman infantry and 200 cavalry to
                        reinforce the army in Spain. A further force of 1500 infantry and 100
                        cavalry was to be raised for the operations in Corsica. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> M. Atilius was to remain in charge of Sardinia till his
                        successor arrived. Then the praetors balloted for their provinces.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> A. Atilius Serranus received the civic
                        and C. Cluvius Saxula the alien jurisdiction; Hither Spain fell to N. Fabius
                        Buteo; Further Spain to C. Matienus; Sicily to M. Furius Crassipes; Sardinia
                        to C. Cicereius. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Before the magistrates
                        left for their provinces the senate decided that L. Postumius should go into
                        Campania to fix the boundaries between the State land and the land in
                        private occupation. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> It was a matter of
                        common knowledge that persons had appropriated a large part of the State
                        domain by gradually advancing their boundaries. Postumius was angry with the
                        Praenestines because when he had gone there in a private capacity to offer a
                        sacrifice in the temple of Fortune, he had not received any marks of honour,
                        either publicly or privately. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> So before he
                        left Rome he sent a despatch to Praeneste ordering the chief magistrate to
                        go out and meet him, to have a place prepared by the municipality where he
                        could stay, and to see that pack animals were ready to carry his luggage
                        when he left. No one before this consul had ever been a burden or expense to
                        the allies. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The magistrates were provided
                        with mules and tents and all other requisites simply that they might not
                        requisition anything of the kind from the allies; they enjoyed the
                        hospitality of private citizens whom they treated with courtesy and
                        consideration; <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> and their own houses in
                        Rome were open to those with whom they were accustomed to stay. <milestone
                            n="10" unit="section"/> When officials were despatched to some place on
                        a sudden emergency they only demanded one mule apiece from the towns through
                        which their journey lay. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> No other expense
                        was incurred by the allies in the case of Roman magistrates. The
                        vindictiveness of the consul, even if justifiable, ought not in any case to
                        have appeared while he was in office. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The
                        Praenestines unfortunately, whether through modesty or timidity, allowed the
                        matter to pass without protest, and this silence furnished the magistrates
                        with a legal colouring, as though following an unquestioned precedent, to
                        demands which became continuously more burdensome. </p>

                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> At the beginning of the year, the
                        commissioners who had visited Aetolia and Macedonia brought back word that
                        no opportunity had been afforded them of meeting Perseus. Some made out that
                        he was ill; others that he was away from home; both stories being equally
                        false. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> It was, however, quite clear that
                        warlike preparations were on foot, and that it would not be long before
                        Perseus resorted to arms. In Aetolia intestine quarrels were increasing in
                        violence day by day, and the leaders of the opposing factions refused to be
                        kept in check by their authority. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> As it
                        was fully expected that there would be war with Macedonia, it was decided
                        that portents should be expiated and prayers offered to win "the peace of
                        the Gods," of those deities, namely, who were mentioned in the Books of
                        Fate. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> At Lanuvium the sight of a great
                        fleet had been witnessed in the heavens; at Privernum the earth had brought
                        forth dark-coloured wool; at Remens in the Veientine district there had been
                        a shower of stones; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> the whole of the
                        Pomptine country had been covered with clouds of locusts; in a field in Gaul
                        where the plough was at work, fishes emerged from the turned-up clods.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> In consequence of these portents the
                        Books of Fate were consulted, and the Keepers announced to what deities and
                        with what victims sacrifices were to be offered; they further ordered
                        special intercessions for the expiation of the portents, and also others in
                        fulfilment of the vow taken by the people the previous year on the occasion
                        of the pestilence. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> All was done as the
                        Sacred Books ordered. </p>

                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="3" type="chapter">
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> It was in this year that the temple of
                        Juno Lacinia was unroofed. Q. Fulvius Flaccus, the censor, was building the
                        temple of Fortuna Equestris and was quite determined that there should be no
                        larger or more magnificent temple in Rome. He had vowed this temple during
                        the Celtiberian war, whilst acting as praetor in Spain. <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> The beauty of the temple would be enhanced, he thought,
                        if it were roofed with marble tiles, and with this object he went down to
                        Bruttium and stripped off half the roof from the temple of Juno Lacinia, as
                        he considered this would furnish sufficient tiles to cover his temple.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Ships were in readiness to transport
                        them, and the natives were deterred by the authority of the censor from any
                        attempt to prevent the sacrilege. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> On the
                        censor's return the tiles were unloaded and carried to the new temple.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Although no hint was dropped as to
                        where they came from, concealment was impossible. Protests were heard in the
                        House, and there was a general demand that the consuls should bring the
                        matter before the senate. The censor was summoned, and his appearance called
                        forth still more bitter reproaches from all sides. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> Not content, he was told, with violating the noblest
                        temple in that part of the world, a temple which neither Pyrrhus nor
                        Hannibal had violated, he did not rest till he had cruelly defaced it and
                        almost destroyed it. With its pediment gone and its roof stripped off, it
                        lay open to moulder and decay in the rain. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                        The censor is appointed to regulate the public morals; the man who had,
                        following ancient usage, been charged to see that the buildings for public
                        worship are properly closed in and that they are kept in repair-this very
                        man is roaming about amongst the cities of our allies ruining their temples
                        and stripping off the roofs of their sacred edifices. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> Even in the case of private buildings such conduct
                        would be thought disgraceful, but he is demolishing the temples of the
                        immortal gods. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> By building and beautifying
                        one temple out of the ruins of another he is involving the people of Rome in
                        the guilt of impiety, as though the immortal gods are not the same
                        everywhere, but some must be honoured and adorned with the spoils of others.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> It was quite clear what the feeling
                        of the House was even before the question was put, and when it was put they
                        were unanimous in deciding that those tiles should be carried back to the
                        temple and that expiatory sacrifices should be offered to Juno. <milestone
                            n="11" unit="section"/> The religious duty was carefully discharged, but
                        the contractors reported that as there was no one who understood how to
                        replace the tiles they had been left in the precinct of the temple. </p>

                        his way to take charge of the province of Hither Spain, died at Marseilles.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> On receiving the information of his
                        death, the senate decreed that P. Furius and Cn. Servilius, whose successors
                        had been already appointed, should decide by ballot which of them should

                        off by equal instalments in ten years. Affairs in Perrhaebia were settled in

                        The obstinacy of the fighting proved costly to the Ligurians; 10,000 men are

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> This year the lustrum was closed. The
                        censors were Q. Fulvius Flaccus and A. Postumius Albinus; Postumius closed
                        the lustrum. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The number of Roman citizens
                        as shown by the census was 269,015, a somewhat smaller number than the
                        previous one. This was owing to the fact that, as the consul explained to
                        the Assembly, all those who had to return to their own cities in compliance
                        with the consul's edict were registered in their own places of residence,
                        none of them in Rome. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The censors had
                        discharged their functions in perfect harmony and in the best interests of
                        the commonwealth. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> All those whom they
                        struck off the senatorial roll, or degraded from the order of the equites,
                        they placed amongst the aerarii and expelled from the tribes, and neither of
                        them retained any name which the other censor had rejected. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> Fulvius dedicated the temple of Fortuna Equestris,
                        which he had vowed six years previously when fighting with the Celtiberi. He
                        also exhibited the Scenic Games for four days and those in the Circus
                        Maximus for one day. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> L. Cornelius
                        Lentulus, one of the Keepers of the Sacred Books, died this year, and A.
                        Postumius Albinus was appointed in his place. Such clouds of locusts invaded
                        Apulia from the sea that they covered the fields far and wide with their
                        swarms. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> To get rid of this destruction to
                        the crops Cn. Sicinius was sent with full powers into Apulia and spent a
                        considerable time in getting together an enormous number of men to collect
                        them. </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The following year in which C. Popilius
                        and P. Aelius were the consuls began with the dispute left over from the
                        year before. The senators wanted to discuss the question of the Ligurians
                        and to reaffirm their resolution. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The
                        consul Aelius brought the matter up for discussion; <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> Popilius, on his brother's behalf, tried to dissuade
                        both his colleague and the senate from taking any further action and
                        publicly gave out that if they made any decree he should oppose it. He
                        deterred his colleague from going any further; the senate were all the more
                        incensed against both consuls and insisted on carrying the matter through.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> So when the allocation of provinces
                        came up and the consuls were anxious to have Macedonia, as a war with
                        Perseus was now imminent, the senate decreed Liguria as the province for
                        both consuls. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> They refused to decree
                        Macedonia unless the case of M. Popilius was gone into. The consuls then
                        demanded to be allowed to raise fresh armies or else reinforcements for the
                        old armies. Both requests were refused. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                        Two of the praetors asked for reinforcements: M. Junius for Hither Spain and
                        Sp. Lucretius for Further Spain. Their request was also refused. <milestone
                            n="14" unit="section"/> C. Licinius Crassus had received the civic and
                        Cn. Sicinius the alien jurisdiction; C. Memmius had Sicily allotted to him,
                        and Sp. Cluvius Sardinia. The consuls were angry with the senate for the
                        course they had taken, and <milestone n="15??" unit="section"/> after fixing
                        the Latin Festival at the earliest possible date, gave notice that they
                        should leave for their province and would transact no public business beyond
                        what was connected with the administration of the provinces. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Valerius Antias writes that Attalus, the
                        brother of Eumenes, went to Rome at this time to lay charges against Perseus
                        and to describe his preparations for war. The majority of annalists, and
                        certainly those whom you would prefer to believe, state that Eumenes came in
                        person. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> When he arrived in Rome he was
                        received with all the honours which the people of Rome considered due to his
                        own merits and quite as much so to the kindnesses which they had heaped upon
                        him in such profusion. After being introduced to the senate he said that he
                        was visiting Rome for two reasons. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> One was
                        his great desire to make acquaintance with the gods and men to whose
                        beneficence he owed his present prosperity, which was such that he did not
                        venture even to wish for anything beyond it. The other reason was that he
                        might warn the senate of the necessity of thwarting the projects of Perseus.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Beginning with a review of Philip's
                        policy he narrated the circumstances of the death of Demetrius, who was
                        opposed to war with Rome. "The Bastarnae," he continued, "were induced to
                        leave their homes that he might have their assistance in the invasion of
                        Italy. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Whilst revolving these schemes in
                        his mind he was surprised by death and left the crown to one whom he knew to
                        be Rome's greatest enemy. The war had thus been left as a heritage to
                        Perseus by his father, bequeathed to him together with the crown, and from
                        the first day of his rule all his plans were laid to feed and foster it.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> He has abundant resources; the long
                        years of peace have produced a numerous progeny of men of military age;
                        moreover he is in the prime of life, in the full strength of manhood, and
                        with a mind strengthened and disciplined in the science and practice of war.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> From his boyhood he has shared his
                        father's tent and has thus gained experience not only in border wars, but
                        even in the wars with Rome in the various expeditions on which he has been
                        sent. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> From the day he ascended the throne
                        he has been marvellously successful in accomplishing many things which his
                        father, after trying every means, was unable to effect either by force or
                        craft; <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> and his power is enhanced by a
                        personal authority such as is only gained by great and numerous merits in a

                        to discuss other questions. One of these was from Rhodes, and its leader had
                        no doubt whatever that Eumenes had included his city in the indictment
                        against Perseus. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Consequently he made
                        every effort through his friends and patrons to get an opportunity of
                        meeting the king in argument before the senate. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> As he did not succeed he denounced the king in
                        unmeasured invective, declaring that he had stirred up the Lycians against
                        the Rhodians and was much more oppressive to Asia than Antiochus had ever
                        been. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> This language pleased the populace
                        whose sympathies were with Perseus, but it was resented by the senate and

                        nations, especially those who represented monarchy. Through this he became
                        known to Perseus, though he was in a different part of the world, and when

                        and consequently of high fortune, he paid a visit to the king. <milestone

                        As all the Roman generals and ambassadors usually accepted his hospitality,
                        Perseus suggested that he should arrange for poison to be administered to

                        knew that the preparation of poison was extremely difficult and dangerous,

                        uncertainty as to its working, whether it will be strong enough to

                        promised to do what the king asked, and started for home. He did not,
                        however, want to return to Brundisium before he saw C. Valerius, who was

                        augurs was to the effect that the portent would prove to be favourable, for
                        it portended the widening of frontiers and the destruction of enemies; those
                        ships' beaks which the storm had thrown down had been taken as spoils from
                        the enemy. Other incidents increased the religious terrors. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> It was reported that showers of blood had been falling
                        for three days at Saturnia; an ass was foaled with three legs, and a bull
                        with five cows had been destroyed by a single flash of lightning at Calatia;
                        at Auximium there had been a shower of earth. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> In expiation of these portents, sacrifices were offered
                        and special intercessions for one day, which was observed as a solemn
                        holiday. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Up to this time the consuls had not left
                        for their province. They did not comply with the desire of the senate to
                        bring up the question of Popilius, and the senators were determined not to
                        make any decrees till this was settled. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                        The feeling against Popilius was intensified by a despatch received from him
                        in which he stated that he had fought another battle with the Statellati and
                        had killed 6000 of them. This iniquitous proceeding of his drove the rest of
                        the Ligurians to arms. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Now, however, it
                        was not only the absent Popilius who was attacked in the senate for having,
                        in defiance of all law, human and divine, commenced an aggressive war upon a
                        people who had made their submission; the consuls also were severely
                        censured for not having gone to their province. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> This attitude of the senate determined two of the
                        tribunes of the plebs-M. Marcius Sermo and Q. Marcius Scylla-to warn the
                        consuls that if they did not go to their province they should impose a fine
                        on them. They also read to the senate the terms of a proposal which they
                        intended to bring forward regarding the treatment of the Ligurians after
                        they had made their submission. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> It was to
                        the effect that where any of the Statellati who had made their surrender had
                        not been restored to liberty by August 1, the senate should on oath empower
                        a magistrate to seek out and punish the persons through whose criminal act
                        they had passed into slavery. This order, thus sanctioned by the senate, was
                        announced to the Assembly. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Before the
                        consuls left the City the senate gave an audience to C. Cicereius in the
                        temple of Bellona. He gave an account. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> of what he had done in Corsica, but his
                        request for a triumph was refused, and he celebrated his triumph on the
                        Alban Mount, without the sanction of the senate, a thing which had become
                        quite customary. Marcius's proposal about the Ligurians received the hearty
                        assent of the plebs, and was carried. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                        Acting on this plebiscite, C. Licinius consulted the senate as to whom they
                        would choose to conduct the enquiry, and the senators ordered him to conduct
                        it himself. </p>

                        province and took over the army from M. Popilius. <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> He did not venture to return to Rome, where the senate
                        were hostile, and the people still more so, for fear of having to stand his
                        trial before the praetor who had submitted to the senate the resolution
                        against him. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> His refusal to appear was met
                        by the tribunes of the plebs with the menace of a second resolution to be
                        submitted to the effect that if he had not entered the City of Rome by
                        November 13, Licinius should judge and determine his case in his absence.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Dragged home by this chain he found
                        himself the object of universal odium in the senate. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> After many of the senators had lashed him with bitter
                        invectives, the House passed a resolution that the praetors C. Licinius and
                        Cn. Sicinius should make it their business to restore to liberty all
                        Ligurians who had not been in arms against Rome since the consulship of Q.
                        Fulvius and L. Manlius, and that the consul C. Popilius should make them a
                        grant of land on the other side of the Po. By this resolution many thousands
                        recovered their freedom and <milestone n="6??" unit="section"/> they were
                        transported across the Po where land was assigned to them. M. Popilius,
                        under the Marcian Decree, appeared on two occasions before C. Licinius.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> On the third day of his trial the
                        praetor, out of regard for his brother the consul, and yielding to the
                        entreaties of the Popilian family, ordered the defendant to appear again on
                        March 15, the day on which the new magistrates would enter upon office, so
                        that he might not have to adjudicate, being no longer a magistrate.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> In this way the decree respecting the

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> A deputation from Carthage was in Rome at
                        that time, as was also Gulussa, Masinissa's son. There was a hot dispute
                        between them in the senate-house. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The
                        grievance of the Carthaginians was that in addition to the territory which
                        had been adjudicated on the spot by the Roman commissioners, Masinissa had
                        during the last two years taken forcible possession of more than seventy
                        towns and forts standing on Carthaginian soil; an easy matter for a man who
                        had no scruples. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> As the Carthaginians were
                        bound by their treaty they took no action, for they were forbidden
                            <milestone n="4??" unit="section"/> to carry their arms outside their
                        frontiers, though they knew quite well that if they were to drive the
                        Numidians out, they would be warring within their own frontiers. They were,
                        however, deterred by a clear clause in the treaty, which expressly forbade
                        them to engage in war with the allies of Rome. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> But the Carthaginians declared that they could no
                        longer endure his insolence and cruelty and avarice; and they explained that
                        they were sent to implore the senate to grant them one of three things,
                        either themselves to decide, as between a king and a people, both of whom
                        were their allies, what belonged to each; <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        or to leave the Carthaginians at liberty to defend themselves against unjust
                        attacks in a just and righteous war; or, finally, if personal bias rather
                        than truth swayed the senate, that they should settle once for all how much
                        of other people's property they wished to make a present of to Masinissa.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The senate would at all events make
                        their gift a more moderate one if they were to know what they had given,
                        whereas Masinissa would fix no limits other than what his greed and ambition
                        might determine. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> If they were not to
                        obtain any of these requests, and if they had in any way given offence since
                        Scipio granted them peace, then let the Romans themselves punish them; they
                        preferred the security of servitude under Roman masters rather than a
                        liberty exposed to Masinissa's lawlessness. <milestone n="9" unit="section"

                        have been easy for his father to give him instructions, for the
                        Carthaginians had given no indication of the question they were going to
                        raise or even of their intention to visit Rome. <milestone n="3"

                        in secret conclave in the temple of Aesculapius, and in addition to other

                            n="4" unit="section"/> This was his father's reason for sending him to
                        Rome, to ask the senate not to give any credit to the charges which their
                        common foe was bringing against him; the only reason for their hatred was
                        his unswerving loyalty to the people of Rome. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> After giving both sides a hearing the senate debated
                        the requests of the Carthaginians and ordered the following reply to be
                        given: "It is the pleasure of the senate that Gulussa sets out at once for
                        Numidia and announces to his father that he must send envoys to the senate
                        as soon as possible to deal with the complaints of the Carthaginians;
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> he must also warn the Carthaginians to
                        appear and state their case. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The senate is
                        prepared to accord to Masinissa all possible honours in the future as they
                        have done in the past, but they cannot let personal regard take the place of
                        justice. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> They wish every man to remain in
                        possession of his own land; it is not their intention to fix new boundaries,
                        but to preserve the old ones. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> When the
                        Carthaginians were vanquished they allowed them to retain their city and
                        their land; but this was not that they might rob them in a time of peace of

                        a treaty had been concluded with Philip and, after his father's death,
                        renewed with him; that in it were clauses expressly forbidding him to carry
                        his arms beyond his frontiers or to make hostile aggression upon the allies
                        of Rome. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Then they repeated to him what

                        intemperate. He accused the Romans of greed and arrogance, and loudly
                        protested against their sending one mission after another to spy upon his
                        words and actions, because they thought it right that he should say and do

                        At last, after a long and violent harangue, he told them to return on the

                            unit="section"/> In this he is said to have declared that the treaty
                        concluded with his father had nothing to do with him; he had consented to
                        its renewal not because he approved of it, but because having just come to
                        the throne he had to submit to everything. If they wanted to make a fresh
                        treaty with him they must come to an understanding as to its terms.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> If they could bring themselves to
                        conclude a treaty on equal terms for both parties, he would see what he had

                        and they were all beginning to leave the audience-chamber, but not before
                        the commissioners replied that they formally renounced his alliance and

                        promised to Rome, the senate ordered the consuls to summon a meeting of the

                        "Whereas Perseus, the son of Philip and King of Macedonia, has broken the

                        whereas he has formed plans for levying war on the people of Rome, and has
                        to this end got together arms, soldiers and ships; be it resolved that war
                        be made upon him unless he gives satisfaction for all these things."
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> This resolution was put to the

                        should come to a mutual arrangement about their provinces of Italy and
                        Macedonia; failing that, to have recourse to the ballot. The one to whom
                        Macedonia fell was to seek redress by force of arms from Perseus, and those

                        consul. A special provision was made for Macedonia. For the other consul
                        each of the two legions consisted, according to ancient precedent, of 5200
                        infantry; those for Macedonia were each raised to 6000 infantry, and the
                        four legions had each the same complement of 300 cavalry. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> The numbers of the allied contingent were also raised
                        for this consul; he was to transport to Macedonia 16,000 infantry and 800
                        cavalry, in addition to the 600 cavalry whom Sicinius had commanded.

                        600 cavalry was considered sufficient for Italy. The consul who was to
                        command in Macedonia was specially empowered to enrol as many veteran
                        centurions and private soldiers as he desired up to fifty years of age.

                        innovation was made this year in the case of the military tribunes. The

                        that they should for that year forgo their claim to elect the military
                        tribunes and leave the consuls and praetors free to appoint them. <milestone

                        Supplies for the fleet and the legions were to be furnished by Sicily and
                        Sardinia, and the praetors in charge of those islands were charged to
                        requisition a second tenth from the natives, the corn to be carried to the

                        The praetor who remained at the disposal of the senate was C. Lucretius

                        serious dispute-about their province. Cassius said that he was ready to
                        choose Macedonia without a ballot, as his colleague could not ballot with
                        him without violating his oath. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> When he
                        was made praetor he took an oath before the Assembly that he could not go to

                        stated days, and they could not be duly offered in his absence, when he was

                        Even should the senate not consider P. Licinius' wishes now that he was

                        When the matter was put to the vote, the senators thought it would be a
                        high-handed proceeding to refuse a province to the man to whom the people of
                        Rome had not refused the consulship, and ordered the consuls to proceed to
                        ballot. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> P. Licinius obtained Macedonia,
                        and C. Cassius, Italy. They then drew lots for the legions; the first and
                        third were to be taken to Macedonia; the second and fourth to remain in
                        Italy. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The consuls carried out the
                        mobilisation with much more care than at other times. Licinius called up the
                        old soldiers and centurions, and many volunteers gave in their names because
                        they saw that those who had served in the former Macedonian war or against
                        Antiochus were rich men. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The military
                        tribunes were choosing the centurions, not in order of precedence, but
                        picking out the best men, and twenty-three centurions of the front rank
                        appealed to the tribunes of the plebs. Two members of the tribunitian
                        college were for referring the matter to the consuls, on the ground that the
                        decision ought to rest with those to whom the mobilisation had been
                        entrusted. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The rest said they would go
                        into the reasons of the appeal, and if an injustice had been done, they

                        should be tried before the Assembly, and the Assembly was accordingly

                        behalf of the centurions. He reminded the Assembly that these men had
                        completed their term of military service, and were worn out by age and
                        incessant toil. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Still, they in no way

                        and against an extremely powerful monarch, or which would prevent the consul
                        from assigning to each man the rank which, in the best interests of the

                    <p> There was a meeting of the national council of Thessaly at Larisa. The

                        Close on this meeting came a deputation from Perseus. Their hopes of success

                        from his father. After alluding to this the delegates asked that the king

                        Marcius said that he heard from his father that friendly relations had

                        party thought that precedence ought to be given to royalty, the other
                        considered that something was due to the great name of Rome, especially as
                        it was Perseus who had sought the interview. <milestone n="5" unit="section"

                        "Philippus"-"the son to the father." The king fell in with this at once.
                        Then a fresh difficulty arose as to the number that should accompany him.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The king thought that he ought to

                        ordered the citizens to place themselves at the disposal of the

                        envoys to Rome to carry on the peace negotiations which he had begun with
                        Marcius, and he gave them letters to take to Byzantium and Rhodes. The
                        purport of the letters was the same for all, he had had an interview with
                        the Roman commissioners. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> What he had heard
                        and said was put in such a way as to make it appear that he had the best of

                        peace, for it was on the advice of Marcius and Atilius that they were sent
                        to Rome. If the Romans in violation of the treaty proceeded to war, then the
                        Rhodians must use all their influence and all their power to restore peace,
                        but if their appeals proved fruitless, then they must make it their business
                        to prevent the power and authority over the whole world from passing into
                        the hands of one single nation. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> That was
                        the concern of all the nations, but especially of the Rhodians, by how much
                        the more they surpassed other nations in greatness and prosperity, but they
                        would be enslaved and helpless if they paid no regard to any but the Romans.

                        citizens prevailed. The answer which they decided to give was to the effect

                        Romans, a friendship which was the fruit of many valuable services rendered

                        The thing for which they took most credit to themselves was the way in which
                        they had hoodwinked the king by holding out hopes of peace. <milestone n="2"

                        every way. They had also succeeded by a clever stroke in breaking up the
                        national council of Boeotia, they could never again be united in support of
                        the Macedonians. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> A good many of the

                        others who had not forgotten the moral standards of earlier days, said that
                        they failed to recognise anything of the Roman character in these
                        negotiations. "Our ancestors," they said, "did not conduct their wars by
                        lurking in ambush and making attacks at night, nor by feigning flight and
                        then turning back upon the enemy when he was off his guard. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> They did not pride themselves on cunning more than on
                        true courage, it was their custom to declare war before commencing it,
                        sometimes even to give the enemy notice of the time and place where they
                        would fight. This sense of honour made them warn Pyrrhus against his
                        physician, who was <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/> plotting against his
                        life, it made them hand over to the Faliscans as a prisoner the betrayer of
                        their children. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> This is the true Roman
                        spirit, there is nothing here of the cunning of the Carthaginians or the
                        cleverness of the Greeks, who pride themselves more in deceiving an enemy
                        than in overcoming him in fair fight. Occasionally more can be gained for
                        the time being by craft than by courage, but it is only when you have forced
                        your enemy to confess that he has been overcome not by cleverness nor by
                        accident, but after a fair trial of strength where the rules of war are
                        properly observed-it is only then that his spirit is broken and his defeat a

                        preferred expediency to honour and signified their approval of what Marcius
                        had done. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> It was decided that he should
                        be sent back to Greece with the fifty quinqueremes, and should be at full

                        of Perseus sending a garrison there on the expiration of the armistice, and

                        plotting against the life of Eumenes was the most laboured part of their
                        speech and the one which made the least impression, for the facts were

                        marching through Epirus he found the country clear and open, but when he had
                        crossed the frontiers of Athamania he had to advance over rough and almost
                        impassable ground. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> It was with the utmost
                        difficulty and by short marches that he struggled through to Gomphi. If with
                        horses and men knocked up and an army of recruits he had been met by the
                        king with a couple of hundred men in order of battle, at a time and place of

                        themselves do not deny that they would have suffered a terrible defeat.

                        fighting, there was not only rejoicing at having surmounted a dangerous
                        pass, but also a feeling of contempt for an enemy who was so blind to his
                        advantages. After duly performing the sacrifices and giving out corn to the
                        soldiers, the consul stayed there a few days to rest both man and beast.

                        arrived at this time with his ships at Chalcis. He was accompanied by his

                        to join the consul, 2000 infantry being left in Chalcis under the command of
                        Athenaeus. Other contingents came in from all the Greek States, most of them
                        so small that they have passed into oblivion. <milestone n="9"

                        the same number from Samos and also five Rhodian quadriremes. As there was
                        no naval war, the praetor sent the vessels back to the various allies.

                        to reconnoitre. It was about the fourth hour of the day, and when he was
                        little more than a mile distant from the Roman camp, Perseus ordered the

                        on all previous occasions the enemy had never appeared before the fourth

                        were all in high spirits, but the Thracians surpassed all in the insolence
                        of their joy. They returned to camp singing and carrying the heads of their

                        Romans there was not only grief at their defeat, but a fear lest the enemy
                        should make a sudden attack on the camp. Eumenes urged the consul to
                        transfer the camp to the opposite bank of the Peneus, that they might have
                        the protection of the river until the shaken soldiers could recover their

                        before, but still more so in remaining inactive through the night, for had

                        were relieved from the danger of an immediate attack, but they were much

                        circumstances, and to curb and restrain the feelings in a time of
                        prosperity. The reply decided upon was that peace would be granted only on
                        the condition that the king placed himself entirely in the hands of the
                        senate and allowed it the unrestricted right of determining his future and

                        peace at a price, persisted in his attempts to bribe the consul by

                        works was too slow, the praetor ordered the scaling-ladders to be

                        it be possible to do so. At a point where two towers and the wall between
                        them had been battered down he brought up a picked force of 2000 men in

                    <p> When the standing corn was cut all round their camp, the Romans moved on to
                        Crannon, where the fields were yet untouched. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> Here they remained encamped for some time as they were
                        secure against attack, owing partly to the distance from Sycurium and partly
                        to the difficulty of obtaining water on the road from that place. Suddenly,
                        one morning at daybreak, they were greatly excited at seeing the king's
                        cavalry and light infantry on a range of hills overlooking the camp.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> These had started from Sycurium at
                        noon the day before, and just before dawn left the infantry behind on the
                        nearest level ground. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Perseus halted for
                        some time on the hills, thinking that the Romans might be drawn into a
                        cavalry action. As they made no movement, he sent a trooper with orders to
                        the infantry to march back to Sycurium, and in a short time rode after them.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The Roman cavalry followed at a
                        moderate interval to pick up stragglers. When they saw the massed infantry
                        marching off in unbroken ranks, they too returned to camp. </p>

                        king and he advanced his camp to Mopselus. The Romans, having cut all the
                        standing corn round Crannon, moved into the district of Phalanna. <milestone
                            n="2" unit="section"/> The king learnt from a deserter that the Romans
                        were dispersed over the country, cutting the corn, without any remaining on
                        guard. He started off with 1000 cavalry and 2000 Thracian and Cretan light
                        infantry. Marching with the utmost possible speed he attacked the Romans
                        when they were least expecting it. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Nearly
                        1000 carts most of them loaded, were captured with their teams, and also 600
                        prisoners taken. He gave the plunder to the Cretans to escort back to their
                        camp. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Then he recalled the cavalry and the
                        rest of the infantry, who were everywhere slaughtering the enemy, <milestone
                            n="5??" unit="section"/> and led them against the nearest detachment who
                        were on guard, thinking to overwhelm them without much trouble. <milestone
                            n="6" unit="section"/> A military tribune, L. Pomponius, was in command
                        of the detachment and withdrew his men, who were dismayed by the sudden
                        appearance of the enemy, to a hill near by, to serve as a defensive position
                        since he was inferior in numbers and strength. Here he made his soldiers
                        close up in a circular formation, with their shields touching one another,
                        so that they might be protected from the arrows and javelins. </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Perseus surrounded the hill with his
                        troops and ordered one body to attempt the ascent of the hill and come to
                        close quarters with the enemy, whilst the others discharged their missiles
                        from a distance. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The Romans were in very
                        great danger, for they could not fight in close order against those who were
                        struggling up the hill, and if they left their ranks and ran forward they
                        were exposed to the javelins and arrows. They suffered mainly from the
                        cestrosphendons, a novel kind of weapon invented during the war. <milestone
                            n="9" unit="section"/> It consisted of a pointed iron head two palms
                        long, fastened to a shaft made of pinewood, nine inches long and as thick as
                        a man's finger. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Round the shaft three
                        feathers were fastened as in the case of arrows, and the sling was held by
                        two thongs, one shorter than the other. When the missile was poised in the
                        centre of the sling, the slinger whirled it round with great force and it
                        flew out like a leaden bullet. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Many of
                        the soldiers were wounded by these and by missiles of all kinds, and they
                        were becoming so exhausted that they were hardly capable of holding their
                        weapons. Seeing this, the king urged them to surrender and pledged his word
                        for their safety and promised to reward them. Not a single man had any
                        thought of surrender. They had made up their minds to die, when an
                        unlooked-for gleam of hope appeared. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Some
                        of the foragers, who had fled to the camp, informed the consul that the
                        detachment on guard was surrounded. Alarmed for the safety of so many
                        fellow-citizens-there were about 800, all Romans-he sallied forth from the
                        camp with a force of cavalry and infantry, including the new reinforcement
                        of Numidian horse and foot, as well as the elephants. The order was given to
                        the military tribunes to follow with the legionaries. <milestone n="13"
                            unit="section"/> Bringing up the velites to stiffen the auxiliary light
                        infantry, he went forward to the hill. Eumenes, Attalus and Misagenes, the
                        Numidian leader, rode by his side. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> As soon as they caught sight of the
                        leading files of their comrades, the spirits of the Romans revived from the
                        depths of despair. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Perseus should have
                        made up his mind after capturing and killing several of the foragers to
                        content himself with this chance success, and not wasted time in
                        beleaguering the detachment. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Or if he did
                        attempt that he ought to have left the field while he could do so safely, as
                        he knew he had no heavy infantry with him. Elated with his success he waited
                        till the enemy appeared, and then sent a hurried message to bring up the
                        phalanx. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> It was too late to do this now.
                        The phalanx, hastily brought into action and disarranged by the speed of its
                        advance, had to meet troops in proper formation and ready for battle.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The consul, who was first on the
                        ground, at once engaged the enemy. For a short time the Macedonians held
                        their own, but they were completely outmatched, and with a loss of 300
                        infantry and 24 of the select cavalry of the "sacred cohort," including
                        their commander Antimachus, they attempted to leave the field. <milestone
                            n="6" unit="section"/> But there was almost more turmoil on their return
                        march than in the battle itself. The phalanx, called up so hurriedly,
                        marched off with equal haste, but where the road narrowed they met the troop
                        of prisoners and the carts loaded with corn, and were brought to a
                        standstill. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> There was great excitement and
                        uproar; no one would wait until the troops of the phalanx could make their
                        way through; the soldiers threw the carts over the cliff, the only way of
                        clearing the road, and the animals were lashed till they charged madly among
                        the crowd. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Hardly had they got clear of
                        the column of prisoners when they met the king and his discomfited cavalry,
                        who shouted to them to face about and march back. This created a commotion
                        almost as great as the crash of a falling house; if the enemy had continued
                        the pursuit and ventured into the pass, there might have been a terrible
                        disaster. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The consul, satisfied with this
                        slight success, recalled the detachment from the hill and returned to camp.
                        According to some authorities, a great battle was fought that day, 8000 of
                        the enemy slain, amongst them two of the king's generals, Sopater and
                        Antipater, 2800 made prisoners, and 27 military standards captured.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Nor was the victory a bloodless one.
                        Above 4300 fell in the consul's army, and 5 standards belonging to the left
                        wing lost. </p>

                        and depressed Perseus, so much so that after staying a few days longer at
                        Mopselus, mainly to see to the burial of the men he had lost, he placed a
                        sufficiently strong garrison in Gonnus and withdrew his troops into
                        Macedonia. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> One of the royal governors,
                        Timotheus, was left with a small force at Phila with instructions to try and

                        quarters and then went with Cotys to Thessalonica. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> News reached him there that Autlebis, a Thracian chief,
                        and Corragus, an officer of Eumenes, had invaded the dominions of Cotys and
                        occupied a district called Marene. He felt that he ought to release Cotys
                        and let him go and defend his kingdom. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> On
                        his departure he bestowed valuable presents on him. To his cavalry he only
                        doled out 200 talents, half a year's pay, though at first he had agreed to
                        give them a year's stipend. </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> When the consul heard that Perseus had
                        gone he marched up to Gonnus on the chance of getting possession of the
                        town. This place lies at the entrance to the Vale of Tempe, and forms a
                        secure barrier against the invasion of Macedonia from that side, while it
                        affords a convenient descent for the Macedonians into Thessaly. <milestone

                        strength of its garrison, was impregnable, the consul abandoned the attempt.
                        Turning his route towards Perrhaebia he took Malloea at the first assault
                        and sacked the town. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> After securing
                        Tripolis and the other places in Perrhaebia he returned to Larisa. Eumenes
                        and Attalus went home, and the consul settled Misagenes and his Numidians in
                        the nearest cities of Thessaly. Part of his army he distributed amongst all
                        the cities of Thessaly, that they might have comfortable winter quarters and
                        serve as garrisons for the cities. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Q.
                        Mucius was sent with 2000 men to hold Ambracia, and the consul disbanded all

                        Advancing with a part of his army into Achaean Phthiotis he razed to its
                        foundations the city of Pteleum, from which the inhabitants had fled, and
                        accepted the voluntary surrender of Antronae. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> Then he brought his army up to Larisa. The city was
                        empty; all the population had taken refuge in the citadel, and he commenced
                        an attack upon it. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The king's garrison of
                        Macedonians had first left the place through fear, and the townsmen, thus
                        deserted, at once surrendered. He now hesitated whether to attack Demetrias
                        or examine the position in Boeotia. The Thebans, owing to the trouble given
                        them by the Coronaeans, were asking hum to come to their assistance.
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> In compliance with their request and
                        also because it was more suitable for winter quarters than Magnesia, he led
