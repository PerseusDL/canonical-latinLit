                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Spring was now coming on; Hannibal
                        accordingly moved out of his winter quarters. His previous attempt to cross
                        the Apennines had been frustrated by the insupportable cold; to remain where
                        he was would have been to court danger. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                        The Gauls had rallied to him through the prospect of booty and spoil, but
                        when they found that instead of plundering other people's territory their
                        own had become the seat of war and had to bear the burden of furnishing
                        winter quarters for both sides, they diverted their hatred from the Romans
                        to Hannibal. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Plots against his life were
                        frequently hatched by their chiefs, and he owed his safety to their mutual
                        faithlessness, for they betrayed the plots to him in the same spirit of
                        fickleness in which they had formed them. He guarded himself from their
                        attempts by assuming different disguises, at one time wearing a different
                        dress, at another putting on false hair. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                        But these constant alarms were an additional motive for his early departure
                        from his winter quarters. About the same time Cn. Servilius entered upon his
                        consulship at Rome, on the 15th of March. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                        When he had laid before the senate the policy which he proposed to carry
                        out, the indignation against C. Flaminius broke out afresh. "Two consuls had
                        been elected, but as a matter of fact they only had one. What legitimate
                        authority did this man possess? What religious sanctions? <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> Magistrates only take these sanctions with them from
                        home, from the altars of the State, and from their private altars at home
                        after they have celebrated the Latin Festival, offered the sacrifice on the
                        Alban Mount, and duly recited the vows in the Capitol. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> These sanctions do not follow a private citizen, nor if
                        he has departed without them can he obtain them afresh in all their fulness
                        on a foreign soil." </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> To add to the general feeling of
                        apprehension, information was received of portents having occurred
                        simultaneously in several places. In Sicily several of the soldiers' darts
                        were covered with flames; in Sardinia the same thing happened to the staff
                        in the hand of an officer who was going his rounds to inspect the sentinels
                        on the wall; the shores had been lit up by numerous fires; <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> a couple of shields had sweated blood; some soldiers
                        had been struck by lightning; an eclipse of the sun had been observed; at
                        Praeneste there had been a shower of red-hot stones; at Arpi shields had
                        been seen in the sky and the sun had appeared to be fighting with the moon;
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> at Capena two moons were visible in
                        the daytime; at Caere the waters ran mingled with blood, and even the spring
                        of Hercules had bubbled up with drops of blood on the water; at Antium the
                        ears of corn which fell into the reapers' basket were blood-stained; at
                        Falerii the sky seemed to be cleft asunder as with an enormous rift and all
                        over the opening there was a blazing light; <milestone n="11" unit="section"
                        /> the oracular tablets shrank and shrivelled without being touched and one
                            <milestone n="12??" unit="section"/> had fallen out with this
                        inscription, "MARS IS SHAKING HIS SPEAR"; and at the same time the statue of
                        Mars on the Appian Way and the images of the Wolves sweated blood. Finally,
                        at Capua the sight was seen of the sky on fire and the moon falling in the
                        midst of a shower of rain. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Then credence
                        was given to comparatively trifling portents, such as that certain people's
                        goats were suddenly clothed with wool, a hen turned into a cock, and a cock
                        into a hen. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> After giving the details
                        exactly as they were reported to him and bringing his informants before the
                        senate, the consul consulted the House as to what religious observances
                        ought to be proclaimed. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> A decree was
                        passed that to avert the evils which these portents foreboded, sacrifices
                        should be offered, the victims to be both full-grown animals and sucklings,
                        and also that special intercessions should be made at all the shrines for
                        three days. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> What other ceremonial was
                        necessary was to be carried out in accordance with the instructions of the
                        decemvirs after they had inspected the Sacred Books and ascertained the will
                        of the gods. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> On their advice it was
                        decreed that the first votive offering should be made to Jupiter in the
                        shape of a golden thunderbolt weighing fifty pounds, gifts of silver to Juno
                        and Minerva, and <milestone n="18??" unit="section"/> sacrifices of
                        full-grown victims to Queen Juno on the Aventine and Juno Sospita at
                        Lanuvium, whilst the matrons were to contribute according to their means and
                        bear their gift to Queen Juno on the Aventine. A lectisternium was to be
                        held, and even the freedwomen were to contribute what they could for a gift
                        to the temple of Feronia. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> When these
                        instructions had been carried out the decemvirs sacrificed full-grown
                        victims in the forum at Ardea, and finally in the middle of December there
                        was a sacrifice at the Temple of Saturn, a lectisternium was ordered (the
                        senators prepared the couch), and a public banquet. <milestone n="20"
                            unit="section"/> For a day and a night the cry of the Saturnalia
                        resounded through the City, and the people were ordered to make that day a
                        festival and observe it as such for ever. </p>

                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> While the consul was occupied in these
                        propitiatory ceremonies and also in the enrolment of troops, information
                        reached Hannibal that Flaminius had arrived at Arretium, and he at once
                        broke up his winter quarters. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> There were
                        two routes into Etruria, both of which were pointed out to Hannibal; one was
                        considerably longer than the other but a much better road, the shorter
                        route, which he decided to take, passed through the marshes of the Arno,
                        which was at the time in higher flood than usual. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> He ordered the Spaniards and Africans, the main
                        strength of his veteran army, to lead, and they were to take their own
                        baggage with them, so that, in case of a halt, they might have the necessary
                        supplies; the Gauls were to follow so as to form the centre of the column;
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> the cavalry were to march last, and
                        Mago and his Numidian light horse were to close up the column, mainly to
                        keep the Gauls up to the mark in case they fell out or came to a halt
                            <milestone n="5??" unit="section"/> through the fatigue and exertion of
                        so long a march, for as a nation they were unable to stand that kind of
                        thing. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Those in front followed wherever
                        the guides led the way, through the deep and almost bottomless pools of
                        water, and though almost sucked in by the mud through which they were
                        half-wading, half-swimming, still kept their ranks. The Gauls could neither
                        recover themselves when they slipped nor when once down had they the
                        strength to struggle out of the pools; depressed and hopeless they had no
                        spirits left to keep up their bodily powers. <milestone n="7" unit="section"
                        /> Some dragged their worn-out limbs painfully along, others gave up the
                        struggle and lay dying amongst the baggage animals which were lying about in
                        all directions. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> What distressed them most
                        of all was want of sleep, from which they had been suffering for four days
                        and three nights. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> As everything was
                        covered with water and they had not a dry spot on which to lay their wearied
                        bodies, they piled up the baggage in the water and lay on the top, whilst
                        some snatched a few minutes' needful rest by making couches of the heaps of
                        baggage animals which were everywhere standing out of the water. <milestone
                            n="10" unit="section"/> Hannibal himself, whose eyes were affected by
                        the changeable and inclement spring weather, rode upon the only surviving
                        elephant so that he might be a little higher above the water. <milestone
                            n="11" unit="section"/> Owing, however, to want of sleep and the night
                        mists and the malaria from the marshes, his head became affected, and as
                        neither place nor time admitted of any proper treatment, he completely lost
                        the sight of one eye. </p>

                        these frightful .circumstances, he at last got clear of the marshes, and as
                        soon as he could find some dry ground he pitched his camp. The scouting
                        parties he had sent out reported that the Roman army was lying in the
                        neighbourhood of Arretium. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> His next step
                        was to investigate as carefully as he possibly could all that it was
                        material for him to know-what mood the consul was in, what designs he was
                        forming, what the character of the country and the kind of roads it
                        possessed, and what resources it offered for the obtaining of supplies.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The district was amongst the most
                        fertile in Italy; the plains of Etruria, which extend from Faesulae to
                        Arretium, are rich in corn and live stock and every kind of produce.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The consul's overbearing temper, which
                        had grown steadily worse since his last consulship, made him lose all proper
                        respect and reverence even for the gods, to say nothing of the majesty of
                        the senate and the laws, and this self-willed and obstinate side of his
                        character had been aggravated by the successes he had achieved both at home
                        and in the field. It was perfectly obvious that he would not seek counsel
                        from either God or man, and whatever he did would be done in an impetuous
                        and headstrong manner. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> By way of making
                        him show these faults of character still more flagrantly, the Carthaginian
                        prepared to irritate and annoy him. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> He
                        left the Roman camp on his left, and marched in the direction of Faesulae to
                        plunder the central districts of Etruria. Within actual view of the consul
                        he created as widespread a devastation as he possibly could, and from the
                        Roman camp they saw in the distance an extensive scene of fire and
                        .massacre. </p>

                        quiet even if the enemy had done so, but now that he saw the possessions of
                        the allies of Rome plundered and pillaged almost before his very eyes, he
                        felt it to be a personal disgrace that an enemy should be roaming at will
                        through Italy and advancing to attack Rome with none to hinder him.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> All the other members of the council
                        of war were in favour of a policy of safety rather than of display; they
                        urged him to wait for his colleague, that they might unite their forces and
                        act with one mind on a <milestone n="9??" unit="section"/> common plan, and
                        pending his arrival they should check the wild excesses of the plundering
                        enemy with cavalry and the light-armed auxiliaries. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> Enraged at these suggestions he dashed out of the
                        council and ordered the trumpets to give the signal for march and battle;
                        exclaiming at the same time: "We are to sit, I suppose, before the walls of
                        Arretium, because our country and our household gods are here. Now that
                        Hannibal has slipped through our hands, he is to ravage Italy, destroy and
                        burn everything in his way till he reaches Rome, while we are not to stir
                        from here until the senate summons C. Flaminius from Arretium as they once
                        summoned Camillus from Veii." During this outburst, he ordered the standards
                        to be pulled up with all speed and at the same time mounted his horse.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> No sooner had he done so than the
                        animal stumbled and fell and threw him over its head All those who were
                        standing round were appalled by what they took to be <milestone n="12??"
                            unit="section"/> an evil omen at the beginning of a campaign, and their
                        alarm was considerably increased by a message brought to the consul that the
                        standard could not be moved though the standard-bearer had exerted his
                        utmost strength. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> He turned to the
                        messenger and asked him: "Are you bringing a despatch from the senate, also,
                        forbidding me to go on with the campaign? Go, let them dig out the standard
                        if their hands are too benumbed with fear for them to pull it up." Then the
                        column began its march. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> The superior
                        officers, besides being absolutely opposed to his plans, were thoroughly
                        alarmed by the double portent, but the great body of the soldiers were
                        delighted at the spirit their general had shown; they shared his confidence
                        without knowing on what slender grounds it rested. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> In order still further to exasperate his
                        enemy and make him eager to avenge the injuries inflicted on the allies of
                        Rome, Hannibal laid waste with all the horrors of war the land between
                        Cortona and Lake Trasumennus. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He had now
                        reached a position eminently adapted for surprise tactics, where the lake
                        comes up close under the hills of Cortona. There is only a very narrow road
                        here between the hills and the lake, as though a space had been purposely
                        left far it. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Further on there is a small
                        expanse of level ground flanked by hills, and it was here that Hannibal
                        pitched camp, which was only occupied by his Africans and Spaniards, he
                        himself being in command. The Balearics and the rest of the light infantry
                        he sent behind the hills; the cavalry, conveniently screened by some low
                        hills, he stationed at the mouth of the defile, so that when the Romans had
                        entered it they would be completely shut in by the cavalry, the lake, and
                        the hills. Flaminius had reached the lake at sunset. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> The next morning, in a still uncertain light, he passed
                        through the defile, without sending any scouts on to feel the way, and when
                        the column began to deploy in the wider extent of level ground the only
                        enemy they saw was the one in front, the rest were concealed in their rear
                        and above their heads. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> When the
                        Carthaginian saw his object achieved and had his enemy shut in between the
                        lake and the hills with his forces surrounding them, he gave the signal for
                        all to make a simultaneous attack, and they charged straight down upon the
                        point nearest to them. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The affair was all
                        the more sudden and unexpected to the Romans because a fog which had risen
                        from the lake was denser on the plain than on the heights; the bodies of the
                        enemy on the various hills could see each other well enough, and it was all
                        the easier for them to charge all at the same time. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> The shout of battle rose round the Romans before they
                        could see clearly from whence it came, or became aware that they were
                        surrounded. Fighting began in front and flank before they could form line or
                        get their weapons ready or draw their swords. </p>

                        displayed all the coolness that could be expected under the circumstances.
                        The ranks were broken by each man turning towards the discordant shouts; he
                        re-formed them as well as time and place allowed, and wherever he could be
                        seen or heard, he encouraged his men and bade them stand and fight.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> "It is not by prayers or entreaties to
                        the gods that you must make your way out," he said, "but by your strength

                        enemy, and where there is less fear there is generally less danger."
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> But such was the uproar and confusion
                        that neither counsel nor command could be heard, and so far was the soldier
                        from recognising his standard or his company or his place in the rank, that
                        he had hardly sufficient presence of mind to get hold of his weapons and
                        make them available for use, and some who found them a burden rather than a
                        protection were overtaken by the enemy. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> In
                        such a thick fog ears were of more use than eyes; the men turned their gaze
                        in every direction as they heard the groans of the wounded and the blows on
                        shield or breastplate, and the mingled shouts of triumph and cries of panic.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Some who tried to fly ran into a dense
                        body of combatants and could get no further; others who were returning to

                            unit="section"/> At last, when ineffective charges had been made in
                        every direction and they found themselves completely hemmed in, by the lake
                        and the hills on either side, and by the enemy in front and rear, it became
                        clear to every man that his only hope of safety lay in his own right hand
                        and his sword. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Then each began to depend
                        upon himself for guidance and encouragement, and the fighting began afresh,
                        not the orderly battle with its three divisions of principes, hastati, and

                        of the army behind, and where each soldier is in his own legion and cohort
                        and maniple. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Chance massed them together,

                        Digging spurs into his horse he charged into the dense masses of the enemy,

                        lance in rest, and then plunged his lance into the consul; but the triarii
                        protected the body with their shields and prevented him from despoiling it.

                        lake nor mountain stopped the panic-stricken fugitives, they rushed like

                        of escape, went into the water up to their shoulders; some in their wild

                        the clash of arms, but were unable, owing to the fog, to see or find out
                        what the fortunes of the fight were. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> At

                        receive honourable interment but it was not found. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> As soon as the news of this disaster reached Rome the
                        people flocked into the Forum in a great state of panic and confusion.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Matrons were wandering about the
                        streets and asking those they met what recent disaster had been reported or
                        what news was there of the army. The throng in the Forum, as numerous as a
                        crowded Assembly, flocked towards the Comitium and the Senate-house and
                        called for the magistrates. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> At last,
                        shortly before sunset, M. Pomponius, the praetor, announced, "We have been
                        defeated in a great battle." Though nothing more definite was heard from
                        him, the people, full of the reports which they had heard from one another,
                        carried back to their homes the information that the consul had been killed
                        with the greater part of his army; <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> only a
                        few survived, and these were either dispersed in flight throughout Etruria
                        or had been made prisoners by the enemy. </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The misfortunes which had befallen the
                        defeated army were not more numerous than the anxieties of those whose
                        relatives had served under C. Flaminius, ignorant as they were of the fate
                        of each of their friends, and not in the least knowing what to hope for or
                        what to fear. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The next day and several
                        days afterwards, a large crowd, containing more women than men, stood at the
                        gates waiting for some one of their friends or for news about them, and they
                        crowded round those they met with eager and anxious inquiries, nor was it
                        possible to get them away, especially from those they knew, until they had
                        got all the details from first to last. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                        Then as they came away from their informants you might see the different
                        expressions on their faces, according as each had received good or bad news,
                        and friends congratulating or consoling them as they wended their way
                        homewards. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> The women were especially
                        demonstrative in their joy and in their grief. They say that one who
                        suddenly met her son at the gate safe and sound expired in his arms, whilst
                        another who had received false tidings of her son's death and was sitting as
                        a sorrowful mourner in her house, no sooner saw him returning than she died
                        from too great happiness. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> For several
                        days the praetors kept the senate in session from sunrise to sunset,
                        deliberating under what general or with what forces they could offer
                        effectual resistance to the victorious Carthaginian. </p>

                        a fresh disaster was announced; 4000 cavalry under the command of C.
                        Centenius, the propraetor, had been sent by the consul Servilius to the
                        assistance of his colleague. When they heard of the battle at Trasumennus
                        they marched into Umbria, and here they were surrounded and captured by
                        Hannibal. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The news of this occurrence
                        affected men in very different ways. Some, whose thoughts were preoccupied
                        with more serious troubles, looked upon this loss of cavalry as a light
                        matter in comparison with the previous losses; others estimated the
                        importance of the incident not by the magnitude of the loss but by its moral
                        effect. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Just as where the constitution is
                        impaired, any malady however slight is felt more than it would be in a
                        strong robust person, <milestone n="4??" unit="section"/> so any misfortune
                        which befell the State in its present sick and disordered condition must be
                        measured not by its actual importance but by its effect on a State already
                        exhausted and unable to bear anything which would aggravate its condition.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Accordingly the citizens took refuge
                        in a remedy which for a long time had not been made use of or required,
                        namely the appointment of a Dictator. As the consul by whom alone one could
                        be nominated was absent, and it was not easy for a messenger or a despatch
                        to be sent through Italy, overrun as it was by the arms of Carthage, and as
                        it would have been contrary to <milestone n="6??" unit="section"/> all
                        precedent for the people to appoint a Dictator, the Assembly invested Q.
                        Fabius Maximus with dictatorial powers and appointed M. Minucius Rufus to
                        act as his Master of the Horse. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> They were
                        commissioned by the senate to strengthen the walls and towers of the City
                        and place garrisons in whatever positions they thought best, and cut down
                        the bridges over the various rivers, for now it was a fight for their City
                        and their homes, since they were no longer able to defend Italy. </p>

                        through Umbria as far as Spoletum, and after laying the country round
                        utterly waste, he commenced an attack upon the city which was repulsed with
                        heavy loss. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> As a single colony was strong
                        enough to defeat his unfortunate attempt he was able to form some conjecture
                        as to the difficulties attending the capture of Rome, and consequently
                        diverted his march into the territory <milestone n="3??" unit="section"/> of
                        Picenum, a district which not only abounded in every kind of produce but was
                        richly stored with property which the greedy and needy soldiers seized and
                        plundered without restraint. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> He remained
                        in camp there for several days during which his soldiers recruited their
                        strength after their winter campaigns and their journey across the marshes,
                        and a battle which though ultimately successful was neither without heavy
                        loss nor easily won. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> When sufficient time
                        for rest had been allowed to men who delighted much more in plundering and
                        destroying than in ease and idleness, Hannibal resumed his march and
                        devastated the districts of Praetutia and Hadria, then he treated in the
                        same way the country of the Marsi, the Marrucini, and the Peligni and the
                        part of Apulia which was nearest to him, including the cities of Arpi and
                        Luceria. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Cn. Servilius had fought some
                        insignificant actions with the Gauls and taken one small town, but when he
                        heard of his colleague's death and the destruction of his army, he was
                        alarmed for the walls of his native City, and marched straight for Rome that
                        he might not be absent at this most critical juncture. </p>
                    <p> Q. Fabius Maximus was now Dictator for the second time. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> On the very day of his entrance upon office he summoned
                        a meeting of the senate, and commenced by discussing matters of religion. He
                        made it quite clear to the senators that C. Flaminius' fault lay much more
                        in his neglect of the auspices and of his religious duties than in bad
                        generalship and foolhardiness. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The gods
                        themselves, he maintained, must be consulted as to the necessary measures to
                        avert their displeasure, and he succeeded in getting a decree passed that
                        the decemvirs should be ordered to consult the Sibylline Books, a course
                        which is only adopted when the most alarming portents have been reported.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> After inspecting the Books of Fate
                        they informed the senate that the vow which had been made to Mars in view of
                        that war had not been duly discharged, and that it must be discharged afresh
                        and on a much greater scale. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The Great
                        Games must be vowed to Jupiter, a temple to Venus Erycina and one to Mens; a

                        must also be vowed. All these things must be done if the war was to be a
                        successful one and the republic remain in the same position in which it was
                        at the beginning of the war. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> As Fabius
                        would be wholly occupied with the necessary arrangements for the war, the

                        M. Aemilius, to take care that all these orders were carried out in good

                        the senate the praetor consulted the pontifical college as to the proper

                        Maximus, decided that the very first step to take was to refer to the people
                        the question of a "Sacred Spring," as this particular form of vow could not

                        shall not bear the guilt, nor he from whom it was stolen. If a man offer his

                        If any sacrifice be offered before the senate and people have ordered that

                        therefrom." <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> To the same end the Great
                        Games were vowed at a cost of 333,333 1/3 ases, and in addition 300 oxen to
                        Jupiter, and white oxen and the other customary victims to a number of
                        deities. When the vows had been duly pronounced a litany of intercession was

                        supervision of the ten keepers of the Sacred Books. Six couches were

                        legions and how many the senators thought he ought to meet their victorious
                        enemy. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> They decreed that he should take
                        over the army from Cneius Servilius, and further that he should enrol from
                        amongst the citizens and the allies as many cavalry and infantry as he
                        considered requisite; <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> all else was left to

                        of the republic. Fabius said that he would add two legions to the army which
                        Servilius commanded; these were raised by the Master of the Horse and he
                        fixed a day for their assembling at Tibur. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                        A proclamation was also issued that those who were living in towns and

                        of safety, and that all the population settled in the districts through
                        which Hannibal was likely to march should abandon their farms, after first
                        burning their houses and destroying their produce, so that he might not have

                        marched along the Flaminian road to meet the consul. As soon as he caught
                        sight of the army in the neighbourhood of Ocriculum near the Tiber, and the
                        consul riding forward with some cavalry to meet him, he sent an officer to
                        tell him that he was to come to the Dictator without his lictors. <milestone

                        profound sense of the majesty of the dictatorship amongst both citizens and
                        allies, who had almost by this time forgotten that greatest of all offices.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Shortly afterwards a despatch was

                        near the port of Cosa. The consul was thereupon ordered to man the ships
                        which were lying off Rome or at Ostia with full complements of seamen and
                        soldiers, and sail in pursuit of the hostile fleet and protect the coast of
                        Italy. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> A large force was raised in Rome,

                        from Fulvius Flaccus, the second in command, and marched through Sabine
                        territory to Tibur, where he had ordered the newly raised force to assemble
                        by the appointed day. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> From there he
                        advanced to Praeneste, and taking a cross-country route, came out on the
                        Latin road. From this point he proceeded towards the enemy, showing the
                        utmost care in reconnoitring all the various routes, and determined not to
                        take any risks anywhere, except so far as necessity should compel him.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The first day he pitched his camp in
                        view of the enemy not far from Arpi; the Carthaginian lost no time in
                        marching out his men in battle order to give him the chance of fighting.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> But when he saw that the enemy kept
                        perfectly quiet and that there were no signs of excitement in their camp, he
                        tauntingly remarked that the spirits of the Romans, those sons of Mars, were
                        broken at last, the war was at an end, and they had openly foregone all
                        claim to valour and renown. He then returned into camp. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> But he was really in a very anxious state of mind, for
                        he saw that he would have to do with a very different type of commander from
                        Flaminius or Sempronius; the Romans had been taught by their defeats and had
                        at last found a general who was a match for him. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> It was the wariness not the impetuosity of the Dictator
                        that was the immediate cause of his alarm; he had not yet tested his
                        inflexible resolution. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> He began to harass
                        and provoke him by frequently shifting his camp and ravaging the fields of
                        the allies of Rome before his very eyes. Sometimes he would march rapidly
                        out of sight and then in some turn of the road take up a concealed position
                        in the hope of entrapping him, should he come down to level ground.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Fabius kept on high ground, at a
                        moderate distance from the enemy, so that he never lost sight of him and
                        never closed with him. Unless they were employed on necessary duty, the
                        soldiers were confined to camp. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> When they
                        went in quest of wood or forage they went in large bodies and only within
                        prescribed limits. A force of cavalry and light infantry told off in
                        readiness against sudden alarms, made everything safe for his own soldiers
                        and dangerous for the scattered foragers of the enemy. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> He refused to stake everything on a general engagement,
                        whilst slight encounters, fought on safe ground with a retreat close at
                        hand, encouraged his men, who had been demoralised by their previous
                        defeats, and made them less dissatisfied with their own courage and
                        fortunes. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> But his sound and common-sense
                        tactics were not more distasteful to Hannibal than they were to his own
                        Master of the Horse. Headstrong and impetuous in counsel and with an
                        ungovernable tongue, the only thing that prevented Minucius from making
                        shipwreck of the State was the fact that he was in a subordinate command.
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> At first to a few listeners,
                        afterwards openly amongst the rank and file, he abused Fabius, calling his
                        deliberation indolence and his caution cowardice, attributing to him faults
                        akin to his real virtues, and by disparaging his superior-a vile practice
                        which, through its often proving successful, is steadily on the increase-he
                        tried to exalt himself. </p>

                        Samnium; he ravaged the territory of Beneventum and captured the city of
                        Telesia. He did his best to exasperate the Roman commander, hoping that he
                        would be so incensed by the insults and sufferings inflicted on his allies
                        that he would be able to draw him into an engagement on level ground.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Amongst the thousands of allies of
                        Italian nationality who had been taken prisoners by Hannibal at Trasumennus
                        and dismissed to their homes were three Campanian knights, who had been
                        allured by bribes and promises to win over the affections of their
                        countrymen. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> They sent a message to
                        Hannibal to the effect that if he would bring his army up to Campania there
                        would be a good chance of his obtaining possession of Capua. Hannibal was
                        undecided whether to trust them or not, for the enterprise was greater than
                        the authority of those who advised it; however, they at last persuaded him
                        to leave Samnium for Campania. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> He warned
                        them that they must make their repeated promises good by their acts, and
                        after bidding them return to him with more of their countrymen, including
                        some of their chief men, he dismissed them. <milestone n="5" unit="section"
                        /> Some who were familiar with the country told him that if he marched into
                        the neighbourhood of Casinum and occupied the pass, he would prevent the
                        Romans from rendering assistance to their allies. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> He accordingly ordered a guide to conduct him there.
                        But the difficulty which the Carthaginians found in pronouncing Latin names
                        led to the guide understanding Casilinum instead of Casinum. Quitting his
                        intended route, he came down through the districts of Allifae, Callifae, and
                        Cales on to the plains of Stella. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> When he
                        looked round and saw the country shut in by mountains and rivers he called
                        the guide and asked him where on earth he was. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> When he was told that he would that day have his
                        quarters at Casilinum, he saw the mistake and knew that Casinum was far away
                        in quite another country. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The guide was
                        scourged and crucified in order to strike terror into the others. After
                        entrenching his camp he sent Maharbal with his cavalry to harry the
                        Falernian land. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The work of destruction
                        extended to the Baths of Sinuessa; the Numidians inflicted enormous losses,

                        flames of war, the allies did not allow their terrors to warp them from
                        their loyalty, simply because they were under a just and equable rule, and
                        rendered a willing obedience to their superiors-the only true bond of

                        frequently listened to the fierce harangues of the Master of the Horse. At

                        bodies, drew him gradually almost up to their camp, his men and horses by
                        this time thoroughly tired. Thereupon Carthalo, the general in command of
                        the cavalry, charged at full speed, and before they came within range of
                        their javelins put the enemy to flight and pursued them without slackening
                        rein for nearly five miles. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> When Mancinus
                        saw that there was no chance of the enemy giving up the pursuit, or of his
                        escaping them, he rallied his men and faced the Numidians, though completely
                        outnumbered and outmatched. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> He himself
                        with the best of his riders was cut off, the rest resumed their wild flight
                        and reached Cales and ultimately by different by-paths returned to the
                        Dictator. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> It so happened that Minucius
                        had rejoined Fabius on this day. He had been sent to strengthen the force
                        holding the defile which contracts into a narrow pass just above Terracina
                        close to the sea. This was to prevent the Carthaginian from utilising the
                        Appian road for a descent upon the territory of Rome, when he left Sinuessa.

                        below their entrenchments, on unquestionably more advantageous ground, yet
                        the Carthaginian came up with his cavalry and light infantry to challenge
                        his enemy. They made repeated attacks and retirements, but the Roman line
                        kept its ground; the fighting was slack and more satisfactory to the
                        Dictator than to Hannibal; 200 Romans fell, and 800 of the enemy. <milestone

                        land of Latium behind them were furnishing the Romans with supplies, while
                        the Carthaginian would have to winter amongst the rocks of Formiae and the
                        sands and marshes of Liternum and in gloomy forests. Hannibal did not fail
                        to observe that his own tactics were being employed against him. <milestone

                        would have to make for the mountains and cross the ridge of Callicula, he
                        would be liable to be attacked by the Romans whilst he was shut up in the
                        valleys. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> To guard against this he decided
                        upon a stratagem which, deceiving the eyes of the enemy by its alarming
                        appearance, would enable him to scale the mountains in a night march without
                        fear of interruption. The following was the ruse which he adopted.

                        plough, amongst the rest of the plunder from the fields. About 2000 oxen
                        were collected for the purpose. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> To

                        of this herd as soon as darkness set in, then driving them up the mountains
                        and if possible mostly above the passes which were guarded by the Romans.

                        broke up; the oxen were driven some distance in front of the column.

                        penetrated to the root of their horns made the oxen rush about as though
                        they were mad. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> At this sudden scampering
                        about, it seemed as though the woods and mountains were on fire, and all the

                        heads made the flames shoot out all the more, and gave the appearance of men
                        running about in all directions. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> When the

                        quitted it. Making their way up to the highest points, they took the
                        direction where there appeared to be the fewest flames, thinking this to be
                        the safest road. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Even so, they came across
                        stray oxen separated from the herd, and at first sight they stood still in
                        astonishment at what seemed a preternatural sight of beings breathing fire.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> When it turned out to be simply a

                        ambuscade, and they took to flight. Now they fell in with some of Hannibal's
                        light infantry, but both sides shrank from a fight in the darkness and
                        remained inactive till daylight. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> In the
                        meantime Hannibal had marched the whole of his army through the pass, and
                        after surprising and scattering some Roman troops in the pass itself, fixed

                        Spaniards come up, who had been sent back by Hannibal to their assistance.

                        above Allifae in an elevated position and one of great natural strength.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Hannibal retraced his steps as far as
                        the Peligni, ravaging the country as he went, as though his intention was to
                        march through Samnium upon Rome. Fabius continued to move along the heights,
                        keeping between the enemy and the City, neither avoiding nor attacking him.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The Carthaginian left the Peligni, and
                        marching back into Apulia, reached Gereonium. This city had been abandoned
                        by its inhabitants because a portion of the walls had fallen into ruin.

                        near Larinum. From there he was recalled to Rome on business connected with
                        religion. Before his departure he impressed upon the Master of the Horse,
                        not only as commander-in-chief but as a friend giving good advice and even

                        of thirty-five ships to meet the enemy. The day after leaving Tarraco he
                        came to anchor at a spot ten miles distant from the mouth of the Ebro.

                        those who were strolling about on the shore or resting in their tents, and
                        expecting anything rather than the approach of an enemy or battle that day,

                        of esparto grass which Hasdrubal had collected for the use of the navy, and
                        after taking what they could use they burnt the rest. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> They did not confine themselves to cruising along the
                        coast, but crossed over to the island of Ebusus, where they made a
                        determined but unsuccessful attack upon the capital during the whole of two
                        days. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> As they found that they were only
                        wasting time on a hopeless enterprise, they took to plundering the country,
                        and sacked and burnt several villages. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                        Here they secured more booty than on the mainland, and after placing it on
                        board, as they were on the point of sailing away, some envoys came to Scipio
                        from the Balearic isles to sue for peace. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                        From this point the fleet sailed back to the eastern side of the province
                        where envoys were assembled from all the tribes in the district of the Ebro,
                        and many even from the remotest parts of Spain. <milestone n="11"
                            unit="section"/> The tribes which actually acknowledged the supremacy of
                        Rome and gave hostages amounted to more than a hundred and twenty. The
                        Romans felt now as much confidence in their army as in their navy, and
                        marched as far as the pass of Castulo. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>

                        Spanish temperament is restless and fond of change, and after the Romans had
                        left the pass and retired to the <milestone n="3??" unit="section"/> coast,
                        Mandonius and Indibilis, who had previously been chief of the Ibergetes,

                        Scipio despatched a military tribune with some light-armed auxiliaries to
                        disperse them, and after a trifling engagement, for they were undisciplined
                        and without organisation, they were all put to rout, some being killed or
                        taken prisoners, and a large proportion deprived of their arms. <milestone
                            n="5" unit="section"/> This disturbance, however, brought Hasdrubal, who

                        camp amongst the Ilergavonians; the Roman camp was at Nova, when unexpected

                        to Scipio and had given hostages, were induced by his representations to
                        take up arms and invade the province of New Carthage with a powerful army.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> They took three fortified towns by

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> This was the position of affairs when P.
                        Scipio, whose command had been extended after he ceased to be consul, came
                        to the province which had been assigned to him by the senate. He brought a
                        reinforcement of thirty ships of war and 8000 troops, also a large convoy of
                        supplies. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> This fleet, with its enormous
                        column of transports, excited the liveliest delight among the townsmen and
                        their allies when it was seen in the distance and finally reached the port
                        of Tarracona. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> There the soldiers were
                        landed and Scipio marched up country to meet his brother; thenceforward they
                        carried on the campaign with their united forces and with one heart and
                        purpose. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> As the Carthaginians were
                        preoccupied with the Celtiberian war, the Scipios had no hesitation in
                        crossing the Ebro and, as no enemy appeared, marching straight to Saguntum,
                        where they had been informed that the hostages who had been surrendered to
                        Hannibal from all parts of Spain were detained in the citadel under a
                        somewhat weak guard. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The fact that they
                        had given these pledges was the only thing that prevented all the tribes of
                        Spain from openly manifesting their leanings towards alliance with Rome;
                        they dreaded lest the price of their defection from Carthage should be the
                        blood of their own children. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> From this
                        bond Spain was released by the clever but treacherous scheme of one
                        individual. </p>
                    <p> Abelux was a Spaniard of high birth living at Saguntum, who had at one time
                        been loyal to Carthage, but afterwards, with the usual fickleness of
                        barbarians, as the fortunes of Carthage changed so he changed his
                        allegiance. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> He considered that any one
                        going over to the enemy without having something valuable to betray was
                        simply a worthless and disreputable individual, and so he made it his one
                        aim to be of the greatest service he could to his new allies. <milestone
                            n="8" unit="section"/> After making a survey of everything which Fortune
                        could possibly put within his reach, he made up his mind to effect the
                        delivery of the hostages; that one thing he thought would do more than
                        anything else to win the friendship of the Spanish chieftains for the
                        Romans. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> He was quite aware, however, that
                        the guardians of the hostages would take no step without the orders of
                        Bostar, their commanding officer, and so he employed his arts against Bostar
                        himself. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Bostar had fixed his camp
                        outside the city quite on the shore that he might bar the approach of the
                        Romans on that side. After obtaining a secret interview with him he warned
                        him, as though he were unaware of it, as to the actual state of affairs.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> "Up to this time," he said, "fear
                        alone has kept the Spaniards loyal because the Romans were far away; now the
                        Roman camp is on our side the Ebro, a secure stronghold and refuge for all
                        who want to change their allegiance. Those, therefore, who are no longer
                        restrained by fear must be bound to us by kindness and feelings of
                        gratitude." <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Bostar was greatly surprised,
                        and asked him what boon could suddenly effect such great results. "Send the
                        hostages," was the reply, "back to their homes. <milestone n="13"
                            unit="section"/> That will evoke gratitude from their parents, who are
                        very influential people in their own country, and also from their
                        fellow-countrymen generally. Every one likes to feel that he is trusted; the
                        confidence you place in others generally strengthens their confidence in
                        you. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> The service of restoring the
                        hostages to their respective homes I claim for myself, that I may contribute
                        to the success of my plan by my own personal efforts, and win for an act
                        gracious in itself still more gratitude." </p>
                    <p> He succeeded in persuading Bostar, whose intelligence was not on a par with
                        the acuteness which the other Carthaginians showed. <milestone n="15"
                            unit="section"/> After this interview he went secretly to the enemy's
                        outposts, and meeting with some Spanish auxiliaries he was conducted by them
                        into the presence of Scipio, to whom he explained what he proposed to do.
                        Pledges of good faith were mutually exchanged and the place and time for
                        handing over the hostages fixed, after which he returned to Saguntum.
                            <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> The following day he spent in
                        receiving Bostar's instructions for the execution of the project. It was
                        agreed between them that he should go at night in order, as he pretended, to
                        escape the observation of the Roman outposts. <milestone n="17"
                            unit="section"/> He had already arranged with these as to the hour at
                        which he would come, and after awakening those who were in guard of the boys
                        he conducted the hostages, without appearing to be aware of the fact, into
                        the trap which he had himself prepared. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/>
                        The outposts conducted them into the Roman camp; all the remaining details
                        connected with their restoration to their homes were carried out as he had
                        arranged with Bostar, precisely as if the business were being transacted m
                        the name of Carthage. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> Yet though the
                        service rendered was the same, the gratitude felt towards the Romans was
                        considerably greater than would have been earned by the Carthaginians, who
                        had shown themselves oppressive and tyrannical in the time of their
                        prosperity, and now that they experienced a change of fortune their act
                        might have appeared to be dictated by fear. <milestone n="20" unit="section"
                        /> The Romans, on the other hand, hitherto perfect strangers, had no sooner
                        come into the country than they began with an act of clemency and
                        generosity, and Abelux was considered to have shown his prudence in changing
                        his allies to such good purpose. <milestone n="21" unit="section"/> All now
                        began with surprising unanimity to meditate revolt, and an armed movement
                        would have begun at once had not the winter set in, which compelled the
                        Romans as well as the Carthaginians to retire to their quarters. </p>

                        campaign in Spain during the second summer of the Punic war. In Italy the
                        masterly inaction of Fabius had for a short time stemmed the tide of Roman
                        disasters. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> It was a cause of grave anxiety
                        to Hannibal, for he fully realised that the Romans had chosen for their
                        commander-in-chief a man who conducted war on rational principles and not by
                        trusting to chance. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> But amongst his own
                        people, soldiers and civilians alike, his tactics were viewed with contempt,
                        especially after a battle had been brought about owing to the rashness of
                        the Master of the Horse in the Dictator's absence which would be more
                        correctly described as fortunate rather than as successful. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> Two incidents occurred which made the Dictator still
                        more unpopular. One was due to the crafty policy of Hannibal. Some deserters
                        had pointed out to him the Dictator's landed property, and after all the
                        surrounding buildings had been levelled to the ground he gave orders for
                        that property to be spared from fire and sword and all hostile treatment
                        whatever in order that it might be thought that there was some secret
                        bargain between them. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The second cause of
                        the Dictator's growing unpopularity was something which he himself did, and
                        which at first bore an equivocal aspect because he had acted without the
                        authority of the senate, but ultimately it was universally recognised as
                        redounding very greatly to his credit. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> In
                        carrying out the exchange of prisoners it had been agreed between the Roman
                        and the Carthaginian commanders, following the precedent of the first Punic
                        war, that whichever side received back more prisoners than they gave should
                        strike a balance by paying two and a half pounds of silver for each soldier
                        they received in excess of those they gave. <milestone n="7" unit="section"
                        /> The Roman prisoners restored were two hundred and forty-seven more than
                        the Carthaginians. The question of this payment had been frequently
                        discussed in the senate, but as Fabius had not consulted that body before
                        making the agreement there was some delay in voting the money. <milestone
                            n="8" unit="section"/> The matter was settled by Fabius sending his son
                        Quintus to Rome to sell the land which had been untouched by the enemy; he
                        thus discharged the obligation of the State at his own private expense.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> When Hannibal burnt Gereonium after
                        its capture, he left a few houses standing to serve as granaries, and now he

                        The camp had been situated in a lofty and secure position; it was now

                        the general's temperament were being discussed; suggestions were made for an

                        it was left with a weak guard. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Hannibal
                        soon found out that the tactics of his enemies had changed with the change
                        of generals, and that they would act with more spirit than prudence, and

                            unit="section"/> The next thing he did was to move his camp still nearer

                        the Romans, so that they might know that he was determined to protect his
                        foragers in case of attack. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> From this
                        position he was able to see another elevated position still closer to the

                        to attempt to seize it in broad daylight the enemy, having less distance to
                        go, would be there before him, so he sent a force of Numidians who occupied
                        it during the night. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The next day the
                        Romans, seeing how small a number were holding the position, made short work
                        of them and drove them off and then transferred their own camp there.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> By this time there was but a very
                        small distance between rampart and rampart, and even that was almost
                        entirely filled with Roman troops, who were demonstrating in force to
                        conceal the movements of cavalry and light infantry who had been sent
                        through the camp gate farthest from the enemy to attack his foragers, upon
                        whom they inflicted severe losses. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                        Hannibal did not venture upon a regular battle because his camp was so
                        weakly guarded that it could not have repelled an assault. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> Borrowing the tactics of Fabius he began to carry on
                        the campaign by remaining in almost complete inaction, and withdrew his camp
                        to its former position before the walls of Gereonium. <milestone n="11"
                            unit="section"/> According to some authors a pitched battle was fought
                        with both armies in regular formation; the Carthaginians were routed at the
                        first onset and driven to their camp; from there a sudden sortie was made
                        and it was the Romans' turn to flee, and the battle was once more restored
                        by the sudden appearance of Numerius Decimus, the Samnite general.
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Decimus was, as far as wealth and
                        lineage go, the foremost man not only in Bovianum, his native place, but in
                        the whole of Samnium. In obedience to the Dictator's orders he was bringing
                        into camp a force of 8000 foot and 500 horse, and when he appeared in
                        Hannibal's rear both sides thought that it was a reinforcement coming from
                        Rome under Q. Fabius. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Hannibal, it is
                        further stated, ordered his men to retire, the Romans followed them up, and
                        with the aid of the Samnites captured two of their fortified positions the
                        same day; <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> 6000 of the enemy were killed
                        and about 5000 of the Romans, yet though the losses were so evenly balanced
                        an idle and foolish report of a splendid victory reached Rome together with
                        a despatch from the Master of the Horse which was still more foolish. </p>

                        were kept back and almost imprisoned within their lines; they were deprived

                        military command by no means implied an equal share of military skill, he
                        returned to his army with a spirit undismayed by either his fellow-citizens

                        Minucius had been almost unbearable before, but now that he had won as great

                        Accordingly on his first meeting with Q. Fabius, he told him that the very
                        first thing that had to be settled was the method in which they should
                        exercise their divided authority. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The best
                        plan, he thought, would be for them each to take supreme command on
                        alternate days, or, if he preferred it, at longer intervals. <milestone

                        decided negative. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Everything, he argued,
                        which his colleague's rashness might prompt would be at the mercy of
                        Fortune; though his command was shared with another, he was not wholly
                        deprived of it; <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> he would never therefore
                        voluntarily give up what power he still possessed of conducting operations
                        with common sense and prudence, and though he refused to agree to a division
                        of days or periods of command, he was prepared to divide the army with him
                        and use his best foresight and judgment to preserve what he could as he
                        could not save all. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> So it was arranged
                        that they should adopt the plan of the consuls and share the legions between
                        them. The first and fourth went to Minucius, Fabius retained the second and
                        third. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The cavalry and the contingents
                        supplied by the Latins and the allies were also divided equally between

                        battle with Minucius, who, he felt quite sure, would hurry up to stop him.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The entire intervening country seemed,
                        at a first glance, totally unsuited for surprise tactics, for there were no
                        woods anywhere, no spots covered with brushwood and scrub, but in reality it
                        naturally lent itself to such a purpose, and all the more so because in so
                        bare a valley no stratagem of the kind could be suspected. In its windings
                        there were caverns, some so large as to be capable of concealing two hundred
                        men. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Each of these hiding-places was
                        filled with troops, and altogether 5000 horse and foot were placed in

                        the rising ground already described in order to divert the attention of the
                        enemy. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> As soon as they were sighted, their

                        amongst his senseless and hot-headed soldiers the general sounded a general
                        call to arms, and poured idle abuse and threats on the enemy. He sent the
                        light infantry first in open skirmishing order, these were followed by the
                        cavalry in close formation, and at last, when he saw that reinforcements
                        were being brought up to the enemy, he advanced with the legions in line.

                        up the hill from lower ground were the first to be repulsed and forced back
                        to the cavalry who were coming up behind them. They sought refuge behind the
                        front ranks of the legions, who alone amidst the general panic preserved

                        on both flanks and on the rear of the Roman legions created such confusion
                        and alarm that not a man had any spirit left to fight or any hope of

                        Minucius called his men together and addressed them thus: "Soldiers, I have

                        overland through Sicily and crossed the Strait into Italy, in consequence of

                        On the occasion of the mutiny amongst the troops in Gaul two years before,
                        the praetor, L. Manlius, had vowed a temple to Concord, but up to that time
                        no contract had been made for its construction. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> Two commissioners were appointed for the purpose by M.

                        Flamininus, and they entered into a contract for the building of the temple
                        within the precinct of the citadel. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The
                        senate passed a resolution that Aemilius should also write to the consuls
                        asking one of them, if they approved, to come to Rome to hold the consular
                        elections, and he would give notice of the elections for whatever day they
                        fixed upon. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The consuls replied that they
                        could not leave the army in the presence of the enemy without danger to the
                        republic, it would be therefore better for the elections to be held by an
                        interrex than that a consul should be recalled from the front. <milestone
                            n="11" unit="section"/> The senate thought it better for a Dictator to
                        be nominated by the consul for the purpose of holding the elections. L.
                        Veturius Philo was nominated; he appointed Manlius Pomponius Matho his
                        Master of the Horse. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Their election was
                        found to be invalid, and they were ordered to resign office after holding it

                        commands extended for another year. The interreges appointed by the senate
                        were C. Claudius Cento, son of Appius, and P. Cornelius Asina. The latter
                        conducted the elections amidst a bitter struggle between the patricians and
                        the plebs. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> C. Terentius Varro, a member of
                        their own order, had ingratiated himself with the plebs by his attacks upon
                        the leading men in the State and by all the tricks known to the demagogue.
                        His success in shaking the influence of Fabius and weakening the authority
                        of the Dictator had invested him with a certain glory in the eyes of the
                        mob, which was heightened by the other's unpopularity, and they did their
                        utmost to raise him to the consulship. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The
                        patricians opposed him with their utmost strength, dreading lest it should
                        become a common practice for men to attack them as a means of rising to an
                        equality with them. Q. Baebius Herennius, a relation of Varro's, accused not
                        only the senate, but even the augurs, because they had prevented the
                        Dictator from carrying the elections through, and by thus embittering public
                        opinion against them, he strengthened the feeling in favour of his own
                        candidate. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> "It was by the nobility," he
                        declared, "who had for many years been trying to get up a war, that Hannibal

                        protracting it. The advantage which M. Minucius gained in the absence of
                        Fabius made it abundantly clear that <milestone n="6??" unit="section"/>
                        with four legions combined, a successful fight could be maintained, but
                        afterwards two legions had been exposed to slaughter at the hands of the
                        enemy, and then rescued at the very last moment in order that he might be
                        called 'Father' and 'Patron' because he would not allow the Romans to
                        conquer before they had been defeated. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                        Then as to the consuls; though they had it in their power to finish the war
                        they had adopted Fabius' policy and protracted it. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> This is the secret understanding that has been come to
                        by all the nobles, and we shall never see the end of the war till we have
                        elected as our consul a man who is really a plebeian, that is, one from the

                        initiated into the same mysteries; when they are no longer looked down upon

                        both staying with the army; then, afterwards, because they had to nominate a
                        Dictator against their will to conduct the elections, they had carried their
                        point by force, and the Dictator's appointment was declared invalid by the

                        excitement amongst the plebs. There were three patrician candidates in the

                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> two plebeians who were now ennobled,
                        C. Atilius Serranus and Q. Aelius Paetus, one of whom was a pontiff, the
                        other an augur. But the only one elected was C. Terentius Varro, so that the
                        elections for appointing his colleague were in his hands. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> The nobility saw that his rivals were not strong
                        enough, and they compelled L. Aemilius Paulus to come forward. He had come
                        off with a blasted reputation from the trial in which his colleague had been
                        found guilty, and he narrowly escaped, and for a long time stoutly resisted
                        the proposal to become a candidate owing to his intense dislike of the
                        plebs. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> On the next election day, after all
                        Varro's opponents had retired, he was given to him not so much to be his

                        The elections of praetors followed; those elected were Manlius Pomponius
                        Matho and P. Furius Philus. To Philus was assigned the jurisdiction over
                        Roman citizens, to Pomponius the decision of suits between citizens and
                        foreigners. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Two additional praetors were

                        Several strong and capable men were passed over, for at such a time it
                        seemed undesirable that a magistracy should be entrusted to new and untried

                        Some authorities record that both horse and foot in the legions were made
                        stronger by the addition of 1000 infantry and 100 cavalry to each, so that
                        they contained 5000 infantry and 300 cavalry, whilst the allies furnished

                        legions left the City the decemvirs were ordered to consult the Sacred Books
                        owing to the general alarm which had been created by fresh portents.

                        had fallen simultaneously on the Aventine in Rome and at Aricia; that the

                        The proper expiation of these portents was ascertained from the Sacred

                        he caught sight of the enemy. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> His
                        colleague, Paulus, made only one speech, in which there was much more truth
                        than the people cared to hear. He passed no strictures on Varro, but he did
                        express surprise that any general, whilst still in the City before he had
                        taken up his command, or become acquainted with either his own army or that
                        of the enemy, or gained any information as to <milestone n="9??"

                        conduct the campaign and be able to foretell the day on which he would fight
                        a decisive battle with the enemy. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> As for
                        himself, Paulus said that he would not anticipate events by disclosing his
                        measures, for, after all, circumstances determined measures for men much
                        more than men made circumstances subservient to measures. <milestone n="12"
                            unit="section"/> He hoped and prayed that such measures as were taken
                        with due caution and foresight might turn out successful; so far rashness,
                        besides being foolish, had proved disastrous. <milestone n="13"
                            unit="section"/> He made it quite clear that he would prefer safe to
                        hasty counsels, and in order to strengthen him in this resolve Fabius is
                        said to have addressed him on his departure in the following terms: </p>

                        your own sense of honour demanded; if you were both alike bad, you would
                        neither listen to anything I had to say, nor take any advice which I might

                        will have less difficulty with C. Terentius than with Hannibal; I rather
                        think the former will prove a more dangerous enemy than the latter.

                        luck on you by mentioning the ill-starred Flaminius, but this I must say
                        that it was only after he was consul and had entered upon his province and
                        taken up his command that he began to play the madman, but this man was
                        insane before he stood for the consulship and afterwards while canvassing
                        for it, and now that he is consul, before he has seen the camp or the enemy
                        he is madder than ever. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> If he raises such
                        storms amongst peaceful civilians as he did just now by bragging about
                        battles and battlefields, what will he do, think you, when he is talking to
                        armed men-and those young men-where words at once lead to action. <milestone
                            n="8" unit="section"/> And yet if he carries out his threat and brings
                        on an action at once, either I am utterly ignorant of military science, of
                        the nature of this war, of the enemy with whom we are dealing, or else some
                        place or other will be rendered more notorious by our defeat than even
                        Trasumennus. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> As we are alone, this is
                        hardly a time for boasting, and I would rather be thought to have gone too
                        far in despising glory than in seeking it, but as a matter of fact, the only
                        rational method of carrying on war against Hannibal is the one which I have
                        followed. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> This is not only taught us by
                        experience-experience the teacher of fools-but by reasoning which has been
                        and will continue to be unchanged as long as the conditions remain the same.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> We are carrying on war in Italy, in
                        our own country on our own soil, everywhere round us are citizens and

                        their loyalty thus far to us in our adversity; and time and circumstance are

                            n="13" unit="section"/> Hannibal, on the other hand, is in a foreign and

                        opposition and danger; nowhere by land or sea can he find peace; no cities
                        admit him within their gates, no fortified towns; nowhere does he see
                        anything which he can call his own, he has to live on each day's pillage: he
                        has hardly a third of the army with which he crossed the Ebro; <milestone
                            n="14" unit="section"/> he has lost more by famine than by the sword,

                        the better of a man who is growing weaker day by day, who has neither

                            unit="section"/> But I will not sound my own praises even before you.
                        See how the late consuls, Cn. Servilius and Atilius, fooled him. This, L.
                        Paulus, is the only safe course to adopt, and it is one which your fellow
                        citizens will do more to make difficult and dangerous for you than the enemy
                        will. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> For your own soldiers will want the
                        same thing as the enemy; Varro though he is a Roman consul will desire just
                        what Hannibal the Carthaginian commander desires. You must hold your own
                        single-handed against both generals. And you will hold your own if you stand
                        your ground firmly against public gossip and private slander, if you remain
                        unmoved by false misrepresentations and your colleague's idle boasting. It
                        is said that truth is far too often eclipsed but never totally extinguished.
                        The man who scorns false glory will possess the true. <milestone n="19"
                            unit="section"/> Let them call you a coward because you are cautious, a

                        clever enemy cause for fear than earn the praise of foolish compatriots.
                        Hannibal will only feel contempt for a man who runs all risks, he will be
                        afraid of one who never takes a rash step. <milestone n="21" unit="section"

                        fail to seize an opportunity favourable to yourself, and never give a
                        favourable opportunity to the enemy. <milestone n="22" unit="section"/> The

                        set forward, escorted by the foremost men amongst the patricians; the
                        plebeian consul was attended by his plebeian friends, more conspicuous for
                        their numbers than for the quality of the men who composed the crowd.

                        and the old soldiers were formed into one army, and two separate camps were
                        formed, the new camp, which was the smaller one, being nearer to Hannibal,
                        while in the old camp the larger part of the army and the best troops were
                        stationed. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> M. Atilius, one of the consuls
                        of the previous year, pleaded his age and was sent back to Rome; the other,

                        the consuls. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> For not only was there
                        nothing left out of his daily plunder, but there was nothing left anywhere
                        for him to seize, as all the corn, now that the country was unsafe, had been

                        ten days' rations of corn remained, as was afterwards discovered, and the
                        Spaniards were prepared to desert, owing to the shortness of supplies, if

                        to drive off the foragers; a confused fight ensued owing to the soldiers
                        rushing forward without any preconcerted plan or orders from their
                        commanders, and the contest went heavily against the Carthaginians.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> As many as 1700 of them were killed,
                        the loss of the Romans and the allies did not amount to more than 100. The
                        consuls commanded on alternate days, and that day happened to be Paulus'
                        turn. He checked the victors who were pursuing the enemy in great disorder,
                        for he feared an ambuscade. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Varro was
                        furious, and loudly exclaimed that the enemy had been allowed to slip out of

                        brought to a close. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Hannibal did not very
                        much regret his losses, on the contrary he believed that they would serve as
                        a bait to the impetuosity of the consul and his newly-raised troops, and
                        that he would be more headstrong than ever. <milestone n="5" unit="section"

                        what was going on in his own; he was fully aware that there were differences
                        and quarrels between the commanders, and that two-thirds of the army
                        consisted of recruits. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The following night
                        he selected what he considered a suitable position for an ambuscade, and
                        marched his men out of camp with nothing but their arms, leaving all the
                        property, both public and private, behind in the camp. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> He then concealed the force behind the hills which

                        and took <milestone n="8??" unit="section"/> the baggage train through the

                        The one consul behaved as though he were one of the clamorous crowd; the

                        exposed to view, in some parts he had seen silver lying about on the paths
                        as though it had been put there for plunder. <milestone n="7" unit="section"
                        /> So far from deterring the soldiers from satisfying their greed, as it was
                        intended to do, this report only inflamed it, and a shout arose that if the
                        signal was not given they would go on without their generals. There was no
                        lack of a general, however, for Varro instantly gave the signal to advance.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Paulus, who was hanging back, received
                        a report from the keeper of the sacred chickens that they had not given a
                        favourable omen, and he ordered the report to be at once carried to his
                        colleague as he was just marching out of the camp gates. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> Varro was very much annoyed, but the recollection of
                        the disaster which overtook Flaminius and the naval defeat which the consul
                        Claudius sustained in the first Punic war made him afraid of acting in an
                        irreligious spirit. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> It seemed as though
                        the gods themselves on that day delayed, if they did actually do away, the
                        fatal doom which was impending over the Romans. For it so happened that
                        whilst the soldiers were ignoring the consul's order for the standards to be
                        carried back into camp, two slaves, one belonging to a trooper from Formiae,
                        the other to one from Sidicinum, who had been captured with the foraging
                        parties when Servilius and Atilius were in command, had that day escaped to
                        their former masters. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> They were taken
                        before the consul and told him that the whole of Hannibal's army was lying
                        behind the nearest hills. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The opportune
                        arrival of these men restored the authority of the consuls, though one of
                        them in his desire to be popular had weakened his authority by his
                        unscrupulous connivance at breaches of discipline. </p>

                        movement which the Romans had commenced was not recklessly carried out to
                        its final stage, and that his ruse had been detected, he returned to camp.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Owing to the want of corn he was
                        unable to remain there many days, and fresh plans were continually cropping
                        up, not only amongst the soldiers, who were a medley of all nations, but
                        even in the mind of the general himself. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                        Murmurs gradually swelled into loud and angry protests as the men demanded
                        their arrears of pay, and complained of the starvation which they were
                        enduring, and in addition, a rumour was started that the mercenaries,
                        chiefly those of Spanish nationality, had formed a plot to desert.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Even Hannibal himself, it is said,
                        sometimes thought of leaving his infantry behind and hurrying with his
                        cavalry into Gaul. With these plans being discussed and this temper
                        prevailing amongst the men, he decided to move into <milestone n="5??"
                            unit="section"/> the warmer parts of Apulia, where the harvest was
                        earlier and where, owing to the greater distance from the enemy, desertion
                        would be rendered more difficult for the fickle-minded part of his force. As
                        on the previous occasion, he ordered camp-fires to be lighted, and a few
                        tents left where they could be easily seen, in order that the Romans,
                        remembering a similar stratagem, might be afraid to move. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> However, Statilius was again sent to reconnoitre with
                        his Lucanians, and he made a thorough examination of the country beyond the
                        camp and over the mountains. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> He reported
                        that he had caught a distant view of the enemy in line of march, and the
                        question of pursuit was discussed. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> As
                        usual, the views of the two consuls were opposed, but almost all present
                        supported Varro, not a single voice was given in favour of Paulus, except
                        that of Servilius, consul in the preceding year. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> The opinion of the majority of the council prevailed,
                        and so, driven by destiny, they went forward to render Cannae famous in the
                        annals of Roman defeats. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> It was in the
                        neighbourhood of this village that Hannibal had fixed his camp with his back
                        to the Sirocco which blows from Mount Vultur and fills the arid plains with
                        clouds of dust. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> This arrangement was a

                        carefully examining the roads as they marched, and when they reached Cannae
                        and had the enemy in view they formed two entrenched camps separated by the
                        same interval as at Gereonium, and with the same distribution of troops in
                        each camp. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The river Aufidus, flowing past
                        the two camps, furnished a supply of water which the soldiers got as they
                        best could, and they generally had to fight for it. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> The men in the smaller camp, which was on the other
                        side of the river, had less difficulty in obtaining it, as that bank was not
                        held by the enemy. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Hannibal now saw his
                        hopes fulfilled, that the consuls would give him an opportunity of fighting
                        on ground naturally adapted for the movements of cavalry, the arm in which
                        he had so far been invincible, and accordingly he placed his army in order
                        of battle, and tried to provoke his foe to action by repeated charges of his
                        Numidians. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The Roman camp was again
                        disturbed by a mutinous soldiery and consuls at variance, Paulus bringing up
                        against Varro the fatal rashness of Sempronius and Flaminius, Varro
                        retorting by pointing to Fabius as the favourite model of cowardly and inert
                        commanders, and calling gods and men to witness that it was through no fault
                        of his that Hannibal had acquired, so to speak, a prescriptive right to
                        Italy; <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> he had had his hands tied by his
                        colleague; his soldiers, furious and eager for fight, had had their swords

                        the other hand, declared that if anything happened to the legions flung
                        recklessly and betrayed into an ill-considered and imprudent action, he was
                        free from all responsibility for it, though he would have to share in all
                        the consequences. "See to it," he said to Varro, "that those who are so free
                        and ready with their tongues are equally so with their hands in the day of
                        battle." </p>

                        disputes instead of deliberation, Hannibal withdrew the bulk of his army,
                        who had been standing most of the day in order of battle, into camp.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He sent his Numidians, however, across
                        the river to attack the parties who were getting water for the smaller camp.

                        they nearly reached the gates of the camp. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                        It was looked upon as such an insult for a Roman camp to be actually
                        terrorised by irregular auxiliaries that one thing, and one thing alone,
                        held back the Romans from instantly crossing the river and forming their
                        battle line-the supreme command that day rested with Paulus. <milestone

                        and led his forces drawn up for action across the river. Paulus followed,
                        for though he disapproved of the measure, he was bound to support it.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> After crossing, they strengthened
                        their line with the force in the smaller camp and completed their formation.

                        river, the Roman cavalry were posted, then came the infantry; on the extreme
                        left were the cavalry of the allies, their infantry were between them and
                        the Roman legions. The javelin men with the rest of the light-armed
                        auxiliaries formed the front line. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The
                        consuls took their stations on the wings, Terentius Varro on the left,

                        forward the Balearics and the other light infantry. He then crossed the
                        river in person and as each division was brought across he assigned it its

                        were for the most part a body of Romans from the way they were armed, they
                        were so completely equipped with the arms, some of which they had taken at

                        the vastness of their stature and their frightful appearance: the Gauls were
                        naked above the waist, the Spaniards had taken up their position wearing
                        white tunics embroidered with purple, of dazzling brilliancy. The total
                        number of infantry in the field was 40,000, and there were 10,000 cavalry.

                        was that they had purposely so placed themselves, or whether it happened by
                        accident, since the Romans faced the north, the Carthaginans the South.

                        the Vulturnus, was against the Romans, and blew great clouds of dust into

                        face to face. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Each side tried to force
                        their way straight forward, till at last the horses were standing in a

                        drag them from their horses. It had become mainly a struggle of infantry,
                        fierce but short, and the Roman cavalry was repulsed and fled. <milestone

                        the infantry became engaged, and as long as the Gauls and Spaniards kept
                        their ranks unbroken, both sides were equally matched in strength and
                        courage. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> At length after long and repeated
                        efforts the Romans closed up their ranks, echeloned their front, and by the
                        sheer weight of their deep column bore down the division of the enemy which
                        was stationed in front of Hannibal's line, and was too thin and weak to
                        resist the pressure. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Without a moment's
                        pause they followed up their broken and hastily retreating foe till they
                        took to headlong flight. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Cutting their way
                        through the mass of fugitives, who offered no resistance, they penetrated as
                        far as the Africans who were stationed on both wings, somewhat further back
                        than the Gauls and Spaniards who had formed the advanced centre. As the
                        latter fell back the whole front became level, and as they continued to give
                        ground it became concave and crescent-shaped, the Africans at either end
                        forming the horns. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> As the Romans rushed on
                        incautiously between them, they were enfiladed by the two wings, which
                        extended and closed round them in the rear. <milestone n="9" unit="section"
                        /> On this, the Romans, who had fought one battle to no purpose, left the
                        Gauls and Spaniards, whose rear they had been slaughtering, and commenced a
                        fresh struggle with the Africans. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The
                        contest was a very one-sided one, for not only were they hemmed in on all
                        sides, but wearied with the previous fighting they were meeting fresh and

                        out from their own line with their shields slung behind their backs as
                        though they were deserters, and suddenly leaped from their horses and flung

                        quiet, but when the eyes and minds of all were wholly taken up with the
                        fighting they seized the large Roman shields which were lying everywhere
                        amongst the heaps of slain and commenced a furious attack upon the rear of
                        the Roman line. Slashing away at backs and hips, they made a great slaughter

                        to join them? Because, of course, all the country between us is scoured by
                        the enemy and they prefer to expose other people to that deadly peril rather
                        than themselves." Others did not disapprove of the proposal, but they lacked
                        courage to carry it out. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> P. Sempronius
                        Tuditanus protested against this cowardice. "Would you," he asked, "rather

                        Certainly not, if you are really the fellow-countrymen of L. Aemilius, who

                        But, before daylight overtakes us and the enemy gathers in larger force to
                        bar our path, let us cut our way through the men who in disorder and
                        confusion are clamouring at our gates. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>

                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The inhabitants received them with

                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> But the large number of men, which now
                        amounted to something like 10,000, made the burden imposed upon Busa much
                        heavier. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> For Appius and Scipio, on hearing
                        that the consul was safe, at once sent to him to inquire what amount of foot
                        and horse he had with him, and also whether he wanted the army to be taken

                        transferred his forces to Canusium, and now there was something like a
                        consular army; it seemed as though they would defend themselves successfully
                        behind their walls if not in the open field. <milestone n="7" unit="section"
                        /> The reports which reached Rome left no room for hope that even these
                        remnants of citizens and allies were still surviving; it was asserted that
                        the army with its two consuls had been annihilated and the whole of the

                        by going into details. After the loss of the consul and the army at
                        Trasumennus the previous year, it was not wound upon wound but multiplied
                        disaster that was now announced. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> For
                        according to the reports two consular armies and two consuls were lost;
                        there was no longer any Roman camp, any general, any single soldier in
                        existence; Apulia, Samnium, almost the whole of Italy lay at Hannibal's
                        feet. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Certainly there is no other nation
                        that would not have succumbed beneath such a weight of calamity. <milestone

                        of the Carthaginians at the Aegates, which broke their power to such an
                        extent that they gave up Sicily and Sardinia and submitted to the payment of
                        tribute and a war indemnity; or, again, the battle which they lost in
                        Africa, in which Hannibal himself was crushed. But there is no point of
                        comparison between these and Cannae, unless it be that they were borne with

                        the living and the dead were being indiscriminately bewailed in almost every

                        be sure to be fugitives scattered about the country, and bring back tidings
                        as to what had befallen the consuls and the armies, and if the gods out of

                        that all who brought tidings were taken to the praetors, and that the

                        lies in the City and its walls. When the tumult has once been hushed, then

                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The dearth of freemen necessitated a
                        new kind of enlistment; 8000 sturdy youths from amongst the slaves were
                        armed at the public cost, after they had each been asked whether they were
                        willing to serve or no. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> These soldiers
                        were preferred, as there would be an opportunity of ransoming them when

                        into two groups; the allies were treated as they had been at the Trebia and
                        at Trasumennus, after some kind words they were dismissed without ransom;
                        the Romans, too, were treated as they had never been before, for when they
                        appeared before him he addressed them in quite a friendly way. <milestone

                        all he was fighting for was his country's honour as a sovereign power. His
                        fathers had yielded to Roman courage, his one object now was that the Romans
                        should yield to his good fortune and courage. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> He now gave the prisoners permission to ransom
                        themselves; each horseman at 500 "chariot pieces" and each foot-soldier at
                        300, and the slaves at 100 per head. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> This
                        was somewhat more than the cavalry had agreed to when they surrendered, but
                        they were only too glad to accept any terms. <milestone n="6" unit="section"

                        senate at Rome, and the only guarantee required was that they should take an
                        oath to return. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> They were accompanied by
                        Carthalo, a Carthaginian noble, who was to sound the feelings of the

                        one of them, a man of an utterly un-Roman temper, returned to the camp, as
                        if he had forgotten something, and in this way hoped to free himself from
                        his oath. He rejoined his comrades before nightfall. <milestone n="9"

                        sheer cowardice; standing on the heaps of the slain we kept up the struggle
                        till close on night, and only then did we retire into camp; <milestone n="4"

                        we defended our entrenchments; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> the
                        following day we were surrounded by the victorious army and cut off from the

                        dense masses of the enemy. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> We did not
                        think it a crime for some of Rome's soldiers to survive the battle of
                        Cannae, seeing that 50,000 men had been butchered there, and therefore in
                        the very last resort we consented to have a price fixed for our ransom and
                        surrendered to the enemy those arms which were no longer of the slightest
                        use to us. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Besides, we had heard that our
                        ancestors had ransomed themselves from the Gauls with gold, and that your
                        fathers, sternly as they set themselves against all conditions of peace, did
                        nevertheless send delegates to Tarentum to arrange the ransom of the
                        prisoners. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> But neither the battle at the
                        Alia against the Gauls nor that at Heraclea against Pyrrhus was disgraced by
                        the actual losses sustained so much as by the panic and flight which marked
                        them. The plains of Cannae are covered by heaps of Roman dead, and we should
                        not be here now if the enemy had not lacked arms and strength to slay us.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> There are some amongst us who were
                        never in the battle at all, but were left to guard the camp, and when it was
                        surrendered they fell into the hands of the enemy. <milestone n="10"

                        will say, not even those who fled from the battle, mostly without arms, and
                        did not stay their flight till they had reached Venusia or Canusium, can
                        claim precedence over us or boast that they are more of a defence to the

                        in them and in us good and gallant soldiers, only we shall be still more

                        will not cost more to ransom us than it did to purchase them, but if I were
                        to compare ourselves as soldiers with them, I should be offering an insult
                        to the name of Roman. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> I should think,

                        enemy you are going to abandon us. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Is it
                        to a Pyrrhus, who treated his prisoners as though they were his guests? Is
                        it not rather to a barbarian, and what is worse, a Carthaginian, of whom it
                        is difficult to judge whether he is more rapacious or more cruel? <milestone

                        move you no less than if, on the other hand, you beheld your legions lying
                        scattered over the plains of Cannae. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> You
                        can behold the anxiety and the tears of our kinsmen as they stand in the
                        vestibule of your House and await your reply. If they are in such anxiety
                        and suspense about us and about those who are not here, what, think you,
                        must be the feelings of the men themselves whose life and liberty are at
                        stake? <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> Why, good heavens! even if
                        Hannibal, contrary to his nature, chose to be kind to us, we should still
                        think life not worth living after you had decided that we did not deserve to
                        be ransomed. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> Years ago the prisoners who
                        were released by Pyrrhus without ransom returned to Rome, but they returned

                        their ransom. Am I to return to my native country as a citizen not thought
                        worth three hundred coins? Each of us has his own feelings, senators.

                        and affection had brought even women amongst the crowd of men who thronged
                        the Forum. After the strangers had withdrawn the debate commenced in the
                        senate. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> There was great difference of
                        opinion; some said that they ought to be ransomed at the expense of the
                        State, others were of opinion that no public expense ought to be incurred,
                        but they ought not to be prevented from defraying the cost from private

                        money was not available it should be advanced from the treasury on personal

                        the turn of T. Manlius Torquatus, a man of old-fashioned and, some thought,
                        excessive strictness, to give his opinion, he is said to have spoken in
                        these terms: <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> "If the delegates had
                        confined themselves to asking that those who are in the hands of the enemy
                        might be ransomed, I should have stated my opinion in few words without
                        casting reflections on any of them, for all that would have been necessary
                        would be to remind you that you should maintain the custom and usage handed
                        down from our forefathers by setting an example necessary for military
                        discipline. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> But as it is, since they have
                        almost treated their surrender to the enemy as a thing to be proud of, and
                        think it right that they should receive more consideration than the
                        prisoners taken in the field or those who reached Venusia and Canusium, or
                        even the consul himself, I will not allow you to remain in ignorance of what

                        or at least that we had before us P. Sempronius Tuditanus, for if these men
                        had followed him they would at this moment be in the Roman camp, not

                        have made a sortie, even through dense masses of the enemy, but they did not
                        make any attempt to do so on their own initiative, nor would they follow any

                        spoke to his three hundred volunteers whom he was leading to the capture of
                        a height situated in the very centre of the enemy's position: 'Let us,' he
                        exclaimed, 'die, my men, and by our death rescue our blockaded legions from
                        their peril'-if, I say, P. Sempronius had spoken thus, I should not regard

                        to their country free men with arms in their hands. The enemy did not stop
                        these six hundred, how safe the way would have been, do you not think? for a
                        force of almost two legions. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/> You would
                        have to-day, senators, at Canusium 20,000 brave loyal soldiers; but as for
                        these men, how can they possibly be good and loyal citizens? <milestone
                            n="21" unit="section"/> And as to their being 'brave,' they do not even
                        themselves assert that-unless, indeed, some one chooses to imagine that
                        whilst they were trying to stop the others from making the sortie, they were
                        really encouraging them, or that, fully aware that their own timidity and
                        cowardice was the cause of their becoming slaves, they feel no grudge
                        towards the others for having won both safety and glory through their
                        courage. <milestone n="22" unit="section"/> Though they might have got away
                        in the dead of the night, they preferred to skulk in their tents and wait
                        for the daylight and with it the enemy. But you will say, if they lacked
                        courage to leave the camp they had courage enough to defend it bravely;
                        blockaded for several days and nights, they protected the rampart with their
                        arms, and themselves with the rampart; <milestone n="23" unit="section"/> at
                        last, after going to the utmost lengths of endurance and daring, when every
                        support of life failed, and they were so weakened by starvation that they
                        had not strength to bear the weight of their arms, they were in the end
                        conquered by the necessities of nature more than by the force of arms.
                            <milestone n="24" unit="section"/> What are the facts? At daybreak the
                        enemy approached the rampart; within two hours, without trying their fortune
                        in any conflict, they gave up their arms and themselves. This, you see, was
                        their two days' soldiership. <milestone n="25" unit="section"/> When duty
                        called them to keep their line and fight they fled to their camp, when they
                        ought to have fought at the rampart they surrendered their camp; they are
                        useless alike in the field and in the camp. Am I to ransom you? <milestone
                            n="26" unit="section"/> When you ought to have made your way out of the
                        camp you hesitated and remained there, when it was obligatory for you to
                        remain there and defend the camp with your arms you gave up camp, arms, and
                        yourselves to the enemy. <milestone n="27" unit="section"/> No, senators, I
                        do not think that those men ought to be ransomed any more than I should
                        think it right to surrender to Hannibal the men who forced their way out of
                        the camp through the midst of the enemy and by that supreme act of courage
                        restored themselves to their fatherland." </p>

                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Although most of the senators had
                        relations among the prisoners, there were two considerations which weighed
                        with them at the close of Manlius' speech. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                        One was the practice of the State which from early times had shown very
                        little indulgence to prisoners of war. The other was the amount of money
                        that would be required, for they were anxious that the treasury should not
                        be exhausted, a large sum having been already paid out in purchasing and
                        arming the slaves, and they did not wish to enrich Hannibal who, according
                        to rumour, was in particular need of money. <milestone n="3" unit="section"
                        /> When the melancholy reply was given that the prisoners were not ransomed,
                        the prevailing grief was intensified by the loss of so many citizens, and
                        the delegates were accompanied to the gates by a weeping and protesting
                        crowd. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> One of them went to his home
                        because he considered himself released from his vow by his pretended return
                        to the camp. When this became known it was reported to the senate, and they
                        unanimously decided that he should be arrested and conveyed to Hannibal
                        under a guard furnished by the State. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                        There is another account extant as to the fate of the prisoners. According
                        to this tradition ten came at first, and there was a debate in the senate as
                        to whether they should be allowed within the City or not; they were admitted
                        on the understanding that the senate would not grant them an audience.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> As they stayed longer than was
                        generally expected, three other delegates arrived-L. Scribonius, C.
                        Calpurnius, and L. Manlius-and a relative of Scribonius who was a tribune of
                        the plebs made a motion in the senate to ransom the prisoners. <milestone
                            n="7" unit="section"/> The senate decided that they should not be
                        ransomed, and the three who came last returned to Hannibal, but the ten
                        remained in Rome. They alleged that they had absolved themselves from their
                        oath because after starting on their journey they had returned to Hannibal
                        under the pretext of reviewing the list of the prisoners' names. <milestone
                            n="8" unit="section"/> The question of surrendering them was hotly
                        debated in the senate, and those in favour of this course were beaten by
                        only a few votes. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Under the next censors,
                        however, they were so crushed beneath every mark of disgrace and infamy that
                        some of them immediately committed suicide; the others not only avoided the
                        Forum for all their after life, but almost shunned the light of day and the
                        faces of men. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> It is easier to feel
                        astonishment at such discrepancies amongst our authorities than to determine
                        what is the truth. </p>
                    <p> How far that disaster surpassed previous ones is shown by one simple fact.
                        Up to that day the loyalty of our allies had remained unshaken, now it began
                        to waver, for no other reason, we may be certain, than that they despaired
                        of the maintenance of our empire. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The
                        tribes who revolted to the Carthaginians were the Atellani, the Calatini,
                        the Hirpini, a section of the Apulians, all the Samnite cantons with the
                        exception of the Pentri, all the Bruttii and the Lucanians. <milestone
                            n="12" unit="section"/> In addition to these, the Uzentini and almost
                        the whole of the coast of Magna Graecia, the people of Tarentum Crotona and
                        Locri, as well as all Cisalpine Gaul. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                        Yet, in spite of all their disasters and the revolt of their allies, no one
                        anywhere in Rome mentioned the word "Peace," either before the consul's
                        return or after his arrival when all the memories of their losses were
                        renewed. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Such a lofty spirit did the
                        citizens exhibit in those days that though the consul was coming back from a
                        terrible defeat for which they knew he was mainly responsible, he was met by
                        a vast concourse drawn from every class of society, and thanks were formally
                        voted to him because he "had not despaired of the republic." <milestone
                            n="15" unit="section"/> Had he been commander-in-chief of the
                        Carthaginians there was no torture to which he would not have been
                        subjected. </p>
