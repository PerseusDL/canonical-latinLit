                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The above-described events took place in
                        the winter. At the commencement of spring Quinctius, anxious to make the
                        Boeotians, who were uncertain which side to take, into a Roman dependency,
                        summoned Attalus to Elatia, and marching through Phocis fixed his camp at a
                        point five miles from Thebes, the Boeotian capital. <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> The following day, escorted by a single maniple and
                        accompanied by Attalus and the various deputations who had flocked to him
                        from all quarters, he proceeded to the city. The hastati of the legion,
                        numbering 2000 men, were ordered to follow him at a distance of one mile.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> About half-way he was met by
                        Antiphilus, the captain-general of the Boeotians; the population of the city
                        were on the walls, anxiously watching the approach of the Roman general and
                        the king. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> They saw few arms and few
                        soldiers with them, the hastati, who were following a mile behind, were
                        hidden by the windings of the road and the undulating nature of the terrain.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> As he came nearer to the city he
                        slackened his pace, as though he were saluting the crowds who had come out
                        to meet him, but really to allow the hastati to catch him up. <milestone
                            n="6" unit="section"/> The townsfolk pushing along in a mass in front of
                        the lictor did not see the armed column which had hurried up until they
                        reached the general's quarters. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Then they
                        were utterly dismayed, as they believed that the city had been betrayed and
                        captured through the treachery of Antiphilus. It was quite clear that the
                        Council of Boeotia which was summoned for the next day would have no chance
                        of unfettered deliberation. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> They concealed
                        their vexation, since to have exhibited it would have been useless and
                        dangerous. </p>

                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="2" type="chapter">
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Attalus was the first to speak in the
                        council. He began by recounting the services which he had rendered to Greece
                        as a whole and in particular to the Boeotians. <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> But he was too old and infirm to stand the strain of
                        public speaking, and suddenly became silent and fell down. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> Whilst they were removing the king, who had lost the
                        use of one side, the proceedings were suspended. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> Aristaenus, the chief magistrate of the Achaeans, was
                        the next to speak, and he spoke with all the more weight because he gave the
                        Boeotians the same advice which he had given to the Achaeans. <milestone
                            n="5" unit="section"/> Quinctius himself added a few remarks, in which
                        he dwelt more upon the good faith of the Romans and their sense of honour
                        than upon their arms and resources. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        Dicaearchus of Plataea next brought forward a motion in favour of alliance
                        with Rome. When its terms had been recited no one ventured to oppose it,
                        consequently it was passed by the unanimous vote of the cities of Boeotia.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> After the council broke up Quinctius
                        only stayed in <milestone n="8??" unit="section"/> Thebes as long as
                        Attalus' sudden attack made it necessary, and as soon as he saw that there
                        was no immediate danger to life but only powerlessness in the limbs, he left
                        him to undergo the necessary treatment and returned to Elatia. <milestone
                            n="9" unit="section"/> The Boeotians, like the Achaeans before them,
                        were thus admitted as allies, and as he was leaving everything behind in
                        peaceful security, he was able to devote all his thoughts to Philip and the
                        means of bringing the war to a close. </p>
                </div>
                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="3" type="chapter">
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> After his envoys had returned from their
                        fruitless mission to Rome, Philip decided to raise troops in every town in
                        his kingdom. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Owing to the perpetual wars
                        which had for so many generations drained the manhood of Macedonia there was
                        a serious lack of men of military age, and under Philip's own rule vast
                            <milestone n="3??" unit="section"/> numbers had perished in the naval
                        battles against the Rhodians and Attalus and in the campaigns against the
                        Romans. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Under these circumstances he even
                        enrolled youths of sixteen and recalled to the colours men who had served
                        their time, provided they had any stamina left. After his army was brought
                        up to its proper strength he concentrated the whole of his forces at Dium
                        and <milestone n="5??" unit="section"/> formed a standing camp there in
                        which he drilled and exercised his soldiers day by day whilst waiting for
                        the enemy. During this time Quinctius left Elatia and marched by way of
                        Thronium and Scarphea to Thermopylae. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The
                        Aetolian Council had been summoned to meet at Heraclea to decide the
                        strength of the contingent which was to follow <milestone n="7??"
                            unit="section"/> the Roman general to war, and he waited at Thermopylae
                        for a couple of days to learn the result. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                        When he had been informed of their decision he started, and marching past
                        Xyniae fixed his camp where the frontiers of Acarnania and Thessaly meet.
                        Here he waited for the Aetolian contingent, who came up without any loss of
                        time under the command of Phaeneas. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> They
                        numbered 600 infantry and 400 cavalry. To remove any doubt as to why he had
                        waited he resumed his march as soon as they arrived. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> On his advance through Phthiotis he was joined by 500
                        Cretans from Gortynium and 300 Apollonians, armed like the Cretans, and not
                        long after by Amynander with 1200 Athamanian infantry. As soon as Philip
                        ascertained that the Romans had started from Elatia he realised that a
                        struggle lay before him which would decide the fate <milestone n="11??"
                            unit="section"/> of his kingdom, and he thought it well to address words
                        of encouragement to his soldiers. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> After
                        repeating the familiar phrases about the virtues of their ancestors and the
                        military reputation of the Macedonians, he dwelt more especially on the
                        considerations which tended to depress their courage and then on those from
                        which they ought to derive consolation and hope. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Against the three defeats sustained by the
                        Macedonian phalanx at the Aous he set the repulse of the Romans at Atrax.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> On the former occasion, when they
                        failed to maintain their hold on the pass leading into Epirus, he pointed
                        out that the fault lay, first, with those who had been careless in
                            <milestone n="3??" unit="section"/> their outpost duties and then in the
                        behaviour of the light infantry and the mercenaries in the actual battle.
                        But the Macedonian phalanx stood its ground, and on favourable ground and in
                        a fair field would always remain unbeaten. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                        The phalanx consisted of 16,000 men, the flower of the military strength of
                        his dominions. There were in addition 2000 caetrati, whom they call "
                        peltasts," and contingents of the same strength were furnished by the
                        Thracians and by the Trallians, an Illyrian tribe. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> Besides these there were about 1500 hired troops drawn
                        from various nationalities. and a body of cavalry numbering 2000 troopers.
                        With this force the king awaited his enemies. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> The Roman army was almost equal in numbers, in cavalry
                        alone were they superior, owing to the accession of the Aetolians. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Quinctius had been led to hope that Thebes
                        in Phthiotis would be betrayed to him by Timon, the first man in the city,
                        and accordingly he marched thither. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He
                        rode up to the walls with a small body of cavalry and light infantry, but
                        his expectations were so far frustrated by a sortie from the city that he
                        would have been in imminent danger had not infantry and cavalry from the
                        camp come to his assistance in time. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> When
                        he found that his hopes were illusory and that there was no prospect of
                        their being realised he desisted from any further attempt for the time.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Definite information having reached
                        him, however, that the king was now in Thessaly, though his exact
                        whereabouts was unknown, he sent his men into the fields round to cut down
                        and prepare stakes for a stockade. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Both
                        the Macedonians and the Greeks made use of stockades, but they did not adapt
                        their materials either for convenience in carrying or for defensive
                        strength. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The trees they cut down were too
                        large and too branching for the soldiery to carry together with their arms,
                        and when they had put them in position and fenced their camp with them the
                        demolition of their rampart was an easy matter. <milestone n="7"

                        the numerous stout branches afforded a good hold, so that two, or at the
                        most three, men by pulling together would bring a tree down, making at once
                        a gap as wide as a gate, and there was nothing at hand with which to block
                        the opening. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> On the other hand, the stakes
                        which the Romans cut were light and generally forked with <milestone n="9??"
                            unit="section"/> three, or at the most four, branches, so that, with his
                        arms slung at his back, the Roman soldier could carry several of them
                        together comfortably. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Then again they fix
                        them so close together in the ground and interlace the branches in such a
                        way that it is impossible to discover to which particular tree any of the
                        outside branches belong, and these are made so sharp and so closely
                        intertwined that there is no room <milestone n="11??" unit="section"/> left
                        for inserting the hand, nothing can be got hold of to be dragged away, nor

                        hooked together like the links of a chain. <milestone n="12" unit="section"

                        out in what part of Thessaly the enemy was, and what were his intentions.
                        Philip was in the neighbourhood of Larisa and had already received

                        out to seize some hills which commanded the city, but <milestone n="5??"

                        troops were routed and driven back to their camp; a success in which the
                        Aetolians had the greatest share. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Both
                        sides were greatly hampered in their movements by the nature of the ground,
                        which was thickly planted with trees, and by the gardens which are usually
                        found in suburban districts, the roads being enclosed between walls and in
                        some cases blocked. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Both commanders alike
                        determined to get out of the neighbourhood, and as though by mutual
                        agreement they both made for Scotusa: Philip, in the hope of obtaining a
                        supply of corn there; Quinctius, with the intention of forestalling his
                        adversary and destroying his corn. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The
                        armies marched the whole day without once getting sight of each other owing
                        to a continuous range of hills which lay between them. The Romans encamped
                        at Eretria in Phthiotis, Philip fixed his camp by the river Onchestus.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The next day Philip encamped at

                        least deterred by the clouds which had descended to the earth after the
                        rain, and he ordered the standard-bearers to march out. <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> But so thick a fog had blotted out the daylight that
                        the standard-bearers could not see their way, nor could the men see their
                        standards. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Misled by the confused shouts,
                        the column was thrown into as great disorder as if it had lost its way in a

                        range of hills called Cynoscephalae, where they left a strong force of
                        infantry and cavalry in occupation, they formed their camp. The Roman
                        general was still in camp at Thetideum; he sent out, however, ten squadrons
                        of cavalry and a thousand velites to reconnoitre and warned them to be on
                        their guard against an ambuscade, which owing to the darkened daylight might
                        not be detected even in open country. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> When
                        they reached the heights where the enemy were posted both sides stood
                        stock-still as though paralysed by mutual fear. As soon as their alarm at
                        the unexpected sight subsided they sent messages to their generals in camp
                        and did not hesitate any longer to engage. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        The action was begun by the advanced patrols, and then as the supports came
                        up the fighting became general. The Romans were by no means a match for
                        their opponents, and they sent message after message to their general to
                        inform him that they were being overpowered. <milestone n="7" unit="section"

                        was going against the Romans. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> This turn of
                        fortune threw the Macedonians into difficulties and they sent to their king
                        for help. But as owing to the darkness a battle was the last thing he had
                        looked for on that day, and as a large number of men of all ranks had been
                        sent out to forage, he was for a considerable time at a loss what to do.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The messages became more and more
                        importunate, and as the fog had now cleared away and revealed the situation
                        of the Macedonians who had been driven to the topmost height and were
                        finding more safety in their position than in their arms, Philip felt that
                            <milestone n="10??" unit="section"/> he ought to risk a general and
                        decisive engagement rather than let a part of his force be lost through want
                        of support. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Accordingly he sent
                        Athenagoras, the commander of the mercenaries, with the whole of the foreign
                        contingent, except the Thracians, and also the Macedonian and Thessalian
                        cavalry. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Their appearance resulted in the
                        Romans being dislodged from the hill and compelled to retreat to lower
                        ground. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> That they were not driven in
                        disorderly flight was mainly owing to the Aetolian cavalry, which at that
                        time was the best in Greece, though in infantry they were inferior to their

                        did the same, more because no other course was open to him than because he
                        wished to seize the opportunity of a battle. He posted the elephants in

                        right wing, the finest body in his army, which they call "the phalanx," went

                        repulsed, and when he further saw that fighting was going on near the
                        enemy's camp he was in a state of great exultation. <milestone n="10"

                        army when attacked in the rear can fail to be shaken, but the inevitable
                        confusion was increased by the inability of the Macedonian phalanx, a heavy

                        disadvantage from the ground, for in following their repulsed enemy down the

                        movement. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Assailed on both sides they
                        lost heavily, and in a short time they flung away their arms and took to

                        unaware that the enemy were no longer resisting and ignorant of their
                        general's intention, commenced an attack upon them, and when those in front
                        had been cut down the rest scattered in flight. <milestone n="6"

                        Macedonia. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Quinctius sold some of the

                            unit="section"/> Whilst he was there a herald arrived from the king
                        ostensibly to ask for an armistice for the purpose of burying those who had
                        fallen in the battle, but really to ask for permission to open negotiations
                        for peace. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Both requests were granted by
                        the Roman general, who also sent a message to the king bidding him not to
                        lose heart. This gave great offence to the Aetolians, who were intensely
                        mortified and said that the commander had been changed by his victory.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Before the battle, so they alleged, he
                        used to consult his allies on all matters great and small, but now they were
                        excluded from all his counsels; he was acting solely on his own judgment.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> He was looking out for an opportunity
                        of ingratiating himself personally with Philip so that after the Aetolians
                        had borne the whole burden of the hardships and sufferings of the war the
                        Roman might secure for himself all the credit and advantages of peace.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> As a matter of fact Quinctius
                        certainly did show the Aetolians less consideration, but they were quite
                        ignorant of his reason for treating them with neglect. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> They believed that he was looking for bribes from
                        Philip, though he was a man who never yielded to the temptation of money;
                        but it was not without good reason that he was disgusted with the Aetolians
                        for their insatiable appetite for plunder and their arrogance in claiming
                        for themselves the credit of the victory, a piece of vanity which offended
                        all men's ears. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Besides, if Philip were
                        out of the way and the kingdom of Macedonia hopelessly crushed he recognised
                        that the Aetolians must be regarded as the dominant power in Greece.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Dictated by these considerations his
                        conduct was deliberately designed to humiliate and belittle them in the eyes

                        armistice and arrangements were made for a conference with Philip. Before
                        the date fixed for it Quinctius called his allies into consultation and laid
                        before them the conditions of peace which he thought ought to be imposed.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Amynander briefly stated his view,
                        which was that the terms should be such that Greece should be sufficiently
                        strong, even in the absence of the Romans, to protect her liberty and
                        prevent the peace from being broken. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The
                        Aetolians spoke in a more vindictive tone. After a brief allusion to the
                        correctness of Quinctius' attitude in calling in those who <milestone
                            n="4??" unit="section"/> had been his allies in war to advise with him
                        on the question of peace, they went on to assure him that he was totally
                        mistaken if he supposed that he would leave either peace with Rome or
                        liberty for Greece on a sure basis unless Philip were either put to death or
                        expelled from his kingdom. Either of these alternatives was easy for him if
                        he chose to make full use of his victory. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                        Quinctius replied that in uttering these sentiments the Aetolians were
                        losing sight of the settled policy of Rome and convicting themselves of
                        inconsistency. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> In all the former councils
                        and conferences when discussing the question of peace they had never
                        advocated the destruction <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/> of Macedonia,
                        and the Romans, whose policy from the earliest times had been to show mercy
                        to the conquered, had furnished a conspicuous proof of this in the peace
                        which had been granted to Hannibal and the Carthaginians. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> Leaving the Carthaginians, however, out of account, how
                        often had he himself had conferences with Philip? But never had the question
                        of his abdication been raised. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Had his
                        defeat in battle made the war one of extermination? "An enemy in arms one is
                        bound to meet with ruthless hostility; towards the conquered the greatest
                        minds show the greatest clemency. You think that kings of Macedon are a

                        that nation and kingdom were swept away, Thracians, Illyrians, Gauls, savage
                        and barbarous tribes, would pour into Macedonia and then into Greece.

                        interrupted by Phaeneas, the president of the Aetolian league, who solemnly
                        declared amid great excitement that if Philip escaped then, he would soon
                        prove a still more dangerous enemy. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                        "Cease your uproar," said Quinctius, "when we have to deliberate. <milestone

                        meeting of the Romans and all their allies was convened, before which he

                        deliberately abstaining from any allusion to those conditions which were
                        regarded as essential, instead of letting them be forced from him in the
                        discussion. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> All the concessions which in
                        the former conference the Romans had insisted upon or the allies had
                        demanded he said he would agree to, everything else he would leave to the
                        decision of the senate. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> This would seem to
                        have precluded any further demands even from those most hostile to him, and
                        yet Phaeneas broke the general silence by asking, "What? <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> Philip! Do you at last restore to us Larisa, Cremaste,
                        Echinus and Phthiotic Thebes?" <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> On Philip
                        replying that he placed no difficulty in the way of their resuming
                        possession of these places, a dispute arose between Quinctius and the
                        Aetolians over Thebes. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Quinctius asserted
                        that it belonged to Rome by the right of war, for before the war broke out
                        he marched there and invited the citizens to enter into friendly relations
                        with him, and whilst they were at full liberty to abandon Philip they
                        preferred his allegiance to that of the Romans. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> Phaeneas retorted that it was only just and equitable,
                        considering the part they had taken in the war, that all which the Aetolians
                        possessed before the war should be restored to them. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> It was provided by treaty from the very first that the
                        spoils of war, including all movable goods and all livestock and prisoners,
                        should go to the Romans; the conquered cities and territories to the
                        Aetolians. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> "You yourselves," replied
                        Quinctius, "broke that treaty when you left us and made peace with Philip.

                            unit="section"/> This declaration was approved by all the allies, but
                        created a bitter feeling amongst the Aetolians at the time, and soon led to
                        a war which proved most disastrous to them. It was agreed that Philip should
                        give up his son Demetrius and some of "the friends of the king" as hostages
                        and also pay an indemnity of 200 talents. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                        With regard to the other matters, he was to send an embassy to Rome and a
                        four months' truce was granted him to enable him to do so. <milestone n="15"
                            unit="section"/> In case the senate declined to grant terms of peace the
                        agreement was to be cancelled and the hostages and money returned to Philip.
                        The main reason for Quinctius desiring an early peace is alleged to have
                        been the warlike designs of Antiochus and his threatened invasion of Europe.

                        still adhered to the Macedonian alliance. Before the battle of Cynoscephalae
                        L. Quinctius had invited their chiefs to a conference at Corcyra, where he
                        induced them to take <milestone n="2??" unit="section"/> the first step

                        reasons for their fidelity were their innate sense of loyalty and their fear
                        and dislike of the Aetolians. A national council was convened at Leucas. It
                        was by no means generally attended, nor did those who were present agree as
                        to the course to be pursued. The leaders, however, including the presiding

                        towards the city with every description of artillery and siege engines,

                        Acarnania as a whole lies between Aetolia and Epirus and looks westward
                        towards the Sicilian Sea. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Leucadia, which
                        is now an island separated from Acarnania by a canal of moderate depth, was

                        isthmus half a mile long, and at no point more than 120 paces broad.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The city of Leucas is situated at the
                        head of this isthmus, resting on a hill which faces eastward towards
                        Acarnania; the lowest part of the city lies on the sea front and is level.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> This makes it open to attack both by
                        land and sea, for the shallow waters are more like a lagoon than like the
                        sea, and the soil of the surrounding plain can easily be thrown up for lines
                        of investment and siege works. Many parts of the wall were in consequence

                        day they repaired the shattered walls, barricaded the breaches, made
                        constant sorties and defended their walls by arms more than their walls
                        defended them. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The siege would have been
                        protracted longer than the Romans anticipated had not some refugees of
                        Italian nationality who were living in Leucas admitted soldiers from the

                        with great tumult from the higher ground and found the Leucadians drawn up

                        Boeotia to an intensely bitter hatred against the Romans; they were quite
                        convinced that Zeuxippus, the foremost man amongst them, would not have been
                        a party to such a crime if he had not been countenanced by the Roman
                        general. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> To go to war was impossible; they
                        had neither forces nor a leader, but they did the next thing to it, they
                        took to brigandage and assassination. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> They
                        made away with soldiers who were billeted on them, and others on furlough
                        who were going about on various errands in their winter quarters. Some were
                        caught in the high roads by men who lay in wait for them, others were led on
                        false pretences to lonely inns and then seized and murdered. <milestone

                        were amongst the missing every day, the whole of Boeotia acquired an evil
                        reputation, and the men were more afraid to go outside their camp than if
                        they had been in an enemy's country. On this, Quinctius sent officers to the

                        /> Most of them were found to have been committed round Lake Copais; here

                        or amphorae fastened to them, to sink them deeper by their weight. Many
                        murders also took place at Acraephia and Coronea. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> Quinctius issued orders for those who were guilty to be
                        given up to him, and he levied a fine of 500 talents upon the Boeotians for
                        the 500 soldiers who had been murdered. </p>
                    <p> Neither of these orders was complied with. The cities simply excused
                        themselves by saying that their government had not sanctioned any of these
                        deeds. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Quinctius thereupon sent a
                        deputation to visit Athens and Achaia and explain to them that it was in a
                        just and holy cause that he was going to punish the Boeotians by arms.

                        Achaean envoys came to their support. The mediation of the Achaeans was the
                        more effectual of the two, because in case they failed to obtain peace for
                        the Boeotians they were resolved to fight by the side of the Romans.

                        arrived from Rome. On their advice peace was granted to Philip on the

                        free and independent; <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Philip was to
                        withdraw his garrisons from those which had been under his rule and after
                        their evacuation hand them over to the Romans before the date fixed for the
                        Isthmian Games. He was also to withdraw his garrisons from the following

                        undertook to communicate the decision of the senate and the commissioners to
                        Prusias, King of Bithynia. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The king was
                        also to restore all prisoners and deserters to the Romans, and all his

                        indemnity which he was required to pay amounted to 1000 talents, half of it

                        king for ten years. Claudius says that the annual tribute amounted to 4200
                        lbs. of silver and extended over thirty years, with an immediate payment of
                        2000 lbs. He also says that an additional clause in the treaty expressly
                        provided that Philip should not make war upon Eumenes, who had succeeded his
                        father Attalus upon the throne. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> As a

                        they criticised the commissioners' decision bitterly in private. It was,
                        they said, a mere form of words vaguely suggesting the delusive image of
                        pretended liberty. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Why, they asked, were
                        some cities to be given to the Romans without being named, and others which
                        were named to retain their freedom, unless it was thought that the cities in
                        Asia might be safely left free because of their remoteness, whilst those in
                        Greece which are not even named might be appropriated, viz. Corinth,
                        Chalcis, Oreus, together with Eretria and Demetrias? <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> Nor was this charge altogether groundless, for there
                        was much hesitation as to three of those cities. In the decree of the senate
                        which the commissioners had brought with them the rest of the cities in
                        Greece and Asia were unequivocally declared free, but in the case of
                        Corinth, Chalcis and Demetrias the commissioners were instructed to do and
                        determine <milestone n="5??" unit="section"/> as the interests of the
                        commonwealth and the circumstances of the time and their own sense of duty
                        required. It was Antiochus they had in their minds; <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> they were convinced that as soon as he deemed his
                        strength adequate he would invade Europe, and they did not intend to leave
                        it open to him to occupy cities which would form such favourable bases of
                        operations. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Quinctius proceeded with the
                        ten commissioners to Anticyra, and from there sailed across to Corinth. Here
                        the commissioners discussed for days the measures for securing the freedom
                        of Greece. Again and again Quinctius urged that the whole of Greece must be
                        declared free if they wanted to stop the tongues of the Achaeans and inspire
                        all <milestone n="8??" unit="section"/> with a true affection for Rome and
                        an appreciation of her greatness-if, in fact, they desired to convince the
                        Greeks that they had crossed the seas with the sole purpose of winning their
                        freedom and not of transferring Philip's dominion over them to themselves.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The commissioners took no exception to
                        his insistence on making the cities free, but they argued that it would be
                        safer for the cities themselves <milestone n="10??" unit="section"/> to
                        remain for a time under the protection of Roman garrisons rather than have
                        to accept Antiochus as their master in the place of Philip. <milestone
                            n="11" unit="section"/> At last they came to a decision; the city of
                        Corinth was to be restored to the Achaeans, but a garrison was to be placed
                        in Acrocorinthus, and Chalcis and Demetrias were to be retained until the

                        now close at hand. These Games always drew vast crowds, owing partly to the
                        innate love of the nation for a spectacle in which they watched contests of
                        every kind, competitions <milestone n="2??" unit="section"/> of artistic
                        skill, and trials of strength and speed, and partly owing to the fact that
                        its situation between two seas made it the common emporium of Greece and
                        Asia, where supplies were to be obtained of everything necessary or useful

                        conjectures were formed and openly expressed as to what the Romans would do,

                        after a blast from the trumpet had produced silence, made the following

                        him, now that he had obtained peace, to send a mission to Rome to establish
                        relations of friendship and alliance. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> By

                        with Philip took place at Tempe. He assured Cornelius that he would send
                        delegates forthwith, and Cornelius then went on to Thermopylae, where what
                            <milestone n="8??" unit="section"/> was called the Pylaic council-a

                        others took a much stronger line and declared that without the aid of the

                        have landed in Greece. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> To prevent matters
                        from coming to an open quarrel, the Roman commander abstained from replying
                        to these charges and simply assured them that if they would send an embassy
                        to Rome they would gain everything that was fair and reasonable. <milestone

                        Greece and Macedonia and Asia, Etruria very nearly became the scene of war
                        owing to a conspiracy of the slaves. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> For
                        the purpose of investigating and crushing this movement, Manius Acilius
                        Glabrio, to whom as praetor the mixed jurisdiction over citizens and aliens
                        had been assigned, was sent into Etruria with one of the two legions
                        stationed in the City. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> A body of the

                        sent back to their masters. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The consuls
                        left for their provinces. Marcellus entered the territory of the Boii, and
                        whilst he was entrenching his camp on some rising ground, his men worn out
                        with marching all day long, Corolamus, one of the Boian chiefs, attacked him
                        with a large force and killed as many as 3000. Several men of high rank fell
                        in this tumultuary battle; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> amongst them
                        Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus and M. Junius Silanus, prefects of the allies,
                        and two military tribunes in the second legion-M. Ogulnius and P. Claudius.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The Romans, however, succeeded by
                        great exertions in completing their lines and held the camp against the
                        attacks of the enemy, which his initial success rendered all the more
                        fierce. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Marcellus remained in his camp for
                        some time, in order that his wounded might be cured and that his men might
                        have time to recover their spirits after such heavy losses. </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The Boians, quite incapable of supporting
                        the weariness of delay, dispersed everywhere to their villages and
                        strongholds. Suddenly Marcellus crossed the Po and invaded the Comum
                        territory, where the Insubres had induced the natives to take up arms and
                        were now encamped. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The Boian Gauls, full
                        of confidence after the recent fight, joined battle with him while he was
                        actually on the march, and at first attacked with such violence that they
                        forced the front ranks to give way. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                        Fearing that if they once began to give ground it might end in a complete
                        repulse, Marcellus brought up a cohort of Marsians and launched all the
                        troops of the Latin cavalry against the enemy. <milestone n="11"

                        steadiness and resisted all attempts to break it. At last they took the
                        offensive in a furious charge which the Gauls were unable to stand; they
                        turned and fled in disorder. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> According to
                        Valerius Antias over 40,000 men were killed in that battle, 801 standards
                        captured, together with 732 wagons and a large number of gold chains.
                            <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Claudius tells us that one of these,

                        the Capitol. The Gaulish camp was stormed and plundered on the same day as
                        the battle took place, and a few days later the town of Comum was captured.
                            <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Subsequently twenty-eight fortified
                        places went over to the consul. It is a question amongst the various

                        marched <milestone n="15??" unit="section"/> in the first place, and whether
                        he wiped out his unsuccessful action by a successful one afterwards or
                        whether the victory at Comum was marred by his later disaster amongst the

                        by making a wide detour through open and therefore safe country ultimately

                        keeping its formation on the march, and they followed it through secret
                        paths in the forest with the intention of making a surprise attack.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> As they did not catch it up, they
                        suddenly crossed the Po in ships and devastated the lands of the Laevi and
                        Libui. On their way back along the Ligurian frontier they fell in with the
                        Roman armies whilst they were loaded with plunder. <milestone n="7"

                        made for battle. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Here was a striking
                        instance of the way in which passion stimulates courage, for the Romans were
                        so determined to kill rather than simply to win a victory that they left

                        a three days' thanksgiving was ordered for the victory. Marcellus arrived in
                        Rome soon afterwards and a triumph was unanimously accorded to him by the
                        senate. He celebrated his triumph over the Insubres and the Comensians while

                        opportunity of winning it. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> They told the
                        envoys in reply that Antiochus must be neither surprised nor angry if they
                        did not patiently resign themselves to the indefinite postponement of their
                        hopes of liberty. </p>
                    <p> At the beginning of spring he set sail from Ephesus for the Hellespont and
                        ordered his land army to proceed from Abydos to the Chersonese. <milestone

                        Madytos, a city in the Chersonese, and as they had shut their gates against
                        him he completely invested the place, and was on the point of bringing up
                        his siege engines when the city surrendered. <milestone n="9" unit="section"
                        /> The fear which Antiochus thus inspired led the inhabitants of Sestos and
                        the other cities in the Chersonese to make a voluntary surrender. His next
                        objective was Lysimachia. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> When he arrived
                        here with the whole of his land and sea forces he found the place deserted
                        and little more than a heap of ruins, for some years previously the
                        Thracians had captured and plundered the city and then burnt it. <milestone
                            n="11" unit="section"/> Finding it in this condition, Antiochus was
                        seized by a desire to restore a city of such celebrity and so favourably
                        situated, and he at once set about the various tasks which this involved.
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The houses and walls were rebuilt,
                        some of the former inhabitants who had been made slaves were ransomed,
                        others who were scattered as refugees throughout the Chersonese and the
                        shores of the Hellespont were discovered and brought together, and new
                        colonists were attracted by the prospect of the advantages they would
                        receive. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> In fact every method was adopted
                        of repopulating the city. To remove at the same time all apprehensions of
                        trouble from the Thracians he proceeded with <milestone n="14??"

                        Rome? Even if he had landed in Italy he would say that he did not mean war,
                        but the Romans were not going to wait until he was in a position to do that.

                        Antiochus ought to do, whilst they never stopped to consider what limits

                        Romans. After the defeat of Lysimachus all that belonged to him passed by
                        the right of war to Seleucus, and therefore he counted it part of his

                        for some days, an unauthenticated rumour reached them that Ptolemy was dead.

                        arrived at; both parties pretended that they had heard nothing about it, and
                        L. Cornelius, whose mission extended to both Antiochus and Ptolemy, asked
                        for a short adjournment to allow of his obtaining an interview with Ptolemy.
                        His object was to land in Egypt before the new occupant of the throne could

                        it would be his own, and so, taking his leave of the Roman commissioners and

                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> From there he despatched envoys to

                        reached Patarae in Lycia and there he learnt that Ptolemy was alive. He now
                        abandoned all intention of sailing to Egypt, but continued his voyage as far
                        as Cyprus. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> When he had rounded the

                        as far as the co-called "heads" of the river Saros he was overtaken by a

                        a large number foundered so suddenly that none could swim to land. There was
                        a very great loss of life; not only nameless crowds of sailors and soldiers,
                        but many distinguished men, friends of the king, were amongst the victims.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Antiochus collected the remains of his
                        shattered fleet, but as he was in no condition to make an attempt on Cyprus
                        he returned to Seleucia, much poorer in men and material resources than when
                        he started on his expedition. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Here he had
                        the ships beached, for winter was close at hand, after which he went to

                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> This was in fulfilment of a vow made
                        by the praetor A. Cornelius Mammula at the desire of the senate and by order
                        of the people twenty-one years previously in the consulship of Cn. Servilius

                        Whilst general surprise was felt that nothing was being done about the war
                        which had broken out in Spain, a despatch arrived from Q. Minucius
                        announcing that he had successfully engaged the Spanish generals Budar and
                        Baesadines, and that the enemy had lost 12,000 men, Budar being made
                        prisoner and the rest routed and put to flight. When the despatch was read
                        less apprehension was felt about the two Spains, where a very serious war
                        had been anticipated. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The general anxiety
                        now centered on Antiochus, especially after the return of the ten
                        commissioners. After giving their report on the negotiations with Philip and
                        the terms on which peace had been made with him, they made it evident that a
                        war on at least as great a scale with Antiochus was imminent. <milestone

                        Europe with an enormous fleet and a splendid army, and if his attention had
                        not been diverted by a groundless hope based upon a still more groundless
                        rumour, to the invasion of Egypt, Greece would very soon have been in the

                        naturally restless and now intensely embittered against the Romans, would no
                        longer remain quiet. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> And there was another
                        most formidable mischief with its roots in the very vitals of Greece-Nabis,
                        who was for the time being tyrant of Lacedaemon, but who if he were allowed
                        would soon become tyrant of the whole of Greece, a man who in greed and
                        brutality rivalled the most notorious tyrants in history. <milestone n="9"

                        thought best in the interests of the State, the matter was finally left in

                        were constantly writing to their friends in Rome. <milestone n="6"

                        being sent by Hannibal to Antiochus and emissaries from the king were
                        holding secret conferences with him. Just as there were wild beasts which no
                        skill could tame, so this man was untamable and implacable. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> He complained that his countrymen were becoming
                        enervated through ease and self-indulgence, and slumbering in indolence and
                        sloth, and said that nothing could rouse them but the clash of arms.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> People were all the more ready to
                        believe these assertions when they remembered that it was this man who was
                        responsible for the beginning quite as much as for the conduct of the late
                        war. His recent action had also called forth strong resentment amongst many

                        their fellow-citizens, Hannibal, who had been appointed one of the presiding
                        magistrates, ordered the quaestor to be summoned before him. <milestone

                        belonged to the opposite party and, moreover, as the quaestors were
                        generally advanced to the all-powerful order of judges he gave himself the

                        Resenting this indignity Hannibal sent an officer to arrest the quaestor,
                        and after he was brought into the assembly Hannibal denounced not only the
                        quaestor but the whole of the judicial order, whose insolence and excessive
                        power utterly subverted the laws and the authority of the magistrates who

                        of that order were recognised as dangerous to the liberty of the meanest
                        citizen, he at once proposed and carried a law enacting that the judges
                        should be elected annually and that none should hold office for two

                        he took in the public interest aroused intense hostility to him personally.

                        his opponents carried their point and delegates were sent to Carthage to

                        enemies to give out that people who asked the reason of their coming
