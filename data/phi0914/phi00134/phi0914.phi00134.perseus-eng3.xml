                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> While the State was preoccupied by serious
                        wars, some hardly yet over and others threatening, an incident occurred
                        which though unimportant in itself resulted in a violent party conflict.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Two of the tribunes of the plebs, M.
                        Fundanius and L. Valerius, had brought in a proposal to repeal the Oppian
                        Law. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> This law had been made on the motion
                        of M. Oppius, a tribune of the plebs, during the consulship of Q. Fabius and
                        Tiberius Sempronius, when the strain of the Punic War was most severely
                        felt. It forbade any woman to have in her possession more than half an ounce
                        of gold, to wear a dress of various colours or to ride in a two-horsed
                        vehicle within a mile of the City or of any Roman town unless she was going
                        to take part in some religious function. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                        The two Brutuses-M. Junius and T. Junius-both tribunes of the plebs,
                        defended the law and declared that they would not allow it to be repealed;
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> many of the nobility came forward to
                        speak in favour of the repeal or against it; the Capitol was crowded with
                        supporters and opponents of the proposal; the matrons could not be kept
                        indoors either by the authority of the magistrates or the orders of their
                        husbands or their own sense of propriety. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        They filled all the streets and blocked the approaches to the Forum; they
                        implored the men who were on their way thither to allow the women to resume
                        their former adornments now that the commonwealth was flourishing and
                        private fortunes increasing every day. Their numbers were daily augmented by
                        those who came up from the country towns. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                        At last they ventured to approach the consuls and praetors and other
                        magistrates with their demands. One of the consuls at all events was
                        inexorably opposed to their request-M. Porcius Cato. He spoke as follows in
                        defence of the law: </p>

                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> "If we had, each one of us, made it a rule
                        to uphold the rights and authority of the husband in our own households we
                        should not now have this trouble with the whole body of our women.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> As things are now our liberty of
                        action, which has been checked and rendered powerless by female despotism at
                        home, is actually crushed and trampled on here in the Forum, and because we
                        were unable to withstand them individually we have now to dread their united
                        strength. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> I used to think that it was a
                        fabulous story which tells us that in a certain island the whole of the male
                        sex was extirpated by a conspiracy amongst the women; <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> there is no class of women from whom the gravest
                        dangers may not arise, if once you allow intrigues, plots, secret cabals to
                        go on. I can hardly make up my mind which is worse, the affair itself or the
                        disastrous precedent set up. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The latter
                        concerns us as consuls and magistrates; the former has to do more with you,
                        Quirites. Whether the measure before you is for the good of the commonwealth
                        or not is for you to determine by your votes; this tumult amongst the women,
                        whether a spontaneous movement or due to your instigation, M. Fundanius and
                        L. Valerius, certainly points to failure on the part of the magistrates, but
                        whether it reflects more on you tribunes or on the consuls I do not know.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> It brings the greater discredit on you
                        if you have carried your tribunitian agitation so far as to create unrest
                        among the women, but more disgrace upon us if we have to submit to
                            <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/> laws being imposed upon us through
                        fear of a secession on their part, as we had to do formerly on occasions of
                        the secession of the plebs. It was not without a feeling of shame that I
                        made my way into the Forum through a regular army of women. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> Had not my respect for the dignity and modesty of some
                        amongst them, more than any consideration for them as a whole, restrained me
                        from letting them be publicly rebuked by a consul, I should have said, 'What
                        is this habit you have formed of running abroad and blocking the streets and
                        accosting men who are strangers to you? <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                        Could you not each of you put the very same question to your husbands at
                        home? Surely you do not make yourselves more attractive in public than in
                        private, to other women's husbands more than to your own? <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> If matrons were kept by their natural modesty within
                        the limits of their rights, it would be most unbecoming for you to trouble
                        yourselves even at home about the laws which may be passed or repealed
                        here.' Our ancestors would have no woman transact even private business
                        except through her guardian, they placed them under the tutelage of parents
                        or brothers or husbands. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> We suffer them
                        now to dabble in politics and mix themselves up with the business of the
                        Forum and public debates and election contests. What are they doing now in
                        the public roads and at the street corners but recommending to the plebs the
                        proposal of their tribunes and voting for the repeal of the law. <milestone
                            n="12" unit="section"/> Give the reins to a headstrong nature, to a
                        creature that has not been tamed, and then hope that they will themselves
                        set bounds to their licence if you do not do it yourselves. <milestone
                            n="13" unit="section"/> This is the smallest of those restrictions which
                        have been imposed upon women by ancestral custom or by laws, and which they
                        submit to with such impatience. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> What they
                        really want is unrestricted freedom, or to speak the truth, licence, and if
                        they win on this occasion what is there that they will not attempt? </p>
                </div>
                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="3" type="chapter">
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> "Call to mind all the regulations
                        respecting women by which our ancestors curbed their licence and made them
                        obedient to their husbands, and yet in spite of all those restrictions you
                        can scarcely hold them in. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> If you allow
                        them to pull away these restraints and wrench them out one after another,
                        and finally put themselves on an equality with their husbands, do you
                        imagine that you will be able to tolerate them? From the moment that they
                        become your fellows they will become your masters. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> But surely, you say, what they object to is having a
                        new restriction imposed upon them, they are not deprecating the assertion of
                        a right but the infliction of a wrong. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> No,
                        they are demanding the abrogation of a law which you enacted by your
                        suffrages and which the practical experience of all these years has approved
                        and justified. This they would have you repeal; that means that by
                        rescinding this they would have you weaken all. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> No law is equally agreeable to everybody, the only
                        question is whether it is beneficial on the whole and good for the majority.
                        If everyone who feels himself personally aggrieved by a law is to destroy it
                        and get rid of it, what is gained by the whole body of citizens making laws
                        which those against whom they are enacted can in a short time repeal?
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> I want, however, to learn the reason
                        why these excited matrons have run out into the streets and scarcely keep
                        away from the Forum and the Assembly. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Is
                        it that those taken prisoners by Hannibal-their fathers and husbands and
                        children and brothers-may be ransomed? The republic is a long way from this
                        misfortune, and may it ever remain so! <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                        Still, when this did happen, you refused to do so in spite of their dutiful
                        entreaties. But, you may say, it is not dutiful affection and solicitude for
                        those they love that has brought them together; they are going to welcome
                        Mater Idaea on her way from Phrygian Pessinus. What pretext in the least
                        degree respectable is put forward for this female insurrection? <milestone
                            n="9" unit="section"/> 'That we may shine,' they say, 'in gold and
                        purple, that we may ride in carriages on festal and ordinary days alike, as
                        though in triumph for having defeated and repealed a law after capturing and

                        expensive habits of women and often, too, of those of men, not only private
                        citizens but even magistrates, <milestone n="2??" unit="section"/> and I
                        have often said that the community suffers from two opposite vices-avarice
                        and luxury-pestilential diseases which have proved the ruin of all great
                        empires. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The brighter and better the
                        fortunes of the republic become day by day, and the greater the growth of
                        its dominion-and now we are penetrating into Greece and Asia, regions filled
                        with everything that can tempt appetite or excite desire, and are even
                        laying hands on the treasures of kings-so much the more do I dread the
                        prospect of these things taking us captive rather than we them. <milestone
                            n="4" unit="section"/> It was a bad day for this City, believe me, when
                        the statues were brought from Syracuse. I hear far too many people praising
                        and admiring those which adorn Athens and Corinth and laughing at the clay
                        images of our gods standing in front of their temples. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> I for my part prefer these gods who are propitious to
                        us, and I trust that they will continue to be so as long as we allow them to
                        remain in their present abodes. </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> In the days of our forefathers Pyrrhus
                        attempted, through his ambassador Cineas, to tamper with the loyalty of
                        women as well as men by means of bribes. The Law of Oppius in restraint of
                        female extravagance had not then been passed, still not a single woman
                        accepted a bribe. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> What do you think was
                        the reason? The same reason which our forefathers had for not making any law
                        on the subject; there was no extravagance to be restrained. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> Diseases must be recognised before remedies are
                        applied, and so the passion for self-indulgence must be in existence before
                        the laws which are to curb it. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> What called
                        out the Licinian Law which restricted estates to 500 jugera except the keen
                        desire of adding field to field? What led to the passing of the Cincian Law
                        concerning presents and fees except the condition of the plebeians who had
                        become tributaries and taxpayers to the senate? <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> It is not therefore in the least surprising that
                        neither the Oppian nor any other law was in those days required to set
                        limits to the expensive habits of women when they refused to accept the gold
                        and purple that was freely offered to them. If Cineas were to go in these
                        days about the City with his gifts, he would find women standing in the
                        streets quite ready to accept them. </p>

                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> There are some desires of which I cannot

                        naturally create a feeling of shame or indignation, but when all are upon
                        the same level as far as dress is concerned why should any one of you fear
                        that you will not attract notice? The very last things to be ashamed of are
                        thriftiness and poverty, but this law relieves you of both since you do not
                        possess what it forbids you to possess. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                        The wealthy woman says, 'This levelling down is just what I do not tolerate.
                        Why am I not to be admired and looked at for my gold and purple? <milestone
                            n="14" unit="section"/> Why is the poverty of others disguised under
                        this appearance of law so that they may be thought to have possessed, had
                        the law allowed it, what it was quite out of their power to possess?' </p>
                    <p> Do you want, Quirites, to plunge your wives into a rivalry of this nature,
                        where the rich desire to have what no one else can afford, and the poor,
                        that they may not be despised for their poverty, stretch their expenses
                        beyond their means? <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> Depend upon it, as
                        soon as a woman begins to be ashamed of what she ought not to be ashamed of
                        she will cease to feel shame at what she ought to be ashamed of. <milestone
                            n="16" unit="section"/> She who is in a position to do so will get what
                        she wants with her own money, she who cannot do this will ask her husband.
                            <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> The husband is in a pitiable plight
                        whether he yields or refuses; in the latter case he will see another giving
                        what he refused to give. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> Now they are
                        soliciting other women's husbands, and what is worse they are soliciting
                        votes for the repeal of a law, and are getting them from some, against the
                        interest of you and your property and your children. When once the law has
                        ceased to fix a limit to your wife's expenses, you will never fix one. Do
                        not imagine that things will be the same as they were before the law was
                        made. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> It is safer for an evil-doer not to
                        be prosecuted than for him to be tried and then acquitted, and luxury and
                        extravagance would have been more tolerable had they never been interfered
                        with than they will be now, just like wild beasts which have been irritated
                        by their chains and then released. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/> I give
                        my vote against every attempt to repeal the law, and pray that all the gods
                        may give your action a fortunate result." </p>

                        had announced their intention of vetoing the repeal spoke briefly to the
                        same effect. Then L. Valerius made the following speech in defence of his
                        proposal: "If it had been only private citizens who came forward to argue in
                        favour of, or against, the measure we have brought in, I should have awaited
                        your votes in silence as I should have considered that enough had been said
                        on either side. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> But now, when a man of
                        such weight of character as M. Porcius, our consul, is opposing our bill,
                        not simply by exerting his personal authority which, even had he remained
                        silent, would have had very great influence, but also in a long and
                        carefully thought out speech, it is necessary to make a brief reply.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He spent, it is true, more time in
                        castigating the matrons than in arguing against the bill, and he even left
                        it doubtful whether the action of the matrons which he censured was due to
                        their own initiative or to our instigation. <milestone n="4" unit="section"
                        /> I shall defend the measure and not ourselves, for that was thrown out as
                        a suggestion rather than as an actual charge. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> Because we are now enjoying the blessings of peace and
                        the commonwealth is flourishing and happy, the matrons are making a public
                        request to you that you will repeal a law which was passed against them
                        under the pressure of a time of war. He denounces this action of theirs as a
                        plot, a seditious movement, and he sometimes calls it a female secession.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> I know how these and other strong
                        expressions are selected to bolster up a case, and we all know that, though
                        naturally of a gentle disposition, Cato is a powerful speaker and sometimes
                        almost menacing. What innovation have the matrons been guilty of by publicly
                        assembling in such numbers for a cause which touches them so closely?
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Have they never appeared in public
                        before? I will quote your own 'Origines' against you. Hear how often they

                        rushing between the lines? And when after the expulsion of the kings the

                        for ancient precedents, was it not the case that in the late war when money
                        was needed the treasury was assisted by the money of the widows? <milestone

                        to no one; why then should we be surprised at their taking the same action
                        in a cause which especially interests them? But what have they done?

                        towns divided by a wall. One was inhabited by Greeks who had, like the
                        people of Massilia, originally come from Phocaea; the other contained a
                        Spanish population. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> As the Greek town was
                        almost entirely open to the sea its walls were less than half a mile in
                        circuit; the Spanish town, further back from the sea, had walls with a
                        circuit of three miles. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> A third element in
                        the population was formed by some Roman colonists who had been settled there
                        by the deified Caesar after the final defeat of Pompey's sons. <milestone
                            n="4" unit="section"/> At the present day all have been fused into one
                        municipal body by the grant of Roman citizenship, in the first instance to
                        the Spaniards and then to the Greeks. Anyone who saw how the Greeks were
                        exposed to attacks on the one side from the open sea and from the Spaniards
                        on the other side might wonder what there was that afforded them protection.
                        Discipline was the guardian of their weakness, a quality which among
                        stronger nations is best maintained by fear. <milestone n="5" unit="section"
                        /> They kept that portion of the wall which faced inland extremely well
                        fortified, only one gate was situated on that side and it was always guarded
                        night and day by one of the magistrates. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        During the night one-third of the citizens were on duty on the walls, not
                        simply as a matter of routine or regulation, they kept up their watches and
                        patrols as if an enemy were at their gates. No Spaniards were allowed within
                        their city, nor did they themselves venture outside their walls without
                        proper precautions. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The exits to the sea
                        were open to all. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> They never went out
                        through the gate which faced the Spanish town unless a large number went
                        together, and it was generally the body who had mounted guard on the walls
                        the night before. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The object of their
                        going outside this gate was as follows: the Spaniards, unfamiliar with the
                        sea, were glad to purchase the goods which the Greeks received from abroad
                        and at the same time to sell the products of their fields to them. Owing to
                        the need of this mutual intercourse the Spanish city was always open to the
                        Greeks. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> An additional security was found
                        in the friendship of Rome, under whose shelter they lay and to which they
                        were quite as loyal as the Massilians, though their strength and resources
                        were so much less. On this occasion they gave the consul and his army a
                        hearty welcome. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Cato made a short stay
                        there, and while he was gaining intelligence as to the strength and position
                        of the enemy he spent the interval in exercising his troops, that they might
                        not waste their time. It happened to be the time of the year when the
                        Spaniards had their corn stored in the barns. <milestone n="12"

                            <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Then, advancing from Emporiae, he
                        laid the enemy's fields waste with fire and sword, and spread terror and

                        as performance, especially in war; to the man who believes that he has help
                        to fall back upon it is just the same as if he had it, his very belief
                        nerves him to hope and to dare. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The next
                        day he gave his reply to the envoys, and assured them that though he was
                        afraid of weakening his force for the benefit of others, he nevertheless
                        made more account of the critical and dangerous position they were in than
                        he did of his own. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> He then ordered a third
                        of the men in each cohort to cook the food, which they were to take on board
                        in good time, and orders were at the same time issued for the ships to be
                        ready to sail in three days' time. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> He told
                        two of the envoys to report these measures to Bilistages and the Ilergetes;
                        the third, the chief's son, he succeeded, by his affability and the presents
                        he gave him, in keeping with him. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The
                        envoys did not leave until they saw the soldiers actually on board, then, no
                        longer feeling any doubts, they spread far and wide amongst friends and foes
                        the news of the approach of Roman succour. </p>

                        long enough he recalled the soldiers from the ships, and as the season for
                        active operations was now approaching, he fixed his camp at a distance of
                        three miles from Emporiae. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> From this
                        position he sent his men into the enemy's fields in quest of plunder, first
                        in one quarter and then in another as occasion served, leaving only a small
                        guard in the camp. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> They generally started
                        at night in order to cover as great a distance from the camp as possible and
                        also to take the enemy by surprise. This kind of thing was a training for
                        the new levies and led to the capture of numerous prisoners, till the enemy
                        no longer ventured outside the defences of their forts. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> When he had thoroughly tested the temper of his own men
                        and that of the enemy he ordered the military tribunes and prefects of the
                        allies, as well as all the cavalry and centurions, to appear on parade and
                        addressed them as follows: <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> "You have often
                        wished for the time when you might have an opportunity of displaying your

                        your operations have resembled those of marauders rather than of warriors,
                        now you shall join issue with the enemy in a regular battle. Henceforth you
                        will be allowed, instead of ravaging fields, to drain cities of their
                        wealth. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> When the Carthaginian commanders
                        and armies were in Spain, our fathers had not a single soldier here, and yet
                        they insisted upon a clause being added to the treaty fixing the Ebro as the
                        boundary of their dominion. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Now, when a
                        consul, two praetors and three Roman armies are occupying Spain, and not a
                        single Carthaginian has been seen in this province for the last ten years,
                        our dominion on this side of the Ebro has been lost to us. <milestone n="9"

                        courage and to compel a nation, which starts a war in a spirit of
                        recklessness rather than of steady determination, to submit once more to the
                        yoke which it has cast off." <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> After these
                        words of encouragement he announced that he should lead them that night
                        against the enemy's camp. They were then dismissed to take food and rest.

                        started at midnight in order that he might take up the position which he
                        intended to secure before the enemy were aware of his movements. <milestone
                            n="2" unit="section"/> He led his troops round to the rear of the
                        enemy's camp and formed them into line at daybreak, after which he sent
                        three cohorts right up to the hostile rampart. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> Startled by the appearance of the Romans behind their
                        lines, the barbarians flew to arms. Meanwhile the consul briefly addressed
                        his men. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> "There is no hope," he said,
                        "anywhere but in courage, and indeed I have taken care that there shall not
                        be. Between us and our camp is the enemy, and behind us enemy country. The
                        noblest course is also the safest, and that is to rest all your hopes in
                        your valour." <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Then he ordered the cohorts
                        to be recalled that their feigned retreat might draw the natives out of
                        their camp. His anticipations were realised. They thought that the Romans
                        had retired through fear, and bursting out of their camp they covered with
                        their numbers the whole of the ground between their camp and the Roman line
                        of battle. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Whilst they were hurriedly
                        forming their ranks the consul, whose dispositions were completed, commenced
                        the attack. The cavalry on the two wings were the first to get into action,
                        but those on the right were immediately repulsed and their hasty retirement
                        created alarm amongst the infantry. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> On
                        seeing this, the consul ordered two picked cohorts to be taken round the
                        enemy's right and to show themselves in his rear before the infantry became
                        engaged. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> This menace to the enemy made the
                        battle a more even one; still, the right wing, both cavalry and infantry,
                        had become so demoralised that the consul seized some of them with his own
                        hand and turned them towards the foe. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> As
                        long as the action was confined to the discharge of missiles it was equally
                        contested on both sides, but now the Roman right where the panic and flight
                        began was with difficulty holding its ground; the left, on the other hand,
                        was pressing back the barbarians in front, and the cohorts in the rear were
                        creating a panic amongst them. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> When they
                        had discharged their iron javelins and fire darts they drew their swords and
                        the fighting became more furious. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> They
                        were no longer wounded by chance hits from a distance, but foot to foot with
                        the foe they had only their strength and courage to trust to. </p>

                        exhausted, the consul rekindled their courage by bringing up the reserves
                        from the second line. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The front was
                        re-formed, and these fresh troops attacking the wearied enemy with fresh
                        weapons made a fierce charge in a dense body and broke their lines, and once
                        broken they soon scattered in flight and rushed through the fields in the
                        direction of their camp. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> When Cato saw the
                        whole battleground filled with fugitives he galloped back to the second
                        legion which was stationed in reserve, ordered the standards to be borne
                        before him and the whole legion to follow him at the double to attack the
                        hostile camp. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> When a man in his eagerness
                        ran out of his rank the consul rode up and struck him with his sparus and
                        ordered the military tribunes and centurions to chastise him. <milestone
                            n="5" unit="section"/> The attack on the camp had already begun, but the
                        Romans were unable to reach the stockade, as they were held up by stones and
                        stakes and every description of missile. The appearance of the fresh legion
                        put heart into the assailants and made the enemy fight still more
                        desperately in front of their breastwork. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        The consul surveyed the whole position that he might find out where there
                        was the weakest resistance and therefore the best chance of breaking
                        through. He saw that the defenders were in least force at the left-hand gate
                        of their camp, and to this point he directed the hastati and principes of
                        the second legion. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The defenders who were
                        holding the gate could not withstand their charge, and when the others saw
                        the enemy within their lines they abandoned all further attempts to retain
                        their camp and flung away their arms and standards. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> Many were killed at the gates, jammed together by the
                        crowding in the narrow space, and whilst the soldiers of the second legion
                        were cutting the enemy from behind, the rest plundered the camp. <milestone
                            n="9" unit="section"/> Valerius Antias says that more than 40,000 of the
                        enemy were killed that day. Cato, who certainly does not depreciate his own
                        merits, says that many were killed, but does not give the actual numbers.

                        his men had nothing to trust to but their courage, and also joining battle

                        third was his order to the second legion to advance in battle formation
                        right up to the gate of the camp while the rest of his troops were scattered

                        battle the consul's victorious advance was uninterrupted. When the signal

                        camp, he allowed them a few hours' rest and then led them off to harry the
                        fields. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> As the enemy had been scattered in
                        flight they extended their depredations over a wider extent of country,

                        than the battle to force the inhabitants of Spanish Emporiae and the

                        taken refuge in Emporiae also surrendered. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        The consul addressed them all in kind terms and dismissed them to their
                        homes. He at once resumed his advance, and wherever his army marched
                        delegates from the various communities met him to make their surrender.

                        whole of Spain on this side the Ebro had been subjugated and the soldiers
                        belonging to the Roman and allied troops who had through various mishaps
                        been made prisoners in Spain were brought by the natives as a gift to the
                        consul. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Then a rumour was spread that the
                        consul intended to take his army into Turdetania, and it was even

                        leniently. They were all sold into slavery to prevent any further

                        Turdetani are considered the least warlike of all the Spanish tribes;
                        nevertheless, trusting to their numbers, they ventured to oppose the Roman
                        armies. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> A cavalry charge threw them at
                        once into disorder; the infantry encounter was hardly a contest, the

                        did not end the war. The Turduli hired a force of 10,000 Celtiberian

                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> While this was going on, the consul,
                        seriously perturbed by the rising of the Bergistani, and convinced that all

                        he summoned the senators in all the cities to meet him. "It is not," he told

                        and the consul marched his legions thither, and found on arrival that the

                        recognised their arms and standards and remembered how often they had raided

                        flung open their gates and all in a body rushed upon them. <milestone n="7"

                        where all was silence and solitude, as the defenders had gone off in pursuit

                        those inflicted on you would have been a sufficient justification for war.

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> This pretentious harangue called up
                        Aristaenus, the captain-general of the Achaean League. <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> "I pray," he began, "that Jupiter Optimus Maximus and
                        Queen Juno, the tutelary deities of Argos, may never allow that city to be a
                        bone of contention between the tyrant of Lacedaemon and the robbers of
                        Aetolia, or suffer more after you have recovered it than it did when he

                        they make a stronghold for themselves in the very heart of Greece? They have
                        nothing Greek about them but the language, any more than they have anything
                        human about them but the form and appearance of men; their customs and rites
                        are more horrid than those of any barbarians, nay, even than those of savage
                        beasts. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> We ask you therefore, Romans, to
                        rescue Argos from Nabis and settle the affairs of Greece in such a way that
                        you may leave this country at peace and security even against the robber
                        practices of the Aetolians." <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> A general
                        outcry against the Aetolians arose, and the Roman commander said that he
                        would have replied to their charges had he not seen that the delegates were
                        all so incensed against them that they needed to be calmed rather than
                        excited further. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> He should now put the
                        question, "What do you decide as to war with Nabis, if he does not restore
                        Argos to the Achaeans?" There was a unanimous decision in favour of war, and
                        he impressed upon them the duty of each city sending a contingent in
                        proportion to their strength. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> He also sent
                        an envoy to the Aetolians, not so much in the expectation of compliance with
                        his demands as to make them disclose their real sentiments, and in this he
                        succeeded. </p>

                        he felt at the appearance of the Romans, and his fears of a foreign foe were
                        aggravated by disturbances at home. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> There
                        was an Argive named Damocles, a young man of more courage than prudence.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> He got hold of those who seemed likely

                        somewhat incautious in testing the sincerity of those whom he addressed.
                        While he was conferring with his supporters one of the commandant's

                        tortured to death. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> He went off accordingly
                        with a few followers to the forum, calling upon all who had the safety of
                        their State at heart to follow him as the champion of their liberty. He did
                        not induce a single person to move, for they saw that there was no chance of

                        trouble driven back behind their walls. The Roman general then fixed his
                        camp at the spot where the battle had taken place and remained there for a

                        he summoned a council of war to consider the question of attacking Argos.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> All with the exception of Aristaenus
                        were agreed that as Argos was the sole cause of the war, so it ought

                        was very far from what Quinctius wanted, and when Aristaenus spoke in
                        opposition to the unanimous sense of the council he listened to him with
                        unmistakable signs of approval. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> He wound
                        up the discussion by stating that it was on behalf of the Argives that war
                        had been begun, and he could not imagine anything less consistent than to
                        leave the real enemy alone and attack Argos. <milestone n="8" unit="section"
                        /> As far as he was concerned he should direct all his efforts against

                    <p> After the council broke up he sent some cohorts of light troops, infantry
                        and cavalry, to collect corn. All that was ripe was cut and carried off;
                        what was still green was trampled down and spoilt to prevent the enemy from
                        using it. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Then he commenced his march, and
                        after crossing Mount Parthenius and leaving Tegea on his right he encamped
                        on the third day at Caryae, and here he awaited the allied contingents
                        before entering the enemy's country; <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> 1500

                        which had been requisitioned from the cities in the neighbourhood.

                        concentrating; L. Quinctius had arrived from Leucas with 40 ships; there
                        were 18 decked ships from Rhodes; Eumenes was cruising amongst the Cyclades
                        with 10 decked ships, 30 despatch-boats and various others of smaller build.

                        held Lacedaemon was very considerable. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                        The principal man among the refugees was Agesipolis, and the sovereignty of

                        rather than punished for having done it. He should therefore keep certain

                        for some time there was a regular action. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                        At length Nabis' men began to waver and finally took to flight. The rout
                        would not have been so complete had not the Achaeans who were pursuing them
                        been familiar with the country. They inflicted heavy losses upon them and
                        deprived most of the scattered fugitives of their arms. Quinctius fixed his
                        camp near Amyclae. This city lay in a populous and fertile district and he
                        laid the whole of it waste. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> None of the
                        enemy, however, ventured outside their gates, and he shifted his camp to the
                        bank of the Eurotas and from there he carried devastation throughout the
                        district which stretched from the foot of Taygetus to the sea. </p>

                        securing the towns on the coast, in some cases by voluntary surrender, in
                        others by threats or force. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Gytheum was
                        the great seaport of Lacedaemonia, and when he learnt that the Romans were
                        in camp at no great distance from the sea Lucius determined to attack it
                        with his united strength. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> In those days it
                        was a strong city with a large mixed population of citizens and aliens and
                        was thoroughly equipped with all the apparatus for war. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> Lucius was attempting a far from easy task, and very
                        opportunely for him Eumenes and the Rhodian fleet appeared on the scene.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The immense number of seamen which had
                        been drawn from the three fleets constructed in a few days all that was
                        required for an attack upon the city, which was fortified on its landward as
                        well as its seaward side. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The testudines
                        had been brought up and the wall was being undermined; in other places it
                        was being battered by the rams. One turret had been brought down by repeated
                        blows and the wall adjacent had fallen with it. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> To draw off the enemy from the breach thus caused, the
                        Romans delivered an assault from the harbour, where the ground was more
                        level, while at the same time they attempted to fight their way over the
                        ruins of the wall. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> They had almost
                        succeeded in penetrating at this point when the assault was suddenly stopped
                        as a prospect presented itself of the city being surrendered, a prospect,
                        however, which soon vanished. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Two men,
                        Dexagoridas and Gorgopas, shared the command of the city between them.
                        Dexagoridas had sent to the Roman general to say that he would deliver up
                        the city. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> After the time and manner of
                        procedure had been settled he was put to death by Gorgopas as a traitor, and
                        the latter, now in sole command, offered a more determined resistance. The
                        assault would have become much more difficult had not Quinctius appeared
                        with a body of 4000 picked troops. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> When
                        he had shown himself with his army drawn up on the brow of a hill not far
                        from the city, whilst Lucius on the other side was pressing the assault with
                        his siege works both by land and Sea, Gorgopas was driven to despair and
                        compelled to take the very course which in the case of <milestone n="12??"

                        had been left in command at Argos, transferred the custody of the city to
                        Timocrates of Pellene and joined Nabis at Sparta with 1000 mercenary troops
                        and 2000 Argives. </p>

                        appearance of the Roman fleet and the loss of the towns on the coast, but as
                        long as Gytheum was held by his men he accepted the situation though with
                        faint hopes of success. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> When, however, he
                        heard that it too had passed into the hands of the Romans he realised the
                        hopelessness of his position with the enemy all round his frontiers and the
                        sea entirely closed to him. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He saw that he
                        must yield to circumstances, and accordingly he sent a herald to the Roman
                        camp to find out whether they would allow him to send envoys to them.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> His request was granted, and
                        Pythagoras was sent to the general for the sole purpose of asking him to
                        meet the tyrant in conference. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The
                        military council was convened and they were unanimously of opinion that a

                        whether he would speak first or not, and he began the discussion in the
                        following speech: "Titus Quinctius and all who are present: If I could have
                        discovered for myself the reason why you have declared war against me or
                        actually commenced it, I should have awaited in silence the issue of my
                        fortunes. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> But as things are now I cannot
                        control myself sufficiently to refrain from asking, before I perish, why I
                        am to perish. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> If you were what the
                        Carthaginians are reported to be, a people for whom the honourable
                        observance of treaties possesses no sanctity, I should not be surprised at
                        your considering it a matter of small moment in what way you treat me.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> But when I look at you I see that you
                        are Romans who hold treaties to be the most solemn of all religious
                        obligations, and fidelity to allies the most sacred of human duties.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> When I look at myself I hope I am
                        still the man who in common with the rest of the Lacedaemonians is bound to
                        you by an age-long treaty of alliance and who renewed in the recent war with
                        Philip the personal tie of friendship. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        But, you say, I have violated and destroyed it by holding the city of the
                        Argives. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> How shall I justify this? By
                        appealing to facts or to the circumstances of the time? As to the facts I
                        have a double defence, for it was the townsmen themselves who invoked my aid
                        and put the place in my hands; I did not occupy it by force, I accepted it
                        and that too when Philip's partisans were in power, not when it was your
                        ally. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The circumstance of time clears me
                        too, because it was when I was actually holding Argos that the alliance
                        between us was formed, and the stipulation was not that I should withdraw my
                        garrison from Argos, but only that I should furnish assistance to you in the
                        war. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> In this question of Argos I most
                        certainly have the best of the argument both on the ground of equity and
                        justice-for I took a city which belonged not <milestone n="10??"
                            unit="section"/> to you but to your enemy, not by force but at the wish
                        of the inhabitants-and also on the strength of your own admission, for under

                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> But however that may be, the title of
                        'tyrant' and the arbitrary acts of a tyrant, such as summoning slaves to
                        freedom and settling the poverty-stricken masses on the land, are alleged
                        against me. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> As to the title I can make
                        this reply, whatever my character is I am the same man with whom you
                        yourself, T. Quinctius, entered into alliance. <milestone n="13"
                            unit="section"/> Then, I remember, you called me 'king,' now I see that
                        you have dubbed me 'tyrant.' Now, if I had altered the designation of my
                        rule, I should have to defend my inconsistency; as you are altering it, you
                        must justify yours. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> As to my augmenting
                        the civil population by freeing the slaves and dividing up the land amongst
                        the poor and needy, I can defend myself against this charge also by pleading
                        the time at which I did it. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> Whatever
                        these measures were I had carried them out when you contracted alliance with
                        me and accepted my assistance in the war with Philip. <milestone n="16"
                            unit="section"/> But even supposing that I had carried them out to-day,
                        I do not ask how I could have injured you or disturbed the amity between us,
                        I content myself with asserting that I have acted in accordance with our
                        ancestral laws and customs. Do not weigh what is done in Lacedaemon by your
                        own institutions. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> There is no necessity
                        for going into details. You select your cavalry as you do your infantry,
                        according to their assessment; you will have a few preeminent for their

                        any one order to be preponderant in the State; he believed that an equality
                        of rank and fortune was necessary in order that there might be a large
                        number of men to bear arms for their country. I have spoken at greater

                        face the certainty of having to pass the winter round the walls of
                        Lacedaemon. If these tedious processes only involved toil and danger I

                        There was to be a truce for six months between Nabis and his opponents-the
                        Romans, Eumenes and the Rhodians. T. Quinctius and Nabis were each to send
                        forthwith commissioners to Rome to secure the confirmation of the peace by
                        the senate. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The armistice was to commence
                        from the day on which the document containing the conditions was handed to
                        Nabis, and within ten days from that date he was to withdraw all his
                        garrisons from Argos and the other towns in Argive territory and the places
                        were to be handed over, evacuated and free, to the Romans. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> No slaves were to be removed from those places, whether
                        they had belonged to the king or the public authorities or private
                        individuals, and if any had previously been so removed they were to be duly
                        restored to their owners. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Nabis was to
                        return the ships he had taken from the maritime cities, and he himself was
                        not to possess any vessel beyond two light barques with not more than
                        sixteen oars. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> All the cities allied with
                        Rome were to have their prisoners and deserters restored to them, and all
                        the property which the people of Messene could collect together and identify
                        was to be given back to them. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Further, he
                        was to allow the Lacedaemonian refugees to have their wives and children

                        whilst in exile against her will. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Such of

                        were in any way to interfere with them. He was not to build a walled town or

                        commander-one being his own son-and he was to pay an indemnity of 100
                        talents of silver at once and an annual instalment of 50 talents for the

                        drawn from the maritime cities furnished him with by far the finest of his

                        soon became generally known. They were not objected to so strongly by the

                        time from the whole assembly, at another from separate groups. When he had

                        saying that they hoped for the best and that Fortune helped the brave.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Encouraged by the general voice, the
                        tyrant gave out that Antiochus and the Aetolians would assist them, and he

                        their missiles removed any doubt from the minds of the Romans that war was

                        bring up the whole of the naval contingent from Gytheum, he proceeded with
                        his military tribunes to ride round the city and examine its position.

                        in recent years the various tyrants had protected those parts which were
                        level and exposed by a wall; the higher and less accessible positions were
                        defended by permanent military posts instead of fortifications. <milestone

                        attack. Accordingly he completely invested the city with Roman and allied
                        troops, mounted and unmounted; in fact, his entire military and naval
                        strength, amounting to 50,000 men. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Some

                        which to attack and still more to appal the enemy. Orders were issued for
                        all to raise the battle-shout and rush straight forward to the assault at
                        the same moment so that the Lacedaemonians, threatened on every side, would
                        not know where first to meet the attack or where assistance would be most
                        required. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Quinctius formed his main army
                        into three divisions: the first was to deliver the assault in the
                        neighbourhood of the Phoebeum; the second towards the Dictynneum; the third
                        at the place called the Heptagoniae. All these points were unprotected by
                        walls. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Though the city was now encompassed
                        on every side by so menacing a foe the tyrant was most energetic in its
                        defence; wherever shouts arose on some sudden onset, when breathless
                        messengers came asking for help, he either hurried to the threatened spot
                        himself or sent others to assist. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> When,

                        to the messages that came; he not only lost all power of judgment, but was
                        almost beside himself. </p>

                        been observed, and the Pontifex Maximus P. Licinius reported to the
                        pontifical college that its observance had not been properly carried out.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The college authorised him to bring
                        the matter to the notice of the senate, and they decided that there should
                        be an entirely fresh observance under the direction of the pontiffs.

                        at the same time, were also ordered to be celebrated, and the usual outlay
                        incurred upon them. The victims to be offered included all the cattle born
                        between 1st March and 1st May during the consulship of P. Cornelius and
                        Tiberius Sempronius. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Then came the

                        leader of the senate. Only three senators in all were removed from the roll,

                        Another thing which added immensely to their popularity with the patricians
                        was the order they issued to the curule aediles, requiring them to reserve
                        special places for the senators at the Roman Games; previously they sat
                        amongst the crowd. Very few of the equestrian order were deprived of their
                        horses, nor did the censors treat any order in the State harshly. The Hall
                        of Liberty and the Villa Publica were also restored and enlarged by these
                        censors. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The Sacred Spring and the Games,

                        men who were to set the City on fire at various points during the night so

                        When the consul became aware of the numbers and confidence of the enemy he

                        while the fourth legion were still held up in their gate. Suddenly a new
                        alarm arose on the opposite side of the camp. <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> The Gauls had broken through the quaestorian gate, and
                        after meeting with the most obstinate resistance had killed the quaestor, L.
                        Postumius Tympanus, M. Atinius and P. Sempronius, praefects of allies, and
                        nearly 200 men. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> This side of the camp was
                        in the enemy's hands until one of the "special cohorts" which had been sent
                        by the consul to defend the quaestorian gate drove them out of the camp
                        after killing many of them, and stopped those who were breaking in.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Almost at the same moment the fourth
                        legion, with two of the special cohorts, forced their way out of another
                        gate. So there were three separate actions going on simultaneously on
                        different sides of the camp, and the confused shouts which arose called off
                        the attention of the combatants from their own struggle to the doubtful
                        position of their comrades. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Up to noonday
                        the battle was fought with equal strength on both sides, and almost equal
                        hopes of victory. But the heat and the exertion told upon the Gauls with
                        their soft and perspiring bodies, utterly incapable as they were of enduring
                        thirst, and compelled them to beat a retreat. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> The few who still stood their ground were charged by
                        the Romans and driven in rout to their camp. Then the consul gave the signal
                        to retire; most of the men obeyed it, but some in their eagerness for battle
                        and in the hope of securing the hostile camp pushed on to the rampart.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The Gauls, deriding this weak force,
                        rushed in a body out of their camp. Now it was the Romans who were routed,
                        and those who refused to return to camp at the consul's order were driven
                        thither by their fears. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> So first on one
                        side and then on the other victory and flight alternated. The Gauls,
                        however, lost as many as 11,000 men, the Romans 5000. </p>

                        fields of the Boii and the Ligurians, plundering as he went, until the

                        that he returned to Rome to conduct the elections without doing anything

                        administering justice and reforming the judicial procedure. He also made
                        changes in the political arrangements which had been imposed on the cities
                        by the lawless tyranny of Nabis and his lieutenants, and which by augmenting
                        the power of his own party crushed the rights and liberties of the others.

                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> It was felt by those present to be
                        quite inconsistent with the part of a Liberator of Greece to leave the
                        tyrant as a scourge to his own country and a terror to all the surrounding

                        importance it seemed better to leave him weakened and almost entirely
                        deprived of any power to injure others rather than allow this city to

                        destroy their liberty, since the party which was worsted in a domestic
                        struggle would rather join hands with a foreigner than submit to a

                        any war during their year of office, when a despatch arrived from M.
                        Cincius, the commandant of Pisae, announcing a rising in Liguria. <milestone

                        mounted the Rostra and issued an edict for the two City legions which had

                        place would be taken by two legions which he was going to raise. <milestone

                        had of military age, the total being fixed at 15,000 infantry and 500
                        cavalry. They were then instructed to start for home at once and raise their
                        troops without a moment's delay. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Fulvius
                        and Flaminius were each reinforced with Roman troops to the number of 3000
                        infantry and 100 cavalry and also 5000 infantry and 200 cavalry furnished by
                        the Latins and allies, and the praetors were ordered to disband the old

                            unit="section"/> Large numbers of the soldiers in the City legions urged
                        the tribunes of the plebs to investigate the cases of the men who pleaded
                        either length of service or ill-health as reasons why they should not be
                        called up. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> This matter was quite thrown
                        aside by a despatch from Tiberius Sempronius, in which he stated that a body
                        of 10,000 Ligurians had appeared in the neighbourhood of Placentia and had
                        wasted the country with fire and sword up to the very walls of the colony
                        and the banks of the Po, and the Boii also were contemplating a revival of

                        decreed that a state of emergency had arisen, and that they disapproved of
                        the tribunes investigating the soldiers' grievance and so preventing them
                        from assembling in obedience to the edict. <milestone n="12" unit="section"
                        /> They further ordered that the men of the allied contingents who had

                        Whilst on his way to his province the consul was to enlist and arm and take
                        with him whatever men he thought fit in the towns and country districts
                        through which he passed, and he was empowered to disband any of them

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> After the consuls had raised the necessary
                        troops and left for their provinces, T. Quinctius requested the senate to
                        listen to his report of the arrangements which he had made in concert with
                        the ten commissioners, and if they thought good to ratify and confirm them.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> They would, he said, be in a better
                        position to do this if they heard the statements of the envoys who had come
                        from every State in Greece as well as those who had come from the three
                        kings. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> These deputations were introduced
                        to the senate by the City praetor, Caius Scribonius, and they all met with a
                        favourable reception. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> As the negotiations
                        with Antiochus were somewhat protracted they were entrusted to the ten
                        commissioners, some of whom had been with the king either in Asia or in
                        Lysimachia. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> T. Quinctius was authorised to
                        hear the envoys in the presence of the commissioners and make such a reply
                        as was consistent with the interests and the honour of the Roman people.
                        Menippus and Hegesianax were the leaders of the embassy, and the former was
                        the spokesman. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> He professed himself at a
                        loss to understand what difficulty or complications his mission could create
                        as he had simply come to ask that friendly relations might be established
                        and an alliance formed. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> There were three
                        kinds of treaties by means of which States and monarchs came to terms with
                        one another. In one case the conditions were dictated to those who had been
                        vanquished in war, for when everything had been surrendered to the one who
                        was the stronger in arms he had the absolute right to say what they might
                        retain and of what they were to be deprived. <milestone n="8" unit="section"
                        /> In the second case powers who have been equally matched in war form a
                        league of peace and amity on equal terms, for then they arrive at a mutual
                        understanding in respect of claims for indemnity, and where proprietorship
                        has been disturbed by the war, matters are adjusted either in accordance
                        with the former legal status or as is most convenient to the contracting
                        parties. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The third class of treaties
                        comprises those made by States which have never been enemies and who unite
                        in forming a league of friendship; no conditions are either imposed or
                        accepted, for these only exist between victors and vanquished. <milestone
                            n="10" unit="section"/> It was this latter kind of league that Antiochus
                        was seeking, and he (the speaker) was surprised that the Romans should think
                        it just and fair to impose conditions upon the king as to which of the
                        cities in Asia they decided should be free and autonomous and which should
                        pay tribute, and in the case of some forbidding the king to garrison them.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> These were terms on which to make
                        peace with Philip their enemy, not a treaty of alliance with Antiochus, who
                        was their friend. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The following was Quinctius' reply: "Since
                        it pleases you to draw these distinctions and to enumerate the various ways
                        in which friendly relations can be established, I too will lay down the two
                        conditions apart from which, you may tell your king, no friendship with Rome
                        can be established. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> One is this-if he does
                        not wish us to concern ourselves with the cities of Asia, he must himself
                        keep his hands off every part of Europe. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                        The other is this-if instead of confining himself within the frontiers of
                        Asia he crosses over into Europe, the Romans will be perfectly justified in
                        protecting their friendship with those cities where it exists and in winning
                        new ones." <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Hegesianax replied: "Surely it
                        is an unworthy suggestion to say that Antiochus is excluded from the cities
                        of Thrace and the <milestone n="5??" unit="section"/> Chersonese which his
                        great-grandfather Seleucus won most gloriously after defeating Lysimachus,
                        who fell in the battle, and some of which Antiochus himself recovered by
                        force of arms from the Thracians who had taken possession of them, whilst
                        others which had been deserted, like Lysimachia, he repeopled with tillers
                        of the soil, and where they had been burnt or laid in ruin he rebuilt them
                        at a vast expense. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> What resemblance could
                        there be between the renunciation by Antiochus of his right to cities which
                        had been acquired or recovered in this way and the non-interference of the
                        Romans in Asia, which had never belonged to them? <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> Antiochus was asking for the friendship of Rome, but it
                        was such a friendship as would bring him honour, not shame." <milestone
                            n="8" unit="section"/> On this Quinctius observed: "As it is a question
                        of honour-a question which ought to be the sole, or at all events the
                        primary, one for the foremost nation in the world and for a monarch so great
                        as yours, <milestone n="9??" unit="section"/> which course appears to you
                        the more honourable, to desire the freedom of all the Greek cities wherever
                        they are or to keep them tributary and in bondage? <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> If Antiochus thinks that he is acting honourably in
                        claiming the lordship of cities which his great-grandfather held by the
                        right of war, a right which his father and <milestone n="11??"
                            unit="section"/> grandfather never asserted, the Roman people also
                        consider that their sense of honour and consistency forbid them to abandon
                        their championship of the liberties of Greece. <milestone n="12"
                            unit="section"/> As they liberated Greece from Philip, so it is their
                        intention to liberate the Greek cities in Asia from Antiochus. <milestone
                            n="13" unit="section"/> Colonies were not founded in Aeolis and Ionia to
                        be in bondage to monarchs, but that their stock might multiply and a nation
                        of ancient lineage be propagated throughout the world." </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> As Hegesianax hesitated and could not deny
                        that the cause of liberty carried a more honourable title than that of
                        slavery, P. Sulpicius, the senior of the ten commissioners, said: "Let us
                        have no more beating about the bush; <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                        choose one of the two conditions which Quinctius has just put forward so

                            unit="section"/> "It is not our wish," said Menippus, "nor is it in our

                        will be impaired." <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The next day Quinctius
                        introduced to the senate all the deputations from Greece and Asia, in order
                        that they might learn the attitude of the Romans and that of Antiochus
                        towards the cities of Greece. He laid his own demands before them and then
                        those of the king, and told them to report to their governments that the
                        Romans would <milestone n="5??" unit="section"/> show the same courage and
                        fidelity in vindicating their liberties against Antiochus, if he did not
                        quit Europe, which they had shown in liberating them from Philip. <milestone
                            n="6" unit="section"/> On this Menippus earnestly begged Quinctius and
                        the senate not to precipitate a decision which might, when once taken, throw
                        the world into confusion. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> He asked them to
                        take time for reflection and allow the king to do the same. When the
                        conditions were reported to him, he would take them into consideration and
                        would obtain some modification of them or make some concessions for the sake
                        of peace. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> So the whole matter was
                        postponed and it was decided that the same commissioners should be sent to
                        the king who had been with him at Lysimachia, namely P. Sulpicius, P.
                        Villius and P. Aelius. </p>

                        when envoys came from Carthage with the intelligence that Antiochus was
                        undoubtedly preparing for war with the advice and assistance of Hannibal,
                        and apprehensions were felt as to the outbreak of a war with Carthage at the
                        same time. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> As was stated above, Hannibal,
                        a fugitive from his native country, had reached the court of Antiochus,
                        where he was treated with great distinction, the only motive for this being
                        that the king had long been meditating a war with Rome, and no one could be
                            <milestone n="3??" unit="section"/> more qualified to discuss the

                        be conducted on Italian soil; Italy would furnish both supplies and men to a
                        foreign foe. But, he argued, if that country remained undisturbed and Rome
                        were free to employ the strength and resources of Italy beyond its
                        frontiers, no monarch, no nation could meet her on equal terms. <milestone
                            n="5" unit="section"/> He wanted 100 decked ships and a force of 10,000
                        infantry and 1000 cavalry; he would take the fleet to Africa first as he
                        felt confident of being able to persuade the Carthaginians to enter upon
                        another war, and if they hung back he would raise up war against Rome in
                        some part of Italy. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The king should cross
                        over into Europe with the rest of his army and keep his troops somewhere in
                        Greece, not actually sailing for Italy, but prepared to do so; this would
                        give a sufficient impression of the magnitude of the war. </p>

                        view, he thought he ought to prepare his countrymen, but he would not run
                        the risk of sending a written communication lest it should be intercepted
                        and his plans discovered. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> During his visit
                        to Ephesus he had picked up a Tyrian servant named Aristo and, as he had

                        commissions, Hannibal decided to make use of him. By means of bribes and
                        lavish promises, which the king himself endorsed, he was induced to go to
                        Carthage with instructions. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Hannibal
                        supplied him with a list of those whom it was necessary to interview, and he
                        also provided him with secret signs by which they might know that he had
                        really been commissioned by Hannibal. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> As
                        the man was constantly going about Carthage, Hannibal's enemies found out
                        the reason for his <milestone n="5??" unit="section"/> visit quite as soon
                        as his friends, and the matter became the subject of conversation at social
                        gatherings and in the clubs. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> At last it
                        gave rise to discussion in the senate, where various speakers asserted that
                        nothing was gained by Hannibal's banishment if he was able to form
                        treasonable designs, and by carrying on an agitation amongst the citizens
                        threaten the peace and security of the State. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> They declared that one Aristo, a Tyrian stranger, had
                        come furnished with instructions from Hannibal and Antiochus, that men who
                        were well known were holding furtive colloquies with him every day, and that
                        a mischief was being secretly hatched which would soon break out and bring
                        about universal ruin. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> There was a general
                        outcry and all present demanded that Aristo should be summoned and
                        questioned as to the object of his visit, and unless he explained it, sent
                        with a deputation to Rome. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> "We have
                        suffered enough," they said, "for one man's recklessness; if private
                        citizens offend it will be at their own risk, the State must be preserved
                        from the taint and even from the suspicion of guilt." </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> When Aristo appeared he endeavoured to
                        clear himself by relying mainly on the fact that he had brought nothing in
                        the shape of a letter to anyone. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Still he
                        did not give a satisfactory explanation of the object of his visit, and what
                        caused him most embarrassment was the allegation that his interviews were
                        confined to the members of the Barcine party. <milestone n="12"
                            unit="section"/> On this a heated discussion arose, one side demanding
                        his arrest and detention as a spy, the other asserting that there was no
                        ground for such irregular action, and it would form a bad precedent if
                        visitors from abroad were to be apprehended for no reason whatever.
                            <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> The same thing would happen to the
                        Carthaginians at Tyre and the other commercial cities which they so largely
                        frequented. The debate was adjourned. Aristo, having to do with
                        Carthaginians, adopted a Carthaginian stratagem. <milestone n="14"
                            unit="section"/> Early in the evening he hung up a placard in the
                        busiest part of the city over the tribunal where the magistrates sat day by
                        day. In the third watch of the night he boarded a vessel and fled away. When
                        the suffetes took their seats the next morning to administer justice they
                        saw the placard, took it down and read it. <milestone n="15" unit="section"
                        /> It stated that Aristo's instructions were not intended for private
                        citizens; they were public and addressed to the "elders"-for so they
                        designated their senate. As this involved the whole government there was
                        less eagerness to investigate the few cases where suspicion fell. <milestone
                            n="16" unit="section"/> It was, however, decided that a deputation
                        should be sent to Rome to report the affair to the consuls and the senate
                        and at the same time lay a complaint against Masinissa. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> When Masinissa saw that the Carthaginians
                        were falling into bad odour with Rome and at variance amongst themselves-the
                        leaders of the Barcine party suspected by the senate owing to their
                        interviews with Aristo, <milestone n="2??" unit="section"/> and the senate
                        suspected by the people in consequence of the notice which Aristo had put
                        up-he thought it a good opportunity for attacking them. The coastal district
                        which skirts the Lower Syrtis is called Emporia. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> It is a very fertile country and there is one city in
                        it-Leptis-which alone paid Carthage tribute to the extent of a talent a day.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> This district Masinissa overran and
                        ravaged from end to end and occupied parts of it, so that it appeared
                        doubtful whether it belonged to him or to the Carthaginians. <milestone
                            n="5" unit="section"/> On learning that they had sent envoys to Rome to
                        meet the charges which had been made against them, and also to complain of
                        his conduct, he too sent a deputation to strengthen the suspicions against
                        Carthage and also to question the right of that government to exact tribute
                        from the district which he had invaded. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        The Carthaginians were received in audience first, and their account of the
                        Tyrian stranger made the senate feel anxious lest they should be involved in
                        war with both Antiochus and Carthage at the same time. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> What strengthened their suspicions most of all was the
                        fact that after deciding to arrest Aristo and send him to Rome they had
                        neglected to keep either him or his ship under guard. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> Then came the argument with Masinissa's representatives
                        as to the territory in dispute. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The
                        Carthaginians rested their case on the adjudication of Scipio, as the
                        district lay within the frontiers of what, after his victory, he declared to
                        be Carthaginian territory, and they also relied on Masinissa's own
                        admission. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> When Aphthires was a fugitive
                        from his kingdom and was roaming with a body of Numidians in the
                        neighbourhood of Cyrenae, Masinissa who was pursuing him asked permission to
                        traverse that district, showing thereby that he had no doubt as to its
                        belonging to Carthage. </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The Numidians contended that false
                        statements had been made as to Scipio's delimitation. If the origin of any
                        rights they claimed was inquired into, what ground in all Africa really
                        belonged to the Carthaginians? <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> When they
                        landed on its shores and sought a settlement they were granted as much land
                        on which to build their city as they could enclose within an ox-hide cut
                        into strips. Whatever ground they had gained outside Bursa they had gained
                        by violence and robbery. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> As to the
                        territory in question, it was impossible for them to prove that it had been
                        in their possession from the beginning or even for any considerable length
                        of time. The Carthaginians and the kings of Numidia laid alternate claims to
                        it as opportunity offered; it always became the possession of those who for
                        the time being were the strongest in arms. <milestone n="14" unit="section"
                        /> They begged the senate to let matters remain in the same state in which
                        they were before Carthage became the enemy or Masinissa the friend and ally
                        of Rome, and not to prevent him who was able to hold it from doing so.
                            <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> The reply given to both parties was
                        to the effect that the senate would send a commission to Africa to settle
                        the dispute on the spot. The commissioners were P. Scipio Africanus, C.
                        Cornelius Cethegus and M. Minucius Rufus. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>
                        After surveying the locality and hearing both sides they decided for neither
                        of them and left the whole question in abeyance. Whether they did this of
                        their own motion or whether they had received instructions to do so is
                        uncertain. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> What is certain is that under
                        the circumstances it was a matter of expediency that the question should
                        remain unsettled. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> Had it not been so
                        Scipio, either through his knowledge of the facts or his personal influence
                        with both the contending parties, could have settled it by a nod. </p>
