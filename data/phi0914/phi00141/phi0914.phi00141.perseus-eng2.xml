                    <p> The sacred fire was extinguished in the temple of Vesta. Tiberius Sem-
                        pronius Gracchus conquered the Celtiberians and received their submis- sion,
                        and built the town Gracchuris in Spain, as a memorial of his exploits. The
                        Vaccaeans and Lusitanians also were subdued by the pro- consul Postumius
                        Albinus. Both generals triumphed. Antiochus, the son of Antiochus, having
                        been delivered to the Romans by his father, as a hostage, on the death of
                        his brother Seleucus, who had succeeded his father on his demise, being sent
                        from Rome to the sovereignty of Syria, acted the part of a very worthless
                        king, with the exception of his attention to religion, owing to which he
                        erected many magnificent temples in various places; at Athens to Olympian,
                        and at Antioch to Capitoline Jupiter. The lustrum was closed by the censors.
                        Two hundred and sixty-three thousand two hundred and ninety-four citizens
                        are said to have been rated. Quintus Voconius Saxa, tribune of the people,
                        pro- posed a law, that no one should make a woman his heir. Marcus Cato
                        advocated the law: his speech is extant. This book contains besides the
                        successes against the Ligurians, Istrians, Sardinians, and Celtiberians, and
                        the commencement of the Macedonian war, which Perseus, the son of Philip,
                        was planning; for he had sent an embassy to the Carthaginians, which had
                        been heard by them at night; and besides he was tampering with different
                        states of Greece. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> This book is
                            very imperfect; a great part of the beginning of it is lost; and there
                            are, besides, considerable chasms in other parts of it. The supplemental
                            passages which the translator has introduced, to complete the connexion,
                            are taken from Crevier. They are printed in a different character.

                            <milestone n="1" unit="suppl-chapter"/> The Roman people had now carried
                            their victorious arms over all parts of the world, and far and wide had
                            pene- trated countries at a vast distance, and separated by several
                            seas. Nevertheless, in such a tide of success flowing according to their
                            wishes, having obtained a high character for modera- <pb n="1916"
                                xml:id="p.1916"/> tion, they were more powerful by their influence
                            than by their military sway; and they boasted frequently that they
                            carried more measures with foreign nations by policy, than by violence
                            and terror. Never insulting conquered nations and kings, generous to
                            their allies, seeking for themselves the honour of victory only, to
                            kings they had preserved their rank, to nations their laws, rights, and
                            liberty, whether in a treaty formed with an equal or with an inferior;
                            and although they had so encompassed, by their arms, both coasts of the
                            Mediter- ranean, from Cadiz even as far as Syria, and had gained respect
                            for the Roman name through immense tracts of terri- tory, yet the only
                            subjects they had, were the nations of Sicily, and the islands on the
                            coast of Italy, and the tribes of the greater part of Spain, which had
                            not yet learned to bear their yoke with resignation. It was the
                            ill-timed treachery of their enemies and rivals, rather than their own
                            ambition, that afforded them cause and material for the increase of
                            their sway. As a special instance: the cruelty of Perseus, who obtained
                            the kingdom of Macedon by treachery and crime, displayed towards his
                            subjects, detested by all, his frantic avarice in the midst of boundless
                            wealth, his inconsiderate levity in the adoption and prosecution of his
                            plans, both destroyed him, and whatever could remain independent, as
                            long as he existed, the principal restraint on the Roman power; for his
                            fall recoiled upon others, and brought with it not only the downfal of
                            his neighbours, but also that of those who were far removed from him.
                            The fall of Carthage and of the Achaeans followed the ruin of the
                            Macedonians: and when the state of all was convulsed by their disasters,
                            the rest of the empires, already tottering for some time, were
                            overthrown shortly after, and all fell beneath the Roman sway. It was my
                            intention to lay here before the reader at a glance these events, so
                            intimately connected in interest, though occurring at different times
                            and places, whilst he contemplated the war impending over the Romans
                            from Perseus, from which especi- ally the Roman power drew the sources
                            of its growth. Perseus was then concocting that war in secret; the
                            Ligurians and Gauls provoked rather than employed the Roman arms. </p>

                            <milestone n="2" unit="suppl-chapter"/> Gaul and the Ligurians were the
                            provinces assigned to the consuls, Marcus Junius Brutus, Aulus Manlius
                            Vulso: Gaul was assigned to Manlius, Liguria to Junius. As to the
                            praetors, <pb n="1917" xml:id="p.1917"/> the city jurisdiction fell to
                            Marcus Titinius Curvus; the foreign, to Tiberius Claudius Nero; Sicily,
                            to Publius Aelius Ligus; Sardinia, to Titus Aebutius; Hither Spain, to
                            the other Marcus Titinius, for there were two of that name praetors in
                            that year; and the Farther Spain, to Titus Fonteius Capito. A fire broke
                            out in the forum, by which very many buildings were burnt to the ground,
                            and the temple of Venus was entirely consumed. The sacred fire of Vesta
                            was extinguished: the virgin who had the care of it was punished with
                            stripes, by order of Marcus Aemilius, the chief pontiff, and
                            supplication was performed, as usual in such cases. In this year the
                            lustrum was closed by Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and Marcus Fulvius
                            Nobilior, censors, in which were rated two hundred and seventy-three
                            thousand two hundred and forty-four citizens. The ambassadors of Perseus
                            arrived, requiring that he should be saluted by the senate as hang,
                            ally, and friend, and that the treaty should be renewed with him which
                            had existed with his father Philip. Perseus was an object of hatred and
                            suspicion to the Romans, and most of them had no <milestone n="3??"
                                unit="section"/> doubt, that as soon as an opportunity was
                            presented, and his strength appeared to him adequate to the struggle, he
                            would wage against the Romans the war, pre- pared in secret by Philip,
                            for so many years. However, that they might not appear to have provoked
                            him when quiet and desirous of peace, and to have themselves furnished
                            him with a cause for war, they conceded to him his demands. Perseus,
                            when this answer was received, supposing that the kingdom was secured to
                            him, began to acquire influence among the Greeks. Being desirous
                            therefore of procuring their friend- ship, he recalled into Macedon all,
                            without exception, who had gone into exile, when condemned for debt or
                            by any judicial proceeding, and those who had left Macedon for high
                            treason, by edicts, openly announced in the island of Delos, and at
                            Delphi, and at the temple of Minerva at Itone, in which he granted to
                            those returning not only pardon, but also restora- tion of all their
                            property, with the income, from that period in which each became an
                            exile. He also remitted to those who were living in Macedon whatever was
                            due to the royal ex- chequer; and released all those imprisoned for high
                            treason. When by these acts he had encouraged the minds of many, he
                            turned the attention of all Greece towards himself, and filled <pb
                                n="1918" xml:id="p.1918"/> it with great hope. And besides, in the
                            entire deportment of the rest of his life, he preserved the dignity of a
                            king; for his mien was noble, and his person well-fitted to discharge
                            all the duties of war and peace; and his age, now matured, possessed a
                            graceful majesty, beaming from brow and forehead. He had none of his
                            father's wantonness, and licentious passions for women and wine. By
                            these praise-worthy acts Perseus ren- dered the beginning of his reign
                            agreeable, although it was des- tined to have a termination very
                            different from its commencement. </p>

                            were there per- formed by Postumius and Gracchus. But the praise of </p>

                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Gracchus was extraordinary, for he
                            being in the prime of life, since he far surpassed all his coevals in
                            courage and prudence, even then was lauded greatly by fame, and raised
                            greater hope of himself with regard to the future. Twenty thousand
                            Celtiberians were besieging Carabi, a city in alli- ance with the
                            Romans. Gracchus hastened to bear aid to his allies. That anxiety
                            tortured him, how he could signify his intention to the besieged, while
                            the enemy pressed the city with so close a blockade, that it scarcely
                            appeared possible that an enemy could reach it. The daring of Cominius
                            executed the difficult task. He being prefect of a troop of horse,
                            having pre- viously weighed over the matter with himself, and having
                            inform- ed Gracchus of what he was preparing, dressed himself in a
                            Spanish military cloak, and mixed with the enemy's foragers. Having

                            announced the approach of Tiberius. The townsmen, being aroused by this
                            intelligence from the depth of despair to cheerfulness and daring, and
                            having determined to fight bravely to the last, were relieved from
                            blockade on the third day, in con- sequence of the enemy having departed
                            on the arrival of Grac- chus. He himself having been afterwards attached
                            by a stra- tagem of the barbarians, by the union of skill and strength,
                            so repelled the danger, that the artifice recoiled on its originators.
                            There was a town, Complega by name, that had been built several years
                            before, but strengthened by fortifications and increased by speedy
                            additions, into which many of the Spani- ards had flocked, who
                            previously straggled here and there in need of territory. About twenty
                            thousand men coming forth from that city in the garb of suppliants, and
                            holding forth <pb n="1919" xml:id="p.1919"/> branches of olive, stood in
                            view of the camp as <milestone n="5??" unit="section"/> if entreating
                            peace. Immediately, having cast away the emblems of sup- pliants, and
                            having suddenly attached the Romans, they fill every place with alarm
                            and consternation. Gracchus, by a prudent counsel, deserted the camp
                            under the pretence of flight: and whilst they were plundering it with
                            the usual greediness of barbarians, and were encumbering themselves with
                            the spoil, he suddenly returned, and attacking them when in no
                            apprehensions of such an evil, slew the most of them, and even made
                            himself master of their town. There are some who tell the story
                            differently: that Gracchus, when he had dis- covered that the enemy were
                            distressed from want of food, abandoned his camp, which was very well
                            furnished with all articles of food; that the enemy, having taken
                            possession of it, and having intemperately filled themselves with what
                            they had found, and gorged themselves to repletion, were suddenly cut
                            off by the return of the Roman army. </p>

                            way of telling the same exploit, or quite a different affair and
                            dfferent victory, it is certain that Gracchus completely conquered
                            several tribes, and moreover the entire nation of the Celtiberians. I
                            would not however have the hardihood to assert that he took and
                            destroyed three hundred of their cities, although Polybius, a writer of
                            the highest authority, makes mention of it; unless that under the name
                            of cities we include towers and castles: by which description of
                            falsehood both the generals in wars and the writers of histories take
                            delight in setting off exploits. For Spain, with its dry and
                            uncultivated soil, could not sup- port a large number of cities. The
                            wild and uncivilized manners of the Spaniards, with the exception of
                            those that dwell on our sea, are also at variance with the assertion,
                            since the dispositions of men are accustomed to become more mild by the
                            meeting with fellow-citizens which occurs in towns. But whatever we may
                            determine concerning the number or description of the cities taken by
                            Sempronius, (for writers vary also in the number, and some have related
                            that one hundred and fifty towns were taken by him, others that one
                            hundred and three was the number,) he certainly performed noble
                            achievements; nor was he distinguished by the praises he received in war
                            only; but he also proved himself unparal- leled in arranging and
                            arbitrating peace and laws for the <pb n="1920" xml:id="p.1920"/>
                            conquered nations. For he distributed lands among the poor and assigned
                            them habitations, and by giving and receiving an oath, secured to, all
                            the tribes inhabiting that country, laws clearly defined, according to
                            which they were to live in friend- ship and alliance with the Roman
                            people. And posterity often appealed to the authority of this treaty in
                            the wars which afterwards broke out. Gracchus appointed that the town
                            which was hitherto called Illurcis, should be distinguished by his own
                            name, and called Gracchuris, as a monument of his merit and actions. The
                            report of the acts of Postumius is more involved in obscurity. However
                            the Vaccaeans and .Lusitanians were conquered by him, and forty thousand
                            of these nations were slain. These affairs being transacted, they both,
                            when they had delivered up the armies and provinces to their successors
                            on their arrival, went home to triumph. In Gaul, Manlius the consul, to
                            whom that province had fallen, when material for a triumph was wanting,
                            eagerly seized an opportunity presented by fortune, of waging war
                            against the Istrians. They had aided the Aetolians on a former occasion
                            when making war against the Romans, and lately too had given trouble. At
                            that time Aepulo, a king of a violent dis- position, ruled them, who was
                            said to have armed the nation trained to peace by his father, ... </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> When the consul held a council on the subject
                    of a war with Istria, some were of opinion that it ought to be begun
                    immediately, before the enemy could collect forces; others, that the senate
                    ought first to be consulted; the opinion was adopted which opposed delay.
                    Accordingly the consul, marching from Aquileia, pitched his camp at the lake
                    Timavus, which lies very near the sea. Thither came Caius Furius, one of the
                    naval commanders, with ten ships; for two naval commanders had been appointed
                    against the fleet of the Illyrians, and these commanders, with twenty ships for
                    the protection of the coast of the Hadriatic, were to make Ancona, as it were,
                    the pivot of their position; so that Lucius Cornelius had to guard the coasts on
                    the right, extending from the latter place to Tarentum; and Caius Furius those
                    on the left, as far as Aquileia. This squadron was sent to the nearest port in
                    the Istrian territory, with a number of transports and a large store of
                    provisions; while the consul, following with the <pb n="1921" xml:id="p.1921"/>
                    legions, encamped at the distance of about five miles from the <milestone
                        n="8??" unit="section"/> coast. A plentiful market was soon established at
                    the port, and every thing conveyed thence to the camp. That this might be done
                    with greater safety, out-posts were fixed around the camp; a newly-levied cohort
                    of Placentines was posted between the camp and the sea, as a picket in the
                    direction of Istria; and that the watering-parties might likewise have
                    protection at the river, orders were given to Marcus Aebutius, military tribune,
                    to take thither two companies of the second legion. Titus and Caius Aelius,
                    military tribunes, led out the third legion on the road towards Aquileia, in
                    support of those that went for food and forage. In the same quarter, nearly a
                    mile distant, was the camp of the Gauls: Catmelus acted as their chieftain, and
                    they were not more than three thousand armed men. </p>

                    opportunity that might give them an advantage; <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>

                    unarmed crowd of persons trafficking between the camp and the sea, and that they
                    had not fortified themselves either by works on land, or by the help of ships,
                    they made an assault on two of their posts at once, that of the Placentine
                    cohort, and that of the two companies of the second legion. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> A morning fog concealed their design; and when this began
                    to disperse as the sun grew warm, the light piercing through it in some degree,
                    yet still being far from clear, and, as usual in such cases, magnifying the
                    appearance of every thing, deceived the Romans, and made the army of the enemy
                    appear much greater to them than it really was. <milestone n="5" unit="section"
                    /> And when the troops in both the posts, terrified, had fled in the utmost
                    confusion to the camp, there they caused much greater alarm than that which they
                    were under themselves: for they could neither tell what made them fly, nor
                    answer any question that was asked. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Then a
                    shouting was heard at all the gates, since there were no guards at them which
                    could withstand an attack: and the crowding together of the soldiers, who fell
                    one against the other in the <pb n="1922" xml:id="p.1922"/> dark, raised a doubt

                    their arms and a greater part without them, as if they had received orders so to

                    of the army, and the consul himself, when, having attempted in vain to call back
                    the fugitives, he had effected nothing by commands, advice, and, at last, by
                    entreaties. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Marcus Licinius Strabo, a military
                    tribune of the third legion, with three companies alone, remained, being left
                    behind by his legion. The Istrians having made an attack on the empty camp,
                    after that no other had met them in arms, came upon him while he was drawing up
                    and encouraging his men at the general's quarters; the fight was maintained with
                    more resolution than might be anticipated, from the small number of the

                    down the general's tent, and seizing on all they could find, went on to the

                    a few of the Istrians, who had drunk in moderation, betook themselves to flight:

                    the person who acted as quaestor to Manlius, and ordered him to bring fetters,

                    The senate ordered him to continue sacrificing the larger victims until he

                    of Popillius was admitted. Then Publius Licinius Crassus alleged that he was

                    determination was made in the case of Publius Licinius, Marcus Cornelius

                    two mountains, called Letum and Balista; and, for greater security, surrounded
                    their encampment with a wall. Some, who were too slow in removing from the low

                    turned their fury against things inanimate, dashing against the walls even

                    fearing that the war might be brought to a conclusion before he arrived in the

                    with a javelin, and fell. The commanders of the enemy did not know that he was
                    killed; and the few of his own party who saw the disaster, carefully covered the

                    lost. Besides this evident completion of the unhappy omen, the keeper of the

                        the shade of his departed col- league. He had the honour of a triumph over
                        the Ligurians. The legion, at whose head the consul was killed, was severely

                        that the campaign of this year should not be counted to the entire legion,
                        and that their pay should be stopped, for not exposing themselves to the
                        enemy's weapons in defence of their commander. About this time ambassadors
                        came to Rome from the Dar- danians, who were greatly distressed by the

                        them and Perseus, and that the Dardanians were really more afraid of him

                        assistance should be sent them. The senate thereupon agreed, that
                        ambassadors should be sent to examine into the affairs of Macedonia; and
                        immediately a commission was given to Aulus Postu- <pb n="1940"

                        some young men, that he might have the principal direction and management of
                        the embassy. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The senate then took into
                        consideration the election of magistrates for the ensuing year, on which
                        subject there was a long debate; for </hi> people skilled in the rules of

                    died, one by the sword, the other by sickness, the substituted consuls could not
                    with propriety hold the elections. <hi rend="italics"> An interregnum,
                        therefore, took place, and the interrex elected consuls Publius Mucius
                        Scaevola, and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, a second time. <milestone n="13"

                        Claudius Centho, were chosen praetors. The provinces assigned to the consuls
                        were Gaul and Liquria. Of the praetors, Cornelius Sulla obtained Sardinia,
                        Claudius Centho gained Hither Spain. There is no record of those to whom the
                        other praetorian provinces fell. This year was notorious for an epidemic,

                        of Luna and Pisae; and at the same time there were alarming ru- mours of
                        disturbances in Gaul. Lepidus having easily quelled the commotions among the

                        they inhabited, as the dispositions of the inhabitants of a country
                        generally resemble its natural features, by the precedent of some former

                    Quintus Mucius made war on those who had wasted the lands of Luna and Pisae: and
                    having reduced them all to subjection, he took away their arms from them. On
                    account of these services, performed under the conduct and auspices of the two
                    consuls, the senate voted a thanksgiving for three days, and sacrifices of forty
                    victims. The commotions which broke out in Gaul and Liguria, at the beginning of
                    this year, were thus speedily sup- <pb n="1941" xml:id="p.1941"/> pressed,
                    without any great difficulty; but the apprehensions of the public, respecting a
                    war with Macedon, still continued. For Perseus laboured to embroil the
                    Bastarnians with the Dardanians; and the ambassadors, sent to examine into the
                    state of affairs in Macedon, returned to Rome, and brought certain information
                    that hostilities had commenced in Dardania. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> At
                    the same time came envoys from king Perseus, to plead in excuse that neither had
                    the Bastarnians been invited by him, nor had they done any thing at his
                    instigation. The senate neither acquitted the king of the imputation, nor urged
                    it against him; they only ordered him to be warned to be very careful to show,
                    that he considered the treaty between him and the Romans as inviolable.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The Dardanians, perceiving that the
                    Bastarnians, so far from quitting their country, as they had hoped, became daily
                    more troublesome, as they were supported by the neighbouring Thracians and
                    Scordiscians, thinking it necessary to make some effort against them, though
                    without any reasonable prospect of success, assembled together in arms from all
                    quarters, at the town that was nearest to the camp of the Bastarnians. It was
                    now winter, and they chose that season of the year, as supposing that the
                    Thracians and Scordiscians would return to their own countries. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> As soon as they heard that these were gone, and the
                    Bastarnians left by themselves, they divided their forces into two parts, that
                    one might march openly along the straight road to attack the enemy; and that the
                    other, going round through a wood, which lay out of sight, might assault them on
                    the rear. But, before these could arrive at the enemy's post, the fight
                    commenced, and the Dardanians were beaten, and pursued to the town, which was
                    about twelve miles from the Bastarnian camp. The victors immediately invested
                    the city, not doubting that, on the day following, either the enemy would
                    surrender it from fear, or they might take it by storm. Meanwhile the other body
                    of Dardanians, which had gone round, not having heard of the defeat of their
                    countrymen, <hi rend="italics">easily</hi> possessed themselves of the camp of

                        return to their native home. Having <pb n="1942" xml:id="p.1942"/> therefore
                        retreated to the Danube, they found it, to their great joy, covered with
                        ice, so thick as to seem capable of sustaining any weight. But when the
                        entire body of men and cattle, hastening on, and crowding together, pressed
                        on it at the same time, the ice, splitting under the immense weight,
                        suddenly parted, and being overcome and broken up, left in the middle of the

                        of the river. The fragments of the broken ice passed over many of them in
                        their attempt to swim and drown- ed them. A few out of the entire nation
                        with difficulty escaped to either bank, with their persons severely crushed.
                        About this time, Antiochus, son to Antiochus the Great, who had been for a
                        long time a hostage at Rome, came into possession of the kingdom of Syria,
                        on the death of his brother Seleucus. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> For
                        Seleucus, whom the Greeks call Phi- lopator, after having received the
                        kingdom of Syria, which had been greatly debilitated by the misfortunes of
                        his father, during an idle reign of twelve years never distinguished by any
                        memorable enterprise at all, called home from Rome this his younger brother,
                        sending, in his stead, his own son Demen- lius, according to the terms of
                        the treaty, which allowed the changing of the hostages from time to time.
                        Antiochus had but just reached Athens on his way, when Seleucus was
                        murdered, in consequence of a conspiracy formed by Helio- dorus, one of the
                        nobles. Eumenes and Attalus expelled him aiming at the crown, and put
                        Antiochus in possession of it, and valued it highly that they had bound him
                        to them by this so important a favour. They now began to harbour some
                        jealousy of the Romans, on account of several trifling causes of disgust.
                        Antiochus, having gained the kingdom by their aid, was received by the
                        people with such transports of joy, that they gave him the surname of
                        Epiphanes, or Rising Star, because when aliens to the royal blood were about
                        to seize the throne, he appeared like a propitious star, to assert his
                        hereditary right. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> He was not deficient in
                        capacity or vigour of mind to make figure in war; but he was so perverse and
                        indiscreet in the whole tenor of his con- duct and behaviour, that they soon
                        changed the surname which they had given him, and instead of Epiphanes,
                        called him Epimanes or Madman. For often having gone forth <pb n="1943"
                            xml:id="p.1943"/> from the palace without the knowledge of his servants,
                        with one or two attendants, crowned with roses, and dressed in robes
                        embroidered with gold, he used to go through the city, sometimes striking
                        those that he met with stones that he carried under his arms; sometimes, on
                        the other hand, throwing money among the mob, and shouting out, <quote>Let

                        to go through the workshops of the goldsmiths, and engravers and other
                        artisans, arguing vainly concerning the art of each: at another time he
                        engaged in conversation in public with any of the plebeian she met: again,
                        wandering around the common taverns, he indulged in potations with
                        foreigners and strangers of the lowest grade. <milestone n="9"

                        celebrating an un- timely banquet, he himself at once came upon them
                        suddenly, with a glass and a concert, revelling and wantoning, so that most
                        of them, struck with terror at the strangeness of the matter, fled away, and
                        the remainder were silent in fear. It is ascertained also that, in the
                        public baths, he used to bathe with the mob. As however there he was in the
                        habit of using the most precious unguents, they report that a plebeian one
                        day said to him: <quote>You are happy, O king: you savour of perfumes of the

                    either by himself or any one else what was his real character. He was accustomed
                    not to speak to his <pb n="1944" xml:id="p.1944"/> friends, nor scarcely afford
                    a smile to his acquaintance. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> By an
                    inconsistent kind of liberality, he made himself and others subjects of
                    ridicule; for to some in the most elevated stations, and who thought highly of
                    themselves, he would give childish presents of sweetmeats, cakes, or toys;
                    others expecting nothing he enriched. Wherefore to many he appeared not to know
                    what he was doing; some said that he acted from a silly, sportive temper;
                    others, that he was evidently mad. In two great and honourable instances,
                    however, he showed a spirit truly royal, —in the presents which he made to
                    several cities, and the honour he paid to the gods. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> To the inhabitants of Megalopolis, in Arcadia, he made a
                    promise to build a wall round their city, and he gave them the greater part of
                    the money requisite for the purpose. At Tegea he began to erect a magnificent
                    theatre of marble. At Cyzicum, he presented a set of golden utensils for the
                    service of one table in the Prytaneum, the state-room of the city, where such as
                    are entitled to that honour dine together. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> To
                    the Rhodians he gave presents of every kind that their convenience required, but
                    none very remarkable. Of the magnificence of his notions, in every thing
                    respecting the gods, the temple of Jupiter Olympius at Athens can be a
                    sufficient testimony: being the only one in the world, the plan of which was
                    suitable to the greatness of the deity. He likewise ornamented Delos with altars
                    of extraordinary beauty, and abundance of statues. <milestone n="6"

                    were to be covered with plates of gold, and many other edifices which he
                    intended in various places, he did not finish, as his reign was very short. He
                    surpassed his predecessors, too, in the magnificence of the public games of
                    every description; of which all the games but one were after their own custom,
                    and celebrated by an immense number of Grecian actors. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> He gave a show of gladiators in the Roman manner, which at
                    first, among a people unaccustomed to such sights, caused more terror than
                    pleasure; but by frequently repeating them, and sometimes permitting the
                    combatants to go no further than wounds, at other times to fight until one was
                    killed, he rendered such kind of shows not only familiar to people's eyes, but
                    even agreeable, and kindled in most of the young men a passion for <pb n="1945"

                            displayed the same worthlessness and levity in exhibiting the games, as
                            in the rest of his life, so that nothing could be seen more magnificent
                            than the preparation for the games, nothing more vile or contemptible
                            than the king himself. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> And when this
                            appeared often on other occasions, it was then most conspicuous in those
                            games, which, in emulation of the magnificence of those which were given
                            by Paulus in Macedon, after the conquest of Perseus, he exhi- bited at
                            immense expense, and with corresponding dishonour. To return, however,
                            to the Roman affairs, from which the mention of this king has caused us
                            to digress too far. Tibe- rius Sempronius Gracchus, after holding the

                            Asellus, Marcus Atilius Serranus, and Cneius Servilius Caepio; although
                            Scipio struggled hard to be admitted even in the last place, yet he was
                            thought to have degenerated so far from the virtues of his father, that

                            had not the latter, with singular modesty, corrected what might be

                            his rival. Thus, by the help of Cicereius, Scipio obtained an honour
                            which he did not seem likely to gain from the people, and which
                            reflected greater glory on Cicereius than on himself. </p>

                        that the fear of immediate danger from the Romans had no influence on our

                    was inaugurated flamen of Jupiter. In the same year a tablet was hung up in the

                    GRAC- CHUS, CONSUL, A LEGION AND ARMY OF THE ROMAN PEOPLE SUBDUED SARDINIA; IN
                    WHICH PROVINCE ABOVE EIGHTY THOUSAND OF THE ENEMY WERE KILLED OR TAKEN. HAVING
                    EXECUTED THE BUSINESS OF THE PUBLIC WITH THE HAPPIEST SUCCESS; HAVING RECOVERED
                    THE REVENUES, AND RESTORED THEM <hi rend="italics">to the commonwealth,</hi> —HE
                    BROUGHT HOME THE ARMY SAFE, UNINJURED, AND ENRICHED WITH SPOIL, AND, A SECOND
                    TIME, ENTERED THE CITY OF ROME IN TRIUMPH. IN COMME- MORATION OF WHICH EVENT HE
                    PRESENTED THIS TABLET AS AN OFFERING TO JUPITER. A map of the island of Sardinia
                    was engraved on the tablet, and pictures of the battles fought there were
                    delineated on it. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Several small exhibitions of
                    gladiators were given to the public this year; the only one particularly
                    remarkable, was that of Titus Flamininus, which he gave on occasion of his
                    father's death, and it was accompanied with a donation of meat, a feast, and
                    stage-plays, and lasted four days. Yet, in the whole of this great exhibition,
                    only seventy-four men fought in three days. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    <hi rend="italics"> The close of this year was rendered memorable by the
                        proposal of a new and import- ant rule, which occupied the state, since it
                        was debated with great emotion. Hitherto, as the law stood, women were as
                        equal- ly capable of receiving inheritances as men. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> From which it hap- pened that the wealth of the most
                        illustrious houses was frequent- ly transferred into other families, to the
                        great detriment, as it was generally supposed, of the state; to which it was
                        no small advantage that there should be a sufficiency of wealth to the
                        descendants of distinguished ancestors, by which they might support and do
                        honour to their nobility of birth, which otherwise would form a burden
                        rather than honour to them. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Besides, since
                        with the now growing power of the empire, the riches of private persons also
                        were increasing fear was felt, lest the minds of women, being rather
                        inclined by nature to luxury, and the pursuit of a more elegant routine of
                        life, and deriving from un- bounded wealth incentives to desire, should fall
                        into immoderate expenses and luxury, and should subsequently chance to de-
                        part from the ancient sanctity of manners, so that there would be a change
                        of morals no less than of the manner of living. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> To obviate these evils, Quintus Voconius Saxa, plebeian
                        tri- bune, proposed to the people, that <quote> no person who should be
                            rated after the censorship of Aulus Postumius and Quintius <pb n="1957"
                                xml:id="p.1957"/> Fulvius should make any woman, whether married or
                            unmar- ried, his heir; also, that no woman, whether married or un-
                            married, should be capable of receiving, by inheritance, goods exceeding
                            the value of one hundred thousand sesterces. </quote>

                        </note> Voconius, also, thought it proper to provide that estates should not
                        be exhausted by the number of legacies, which some- times happened.
                        Accordingly he added a clause to his law, that no person should bequeath to
                        any person or persons pro- perty exceeding in value what was to go to the
                        immediate heirs." <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> This latter clause
                        readily met the general approbation; it appeared reasonable, and calculated
                        to press severely on no- body. Concerning the former clause, by which women
                        were utterly disqualified from receiving inheritances, there were many
                        doubts. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Marcus Cato put an end to all
                        hesitation, having been already, on a former occasion, a most determined
                        adversary and reprover of women, in the defence of the Oppian law, who,
                        although sixty-five years of age, with loud voice and good lungs advocated
                        this law of still greater importance, against them, inveighing, with his
                        usual asperity, against the tyranny of women, and their unsufferable
                        insolence when opulent: on the present occasion, too, he declaimed against
                        the pride and arrogance of the rich matrons, <quote> because they
                            oftentimes, after bringing a great dowry to their husband, kept back and
                            re- tained for themselves a great sum of money, and lent that money on
                            such terms afterwards to their husbands, on their asking it, that as
                            often as they were angry they immediately pressed im- portunately on
                            their husbands, as if they were strange debtors, by a reserved slave who
                            followed them and daily importuned payment. </quote> Moved by
                        indignation at this, they voted for pass- ing the law as Voconius proposed
                        it. </hi>
