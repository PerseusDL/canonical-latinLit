                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> . . . It was said that he called to arms
                        the fighting men whom his father had kept in peace, and that he was very
                        popular with them, as they were eager for plunder. The consul held a council
                        of war to discuss the Histrian campaign. Some thought it ought to be
                        undertaken at once before the enemy had time to get his forces together;
                        others considered that the senate ought first to be consulted. <milestone
                            n="2" unit="section"/> The opinion in favour of prompt action prevailed.
                        From Aquileia, the consul advanced to the Timavus Lake close to the sea.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> C. Furius, one of the two naval
                        commanders, sailed there with ten ships. He and his colleague were to act
                        against the Illyrian fleet and protect the coasts of the Upper Sea with
                        twenty ships. Their joint command pivoted on Ancona; L. Cornelius had the
                        defence of the coast to the right as far as Tarentum, and C. Furius to the
                        left as far as Aquileia. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The ten ships
                        under Furius had been sent to the nearest harbour on Histrian territory,
                        together with cargo ships and a large amount of supplies. The consul
                        followed them with the legions and fixed his camp about five miles from the
                        sea. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> A busy market soon sprang up in the
                        harbour, and all supplies were carried up from the sea to the camp. To
                        render this more secure, pickets were posted on every side of the camp.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> On the side facing Histria the
                        emergency cohort from Placentia was posted permanently; M. Aebutius, one of
                        the military tribunes, was ordered to take two maniples from the second
                        legion to the river bank between the camp and the sea to protect the
                        watering-parties; <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> two other military
                        tribunes, L. and C. Aelius, took the third legion along the road leading to
                        Aquileia to protect the foraging and wood-cutting troops. In that direction
                        lay the camp of the Gauls about a mile distant. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> and in their chief's absence Catemelus was in command.
                        They did not number more than 3000 armed men. </p>

                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> As soon as the Roman army began to move
                        towards the Timavus, the Histri took up a position in concealment behind a
                        hill and followed it while on the march, carefully watching for every
                        opportunity; nothing that happened on sea or land escaped their notice.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> When they saw that only weak pickets
                            <milestone n="3??" unit="section"/> were posted in front of the camp and
                        that between the camp and the sea there was a crowd of unarmed traders busy
                        with their traffic and without any protection either on the land side or
                        towards the sea, they made a simultaneous attack on the pickets, the
                        Placentian cohort and the maniples of the second legion. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> Their movements were at first concealed by an early
                        morning fog. As this began to disperse under the warm rays of the sun, the
                        sunshine struggling fitfully through made everything, as it generally does,
                        look larger to the beholder. In this way the Romans were deceived, as the
                        hostile army appeared larger than it really was. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> The men from both the pickets fled in a great tumult to
                        the camp. The terror they spread here was greater than the alarm in which
                        they had fled, for they could not explain why they had fled, nor could they
                        give any answer to those who questioned them. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> Shouts were heard from the gates, as there were no
                        outposts there to make any resistance, and the crowding together of the
                        soldiers, who were falling over each other in the fog, made it impossible to
                        know whether the enemy were inside the camp or not. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> One voice was heard amongst the cries, calling "To the
                        sea!" and this chance cry started by one individual resounded everywhere
                        throughout the camp. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> They began to run
                        down to the sea, as though acting under orders; at first in small bodies,
                        some with arms, most of them without; then in larger numbers, till at last
                        nearly every man had gone, including the consul himself. He was quite
                        powerless to rally the fugitives; his commands, his authority, his
                        expostulations were all fruitless. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The
                        only officer who remained was M. Licinius Strabo, a military tribune
                        attached to the second legion, who had left him with three maniples in their
                        flight. The Histri made their attack on the empty camp, and after finding no
                        armed resistance, came upon him as he was forming and encouraging his men in
                        the headquarters tent. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The fight was a
                        more stubborn one than might have been expected from the fewness of the
                        defenders, and did not come to an end until the tribune and all round him
                        had fallen. After overturning the headquarters tent and plundering
                        everything in it, the enemy went on to the quaestor's tent, the forum, and
                        the via quintana. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Here they found an
                        abundant supply of everything laid out in readiness, and in the quaestor's
                        tent couches arranged for a meal. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The
                        chieftain lay down and began to feast himself; <milestone n="13"
                            unit="section"/> soon all the others, oblivious of any armed enemy, did
                        the same, and being unused to such good fare, loaded themselves greedily
                        with wine and food. </p>
                </div>
                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="3" type="chapter">
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Things wore a very different aspect among
                        the Romans. There was confusion both on land and sea. The marines struck
                        their tents and hurriedly carried back on board the stores which had been
                        landed on the beach; <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> the soldiers rushed
                        in panic to the boats at the water's edge; some of the sailors, afraid of
                        their boats being overcrowded, tried to stop the crowd; others pushed their
                        boats off into deep water. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> This resulted
                        in a struggle, and soon a regular fight began between the soldiers and the
                        sailors-with bloodshed on both sides-until at the consul's orders the fleet
                        was withdrawn to some distance from the land. Then he began to separate
                        those who had arms from those who were without any. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> There were hardly 1200 out of the whole number who were
                        still armed; very few of the cavalry were found to have brought away their
                        horses with them; the rest were a disorderly mob like so many sutlers and
                        camp-followers, certain to fall a prey to the enemy, if the enemy had had
                        any idea of fighting. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> At last, word was
                        sent to recall the third legion and the Gaulish contingent, and the troops
                        posted round the camp began to come in determined to recover the camp and
                        remove the stain of disgrace. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The military
                        tribunes of the third legion ordered the loads of wood and fodder to be
                        thrown off the baggage animals, and commanded the centurions to place the
                        older men in couples on the mules which had been relieved of their loads,
                        and the cavalry were each to take one of the younger men with them on their
                        horses. They told their men that it would be a most glorious thing for their
                        legion if, by their own valour, they recovered the camp which had been lost
                        through the faintheartedness of the second legion. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> And it easily could be recovered if the barbarians were
                        suddenly surprised in the midst of their plundering; the camp could be
                        recaptured just as it had been captured. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                        His words of encouragement were listened to eagerly by the soldiers, the
                        standards rapidly went forward, and the legionaries followed without a
                        moment's delay. The first, however, to approach the rampart were the consul
                        and the troops he was bringing from the sea. <milestone n="9" unit="section"
                        /> The first tribune of the second legion, with the view of encouraging his
                        men, pointed out to them that if the barbarians had intended to hold the
                        camp by the same arms by which they had taken it, they would, first of all,
                        have followed up their enemy in his flight from his camp to the sea, and
                        then they would have stationed pickets in front of their rampart. <milestone
                            n="10" unit="section"/> They were in all probability lying sunk in wine

                        political oppression only under which they were suffering, but absolute
                        slavery; they, their wives and children were the victims of violence;

                        existed in those provinces. Delegates from the Latin allies, after
                        numberless appeals to the censors and the late consuls, were at length
                        admitted to an audience of the senate, and their statement made a great

                        was that their citizens who were on the Roman register had migrated in great

                        allowed it would come to pass in a very few lustra that the towns and fields

                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The Samnites and Paeligni stated that
                        4000 families had gone from them to Fregellae, but they were not diminishing
                        their contingents, nor were the Fregellans increasing theirs. The practice
                        of individuals changing their citizenship led to two kinds of fraud.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The law allowed those amongst the

                        avoid any male descendants being left at home, they gave their children as

                        male descendants became Roman citizens. Subsequently, even this legal

                        of law and without any male descendants they migrated to Rome and were
                        placed on the City register. The delegates asked that this might be stopped
                        for the future, and that those who had migrated should be ordered to return
                        to their homes. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> They asked further that a

                        had become Roman citizens by this means to renounce their citizenship. The

                        consuls. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Two legions were ordered to be
                        raised for Sardinia, each consisting of 5200 infantry and 300 cavalry; the
                        Latin allies were to supply 12,000 infantry and 600 cavalry. In case the
                        consul wished to take ships from the dockyard, ten quinqueremes were placed
                        at his disposal. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The same strength of
                        infantry and cavalry was decreed for Histria as for Sardinia. The consuls
                        also received instructions to despatch a force of one legion with its
                        complement of cavalry and 5000 infantry and 250 cavalry from the allies to
                        M. Titinius in Spain. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Before the consuls
                        balloted for their provinces various portents were reported. <milestone

                        in the Crustumerian district; on Roman land a boy was born without all his
                        limbs, and a four-footed snake was seen; at Capua numerous buildings in the
                        forum were struck by lightning; at Puteoli two shops had been set on fire by
                        a similar stroke. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> While these were being
                        reported, a wolf entered the City by the Colline Gate in broad daylight and
                        was chased till it escaped through the Esquiline Gate, amidst great
                        excitement on the part of its pursuers. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> In

                        there were special intercessions at all the shrines for one day. <milestone

                        resolution of the senate, the consul C. Claudius carried a measure in which
                        it was ordered that those of the Latin allies who themselves or whose

                        returned by that date. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> In addition to
                        this new law, and the consul's edict enforcing it, a resolution was passed
                        by the senate ordering that whenever any one of them was manumitted and
                        publicly declared to be free, the dictator, consul, interrex, censor or
                        praetor for the time being should put the manumitter on his oath that he was
                        not doing it for the purpose of altering his citizenship; in case he refused
                        to take the oath the senate would declare the manumission invalid.
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> This resolution was to guide all

                        their ravages far and wide, and the Histrians were animated much more by
                        indignation and rage at the loss of their property than by any certain hope
                        that they would be strong enough to meet two consular armies. <milestone

                        into a hastily levied tumultuary force, and they displayed much more
                        impetuosity in beginning a battle than steadfastness in keeping it up. Four
                        thousand of them fell on the field; the rest abandoned all resistance and
                        dispersed to their cities. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> From these
                        cities delegates were sent to the Roman camp to sue for peace, and on being

                        When this became known in Rome through despatches from the proconsuls, C.
                        Claudius, fearing lest this success should rob him of his province and his
                        army, went off post-haste to his province without offering the customary
                        prayers, unattended by his lictors and in the dead of night, his colleague
                        being the only one who was aware of his intention. His conduct after his
                        arrival was more ill-advised even than the way in which he had started for
                        his province. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Addressing the assembled
                        troops, he taunted Manlius with his flight from the camp, to the intense
                        annoyance of the soldiers, since it was they who began the flight, and then
                        he attacked M. Junius for associating himself with his colleague's disgrace,
                        and ended by ordering them both to quit the province. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> They promised that they would obey his order as soon as
                        he had made his departure from the City in the traditional way, after the
                        customary prayers in the Capitol, and attended by his lictors in their
                        official dress. Claudius, beside himself with rage, called the official who
                        was acting as quaestor to Manlius to bring fetters, and threatened to send
                        both Manlius and Junius in chains to Rome. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                        This officer also ignored the consul's authority, and their determination
                        not to obey was strengthened by the way the army supported their commanders
                        and resented the conduct of Claudius. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> At

                        returned to Aquileia in the same vessel in which he had come. <milestone

                        There was a river flowing past the town which impeded the assailants and

                        battle the consul rode forward and rallied his men. Whilst exposing himself
                        somewhat incautiously in front of the standards, he was struck by a missile

                        therefore to a breach of the treaty with Rome, with which all our interests
                        are bound up? Unless, indeed, anyone doubts that a war between Perseus and
                        the Romans is inevitable, and that what was expected during Philip's
                        lifetime and interrupted by his death will take place now that he is dead.
                        Philip, as you know, had two sons, Demetrius and Perseus. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> Demetrius far surpassed his brother in birth on the
                        mother's side, in courage, in ability, in popularity with his countrymen.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> But Philip had destined the crown as
                        a reward for hatred of the Romans, and he put Demetrius to death for no
                        other offence than his friendship with Rome. Perseus, he knew, would inherit
                        a war with Rome almost before he inherited the crown, and he made him king.
                        What else has he been doing since his father's death but making preparations
                        for war? In the first place he sent the Bastarnae into Dardania creating
                        universal alarm. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> If they had made their
                        home in that country, Greece would have found them more troublesome
                        neighbours than the Gauls were in Asia. Though his expectations here were
                        frustrated, he did not give up all thoughts of war; rather, to say the
                        truth, he has now commenced war and subjugated the Dolopes by force of arms,
                        and refused to listen to their proposal to refer their differences to the
                        arbitration of Rome. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Then he crossed
                        Mount Oeta and, in order to make a sudden appearance in the heart of Greece,
                        went up to Delphi. What do you imagine was his object in thus exercising a
                        right-of-way where none existed? Then he traversed Thessaly. His doing so
                        without inflicting injury on any of those he hated I regard with all the
                        more apprehension as an attempt to win them over. <milestone n="14"
                            unit="section"/> And now he has sent a letter to us with what looks like
                        an act of generosity, and advises us to consider how for the future we may
                        dispense with that generosity, namely, by rescinding the decree by which the
                        Macedonians are kept out of the Peloponnese. <milestone n="15"
                            unit="section"/> This, too, in order that we may once more see the
                        king's ambassadors and the renewal of hospitable relations with his chief
                        men. Before long we shall have the Macedonian armies and the king himself
                        entering the Peloponnese by way of Delphi-narrow is the strait that
                        separates us! —and, finally, we shall find ourselves in the ranks of the
                        Macedonians whenever they take up arms against Rome. <milestone n="16"
                            unit="section"/> I give it as my opinion that we make no fresh decree,
                        but let everything remain just <milestone n="17??" unit="section"/> as it
                        is, until it becomes absolutely certain whether these fears of mine are
                        groundless or justified. If the peace between Macedonia and Rome remains
                        unbroken, let there be friendly intercourse between us. <milestone n="18"

                        in war, so now we follow them as the authors of peace. I do not see why we
                        alone in all the world should wage a relentless war against the kingdom of

                        strength or through the favour of heaven or owing to the distance which
                        separates us, in any case we are safe. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> But
                        suppose we lay as open to invasion as the Thessalians and the Aetolians,
                        have we no more interest with the Romans, no stronger claim upon them than
                        the Aetolians, who were not long ago in arms against them, while we have

                        Why does this abominable interference with the common rights of humanity

                        did something which caused us to make this decree against him when he was in

                        any wrong towards us, effacing by his kindness the enmity aroused against
                        his father-what has Perseus done to make us, alone of all nations, his

                        that the services which the former kings of Macedonia have rendered us have
                        been so great that the injury which Philip has done to us, however great it
                        was, should be forgotten, especially now that he is dead. <milestone n="12"
                            unit="section"/> You know that when the Roman fleet was lying at

                        lengthy, and this was our long-standing union of interests with Macedonia
                        and the great services which her kings have for many years rendered to us.

                        war, even Perseus himself entertains no doubt as to our taking the side of
                        Rome. As long as there is peace, let all hostile feelings be suppressed,

                        The leaders were indignant at Perseus not thinking the matter important
                        enough for formal negotiation and making his demand in the few lines of a
                        letter. The discussion was adjourned and no decree was made. <milestone

                        have spoken by far the most convincingly and most eloquently. A few days

                        entertained hopes of peace. There was only a six months' truce, however;

                        factions had led to civil wars. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The
                        commissioners who had gone to Aetolia to put down similar disturbances
                        brought back word that the frenzy of the nation could not be restrained. The
                        consul's arrival was the salvation of the Petavines, and as he had nothing
                        else to do in his province he returned to Rome. </p>

                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> These censors were the first to make
                        contracts for paving the streets of the City with flints and the roads
                        outside with gravel, and footpaths raised at the sides, and also for the
                        construction of bridges at various points. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        They furnished the praetors and aediles with a stage, placed the barriers in
                        the Circus and provided egg-shaped balls to mark the number of laps,
                        turning-posts on the course and iron doors for the cages through which the
                        animals were sent into the arena. They also undertook the paving of the
                        ascent from the Forum to the Capitol with flint and the construction of a
                        colonnade from the temple of Saturn to the Capitol, and then on to the
                        senaculum, and beyond that to the senate-house. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> The market-place outside the Porta Trigemina was paved
                        with stone slabs and enclosed by a palisading; <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> they also repaired the Aemilian colonnade and made a
                        flight of stone steps on the slope leading from the Tiber. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> Inside the same gate they paved the colonnade leading
                        to the Aventine with flint and made a road from the temple of Venus by the
                        Clivus Publicius. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> These censors also
                        signed contracts for the erection of walls at Calatia and Auximium, and the
                        money which they received from the sale of portions of the State domain was
                        spent in building shops round the forums in both these places. <milestone
                            n="11" unit="section"/> Postumius gave out that without the orders of
                        the Roman senate or people he would not spend their money, so Fulvius
                        Flaccus, acting alone, built a temple to Jupiter at Pisaurum and at Fundi
                        and brought water to Placentia. He also paved a street at Pisaurum with
                        flint. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> At Sinuessa he added some suburban
                        residences with aviaries, constructed sewers, enclosed the place with a
                        wall, built colonnades and shops all round the forum, setting up three
                        statues of Janus there. These works contracted for by one of the censors
                        were greatly appreciated by the members of the colony. <milestone n="13"
                            unit="section"/> The censors were strict and painstaking in the
                        regulation of morals; several of the equites were deprived of their horses.

                        earthquake in the Sabine country which had laid many buildings in ruins.

                        Sempronius Gracchus, the legions of the army of Rome have subjugated
                        Sardinia. In that province there have been 80,000 natives either killed or
                        made prisoners. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> He was most happy in his
                        administrations; he liberated the allies of Rome; he restored the revenues
                        and brought his army safely home laden with enormous booty. For the second
                        time he entered Rome in triumph. Because of this he has given this tablet as
                        an offering to Jove." <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> There was a

                        Several gladiatorial exhibitions were given this year, most of them on a
                        small scale; the one given by T. Flamininus far surpassed the rest.

                        he exhibited this spectacle for four days, and accompanied it with a

                        magnificent exhibition the total number of men who fought was only
                        seventy-four. </p>
