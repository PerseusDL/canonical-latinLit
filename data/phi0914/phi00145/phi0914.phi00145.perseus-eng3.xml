                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The heralds of victory travelled to Rome
                        with the utmost possible speed, but on their arrival they found that the
                        rejoicings over it had forestalled them. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                        Four days after the battle, while the Games were going on in the Campus
                        Martius, a whispered rumour suddenly spread amongst the whole concourse of
                        spectators to the effect that a battle had taken place in Macedonia
                        resulting in the utter defeat of the king. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                        Then the rumour grew louder until at last cheers and applause arose as
                        though definite tidings of victory had been brought to them. The magistrates
                        were taken by surprise and enquired who had started this sudden outburst of
                        joy. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> As no one could be found the
                        excitement produced by what they had taken for a certainty calmed down, but
                        still they were convinced that it was a happy omen, which was subsequently
                        verified by the arrival of the authentic messengers. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> They were delighted quite as much at their
                        prognostications proving true as at the victory itself. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> A second outburst amongst the crowd in the Circus is
                        recorded. On 17th September, the second day of the Roman Games, whilst the
                        consul was mounting the stand to start the chariots, a despatch-bearer who
                        said that he had come from Macedonia handed him a despatch wreathed in
                        laurel. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> After the chariots were started he
                        mounted his own and, riding across the course to the raised benches where
                        the spectators were seated, held up the laurelled despatch for the people to
                        see. On catching sight of it, the populace, regardless of the races, ran
                        down into the middle of the Circus. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The
                        consul called the senate together there and after obtaining their sanction,
                        read the despatch to the onlookers in their seats. He announced that his
                        colleague Lucius Aemilius had fought a decisive battle with Perseus, that
                        the Macedonian army had been routed and cut to pieces, that the king with
                            <milestone n="9??" unit="section"/> a few of his followers was a
                        fugitive, and that all the cities of Macedonia had passed under the power of
                        Rome. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> On hearing this, cheers and frantic
                        applause broke out; most of the men deserted the Games and went home to
                        carry the joyful news to their wives and children. <milestone n="11"
                            unit="section"/> This was thirteen days after the battle had been fought
                        in Macedonia. </p>

                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The following day there was a meeting of
                        the senate in the senate-house, and a decree was made ordering public
                        thanksgivings. The senators also passed a resolution that, with the
                        exception of the regular soldiers and the seamen of the fleet the consul
                        should disband those who had taken the military oath to him. <milestone
                            n="2" unit="section"/> The question of the disbandment of the soldiers
                        and seamen was postponed until the arrival of the deputation from L.
                        Aemilius, by whom the despatch-bearer had been sent on in advance.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> On 25th September, about 8 A.M., they
                        entered the City. A vast crowd had gone out to meet them at various points
                        and accompany them back to the City. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                        Carrying the throng along with them they made their way to the Forum, and
                        from there to the senate-house. The senate happened to be in session, and
                        the consul brought them into the House. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                        They were detained there for some time whilst they described the strength of
                        the king's troops, both horse and foot, the numbers of those killed and
                        those taken prisoners, the small cost at which such a slaughter of the enemy
                        had been made, and the panic in which the king had fled. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> They thought he would probably make for Samothrace, and
                        they informed the senate that the fleet was ready to take up the pursuit; he
                        could not escape either by land or sea. Shortly afterwards they were
                        conducted to the Assembly, where they made much the same statement, and the
                        rejoicings were renewed on the consul <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/>
                        giving notice that all the sacred buildings were opened, and every one was
                        to go from the Assembly and offer, each for himself, his thanks to the gods.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> All the temples throughout the City
                        were filled with crowds of women as well as men. The senators were recalled
                        to the senate-house and made a decree that, in consideration of the glorious
                        victory won by L. Aemilius, thanksgivings should be offered <milestone
                            n="9??" unit="section"/> at all the shrines for five days, and the
                        victims sacrificed were to be full-grown animals. Orders were given that the
                        ships which were lying in the Tiber fully equipped for service, <milestone
                            n="10??" unit="section"/> to be sent to Macedonia should occasion arise,
                        were to be hauled up and placed in dock; the crews were to receive a year's
                        pay and be discharged, as also all who had taken the military oath to the
                        consul. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> In addition to these the troops
                        in Corcyra, Brundisium and the coast of the Hadriatic, or in the district of
                        Larinum-an army had been distributed in all these places as a reserve for C.
                        Licinius to take to the support of his colleague, should it become
                        necessary-were ordered to be disbanded. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> A
                        five days' thanksgiving was proclaimed before the Assembly, to commence on
                        26th September. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The two commissioners who had been sent to
                        Illyria reported on their return that the Illyrian army had been destroyed
                        and Gentius taken prisoner, and that Illyria had made formal submission to
                        Rome. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> For these successes, gained under
                        the leadership and auspices of L. Anicius, the praetor, the senate ordered a
                        three days' thanksgiving. A second celebration of the Latin Festival was
                        proclaimed by the consul for 10th-12th November. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> Some writers assert that the envoys from Rhodes who
                        were still in Rome were summoned before the senate after the announcement of
                        the victory, as if to expose them and their stupid arrogance to ridicule.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Agepolis, their leader, is reported to
                        have declared that they had been sent by the government of Rhodes to make
                        peace between Perseus and the Romans because that war was burdensome and
                        hurtful to the <milestone n="5??" unit="section"/> whole of Greece and an
                        expensive and unprofitable one to the Romans themselves. Now that the war
                        had ended otherwise, the Fortune who presides over Rome had done well to
                        give them an opportunity of congratulating the Romans on their splendid
                        victory. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> So far the Rhodians. The senate's
                        reply was to the effect that it was neither to promote the interests of
                        Greece nor to save the Roman exchequer that the Rhodians had despatched that
                        embassy, but solely in the interest of Perseus. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> Had they really felt as anxious about these two matters
                        as they pretended to be, the envoys ought to have been sent at the time when
                        Perseus led his army into Thrace and went on for two years attacking the
                        cities of Greece, some by actual investment, others by intimidation; there
                        was no mention of peace made by the Rhodians then. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> It was not till they learnt that the mountain defiles
                        had been crossed and the Romans had invaded Macedonia that they sent their
                        envoys, their only motive being to save Perseus from the dangers which were
                        hanging over him. With this reply the envoys were dismissed. </p>

                        his way home from Spain, captured the important city of Marcolica, and
                        brought into the treasury 10 pounds' weight of gold and a quantity of silver
                        amounting to one million sesterces. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The
                        consul Paulus Aemilius was, as I have already said, still in camp at Sirae,
                        in the Odomantic country, when three persons of mean appearance brought him
                        a letter from Perseus. On seeing the missive he is said to have shed tears
                        over the fate that befalls men, for the man who a short time ago was not
                        contented with his kingdom of <milestone n="3??" unit="section"/> Macedonia,
                        but made an attack on the Dardanians and the Illyrians, and had called out
                        the auxiliary levies of the Bastarnae-that man had now lost his army, was
                        driven out of his kingdom a homeless wanderer into a small island where, as
                        a suppliant, he was protected by the sanctity of the temple, not by any
                        strength which he possessed. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> When,
                        however, he read the salutation, "From King Perseus to the consul Paulus."
                        the man's utter failure to realise his condition destroyed all feeling of
                        compassion. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Consequently, though in the
                        body of the letter there were appeals for mercy which were anything but
                        kingly, the messengers were dismissed without any reply either by word of
                        mouth or in writing. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Perseus saw that he
                        must forget his royal title in his defeat, and a second letter was sent in
                        which he described himself by his personal name. In this he begged most
                        urgently that some persons might be sent to him with whom he could confer as
                        to his status and the circumstances in which he was placed. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> The three who were sent to him were P. Lentulus, A.
                        Postumius Albinus and A. Antonius. Nothing resulted from this conference;
                        Perseus clung desperately to his royal title, and Paulus was determined that
                        he should place himself and all that he possessed at the mercy of Rome. </p>

                        put in at Samothrace. Octavius thought that the presence of the fleet would
                        intimidate Perseus, and he tried to induce him to surrender by appealing to
                        his hopes and fears. An incident brought about either by accident or design
                        assisted his efforts. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> A young man of
                        distinction, L. Atilius, noticed that the people of Samothrace were holding
                        an assembly, and he requested the magistrates to allow him to address a few
                        words to the people. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Permission being
                        granted, he began: "My friends and hosts of Samothrace, is it true or false
                        what we have heard, that this is a consecrated island and that its soil is
                        everywhere sacred and inviolable?" <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> There
                        was a unanimous response in the affirmative, and he went on: "Why, then, is
                        it polluted and violated by a murderer stained with the blood of King
                        Eumenes? And whilst all approach to your sacred shrines is forbidden to
                        those who do not come with clean hands before commencing any holy rite, will
                        you allow them to be contaminated by the presence of a blood-stained
                        assassin?" <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> It was well known through all
                        the cities of Greece that the murder of Eumenes at Delphi had been attempted
                        and all but effected by Euander. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> They were
                        aware that the temple and the whole of the island lay at the mercy of the
                        Romans, and they felt, too, that they deserved the reproach. Theondas, their
                        chief magistrate-they give him the title of "king"-was accordingly sent to
                        Perseus to inform him that Euander was accused of murder and that courts
                        were established after the manner of their ancestors to try those who were
                        alleged to have entered the sacred boundaries with unholy hands. <milestone
                            n="7" unit="section"/> If Euander felt sure that he would be proved
                        innocent of any capital crime let him appear to defend himself, but if he
                        did not dare to stand his trial, let him deliver the temple from a curse end
                        take measures for his personal safety. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                        Perseus called Euander aside and advised him on no account to undergo a
                        trial; he was no match for his accusers, either on the merits of the case or
                        in the influence which he possessed. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> He
                        was haunted by the fear that if Euander were found guilty he would bring him
                        in as the instigator of that infamous crime. What was left for him to do but
                        to die bravely? Euander raised no objection openly, but after saying that he
                        would rather die by poison than by the sword, he made preparations for
                        secret flight. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> On this coming to the
                        king's ears he was afraid that Euander, by escaping punishment, might bring
                        down the wrath of the Samothracians upon himself under the belief that he
                        had connived at his escape. He therefore gave orders for Euander to be put
                        to death. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> After the reckless perpetration
                        of this murder he suddenly reflected that he had beyond any doubt brought
                        upon himself the blood-guiltiness which had previously rested on Euander.
                        Eumenes had been wounded by Euander in Delphi, and now he himself had put
                        Euander to death in Samothrace. Thus he alone was responsible for the
                        profanation of the two holiest temples in the world by human blood.
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> He averted this terrible charge by
                        bribing Theondas and inducing him to announce to the people that Euander had

                        against his one remaining friend, who had been tested through so many
                        misfortunes and who had been betrayed because he would not betray his

                        and as he was left all but alone he was compelled to form plans for flight.
                        There was a Cretan named Oroandas who was familiar with the coast of Thrace
                        through his trading journeys. Perseus called upon him to take him on board
                        with him to Cotys. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> There was a bay formed
                        by one of the headlands of Samothrace, named from the adjacent temple of
                        Demeter the Demetrium, and there the boat was lying. Just after sunset
                        everything required for use, and as much of the money as could be carried
                        without detection, was put on board. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The
                        king with three who shared his flight went out at midnight through a door at
                        the back of the house into the garden which was close to his room, and after
                        climbing the wall with considerable difficulty succeeded in reaching the
                        shore. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Oroandas had only waited till the
                        money was on board, and as soon as it grew dark weighed anchor and put out
                        to sea for Crete. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> As no ship was to be
                        found in the harbour Perseus wandered about for some time on the shore. At
                        last, dreading the approach of day, he did not dare to return to his
                        quarters but hid himself in a dark corner on one side of the temple.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The children of the Macedonian
                        nobility who were chosen to wait on the king used to be known as "the royal
                        pages." <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> These boys had followed the king
                        in his flight, and even now refused to desert him until a proclamation was
                        published by order of Cnaeus Octavius, stating that the royal pages and any
                        other Macedonians who were in Samothrace would, if they went to the Romans,
                        preserve their personal safety and liberty, and all their property, both
                        what they had with them and what they had left in Macedonia. <milestone

                        reported themselves to C. Postumius, one of the military tribunes. Ion, the
                        Thessalian, also gave up the king's little children to Octavius, and now no
                        one was left with the king except his eldest son Philip. <milestone n="10"

                        respect either of his own renown or that of his nation, and besides, he had
                        only played a subordinate part in the Punic War, as Gentius had done in the
                        Macedonian. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Whereas Perseus was the head
                        and supreme director of the war; and not only were all eyes drawn to him
                        through his own reputation and that of his father and grandfather and others
                        to whom he was allied by blood relationship, but he was heir to the glory of
                        Philip and Alexander the Great, who raised the Macedonian Empire to a
                        supreme position in the world. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Perseus
                        entered the camp in mourning garb without a single attendant to make him

                        Owing to the crowd who surrounded him he was unable to make any progress

                        spread into Asia, Antenor, who was lying with a fleet of swift ships at

                        Popilius was at Delos to escort the supply ships destined for Macedonia, and

                        vessels had left their station he sent home the ships of the allies which
                        were under his command and set sail for Egypt to <milestone n="3??"
                            unit="section"/> carry out the mission with which he was charged. He was
                        anxious to meet Antiochus, if possible, before he approached the walls of
                        Alexandria. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Coasting along the shores of
                        Asia the commissioners arrived at Loryma, a harbour little more than twenty
                        miles from Rhodes and facing the city. Here some of the leading Rhodians had
                        come to meet them-for by this time the news of the victory had been carried
                        to Rhodes-and begged them to break their journey at Rhodes. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> They said that it deeply concerned the good name and
                        safety of their city that the commissioners should find out for themselves
                        what had been going on and what was going on at the time, and should carry
                        back to Rome what they had personally ascertained and not simply empty
                        rumours. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> For a long time they refused, but
                        at last consented to a brief interruption of their voyage for the sake of an
                        allied city. After they had entered Rhodes, these same men persuaded them to
                        appear before their assembly. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The
                        appearance of the commissioners increased rather than allayed the fears of
                        the citizens. Popilius brought up all the hostile speeches and acts of which
                        they had been guilty during the war, whether individually or collectively.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Being a man of fierce temper, he made
                        the matters he spoke about appear still more heinous by his angry expression
                        and the sternness of his voice. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> So though
                        the citizens had given him no personal offence, they could gather from the
                        embittered tone of one Roman senator what the feelings of the senate as a
                        whole were towards them. The address of C. Decimius was much more moderate.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> With regard to most of the things
                        that Popilius had mentioned, he said that the blame did not rest with the
                        people, but with a few agitators who had stirred up the mob, and, winning
                        their votes by bribery, had passed decrees filled with flattery of the king,
                        and had been the means of those embassies being sent to him which had caused
                        the Rhodians as much shame as regret. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> All
                        this, if the people were sound at heart, would recoil on the heads of the
                        guilty parties. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> His words were loudly
                        applauded, for he not only exculpated the great body of the citizens, but he
                        fastened the guilt on those who were really responsible for the mischief.
                            <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> When, therefore, their leaders spoke
                        in reply, those of them who tried to explain away the charges which Popilius
                        had made were not listened to with anything like the approval which greeted
                        those who agreed with Decimius that the authors of the evil should be made
                        to atone for the evil they had done. A decree was at once passed that those
                        who were convicted of having spoken or acted in favour of Perseus against
                        the Romans should be sentenced to death. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                        Some had left the city before the Romans came, others took their own lives.
                        The commissioners did not stay beyond five days in Rhodes, and then went on
                        to Alexandria. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> Their departure did not
                        make the Rhodians any the more slack in commencing the trials under the
                        decree passed when the commissioners were present; the mildness of Decimius
                        did quite as much to strengthen their resolution to see the thing through as
                        the severity of Popilius. </p>

                        24.19) Antiochus was now master of the rest of Egypt, but after his check
                        before Alexandria he retired from its walls. <milestone n="2" unit="section"
                        /> The elder Ptolemy, whose restoration to his throne Antiochus pretended
                        was his sole object in invading Egypt was left at Memphis, and Antiochus
                        withdrew his army into Syria, prepared to attack whichever brother should
                        prove victorious. Ptolemy was quite aware of his intention, and hoped that
                        by playing upon his brother's fears and holding out the prospect of a siege
                        he might possibly, with the active assistance of his sister and the
                        acquiescence of his brother's friends, be admitted into Alexandria.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He began a correspondence with his
                        sister and his brother's friends, and continued to write to them until he
                        had come to terms with them. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> What made him
                        suspicious of Antiochus was that after handing over the rest of Egypt he had
                        left a strong garrison in Pelusium. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> It was
                        obvious that Antiochus was holding the key of Egypt in order to make a fresh
                        invasion whenever he chose, and for Ptolemy to engage in intestine strife
                        with his brother would prove to be his ruin, since, even if victorious, he
                        would be no match for Antiochus after an exhausting war. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> These wise reflections met with the approval of his
                        brother and his friends, and his sister helped him very largely by her
                        advice and her appeals to the brother. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> So
                        peace was made, and he was admitted into Alexandria with everybody's
                        consent; even the populace manifested no opposition, though they had
                        suffered severely both during the investment and after the retirement of the
                        enemy, as no supplies were being brought in from the rest of Egypt. This
                        ought to have given the liveliest satisfaction to Antiochus, had his motive
                        for bringing his army into Egypt really been the restoration of Ptolemy.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> For this was the pretext he alleged in
                        all his communications to the cities of Greece and Asia, and in his replies
                        to their deputations. But he was so intensely annoyed at what had happened
                        that he began to make preparations for war in a much more aggressive and
                        ruthless temper against the two brothers than he had previously shown
                        against the one. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> He at once sent his fleet
                        to Cyprus, and in the first days of spring set his army in motion for Egypt
                        and advanced into Coelo-Syria. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> When near
                        Rhinocolura he was met by envoys from Ptolemy, who thanked him for the
                        recovery of his ancestral crown and begged him to protect the boon he had
                        conferred and to say clearly what he wanted rather than attack him as an
                        enemy by force of arms after being his friend. Antiochus replied that he
                        would not recall his fleet or withdraw his army on any other conditions than
                        the cession of Cyprus and of Pelusium and the surrounding country at the
                        mouth of the Nile. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> He further fixed a day
                        by which he was to receive a reply stating the acceptance of the conditions.

                        others under threats, he marched by easy stages towards Alexandria.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> After crossing the river at Eleusis,
                        about four miles from Alexandria, he was met by the Roman commissioners, to
                        whom he gave a friendly greeting and held out his hand to Popilius.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Popilius, however, placed in his hand
                        the tablets on which was written the decree of the senate and told him first

                        through he said he would call his friends into council and consider what he
                        ought to do. Popilius, stern and imperious as ever, drew a circle round the
                        king with the stick he was carrying and said, "Before you step out of that
                        circle give me a reply to lay before the senate." For a few moments he
                        hesitated, astounded at such a peremptory order, and at last replied, "I
                        will do what the senate thinks right." <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Not
                        till then did Popilius extend his hand to the king as to a friend and ally.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Antiochus evacuated Egypt at the
                        appointed date, and the commissioners exerted their authority to establish a
                        lasting concord between the brothers, as they had as yet hardly made peace
                        with each other. They then sailed to Cyprus and sent home the fleet of
                        Antiochus which had defeated the Egyptian ships in a naval engagement.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The work of the commissioners won
                        great renown amongst the nations, for it was undoubtedly owing to this that
                        Egypt had been rescued out of the hands of Antiochus and the crown restored
                        to the Ptolemaic dynasty. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Whilst one of
                        the consuls for the year had signalised his consulship by a famous victory,
                        the other remained in comparative obscurity because he had no opportunity of
                        distinguishing himself. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> At the outset, in

                        landed at Puteoli, and the quaestor L. Manlius was sent with a sum of money
                        to meet him and conduct him to Rome at the expense of the State. Immediately
                        on his arrival in Rome the senate granted him an audience. <milestone n="13"
                            unit="section"/> The young prince spoke in such a way as to make the
                        matter of his speech still more welcome by the way he put it. He stated the
                        force of cavalry and infantry, the number of elephants, the quantity of corn
                        which his father had sent to Macedonia during the last four years.
                            <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Two things made him blush; one was
                        that the senate through their ambassadors had requested him instead of
                        commanding him to furnish what was necessary for the war, the other was that
                        they had sent money to pay for the corn. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>
                        Masinissa, he said, had not forgotten that it was to the Romans that he owed
                        his kingdom and the subsequent extension of it; he was quite contented with
                        enjoying the usufruct of it and was fully aware that the proprietary
                        remained with those who gave it to him. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>
                        He thought it only right that they should take and not ask or pay for the
                        produce of the soil which they had given. What was over and above the
                        requirements of the people of Rome would be amply sufficient for him.
                            <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> He then informed the senate that
                        after leaving his father with these instructions he was overtaken by mounted
                        messengers who informed him of the final defeat of Macedonia and brought an
                        order for him to offer his father's congratulations to the senate, and to
                        say that he was so rejoiced at this that he wished to go to Rome and offer
                        sacrifices and thanksgivings in the Capitol if the senate would give him
                        permission. </p>

                        attracted all men's eyes and thoughts. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He
                        was received by the men who had taken part with him in the war with as
                        hearty a welcome as though Eumenes himself had come. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> Two objects had brought him to Rome, to all appearance
                        honourable ones; one was to offer congratulations on the victory which he
                        had himself helped to win, the other was to complain of an inroad of the
                        Gauls and a defeat which he had sustained and which seriously threatened his
                        kingdom. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> But he was also cherishing secret
                        hopes of receiving from the senate benefits and rewards which could hardly
                        fall to his lot without injuring his relations with his brother. There were
                        certain men in Rome, evil counsellors, who encouraged his ambitions.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> These men made him believe that the
                        prevailing opinion in Rome with regard to Attalus and Eumenes was that the
                        one was a sure friend to the Romans, the other was regarded as a man whom
                        neither the Romans nor Perseus could trust as an ally. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> It was difficult, therefore, to decide whether the
                        requests he made on his own behalf or those through which he might seek to
                        damage his brother would be the more likely to gain the consent of the
                        senate, so bent were they as a body on granting everything to Attalus and
                        denying everything to Eumenes. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Attalus, as
                        the event showed, was one of those men who try to gain all that their hopes
                        promise them; but in his case the wise admonitions of a friend put a curb,
                        so to speak, on a temper which was becoming wanton through popularity.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> There was in his suite a physician
                        called Stratus; Eumenes, who felt uneasy, had sent him specially to Rome to
                        watch his brother's conduct, and if he saw him becoming disloyal to his
                        brother, to give him sound and faithful advice. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> Stratus found that he had to deal with ears already
                        preoccupied and feelings already tampered with, but he seized favourable
                        moments for conversing with him, and in these interviews he restored a
                        position which had become almost hopeless. <milestone n="10" unit="section"
                        /> He represented to him that different kingdoms had grown strong through
                        different causes; their kingdom was a new one, not based upon age-long
                        power; it stood through brotherly harmony; the royal title and the crown are
                        borne by one, but all his brothers reign with him. <milestone n="11"
                            unit="section"/> Who would not regard Attalus, the next in age, as a
                        king, not only because he sees him in such a powerful position now, but also
                        because the day is near when he will ascend the throne owing to the age and
                        weakness of Eumenes, who has no legitimate son? (He had not yet acknowledged
                        the one who succeeded him.) What advantage would there be in trying to gain
                        by violent means what would shortly come to him of its own accord?
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> A fresh storm had burst on the realm
                        in an invasion of the Gauls which could with difficulty be withstood even by
                        the combined and harmonious efforts of the two monarchs. <milestone n="13"
                            unit="section"/> "If, however, in addition to a foreign foe there was
                        domestic strife, resistance would be impossible, and all that would be
                        gained would be that your brother would lose the crown before his death and
                        you would destroy all hopes of your succeeding him. Even assuming that to
                        save the kingdom for your brother and to wrest it from him were both things
                        you could boast about, still the preservation of the kingdom and the proof
                        it would afford of your brotherly affection would be the more commendable
                        and praiseworthy. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> But as a matter of fact
                        the one alternative is detestable and is next door to parricide; why then
                        should there be any doubt as to which course to take? Are you going to try
                        and secure a part of the kingdom or deprive your brother of the whole?
                            <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> If the former, then, your power being
                        divided, you would be both weakened and exposed to every possible injury and
                        outrage. If the latter, are you prepared to send your elder brother into
                        private life or into banishment, old and infirm as he is, and at last to a
                        lonely exile's death? <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> For, without

                        is given in the fate of Perseus, who laid at the feet of his conqueror the
                        diadem stained with his brother's blood which he had seized in the temple at
                        Samothrace, as though the gods who witnessed the murder were now exacting
                        the penalty. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> The very men who are goading
                        you on, not because they are friendly to you, but because they are enemies
                        to Eumenes, will themselves applaud your affection and constancy if you
                        maintain your loyalty to your brother to the end." </p>

                        Accordingly, when introduced to the senate he offered his congratulations on
                        the victory, and alluded to the services, such as they were, which he and
                        his brothers had rendered. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He then
                        described the serious unrest among the Gauls which had brought about a
                        revolt and begged the senate to send envoys to them with sufficient
                        influence and authority to induce them to lay down their arms. Having
                        carried out his instructions so far as they affected the welfare of the
                        kingdom, he asked that Aenus and Maronea might be assigned to him.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> So, to the disappointment of those who
                        supposed that after bringing charges against his brother he would ask for
                        the kingdom to be divided between them, he left the senate-house. Seldom at
                        any time has either king or private citizen been listened to with such
                        universal pleasure and approval; all honours and gifts were showered upon
                        him during his stay, and his departure was witnessed by large crowds.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Amongst the numerous delegations from
                        Greece the one from Rhodes excited the greatest interest. <milestone n="5"

                        mission of congratulation, and indeed if they had shown themselves in
                        mourning it might have looked as though they were lamenting the fall of
                        Perseus. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> When the consul, M. Junius,
                        consulted the senate as to whether they would grant them free quarters and
                        hospitality and an audience, the House decided that the obligations of
                        hospitality should not be discharged in their case. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> The envoys meanwhile were standing in the Comitium, and
                        when the consul came out of the senate-house they told him that they had
                        come to offer their congratulations on the victory and to rebut the
                        accusations of treason, and they begged that the senate would grant them an
                        audience. The consul told them plainly that it was to friends and allies
                        that the Romans were wont to give a hospitable welcome and grant an audience
                        of the senate. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The conduct of the Rhodians
                        during the war had not been such that they deserved to be counted amongst

                        this, they all prostrated themselves to the ground and implored the consul
                        and all who were present not to think it just and right that the new charges
                        which were falsely made against them should outweigh their services in the

                        The praetor himself had acted in defiance of precedent, for he was making

                        always been consulted on the question of war, and then, if the senate gave
                        their sanction, the question was submitted to the popular Assembly.

                        in the wrong, because the traditional usage was that no one should veto a

                        happened that those who had asserted that they would not interpose their

                        The one who did most to help them was M. Porcius Cato, who though naturally
                        stern and inflexible acted on this occasion the part of a lenient and

                        to the effect that they would neither be declared enemies nor allowed to

                        others elected to remain in Rome with Astymedes so that they could find out

                        pieces in value and sent it to Theaetetus, the commandant of the fleet, for
                        him to carry it to Rome. They wished him to press for an alliance with Rome,
                        but in such a way that the terms would not be submitted to the people, nor
                        reduced to writing, because in case he was unsuccessful the failure would be
                        all the more humiliating. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> It was the sole
                        prerogative of the commandant of the fleet to act in these matters without

                        those years they had maintained friendly relations with Rome without binding
                        themselves by an express treaty of alliance, their only reason being that
                        they did not wish to preclude the kings from all hopes of their assistance
                        should it ever be needed, nor themselves from the advantage to be derived
                        from the bounty and good fortune of those monarchs. <milestone n="10"

                        security against other nations-for they feared none but the Romans-but to

                        the other subject countries would either win their freedom by revolt or be
                        seized by their neighbours, and they themselves would be shut up in a small

                        of so large a city. A body of troops was accordingly despatched to the

                        support of Perseus and their hatred of the Romans; it was through them that
                        the whole nation had revolted from Rome. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        Knowing that the guilt rested on them personally and hopeless of obtaining
                        pardon, they shut the gates that they might be buried in the general ruin of
                        their country, and appealed to the inhabitants to prefer death to servitude.
                        No one ventured to open his lips against such powerful men. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> At last a certain Theodotus, a young man of noble
                        birth, whose dread of the Romans proved stronger than his fear of his
                        chiefs, exclaimed, "What madness possesses you that you should make the

                        right that their country should perish for their sake. Why do we not open
                        our gates and accept the sovereignty which the whole world has accepted?"
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> As he said this the whole multitude
                        followed him, Antinous and Theodotus rushed against the nearest outpost of

                        the Romans. At Tecmon the chief magistrate was equally defiant and closed
                        the gates. He was put to death and the place surrendered. <milestone n="10"

                        agreed upon with the commissioners: "It is the order of the senate and

                        Jupiter and Hercynna, and he offered sacrifices to these deities. He then

                        sent orders for those who were accused to await him at Amphipolis. He met

                        that the ten commissioners had landed in Greece, and laying aside all other

                        Aemilius is said to have spoken to him in a kindly tone, but when he arrived
                        in the camp at Amphipolis he severely censured C. Sulpicius, in the first

                        to the royal treasury. When the day arrived he advanced to the tribunal,
                        where he took his seat with the ten commissioners, surrounded by a vast
                        concourse of Macedonians. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Though they were
                        accustomed to the display of royal power, this novel assertion of authority

                        After the herald had called for silence Paulus, speaking in Latin, explained

                        laid down that the Macedonians were to be a free people, possessing their

                        were to pay to Rome half the tribute which they had been paying to the king.
                        Secondly, Macedonia was to be broken up into four separate cantons.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The first would embrace the district

                        the whole of Bisaltica together with Heraclea, which district the natives
                        call Sintice. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The second canton would be
                        bounded on the east by the Strymon, exclusive of Sintice, Heraclea and
                        Bisaltica; and on the west by the Axius, including the Paeonians, who dwelt
                        to the east of the Axius. The third division would be the district enclosed
                        between the Axius on the east and the Peneus on the west; the Bora range
                        shuts it in on the north. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> This canton was
                        increased by the addition of the part of Paeonia which extends westwards
                        beyond the Axius; Edessa and Beroea were assigned to this division. The
                        fourth canton lay on the other side of the Bora range, bordering Illyria on

                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Aemilius then designated the capital
                        cities where the councils were to be held in the different cantons;
                        Amphipolis was fixed for the first, Thessalonica for the second, Pella for

                        were to be summoned, the tribute deposited, and the annual magistrates
                        elected. His next announcement was that all intermarriage between the
                        inhabitants of the different cantons was forbidden, as also the possession
                        of land or houses in more than one canton. <milestone n="10" unit="section"

                        also forbidden. The Dardanians were laying claim to Paeonia on the ground
                        that it once belonged to them, and they had a common frontier; <milestone

                            <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> As he had refused them Paeonia he
                        granted them the right to purchase salt and ordered the third canton to

                        to be sold. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> He forbade the Macedonians

                        lightening of the annual tribute were a great relief to them, but the
                        prohibition of mutual intercourse between the different cantons seemed to
                        them like the rending asunder of their country, like an animal deprived of
                        its limbs, where each limb is necessary to all the rest so ignorant were
                        they of the size of Macedonia, how easily it lent itself to division and how
                        self-contained each part was in itself. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                        The first section includes the Bisaltae, a nation of warriors living on the
                        other side of the Nessus and around the Strymon and contains many special
                        kinds of fruit and minerals and the city of Amphipolis, which is so
                        conveniently situated, commanding as it does all approaches from the east.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Then again, the second division
                        comprises the populous cities of Thessalonica and Cassandrea and also the
                        rich corn-growing district of Pallene. Facilities for sea-borne traffic are
                        afforded by numerous harbours: some at Torone under Mount Athos, and at
                        Aenea and Acanthus, others facing Thessaly and Euboea, and others again
                        easily accessible from the Hellespont. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The
                        third canton includes the famous cities of Edessa, Beroea and Pella, the
                        warlike tribe of the Vettii and also a large population of Gauls and
                        Illyrians who are devoted to husbandry. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        The fourth canton is peopled by the Eordaei the Lyncestae and the Pelagones,
                        and there are also the three cities of Atintania, Tymphaei, and Elimiotis.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The whole of this strip of country is
                        cold and unkindly and difficult of cultivation, and the character of the
                        peasants corresponds to that of their country. Their barbarian neighbours
                        make them still more ferocious by sometimes familiarising them with war, and
                        in times of peace introducing their own rites and customs. <milestone n="8"

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> After the constitution of Macedonia had
                        been thus announced, and the consul had declared his intention of providing
                        a code of laws, the Aetolians were summoned to appear. <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> The enquiry was directed more to find out who had been
                        in favour of the Romans and who in favour of the king than to discover which
                        party had inflicted and which had suffered wrongs. The murderers were
                        acquitted, the exiles and the slain were alike considered to have deserved
                        their fate; the only one found guilty was A. Baebius because he had allowed
                        his soldiers to be the instruments of the massacre. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> This result of the case of the Aetolians had the effect
                        of inflating the adherents of the Roman party in all the communities and
                        peoples of Greece to an insupportable pitch of insolence, and whenever there
                        was any suspicion of having favoured the king their opponents were trampled
                        in the dust. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The leaders in the various
                        cities fell into three classes; two of these consisted of men who, whilst
                        insinuating themselves into the confidence of the Romans on the one hand or
                        the king <milestone n="5??" unit="section"/> on the other, aggrandised
                        themselves at the expense of their fellow-citizens, the third class sought
                        to defend their liberties and their laws by opposing both the others. The
                        greater the affection which their compatriots felt for them at home, the
                        less were they appreciated abroad. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Elated
                        by the success of the Romans, the supporters of that party were in sole
                        possession of the magistracies and the sole representatives of their States.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Numbers of these men came from the
                        Peloponnesus, from Boeotia, and the other national councils in Greece to be
                        present at the congress, and they filled the ears of the commissioners with
                        their charges. They averred that the supporters of Perseus included not only
                        those who in a spirit of idle vanity openly boasted that they were his
                        friends and intimates, but a <milestone n="8??" unit="section"/> far more
                        numerous body who had secretly espoused his cause, and under the pretext of
                        defending their liberties had everywhere induced the councils to act in
                        direct hostility to Rome. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The loyalty of
                        the different States could only be maintained by crushing these parties and
                        strengthening the authority of those whose sole aim was to support the power
                        of Rome. A list of names was furnished by these men, and letters from the
                        commander were despatched to Acarnania, Aetolia, Epirus and Boeotia,
                        ordering those named to follow him to Rome to make their defence. <milestone
                            n="10" unit="section"/> Two of the commissioners, C. Claudius and Cnaeus
                        Domitius, went in person to Achaia to publish this order. There were two
                        reasons for this. One was their belief that the self-confidence and high
                        spirit of the Achaeans would prevent their obeying the order, and possibly
                        Callicrates and the other informers might even be in danger of their lives.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The other was that while letters from
                        the leaders in other States had been discovered in the royal archives, none
                        had been found from the Achaeans, and the charges against them lacked proof.
                        After the Aetolians had withdrawn, the Acarnanian deputation was called in.
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> In their case no change was made
                        beyond the removal of Leucas as a member of their league. <milestone n="13"
                            unit="section"/> Then the commissioners extended the scope of this
                        enquiry as far as Asia. Labeo was sent to destroy the city of Antissa in the
                        island of Lesbos, and transfer the inhabitants to Methymna, the reason for
                        this step being that they had admitted the king's naval commander, Antenor,
                        into their harbour and helped him with supplies while he was cruising off
                        Lesbos. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Two of their leaders were
                        beheaded: <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> Andronicus, the son of
                        Andronicus, an Aetolian, because he had followed his father and borne arms
                        against Rome, and Neo, a Theban, who had been the prime agent in their

                        been interrupted by these proceedings was again convened. <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> First of all the status of Macedonia was defined.
                        Senators, who were known as "synedri," were to be elected to form a council
                        for the administration of government. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Then
                        a list was read out of the names of those Macedonian leaders who it was
                        decided were to go in advance to Italy with all their children over fifteen
                        years of age. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> At first glance this seemed
                        a cruel measure, but it soon became apparent to the Macedonians that it was
                        done to protect their liberties. The names on the list were those of the
                        friends and court nobles of the king, the generals of his armies, the
                        commanders of his ships and garrisons accustomed to servile submission
                        towards him and dictatorial insolence towards others. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> Some were exceedingly wealthy others whose fortunes did
                        not equal theirs lived quite as extravagantly; their table and dress were on
                        a regal scale they had no idea of citizenship, and were incapable of
                        submission to law or to a liberty equal for all. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> Every one, therefore, who had been employed in the
                        king's service, even those who had been sent as envoys, were ordered to
                        leave Macedonia and proceed to Italy, and whoever refused obedience was
                        threatened with death. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The laws which
                        Aemilius gave to the Macedonians had been so carefully and considerately
                        drawn up that he might be thought to be giving them not to vanquished
                        enemies but to allies who had rendered good service, and not even after a
                        long practical experience-the only safe guide in legislative reform-have
                        they been found to need amendment. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> After
                        attending to these more serious matters he celebrated the Games, for which
                        preparations had been going on for a long time, with great splendour. Notice
                        of them had been sent to the cities of Asia and to the kings, and during his
                        tour in Greece Aemilius had informed the leading men about them. <milestone
                            n="9" unit="section"/> There was a gathering of artistes proficient in
                        every kind of scenic display, a vast assemblage of athletes from all parts
                        of the world, and horses that had won many races. There were also civic
                        deputations with their animals for sacrifice; everything, in fact, which
                        usually formed a part of these exhibitions in honour both of gods and men.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The performances were so good that
                        not only the magnificence of the spectacle but the skill shown in its
                        display were universally admired; the Romans were not in those days adepts
                        at these exhibitions. The same care was taken over the rich banquets which
                        were prepared for the civic deputations. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                        A remark of the consul's was often quoted, that, the man who knew how to win

                        forces were assembled, there was nevertheless such abundance of everything

                        gifts to individuals, to cities, and even to whole nations, sufficient not
                        only for their use at the time, but enough for them to take home with them.

                        interested in the scenic representations and the athletic contests and
                        chariot races than they were in the display of the spoils from Macedonia.
                        These were all laid out to view-statues, pictures, woven fabrics, articles

                        Athenians, who persecuted their foremost men because they were jealous of
                        their greatness. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Enough wrong was done by
                        your ancestors in the case of Camillus, whom they treated with injustice-it

                        yourselves in the case of P. Africanus. We must blush with shame when we
                        remember that the domicile and home of the man who subjugated Africa was at

                        infamy so ugly in the eyes of other nations, so disastrous to our own
                        people; for who would wish to resemble either Africanus or Paulus in a
                        community which was ungrateful and hostile to its good citizens? <milestone

                        were only one of glory, what triumph, pray, does not bring with it a glory
                        in which every Roman has a share? <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> All
                        those triumphs over the Gauls, all those over the Spaniards; all those over

                        only, and not rather of the people of Rome as a whole? As it was not over
                        Pyrrhus or Hannibal personally but over the Epirots and the Carthaginians,
                        so it was not Manlius Curius or P. Cornelius alone who celebrated them but
                        the Romans. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Especially is this true of
                        the soldiers. With their laurel wreaths, each wearing his decorations, they
                        shout their 'Io Triumphe' and make their progress through the City, hymning
                        their commander's praises. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> If at any time
                        the soldiers have not been brought back from the province for their triumph
                        they murmur, yet even then they consider that they are taking their part in
                        it because it was by their hands that the victory was won. <milestone n="14"
                            unit="section"/> If any one were to ask you soldiers for what object you

                        brought into order; why you have come to Rome in your thousands and under
                        your standards; why you remain here and do not disperse each of you to your
                        homes; what answer would you give except that you want to appear in the
                        triumph? You, at all events, ought to wish to be seen as victors. </p>

                        which awaits men. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> He, himself a captive,
                        has seen his children led as captives before him, but still, he has them
                        safe and sound; I, who have triumphed over him, went from the funeral of one
                        of my sons in my chariot to the Capitol, and returned to find the other at
                        the point of death. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Out of all my sons,
                        not one remains to bear the name of Lucius Aemilius Paulus. As though I had
                        a large family, two have been adopted by the Cornelian and Fabian houses;
                        there is not a Paulus left except myself. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                        But your happiness and the good fortune of the republic are my consolation
                        in this ruin of my house." The self-restraint which this speech evinced made
                        a far greater impression upon his audience than if he had indulged in
                        tearful laments over his bereavement. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> On December 1, Cn. Octavius celebrated his
                        naval victory over Perseus. That triumph was without prisoners and without
                        spoil. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He gave each member of the crews
                        seventy-five denarii; to the pilots twice as much; and to the captains four
                        times as much. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> A meeting of the senate was
                        then convened, and the senators decided that Q. Cassius should conduct
                        Perseus and his son Alexander to Alba to remain there under guard.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The king was allowed to retain his
                        suite, his money, his silver plate and his household effects. Bithys the son
                        of Cotys, king of the Thracians was sent, together with the hostages, to
                        Carseoli, to be interned there. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The rest
                        of the captives who had been led in the triumphal procession were to be shut
                        up in prison. A few days later a deputation from Cotys arrived with a sum of
                        money for the ransom of his son and the other hostages. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> They were admitted to an audience of the senate, and
                        they especially urged that it was not of his own will that Cotys had
                        assisted Perseus; he had been compelled to give hostages, and they implored
                        the senate to allow them to be ransomed at such a figure as the senate
                        should fix. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The senate instructed the
                        praetor to tell them in reply that the senate bore in mind the friendly
                        relations which had existed between Rome and Cotys and the ancestors of
                        Cotys and the Thracian nation. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The giving
                        of hostages was itself the offence, and could not be alleged as an excuse,
                        for the Thracians had nothing to <milestone n="9??" unit="section"/> fear
                        from Perseus, even had he kept the peace, much less when he was engaged in a
                        war with Rome. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> However, though Cotys had
                        preferred the favour of Perseus to the friendship of Rome, they would mete
                        out their treatment of him by what was consistent with their own dignity
                        more than by his deserts; they would send back his son and the hostages.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The beneficent acts of the people of
                        Rome were gratuitous; they preferred to leave the value of them in the
                        hearts of those who received them rather than to exact a cash payment for
                        them. Three commissioners were appointed —T. Quinctius Flamininus, C.
                        Licinius Nerva and M. Caninius Rebilus-to conduct the hostages back to
                        Thrace, and each of the Thracian envoys received a present of 2000 ases.
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Bithys was taken with the rest of the
                        hostages from Carseoli and sent to his father. The king's ships, which were
                        larger than had ever been seen before, were hauled up on to the Campus
                        Martius. </p>

                        fresh in men's minds and almost before their eyes, L. Anicius triumphed on
                        the day of the Quirinalia (Feb. 17) over Gentius and the Illyrians.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The spectacle as a whole showed rather
                        a general resemblance to the triumph of Paulus than a correspondence in
                        details. The general himself was a smaller man, and people contrasted the
                        position of the house of Anicius and his authority as praetor with the high
                        lineage of Aemilius and his rank as consul, and there could be no comparison
                        between Gentius and Perseus, or between the Illyrians <milestone n="3??"
                            unit="section"/> and the Macedonians, or between the spoils and wealth
                        carried in the two processions, or the amount of the donative to the
                        soldiers in the two armies. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> But though the
                        recent triumph eclipsed this one, it was clear to the onlookers that in
                        itself it was by no means contemptible. The Illyrians were a nation
                        formidable both by land and sea, who felt secure in their strong fortified
                        positions, and Anicius had thoroughly subjugated them in a few days and
                        captured their king and all his family. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                        Many captured standards were carried in the procession, together with other
                        spoils, and the furniture of the palace, 27 pounds of gold, and 19 of
                        silver, besides 13,000 denarii and 120,000 silver pieces of Illyrian
                        coinage. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Before his chariot walked
                        Gentius, with his wife and children, Caravantius his brother, and several
                        Illyrian nobles. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Out of the booty each
                        legionary received 45 denarii, the centurions twice, and the cavalry three
                        times as much. Anicius gave to the Latin allies as much as to the Romans,
                        and to the seamen of the fleet as much as the soldiers received. <milestone
                            n="8" unit="section"/> The soldiers marched more joyously in this
                        triumph, and the general himself was the subject of many laudatory songs.
                        According to Antias, 200,000 sesterces were realised from the sale of that
                        booty, besides the gold and silver deposited in the treasury, but as it is
                        not clear to me how this sum was realised, I quote his authority instead of
                        stating it as a fact. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> By resolution of the
                        senate, Gentius, with his wife and children and brother, were interned in
                        Spoletium; the rest of the captives were thrown into prison in Rome. As the
                        Spoletians refused to be responsible for their safe-keeping, the royal
                        family were transferred to Iguvium. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The
                        remainder of the Illyrian spoils consisted of 220 swift barques. These Q.
                        Cassius was ordered by the senate to distribute amongst the Corcyraeans, the
                        Apolloniates and the Dyrrhachians. </p>

                        worth recording in Liguria; the enemy never took the field, so they confined

                        were elected consuls. On the following day the election of praetors took
                        place. Those elected were L. Julius, L. Apuleius Saturninus, A. Licinius

                        Claudius, died this year; the augurs chose T. Quinctius Flamininus in his
                        place; Q. Fabius Pictor, a Flamen Quirinalis, also died. During the year

                        citizens. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Addressing the praetor, he said
                        that he had come to pay reverence to the gods of the City, to salute the
                        senate and citizens of Rome, and to congratulate them on their victory over
                        Perseus and Gentius, and the extension of their sway by the subjugation of

                        for him. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Three days afterwards he attended
                        a meeting of the senate. After congratulating them upon the victory, he
                        enumerated his own services in the war, and asked permission to sacrifice
                        ten full-grown victims in the Capitol in fulfilment of a vow, and one to
                        Fortune at Praeneste; these vows had been made for the victory of Rome. He
                        also requested that the alliance with him might be renewed, and that the

                        himself as the manumitted slave of Rome, and wearing the distinctive dress
                        of this class on that account. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/> At Rome,
                        too, when he entered the senate-house, he prostrated himself and kissed the

                        expressions more degrading to himself than complimentary to those who heard
                        him. After a stay of not more than thirty days in the City and the
