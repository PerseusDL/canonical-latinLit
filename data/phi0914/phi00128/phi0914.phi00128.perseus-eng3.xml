                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Though Hasdrubal's invasion had shifted
                        the burden of war to Italy and brought corresponding relief to Spain, war
                        was suddenly renewed in that country which was quite as formidable as the
                        previous one. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> At the time of Hasdrubal's
                        departure Spain was divided between Rome and Carthage as follows: <milestone
                            n="3" unit="section"/> Hasdrubal Gisgo had retreated to the ocean
                        littoral near Gades, the Mediterranean coast-line and almost the whole of
                            <milestone n="4??" unit="section"/> Eastern Spain was held by Scipio on
                        behalf of Rome. A new general took Hasdrubal's place, named Hanno, who
                        brought over <milestone n="5??" unit="section"/> a fresh army, and marched
                        into Celtiberia, which lies between the Mediterranean and the ocean, and
                        here he soon raised a very considerable army. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> Scipio sent M. Silanus against him with a force of not
                        more than 10,000 infantry and 500 cavalry. Silanus marched with all the
                        speed he could, but his progress was impeded by the bad state of the roads
                        and <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/> by the narrow mountain passes,
                        obstacles which are met with in most parts of Spain. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> In spite of these difficulties he outstripped not only
                        any natives who might have carried tidings, but even any <milestone n="9??"
                            unit="section"/> floating rumours of his advance, and with the
                        assistance of some Celtiberian deserters who acted as guides he succeeded in
                        finding the enemy. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> When he was about ten
                        miles distant, he was informed by his guides that there were two camps near
                        the road on which he was marching; <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> the
                        one on the left was occupied by the Celtiberians, a newly raised army about
                        9000 strong, the one on the right by the Carthaginians. <milestone n="12"
                            unit="section"/> The latter was carefully guarded by outposts, pickets
                        and all the usual precautions against surprise; <milestone n="13"
                            unit="section"/> the Celtiberian camp was without any discipline, and
                        all precautions were neglected as might be expected of barbarians and raw
                        levies who felt all the less fear because they were in their own country.
                            <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Silanus decided to attack that one
                        first, and kept his men as much to the left as possible, so as not to be
                        seen by the Carthaginian outposts. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> After
                        sending on his scouts he advanced rapidly against the enemy. </p>
                </div>
                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="2" type="chapter">
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> He was now about three miles away and none
                        of the enemy had yet noticed his advance, the rocks and thickets which
                        covered the whole of this hilly district concealed his movements. <milestone
                            n="2" unit="section"/> Before making his final advance, he ordered his
                        men to halt in a valley where they were effectually hidden and take food.
                        The scouting parties resumed and confirmed the statements of the deserters,
                        on which the Romans, after placing the baggage in the centre and arming
                        themselves for the combat, advanced in order of battle. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> The enemy caught sight of these when they were a mile
                        distant and hurriedly prepared to meet them. <milestone n="4" unit="section"
                        /> As soon as Mago heard the shouting and confusion he galloped across from
                        his camp to take command. There were in the Celtiberian army 4000 men with
                        shields and 200 cavalry, making up a regular legion. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> These were his main strength and he stationed them in
                        the front; the rest who were lightly armed he posted in reserve. In this
                        formation he led them out of the camp, but they had hardly crossed the
                        rampart when the Romans hurled their javelins at them. The Spaniards stooped
                        to avoid them, and then sprang up to discharge their own, which the Romans
                        who were in their usual close order received on their overlapping shields;
                        then they closed up foot to foot and fought with their swords. <milestone
                            n="6" unit="section"/> The Celtiberians, accustomed to rapid evolutions,
                        found their agility useless on the broken ground, but the Romans, who were
                        used to stationary fighting, found no inconvenience from it beyond the fact
                        that their ranks were sometimes broken when moving through narrow places or
                        patches of brushwood. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Then they had to
                        fight singly or in pairs, as if they were fighting duels. </p>
                    <p> These very obstacles, however, by impeding the enemy's flight, gave them up,
                        as though bound hand and foot, to the sword. Almost all the heavy infantry
                        of the Celtiberians had fallen when the Carthaginian light infantry, who had
                        now come from the other camp, shared their fate. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> Not more than 2000 infantry escaped; the cavalry, which
                        had hardly taken any part in the battle, together with Mago also got away.
                        The other general, Hanno, was taken prisoner, together with those who were
                        the last to appear in the field when the battle was already lost. <milestone
                            n="9" unit="section"/> Mago, with almost the whole of his cavalry and
                        his veteran infantry, joined Hasdrubal at Gades ten days after the battle.
                        The Celtiberian levies dispersed amongst the neighbouring forests and so
                        reached their homes. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> So far the war had
                        not been a serious one, but there was all the material for a much greater
                        conflagration had it been possible to induce the other tribes to join the
                        Celtiberians in arms; that possibility was by this most timely victory
                        destroyed. Scipio therefore eulogised Silanus in generous terms, and felt
                        hopeful of bringing the war to a termination if he on his part acted with
                        sufficient promptitude. He advanced, accordingly, into the remote corner of
                        Spain where all the remaining strength of Carthage was concentrated under
                        Hasdrubal. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> He happened at the time to be
                        encamped in the district of Baetica for the purpose of securing the fidelity
                        of his allies, but on Scipio's advance he suddenly moved away and in a march
                        which closely resembled a flight retreated to Gades on the coast. <milestone
                            n="12" unit="section"/> Feeling, however, quite certain that as long as
                        he kept his army together he would be the object of attack, he arranged,
                        before he crossed over to Gades, for the whole of his force to be
                        distributed amongst the various cities, so that they could defend the walls
                        whilst the walls protected them. </p>
                </div>
                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="3" type="chapter">
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> When Scipio became aware of this breaking
                        up of the hostile forces, he saw that to carry his arms from city to city
                        would involve a loss of time far greater than the results gained, and
                        consequently marched back again. Not wishing, however, to leave that
                        district in the enemy's hands, he sent his brother Lucius with 10,000
                        infantry and 1000 cavalry to attack the richest city in that part of the
                        country; the natives call it Orongi. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> It is
                        situated in the country of the Maessesses, one of the tribes of Southern
                        Spain; the soil is fertile, and there are also silver mines. Hasdrubal had
                        used it as his base from which to make his incursions on the inland tribes.
                        Lucius Scipio encamped in the neighbourhood of the city, but before
                        investing it, he sent men up to the gates to hold a parley with the townsmen
                        and endeavour to persuade them to put the friendship rather than the
                        strength of the Romans to the proof. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> As
                        nothing in the shape of a peaceable answer was resumed, he surrounded the
                        place with a double line of circumvallation and formed his army into three
                        divisions, so that one division at a time could be in action while the other
                        two were resting, and thus a continuous attack might be kept up. <milestone
                            n="4" unit="section"/> When the first division advanced to the storm
                        there was a desperate fight; they had the utmost difficulty in approaching
                        the walls and bringing up the scaling-ladders owing to the rain of missiles
                        showered down upon them. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Even when they
                        had planted the ladders against the walls and began to mount them, they were
                        thrust down by forks made for the purpose, iron hooks were let down upon
                        others so that they were in danger of being dragged off the ladders and
                        suspended in mid-air. Scipio saw that what made the struggle indecisive was
                        simply the insufficient number of his men and that the defenders had the
                        advantage because they were fighting from their walls. He withdrew the
                        division which was engaged, and brought up the two others. In face of this
                        fresh attack the defenders, worn out with meeting the former assault,
                        retreated hastily from the walls, and the Carthaginian garrison, fearing
                        that the city had been betrayed, left their various posts and formed into
                        one body. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> This alarmed the townsmen, who
                        dreaded lest the enemy when once inside the city should massacre every one,
                        whether Carthaginian or Spaniard. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> They
                        flung open one of the gates and burst out of the town, holding their shields
                        in front of them in case missiles should be hurled on them from a distance,
                        and showing their empty right hands to make it plain that they had thrown
                        away their swords. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Their action was
                        misinterpreted either owing to the distance at which they were seen, or
                        because treachery was suspected, and a fierce attack was made upon the
                        flying crowd, who were cut down as though they were a hostile army. The
                        Romans marched in through the open gate whilst other gates were demolished
                        with axes and mallets, and as each cavalry man entered he galloped in
                        accordance with instructions to the forum. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                        The cavalry were supported by a detachment of triarii; the legionaries
                        occupied the rest of the city. There was no plundering and, except in the
                        case of armed resistance, no bloodshed. All the Carthaginians and about a
                        thousand of the townsmen who had closed the gates were placed under guard,
                        the town was handed over to the rest of the population and their property
                        restored to them. About 2000 of the enemy fell in the assault upon the city;
                        not more than 90 of the Romans. </p>

                        Philip accordingly proceeded thither by forced marches, but did not reach

                        which were almost ripe, especially round the gulf of the Aenianes, and then
                        led his army back to Scotusa. Leaving the bulk of his forces there he
                        returned to Demetrias with his household troops. <milestone n="17"
                            unit="section"/> With the view of meeting any movement on the part of

                        formed an imposing defence. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Here a violent
                        contest took place, for the tower was plentifully stored with missiles of

                        engrossed by the struggle going on here, Plator admitted the Romans through
                        the gate of the seaward citadel, and this was captured at once. <milestone

                        gates against them, and thus shut out from both citadels they were killed or
                        made prisoners. The Macedonian garrison stood in a close phalanx under the
                        wall of the citadel, neither attempting to flee nor taking an active part in
                        the fighting. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Plator persuaded Sulpicius
                        to let them go and they were placed on board and landed at Demetrium in
                        Phthiotis. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Plator himself joined Attalus.
                        Encouraged by his easy success at Oreus, Sulpicius sailed at once with his

                        the result by no means answered his expectations. <milestone n="12"

                            <milestone n="13??" unit="section"/> the appearance of a double harbour

                        it would be difficult to find a more dangerous roadstead for a fleet. Sudden
                        tempestuous winds sweep down from the lofty mountains on both sides, and the
                        Euripus does not, as is commonly asserted, ebb and flow seven times a day
                            <milestone n="15??" unit="section"/> at regular intervals, but its

                        anchored his fleet in these treacherous waters, he found that the town was

                        warning, but through the treachery of Plator they were lighted too late, and

                        signal. Although this city is also situated on the island, it is separated
                        from the mainland by such a narrow strait as to allow of its being connected
                        by a bridge, and it is therefore more easy to approach it by land than by

                            unit="section"/> As it was he fled, without stopping to arm, in wild
                        disorder to his ships, and the men were actually pushing their vessels off
                        when Philip appeared, and even from the water's edge created great alarm
                        amongst the crews. Then he returned to Opus, storming at gods and men
                        because the chance of a great success had been almost snatched out of his
                        hands. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> He was just as furious with the
                        Opuntians, for, though they might have held out till his arrival, no sooner
                        did they see the enemy than they voluntarily surrendered. </p>
                    <p> After settling matters at Opus, he went on to Thronium. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> Attalus had sailed to Oreus, but on learning that
                        Prusias, the king of Bithynia, had violated the frontiers of his dominions
                        he dropped all his projects in Greece, including the Aetolian war, and
                        sailed to Asia. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Sulpicius took his fleet
                        back to Aegina, whence he had started in the beginning of spring. Philip
                        captured Thronium with no more difficulty than Attalus had experienced at
                        Opus. The population of this city consisted of refugees from Thebes in
                        Phthiotis. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> When the place was captured by
                        Philip, they escaped and put themselves under the protection of the
                        Aetolians, who assigned for their abode a city which had been ruined and
                        abandoned in the previous war with Philip. After his capture of Thronium he
                        advanced to the capture of Tithronon and Drymiae, small unimportant towns in
                        Doris. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Ultimately he reached Elatia,
                        where it was arranged that the embassies from Ptolemy and the Rhodians
                        should meet him. Here they were discussing the question of bringing the
                        Aetolian war to a close-the ambassadors had been present at the recent
                        council of the Romans and Aetolians at Heraclea-when news was brought that
                        Machanidas had decided to attack the Eleans in the midst of their
                        preparations for the Olympic Games. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                        Philip thought it his duty to prevent this, and accordingly dismissed the
                        ambassadors after assuring them that he was responsible for the war and
                        would place no obstacles in the way of peace, provided its terms were fair
                        and honourable. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> He then set off with his
                        army in light marching order, and passed through Boeotia to Megara, and from
                        there he descended to Corinth. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> Here he
                        collected supplies, and then advanced towards Phlius and Pheneos. When he
                        had reached Heraea he heard that Machanidas, alarmed at his rapid approach,
                        had made a hurried return to Lacedaemon. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>
                        On receiving this intelligence he repaired to Aegium, in order to be present
                        at the meeting of the Achaean League; he also expected to find there the
                        Carthaginian fleet, which he had sent for in the hope of doing something by
                        sea. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> The Carthaginians had left that
                        place a few days previously for Oxeae and then, when they heard that Attalus
                        and the Romans had left Oreus, they sought shelter in the harbours of
                        Acarnania, fearing lest if they were attacked within the strait of Rhium,
                        the neck of the Gulf of Corinth, they should be overpowered. </p>

                        vexed at finding that in spite of his rapid movements he was always
                            <milestone n="2??" unit="section"/> too late to do anything, and that
                        Fortune mocked his energy and activity by snatching away every opportunity
                        from before his eyes. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> However, he
                        concealed his disappointment in the presence of the council, and spoke in a
                        very confident tone. Appealing to gods and men he declared that at no time
                        or place <milestone n="4??" unit="section"/> had he ever failed to go with
                        all possible speed wherever the clash of hostile arms was heard. It would be
                        difficult, he continued, to estimate whether the enemy's anxiety to flee or
                        his own eagerness to fight played the greater part in the war. <milestone
                            n="5" unit="section"/> In this way Attalus got away from Opus, and
                        Sulpicius from Chalcis, and now Machanidas had slipped out of his hands. But
                        flight did not always mean victory, and it was impossible to regard as
                        serious a war in which when once you have come into touch with the enemy,
                        you have conquered. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The most important
                        thing was the enemy's own admission that they were no match for him, and in
                        a short <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/> time he would win a decisive
                        victory, the enemy would find the result of the battle no better than they
                        had anticipated. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> His allies were delighted
                        with his speech. He then made over Heraea and Triphylia to the Achaeans, and
                        on their bringing forward satisfactory evidence that Aliphera in Megalopolis
                        had formed part of their territory, he restored that place also to them.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Subsequently with some vessels
                        furnished by the Achaeans-three quadriremes and as many biremes-he sailed to
                        Anticyra. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> He had previously sent into the
                        Gulf of Corinth seven quinqueremes and more than twenty light vessels,
                        intending to strengthen the Carthaginian fleet, and with these he proceeded
                        to Eruthrae in Aetolia near Eupalium, where he disembarked. <milestone
                            n="11" unit="section"/> The Aetolians were aware of his landing, for all
                        the men who were in the fields or in the neighbouring forts of Potidania or
                        Apollonia fled to the woods and the mountains; their flocks and herds which
                        they were unable in their haste to drive away Philip secured and placed on

                        and from there to Cenchreae. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Here he
                        re-embarked, and sailing past the coast of Attica, round the headland of
                        Sunium and almost through the hostile fleets, arrived at Chalcis. <milestone

                        threats or promises, and <milestone n="15??" unit="section"/> he urged them,
                        in case they were attacked, to show the same determination to be true to
                        their ally if they thought their own position preferable to that of Opus or
                        Oreus. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> From Chalcis he sailed to Oreus,
                        where he entrusted the administration and defence of the city to those
                        magnates who had fled on the capture of the place rather than betray it to
                        the Romans. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> Then he returned to
                        Demetrias, the place from which he had started to render assistance to his
                        allies. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> He now proceeded to lay down the
                        keels of 100 war-ships at Cassandrea, and a large number of shipwrights were
                        assembled for their construction. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> As
                        matters were now quiet in Greece, owing to the departure of Attalus and the
                        effective assistance which Philip had given to his allies in their
                        difficulties, he returned to Macedonia to commence operations against the

                        came to Rome to inform the senate that the consul considered L. Porcius and
                        his legions sufficient for the defence of Gaul, in which case he, Livius,
                        and his consular army might be safely withdrawn. <milestone n="2"

                        Nero's legions were to remain in their province, confronting Hannibal. The
                        consuls had been in correspondence with each other and had agreed that as
                        they had been of the same mind in their conduct of public affairs, so,
                        though coming from opposite directions, they should approach the City at the
                        same time. Whichever should be the first to reach Praeneste was to wait
                        there for his colleague, and, as it happened, they both arrived there on the

                        the senate to meet at the temple of Bellona in three days' time they went on
                        together towards the City. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The whole
                        population turned out to meet them with shouts of welcome, and each tried to
                        grasp the consuls' hands; congratulations and thanks were showered upon them
                        for having, by their efforts, rendered the commonwealth safe. When the
                        senate was assembled they followed the precedent set by all victorious
                        generals and laid before the House a report of their military operations.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Then they made request that in

                        special honours should be rendered to the gods and they, the consuls, should

                        place, and then, next to the gods, out of gratitude to the consuls. A solemn
                        thanksgiving was decreed on their behalf, and each of them was allowed to
                        enjoy a triumph. </p>

                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> As they had been in perfect agreement as
                        to the management of their campaign, they decided that they would not have
                        separate triumphs, and the following arrangement was made: <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> As the victory had been won in the province assigned to
                        Livius, and as it had fallen to him to take the auspices on the day of

                        Nero's army was unable to leave its province, it was decided that Livius
                        should ride in the chariot at the head of his soldiers, and C. Claudius Nero
                        alone on horseback. The triumph thus shared between them enhanced the glory
                        of both, but especially of the one who allowed his comrade to surpass him in

                        other who is borne on horseback through the City; even if he went on foot
                        Nero's renown would never die, whether through the glory he acquired in war,
                        or the contempt he showed for it in his triumph." These and similar remarks

                        amounted to 300,000 sesterces and 80,000 of bronze coinage. M. Livius'
                        largesse to his soldiers amounted to fifty-six ases per man, and C. Nero
                        promised to give the same amount to his men as soon as he rejoined his army.
                            <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> It is remarked that in their jests
                        and songs the soldiers on that day celebrated the name of C. Claudius Nero
                        more frequently than that of their own consul; and that the members of the

                        urged the plebs to make them consuls for the coming year. The consuls added
                        considerably to the weight of this recommendation when on the morrow they

                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> It was now the thirteenth year of the
                        Punic War. Both the consuls, L. Veturius Philo and Q. Caecilius Metellus,
                        had the same province-Bruttium-assigned to them, that they might jointly
                        carry on operations against Hannibal. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The
                        praetors balloted for their provinces. M. Caecilius Metellus obtained the
                        City jurisdiction; Q. Mamilius, that over aliens. Sicily fell to C.
                        Servilius, and Sardinia to Ti. Claudius. </p>
                    <p> The armies were distributed as follows: One of the consuls took over Nero's
                        army; the other, that which Q. Claudius had commanded; each consisted of two
                        legions. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> M. Livius, who was acting as
                        proconsul for the year, took over from C. Terentius the two legions of
                        volunteer slaves in Etruria. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> It was also
                        decreed that Q. Mamilius, to whom the jurisdiction over aliens had been
                            <milestone n="10??" unit="section"/> allotted, should transfer his
                        judicial business to his colleague, and hold Gaul with the army which L.
                        Porcius had commanded as propraetor; he was also instructed to ravage the
                        fields of those Gauls who had gone over to the Carthaginians on the arrival
                        of Hasdrubal. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> C. Servilius was to protect
                        Sicily, as C. Mamilius had done, with the two legions of the survivors of
                        Cannae. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The old army in Sardinia, under
                        A. Hostilius, was recalled, and the consuls enrolled a new legion which
                        Tiberius Claudius was to take with him to the island. A year's extension of
                        command was granted to Q. Claudius, that he might remain in charge at
                        Tarentum, and to C. Hostilius Tubero, that he might continue to act at
                        Capua. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> M. Valerius, who had been charged
                        with the defence of the Sicilian seaboard, was ordered to hand over thirty
                        ships to the praetor' C. Servilius, and return to Rome with the rest of his
                        fleet. </p>

                        seemed to those who were reaping them to be covered with blood. At Caere a
                        pig had been farrowed with two heads, and a lamb yeaned which was both male

                        been seen at Alba, and at Fregellae it had become light during the night. In
                        the precinct of Rome an ox was said to have spoken; the altar of Neptune in
                        the Circus Flaminius was asserted to have been bathed in perspiration, and
                        the temples of Ceres, Salus and Quirinus were all struck by lightning.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The consuls received orders to expiate
                        the portents by sacrificing full-grown victims and to appoint a day of
                        solemn intercession. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> These measures were
                        carried out in accordance with the senatorial resolution. What was a much

                        or seen in the City, was the extinction of the fire in the temple of Vesta.
                        The vestal who was in charge of the fire that night was severely flogged by
                        order of P. Licinius, the Pontifex Maximus. <milestone n="7" unit="section"

                        human carelessness, it was decided to sacrifice full-grown victims and hold

                        war, they were advised by the senate "to see to it that the plebeians were

                        Rome and from Latium, and men could dwell in the country parts without fear,
                        it was <milestone n="10??" unit="section"/> by no means fitting that they
                        should be more concerned for the cultivation of Sicily than for that of
                        Italy." The people found it, however, anything but an easy matter.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The small holders had been carried
                        off by the war, there was hardly any servile labour available, the cattle
                        had been driven off as plunder, and the homesteads had been either stripped
                        or burnt. Still, at the authoritative behest of the consuls a considerable
                        number did return to their farms. What led to the senate taking up this
                        question was the presence of deputations from Placentia and Cremona, who
                        came to complain of the invasion and wasting of their country by their
                        neighbours, the Gauls. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> A large proportion
                        of their settlers, they said, had disappeared, their cities were almost
                        without inhabitants, and the countryside was a deserted wilderness. The
                        praetor Mamilius was charged with the defence of these colonies; the
                        consuls, acting on a resolution of the senate, published an edict requiring
                        all those who were citizens of Cremona and Placentia to return to their
                        homes before a certain day. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> At last,
                        towards the beginning of spring, they left for the seat of war. <milestone

                        C. Nero, and L. Veturius, the one which Q. Claudius had commanded, and this
                        he brought up to its full strength with the fresh levies which he had
                        raised. They led their armies into the district of Consentia, and ravaged it
                        in all directions. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> As they were returning
                        laden with plunder they were attacked in a narrow pass by a force of
                        Bruttians and Numidian javelin-men, and not only the plunder but the troops
                        themselves were in danger. There was, however, more alarm and confusion than
                        real fighting. The plunder was sent forward and the legions succeeded in
                        getting into a position free from danger. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>
                        They advanced into Lucania, and the whole of the district returned to its

                        thirteen years he had been carrying on war with varying fortune in an
                        enemy's country far from home. His army was not made up of his own
                        fellow-countrymen, it was a mixed assemblage of various nationalities who
                        had nothing in common, neither laws nor customs, nor language, who differed
                        in appearance, dress <milestone n="5??" unit="section"/> and arms, who were
                        strangers to one another in their religious observances, who hardly

                        united them so closely together that no disturbance ever broke out, either
                        amongst the soldiers themselves or against their commander, though very
                        often money and supplies were lacking and it was through want of these that
                        numerous incidents of a disgraceful character had occurred between the
                        generals and their soldiers in the First Punic War. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> He had rested all his hopes of victory on Hasdrubal and
                        his army, and after that army had been wiped out he withdrew into Bruttium
                        and abandoned the rest of Italy to the Romans. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> Is it not a matter of surprise that no mutiny broke out
                        in his camp? For in addition to all his other difficulties, there was no
                        prospect of feeding his army except <milestone n="9??" unit="section"/> from
                        the resources of Bruttium, and even if the whole of that country had been in
                        cultivation it would have afforded but meager support for so large an army.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> But as it was, a large part of the
                        population had been diverted from the tillage of the soil by the war and by
                        their traditional and innate love of brigandage. He received no assistance
                        from home, for the government was mainly concerned about keeping their hold
                        on Spain, just as though everything in Italy was going on successfully. </p>
                    <p> The situation in Spain was in some respects similar, in others completely

                            unit="section"/> It was dissimilar because the natural features of the

                        front of its camp, neither caring to begin the fight. Towards sunset the two
                        armies, first the Carthaginian and then the Roman, marched back to camp.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> This went on for some days; the
                        Carthaginians were always the first to get into line and the first to
                        receive the order to retire when they were tired out with standing. No
                        forward movement took place on either side, no missile was discharged, no
                        battle-shout raised. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The Romans were
                        posted in the centre on the one side, the Carthaginians in the centre of the
                        other; the flanks on both armies were composed of Spanish troops. In front
                        of the Carthaginian line were the elephants which looked in the distance
                        like towers. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> It was generally supposed in
                        both camps that they would fight in the order in which they had been
                        standing, and that the main battle would be between the Romans and
                        Carthaginians in the centre, the <milestone n="5??" unit="section"/>
                        principals in the war and fairly matched in courage and in arms. <milestone
                            n="6" unit="section"/> When Scipio found that this was assumed as a
                        matter of course, he carefully altered his dispositions for the day on which
                        he intended to fight. The previous evening he sent a tessera through the
                        camp ordering the men to take their breakfast and see that their horses were
                        fed before daybreak, <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/> the cavalry were at
                        the same time to be fully armed with their horses ready, bitted and saddled.
                        Day had scarcely broken when he sent the whole of his cavalry with the light
                        infantry against the Carthaginian outposts, and at once followed them up
                        with the heavy infantry of the legions under his personal command.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Contrary to universal expectation he
                        had made his wings the strongest part of his army by posting the Roman
                        troops there, the auxiliaries occupied the centre. </p>
                    <p> The shouts of the cavalry roused Hasdrubal and he rushed out of his tent.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> When he saw the melee in front of the
                        rampart and the disordered state of his men, and in the distance the
                        glittering standards of the legions and the whole plain covered with the
                        enemy, he at once sent the whole of his mounted force against the hostile
                        cavalry. He then led his infantry out of the camp, and formed his battle
                        line without any change in the existing order. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> The cavalry fight had now been going on for some time
                        without either side gaining the advantage. Nor could any decision be arrived
                        at, for as each side was in turn driven back they retreated into safety
                        amongst their infantry. But when the main bodies were within half a mile of
                        each other, Scipio recalled his cavalry and ordered them to pass to the rear
                        of the infantry, whose ranks opened out to give them passage, he then formed
                        them into two divisions, and posted one as a support behind each of the
                        wings. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Then when the moment for executing
                        his maneuver arrived he ordered the Spaniards in the centre to make a slow
                        advance, and sent word to Silanus and <milestone n="12??" unit="section"/>
                        Marcius that they were to extend to the left as they had seen him extend to
                        the right, and engage the enemy with their light cavalry and infantry before
                        the centers had time to close. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Each wing
                        was thus lengthened by three infantry cohorts and three troops of horse,
                        besides velites, and in this formation they advanced against the enemy at a
                        run, the others following en echelon. The line curved inwards towards the
                        centre because of the slower advance of the Spaniards. The wings were
                        already engaged whilst the Carthaginians and African veterans, the main
                        strength of their army, had not yet had the chance of discharging a single
                        missile. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> They did not dare to leave their
                        place in the line and help their comrades for fear of leaving the centre
                        open to the advance of the enemy. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> The
                        wings were being pressed by a double attack, the cavalry and light infantry
                        had wheeled round and were making a flank charge, whilst the cohorts were
                        pressing their front in order to sever them from their centre. </p>

                        Not only were untrained Balearics and raw Spanish levies face to face with

                        they had been compelled to go into battle before they could strengthen
                        themselves with food. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> It was with this
                        view that Scipio had deliberately delayed the fight till late in the day,
                        for it was not until the seventh hour that the attack began on the wings,
                        and it was some time after that before the battle reached the <milestone

                        the fatigue of standing under arms, and the hunger and thirst from which
                            <milestone n="6??" unit="section"/> they were suffering, they were worn
                        out before they closed with the enemy. Thus exhausted they leaned on their
                        shields as they stood. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> To complete their
                        discomfiture the elephants, scared by the sudden onsets of the cavalry and
                        the rapid movements of the light infantry, rushed from the wings into the
                        centre of the line. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Wearied and depressed,
                        the enemy began to retreat, keeping their ranks however, just as if they had
                        been ordered to retire. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> But when the
                        victors saw that matters were going in their favour they made still more
                        furious attacks in all parts of the field, which the enemy were almost
                        powerless to withstand, though Hasdrubal tried <milestone n="10??"
                            unit="section"/> to rally them and keep them from giving way by calling
                        out that the hill in their rear would afford them a safe retreat if they
                        would retire in good order. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Their fears,
                        however, got the better of their sense of shame, and when those nearest to
                        the enemy gave way, their example was suddenly followed by all and there was
                        a universal flight. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Their first halt was
                        on the lower slope of the hill, and as the Romans hesitated about mounting
                        the hill, they began to re-form their ranks, but when they saw them steadily
                        advancing they again fled and were driven back in disorder to their camp.
                            <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> The Romans were not far from the

                        get back to their camp, and some were even deterred by superstitious fears
                        from attempting anything further for the day. <milestone n="15"
                            unit="section"/> Although the night and the storm invited the

                        their wounds, to take the rest they so sorely needed, yet their fears and
                        the danger they were in allowed them no respite. <milestone n="16"
                            unit="section"/> Fully expecting an attack on their camp as soon as it
                        was light they strengthened their rampart with large stones collected from
                        all the valleys round, hoping to find in their intrenchments the defence
                        which their arms had failed to afford them. <milestone n="17" unit="section"
                        /> The desertion of their allies, however, decided them to seek safety in
                        flight rather than risk another battle. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/>
                        The first to abandon them was Attenes, chief of the Turdetani; he went over
                        with a considerable body of his countrymen, and this was followed by the
                        surrender of two fortified towns with their garrisons to the Romans.

                        the spirit of disaffection becoming general, Hasdrubal shifted his camp the

                        the enemy's departure Scipio sent on his cavalry and followed with his
                        entire army. Such was the rapidity of the pursuit that had they followed in
                        Hasdrubal's direct track they must have caught him up. <milestone n="2"

                        hurried march, which in its haste and confusion looked like a flight gave
                        him a considerable start on the Roman legions. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> Their cavalry and light infantry harassed and retarded

                        and whilst he was continually forced to halt to repel first the cavalry and
                        then infantry skirmishers, the legions came up. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> Now it was no longer a battle but sheer butchery, until
                        the general himself set the example of flight and escaped to the nearest
                        hills with some 6000 men, many of them without arms. The rest were killed or
                        made prisoners. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The Carthaginians hastily
                        improvised an intrenched camp on the highest point of the hills, and as the
                        Romans found it useless to attempt the precipitous ascent, they had no
                        difficulty in making themselves safe. But a bare and sterile height was
                        hardly a place in which to stand even a few days' siege, and there were
                        numerous desertions. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> At last Hasdrubal
                        sent for ships-he was not far from the sea-and fled in the night, leaving
                        his army to its fate. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> As soon as Scipio
                        heard of his flight he left Silanus to keep up the investment of the
                        Carthaginian camp with 10,000 infantry and 1000 cavalry, whilst he himself
                        with the rest of his force returned to Tarraco. During his seventy days'
                        march to this place, he took steps to ascertain the attitude of the various
                        chiefs and tribes towards Rome, so that they might be recompensed as they
                        deserved. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> After his departure Masinissa
                        came to <milestone n="11??" unit="section"/> a secret understanding with
                        Silanus, and crossed over with a small following to Africa, to induce his

                        The reasons which determined him on this sudden change were not evident at
                        the time, but the loyalty which he subsequently displayed throughout his
                        long life to its close proved beyond question that his motives at the
                        beginning were carefully weighed. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> After
                        Mago had sailed to Gades in the ships which Hasdrubal had sent back for him,
                        the rest of the army abandoned by their generals broke up, some <milestone

                        than they are generally regarded by barbarians whose fidelity depends upon

                        delighted with the presents, and, as he saw that the cause of Rome was
                        everywhere successful, whilst the Carthaginians had failed in Italy and
                        entirely disappeared from Spain, he consented to <milestone n="7??"

                        Africa it was of supreme importance for him to secure Syphax; he was the
                        most powerful of the native princes, and had even attempted hostilities
                        against Carthage; moreover, his frontiers were only separated from Spain by
                        a narrow strait. </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Scipio thought it worth while running
                        considerable risk in order to accomplish his end, and as it could not be
                        effected in any other way, he made arrangements for visiting Syphax.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Leaving the defence of Spain in the
                        hands of L. Marcius at Tarraco and M. Silanus at New Carthage, to which
                        latter place he had proceeded by forced marches from Tarraco, he sailed
                        across to Africa accompanied by C. Laelius. <milestone n="12" unit="section"
                        /> He only took two quinqueremes, and as the sea was calm most of the
                        passage was made by rowing, though a light breeze occasionally assisted
                        them. It so happened that Hasdrubal after his expulsion from Spain entered
                        the harbour at the same time. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> He had
                        brought his seven triremes to anchor and was preparing to land when the two
                        quinqueremes were sighted. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> No one
                        entertained the smallest doubt that they belonged to the enemy and could
                        easily be overpowered by superior numbers before they gained the harbour.
                        The efforts of the soldiers and sailors, however, to get their arms ready
                        and the ships <milestone n="15??" unit="section"/> into trim amidst much
                        noise and confusion were rendered futile by a freshening breeze from the
                        sea, which filled the sails of the quinqueremes and carried them into port
                        before the Carthaginians could get up their anchors. <milestone n="16"
                            unit="section"/> As they were now in the king's harbour, no one ventured

                        was not how Spain had been lost, but how Africa was to be retained.
                            <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> It was not from a love of travel or a
                        passion for sailing along pleasant shores that a great Roman commander had
                        quitted his newly subjugated province and his armies and crossed over with

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Spain was now quiet as far as war with
                        Carthage was concerned, but it was quite evident that some communities
                        conscious of wrong-doing were kept quiet more by their fears than by any
                        feeling of loyalty to Rome. Amongst these Iliturgi and Castulo were foremost
                        in importance and foremost in guilt. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> As
                        long as Roman arms were successful Castulo remained true to her alliance;
                        after the Scipios and their armies were destroyed they revolted to Carthage.
                        Iliturgi had gone further, for the inhabitants had betrayed and put to death
                        those who had sought refuge with them after those disasters, thus
                        aggravating their treason by crime. To take action against these cities
                        immediately on his arrival in Spain, whilst the issue was still undecided,
                        might have been justifiable but hardly wise. Now, however, that matters were
                        settled, it was felt that the hour of punishment had arrived. <milestone
                            n="3" unit="section"/> Scipio sent orders to L. Marcius to take a third
                        part of his force to Castulo and at once invest the place, and with the
                        remainder he himself marched to Iliturgi where he arrived after a five days'
                        march. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The gates were closed and every
                        preparation had been made to repel an assault; the townsmen were quite
                        conscious of the punishment they deserved, and any formal declaration of war
                        was, therefore, unnecessary. Scipio made this the subject of his address to
                        his soldiers. "The Spaniards," he said, "by closing their gates have shown
                        how well they deserve the punishment which they fear. <milestone n="5"

                        exact the penalty for cruelty, treachery and murder. <milestone n="6"

                        for all time by this awful example that no one must ever consider a Roman
                        citizen or a Roman soldier a fit subject for ill-treatment, whatever his

                        began to prepare for the assault, storming parties were picked out of all
                        the maniples and supplied with ladders, and the army was formed into two
                        divisions, one being placed under the command of Laelius, so that the town
                        might be attacked from opposite sides and a twofold terror created.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The defenders were stimulated to a
                        determined and prolonged resistance not by their general or their chiefs but
                        by the fear which came from a consciousness of guilt. With their past crime
                        in mind they warned each other that the enemy was seeking not victory so
                        much as vengeance. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The question was not
                        how to escape from death but where to meet it, whether, sword in hand, on
                        the battlefield where the fortune of war often raises up the vanquished and
                        flings the victor to the ground, or amidst the ashes of their city before
                        the eyes of their captive wives and children after being torn with the lash
                        and subjected to shameful and horrible tortures. With this prospect before
                        them every man who could carry arms took his part in the fighting, and even
                        the women and children working beyond their strength supplied missiles to
                        the combatants, and carried stones up to the walls for those who were
                        strengthening the defences. Not only was their liberty at stake-that motive
                        only inspires the brave-but they had before their eyes the very extremity of
                        torture and a shameful death. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> As they
                        looked at each other and saw that each was trying to outdo all the rest in
                        toil and danger, their courage was fired, and they offered such a furious
                        resistance that the army which had conquered Spain was again and again
                        repulsed from the walls of one solitary city, and fell back in confusion
                        after a contest which brought it no honour. <milestone n="11" unit="section"
                        /> Scipio was afraid that the futile efforts of his troops might raise the
                        enemies' courage and depress his own men, and he decided to take his part in
                        the fighting and his share of the danger. Reproaching his soldiers for their
                        cowardice he ordered the ladders to be brought up and threatened to mount
                        himself if the rest hung back. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> He had
                        already reached the foot of the wall and was in imminent danger when shouts

                        safety, and the ladders were at once planted against the wall. Laelius now
                        delivered his attack from the other side of the town. This broke the back of
                        the resistance; the walls were cleared of their defenders and seized by the
                        Romans, and in the tumult the citadel also was captured on that side where
                        it was considered impregnable. </p>

                        their ladders wherever they could approach the walls, these men noticed that
                        the highest part of the city, which was protected by precipitous cliffs, was
                        left unfortified and undefended. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> These
                        Africans, men of light make and through constant training extremely agile,
                        were furnished with iron hooks, and where the projections of the cliff gave

                        they came to a place where it was too steep or too smooth they fixed the

                        pulling up those behind, and those below pushing up those above them.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> In this way, they managed to reach the
                        top, and no sooner had they done so than they ran down with loud shouts into
                        the city which the Romans had already captured. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> And now the hatred and resentment which had prompted
                        the attack on the city showed itself. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> No
                        one thought of making prisoners or securing plunder though everything was at
                        the mercy of the spoilers; the scene was one of indiscriminate butchery,
                        non-combatants together with those in arms, women equally with men were all
                        alike massacred; the ruthless savagery extended even to the slaughter of

                        by the news of the fall of Iliturgi, and this spread dismay and despair

                        exhibition of the instinctive courage of their race, others professed their
                        willingness to fight out of compliment to their general, others again were
                        drawn by a spirit of rivalry to challenge one another to single combat.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> There were several who had outstanding
                        quarrels with one another and who agreed to seize this opportunity of
                        deciding them by the sword on the agreed condition that the vanquished was
                        to be at the disposal of the victor. It was not only obscure individuals who
                        were doing this. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Two distinguished members
                        of the native nobility, Corbis and Orsua, first cousins to each other, who
                        were disputing the primacy of a city called Ibes gave out that they intended
                        to settle their dispute with the sword. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                        Corbis was the elder of the two, but Orsua's father had been the last to
                        hold that dignity, having succeeded his brother. Scipio wanted them to
                        discuss the question calmly and peaceably, but as they had refused to do so
                        at the request of <milestone n="8??" unit="section"/> their own relations,
                        they told him that they would not accept the arbitrament of any one, whether
                        god or man except Mars, and to him alone would they appeal. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> The elder relied upon his strength, the younger on his
                        youth; they both preferred to fight to the death rather than that one should
                        be subject to the commands of the other. They presented a striking spectacle
                        to the army and an equally striking proof of the mischief which the passion
                        for power works amongst men. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The elder
                        cousin by his familiarity with arms and his dexterity easily prevailed over
                        the rough untrained strength of the younger. The gladiatorial contests were
                        followed by funeral games with all the pomp which the resources of the
                        province and the camp could furnish. </p>

                        Certis, and received the surrender of two cities without striking a blow.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Astapa was a city which had always
                        been on the side of Carthage. But it was not this that created a strong
                        feeling of resentment so much as its extraordinary hatred against the
                        Romans, far more than was justified by the necessities of war. Neither the
                        situation nor the fortifications of the city were such as to inspire its
                        inhabitants with confidence, but their love of brigandage induced them to
                        make raids on the territories of their neighbours who were allies of Rome.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> In these excursions they made a
                        practice of capturing any Roman soldiers or camp sutlers or traders whom
                        they came across. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> As it was dangerous to
                        travel in small parties, large companies used to travel together and one of
                        these whilst crossing the frontier was surprised by the brigands who were
                        lying in ambush, and all were killed. When the Roman army advanced to attack
                        the place, the inhabitants, fully aware of the chastisement which their
                        crime merited, felt quite certain that the enemy were too much incensed to
                        allow of any hope of safety in surrender. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                        Despairing of protection either in their walls or their arms, they resolved
                        upon a deed equally cruel and horrible to themselves and to those who
                        belonged to them. Collecting the more valuable of their possessions they
                        piled them up into a heap in a selected place in their forum. <milestone

                        children to take their seats and then heaped round them a quantity of wood,
                        on the top of which they threw dead brushwood. <milestone n="7"

                        and the following instructions were given them: "Remain on guard as long as
                        the battle is doubtful, but if you see that is going against us, and the

                        ensued in which the troopers who had been first to come into collision with
                        the enemy were routed, and this created a panic amongst the light infantry.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The attack would have been pushed
                        even to the foot of the rampart if the pick of the legions had not made the

                        amongst the front ranks, for the enemy, blinded by rage, rushed with mad
                        recklessness upon wounds and death. Then the veterans who came up in
                        support, unshaken by the frantic onset, cut down the front ranks and stayed
                        the advance of those behind. When in their turn they tried to force the
                        enemy back they found that not a man would give ground, they were all
                        resolved to die where they stood. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> On this
                        the Romans extended their lines, which their superiority in numbers enabled
                        them to do easily, until they outflanked the enemy, who fighting in a
                        compact body were killed to a man. </p>

                        bodies flung on to the lighted pile which was again almost extinguished by
                        the streams of blood. And last of all the men themselves, exhausted by the
                        pitiful slaughter of those dear to them, flung themselves arms and all into

                        At first they stood horror-struck at such a fearful sight, then, seeing the

                        heap, the greediness common to human nature impelled them to try and snatch
                        what they could out of the fire. Some were caught by the flames, others were
                        scorched by the heated air, for those in front could not retreat owing to
                        the crowd pressing on behind. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Thus Astapa
                        was destroyed without yielding any plunder to the soldiers. After accepting
                        the surrender of the remaining cities in that district Marcius led his
                        victorious army back to Scipio at New Carthage. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> Just at this time some deserters came from Gades and
                        promised to deliver up the city with its Carthaginian garrison and the

                        partly through the agency of Hanno from the Spanish tribes round. After
                        guarantees of good faith had been given on both sides, Scipio sent Marcius

                        which rumour, however, made still more serious, as each man from the innate
                        love of exaggeration added some fresh detail to what he had already heard.
                        The whole of Spain, especially the remoter parts, was much agitated at the
                        news, and it was easy to judge what an amount of trouble would have been
                        caused by his actual death from seeing what storms arose from the groundless
                        rumour of it. Friendly states did not preserve their fidelity, the army did
                        not remain loyal. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Mandonius and Indibilis
                        had made up their minds, that after the expulsion of the Carthaginians the
                        sovereignty of Spain would pass to them. When they found that their hopes
                        were frustrated they called out their countrymen, the Lacetani, and raised a
                        force amongst the Celtiberians with which they ravaged the country of the
                        Suessitanians and the Sedetanians, who were allies of Rome. A disturbance of
                        a different kind, an act of madness on the part of the Romans themselves,
                        occurred in the camp at Sucro. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> It was held
                        by a force of 8000 men who were stationed there to protect the tribes on
                        this side the Ebro. The vague rumours about their commander's life were not
                        however the primary cause of their movement. A long period of inactivity
                        had, as usual, demoralised them, and they chafed against the restraints of
                        peace after being accustomed to live on the plunder captured from the enemy.
                        At first their discontent was confined to murmurs amongst themselves. "If
                        there is war going on in the province," they said, "what are we doing here
                        amongst a peaceable population? <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> If the war
                        is at an end why are we not taken back to Rome? "Then they demanded their
                        arrears of pay with an insolence quite inconsistent with military discipline
                        or the respect which soldiers should show towards their officers. <milestone
                            n="5" unit="section"/> The men at the outposts insulted the tribunes as
                        they went their rounds of inspection, and some went off during the night to
                        plunder the peaceable inhabitants in the neighbourhood, till at last they
                        used to quit their standards in broad daylight without leave. They did
                        everything just as their caprice and fancy dictated, no attention was paid
                        to rules or discipline or to the orders of their officers. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> One thing alone helped to keep up the outward aspect of
                        a Roman camp and that was the hope which the men entertained that the
                        tribunes would become infected with their madness and take part in their
                        mutiny. In this hope they allowed them to administer justice from their
                        tribunals, they went to them for the watchword and the orders of the day,
                        and relieved guard at the proper intervals. Thus after depriving them of any
                        real authority they kept up the appearance of obedience, whilst they were
                        actually their own commanders. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> When they
                        found that the tribunes censured and reprobated their proceedings and
                        endeavoured to repress them, and openly declared that they would have
                        nothing to do with their insensate folly, they broke out into open mutiny.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> They drove the tribunes from their
                        official seats, and then out of the camp, and amidst universal acclamation
                        placed the supreme command in the hands of the chief ringleaders of the
                        mutiny, two common soldiers whose names were C. Albius of Cales and C.
                        Atrius, an Umbrian. These men were by no means content to wear the insignia
                        of the military tribunes, they had the audacity to affect those of the chief
                        magistrates, the fasces and the axes. It never occurred to them that those
                        symbols which they had carried before them to strike fear into others were
                        impending over their own backs and necks. The false belief that Scipio was
                        dead blinded them; they felt certain that the spread of this report would
                        kindle the flames of war throughout the whole of Spain. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> In the general turmoil they imagined that they would be
                        able to levy contributions on the allies of Rome and plunder the cities
                        round them, and when crime and outrage were being committed everywhere, what
                        they had done would not be noticed in the universal confusion. </p>

                        who started the report, but each in turn kept out of the way, preferring to
                        be thought credulous rather than suspected of inventing such a story.

                        expected that in return for this idle show of power they would draw down

                        intelligence was brought by a party of seven military tribunes, whom Scipio
                        had sent to Sucro. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> At first their presence
                        was strongly resented, but the quiet talks they had with those they happened
                        to know had a calming effect; they visited the soldiers in their tents, and
                        chatted with the groups which gathered round the tribunals or in front of
                        the headquarters tent. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> They made no
                        reference to the treason the soldiers had been guilty of, but only
                        questioned them as to the causes of the sudden outbreak. They were told in
                        reply that the men did not get their pay punctually, nor their due share of
                        credit for the part they had played in the campaign. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> It was by their courage, they asserted, that the Roman
                        name was preserved and the province saved for the republic after the
                        destruction of the two armies and their commanders, at the time when the
                        Iliturgans committed their foul crime. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> And
                        though they had received the just recompense for their treason, no one had
                        been found to reward the Roman soldiers for their meritorious services. </p>
                    <p> In reply to these and similar complaints the tribunes told the men that
                        their requests were reasonable and they would lay them before the general.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> They were glad that these were nothing
                        worse or harder to set right, and the men might rest assured that P. Scipio,
                        after the favour the gods had shown him, and, indeed, the whole State, would
                        show their gratitude. Scipio was experienced in war, but unfamiliar with the
                        storms of internal disturbances. Two things made him anxious, the
                        possibility of the army exceeding all measure in its insubordination, or of
                        his inflicting punishments which would be excessive. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> For the present he decided to go on as he had begun,
                        and handle the matter gently. Collectors were sent among the tributary
                        states so that the soldiers might hope to receive their pay soon. <milestone
                            n="10" unit="section"/> An order was shortly after issued for them to
                        assemble at New Carthage for that purpose; they might go in a body or
                        successively in single detachments as they preferred. The unrest was already
                        dying down when the sudden cessation of hostilities on the part of the
                        revolted Spaniards completely stopped it. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                        When Mandonius and Indibilis heard that Scipio was still alive, they gave up
                        their enterprise and retired within their frontiers, and the mutineers could
                        no longer find any one either amongst their own countrymen or amongst the
                        natives who would associate himself with their mad scheme. <milestone n="12"
                            unit="section"/> After carefully considering every possible plan they
                        saw that the only way of escaping the consequences of their evil counsels,
                        and that not a very hopeful way, was to submit themselves either to the just
                        displeasure of their general or to his clemency, which they were not without
                        hopes of experiencing. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> They argued that
                        he had ever pardoned the enemies of his country after armed conflict,
                        whereas during their mutiny not a wound had been received or a drop of blood
                        shed, it had been free from all cruelty and did not deserve a cruel
                        punishment. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> So ready are men with reasons
                        when they wish to palliate their own misconduct. There was considerable
                        hesitation as to whether they should go to receive their pay separately
                        cohort by cohort. or all together. The latter course seemed the safer and
                        they decided upon it. </p>

                        council of war was being held over them in New Carthage. The members were
                        divided; some thought it sufficient to proceed only against the ringleaders,
                        who did not number more than five-and-thirty; <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> others regarded it as an act of high treason rather
                        than a mutiny and held that such a bad example could only be dealt with by
                        the punishment of the many who were implicated. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> The more merciful view, that punishment should only
                        fall on those with whom the mischief originated, finally prevailed; for the
                        troops generally a severe reprimand was considered sufficient. On the
                        breaking up of the council the army stationed in Carthage was informed that
                        an expedition was to be made against Mandonius and Indibilis, and that
                        rations were to be prepared for several days in advance. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> The object was to make it appear that this was the
                        business for which the council had been held. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> The seven tribunes who had been sent to Sucro to quell
                        the mutiny now returned in advance of the troops, and each handed in the
                        names of five ringleaders. Suitable men had been told off to meet the
                        culprits with smiles and pleasant words, and invite them to their houses,
                        and when they had drunk themselves into a state of stupor place them in
                        fetters. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> When the men were now not far
                        from New Carthage they were informed by people who met them that the whole

                        the Lacetanians. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> This news did not
                        completely dispel the secret fears which haunted their minds, still they
                        were greatly rejoiced to hear it, as they imagined that now that their
                        commander would be alone, they would have him in their power, instead of
                        their being in his. </p>
                    <p> The sun was setting when they entered the city, and they found the other
                        army making all preparations for their march. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> It had been arranged beforehand how they were to be
                        received, they were told that their commander was glad that they had arrived
                        when they did, just before the other army left. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> They then dispersed for food and rest, and the
                        ringleaders were conducted by the men selected for the purpose to their
                        houses, where they were entertained, and where the tribunes arrested and
                        manacled them without any disturbance. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> At
                        the fourth watch the baggage train of the army began to move for its
                        pretended march; at daybreak the standards went forward, but the whole army
                        was halted as soon as it reached the gate, and guards were posted round all
                        the gates to prevent any one from leaving the city. <milestone n="11"
                            unit="section"/> The newly arrived troops were then summoned to an
                        assembly, and they ran into the forum and crowded threateningly round their
                        general's tribunal, expecting to intimidate him by their shouts. <milestone

                        the unarmed crowd. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Now their rebellious
                        spirit was completely cowed, and, as they afterwards admitted, the thing
                        that they were most afraid of was the colour and vigour of their chief whom
                        they expected to see looking weak and ill, and the expression in his face
                        such as they had never witnessed before, not even in the heat of battle.

                        made the following speech: "I never supposed that I should want words in

                        what I am to say to you now, words and ideas alike fail me; I do not even

                        Can I call you soldiers when you have renounced the authority and auspices

                        your designs, your spirit and temper are those of your country's foes. What

                        a single soldier amongst them who had not been brought from Italy, either by
                        his uncle Cnaeus Scipio, who was the first Roman general to come into that

                        still there, but here there were only brigands and brigand chiefs.

                        make their preparations for the next day's departure. Ten days after leaving
                        New Carthage he reached the Ebro, and within four days of his passage of the
                        river he came within view of the enemy. In front of his camp there was a
                        level stretch of ground shut in on either side by mountains. <milestone
                            n="2" unit="section"/> Scipio ordered some cattle taken mostly from the
                        enemy's fields to be driven towards the hostile camp in order to rouse the
                        savagery of the barbarians. Laelius was instructed to remain with his
                        cavalry in concealment behind a projecting mountain spur, and when the light
                        infantry who went to guard the cattle had drawn the enemy into a skirmish he
                        was to charge from his hiding-place. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The
                        battle soon began, the Spaniards on catching sight of the cattle rushed out
                        to secure them, and the skirmishers attacked them while occupied with their
                        plunder. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> At first the two sides harassed
                        one another with missiles, then they discharged light darts, which are more
                        likely to provoke than to decide a battle, and at last they drew their
                        swords. It would have been a steady hand-to-hand fight if the cavalry had
                        not come up. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> They not only made a frontal
                        attack, riding down all in their way, but some galloped round the foot of
                        the mountain so as to cut off the retreat of the enemy. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> There was more slaughter than usually occurs in
                        skirmishes of this kind, and the barbarians were infuriated rather than
                        disheartened at their want of success. </p>
                    <p> In order, therefore, to show that they were not defeated, they marched out
                        to battle the next morning at daybreak. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                        There was not room for them all in the narrow valley, described above; two
                        divisions of their infantry and the whole of their cavalry occupied the
                        plain and the rest of their infantry were posted on the slope of a hill.
                        Scipio saw that the confined space would give him an advantage. Fighting on
                        a narrow front was more adapted to Roman than to Spanish tactics, and as the
                        enemy had brought his line into a position where he could not employ all his
                        strength, Scipio adopted a novel stratagem. <milestone n="8" unit="section"
                        /> As there was no room for him to outflank the enemy with his own cavalry,
                        and as the enemy's cavalry which was massed with the infantry would be
                        useless where it was, he gave Laelius orders to make a detour along the
                        hills, escaping observation as far as possible, and keep the cavalry action
                        distinct from the infantry battle. Scipio led the whole of his infantry
                        against the enemy with a front of four cohorts, as it was impossible to
                        extend further. He did not lose a moment in beginning the fight, for he
                        hoped that in the heat of battle his cavalry might execute their maneuver
                        unnoticed. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Nor were the enemy aware of
                        their movements till they heard the sounds of battle in their rear. So two
                        separate contests were going on through the whole length of the valley, one
                        between the infantry and the other between the cavalry, and the narrow width
                        of the valley prevented the two armies from assisting each other or acting
                        in concert. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The Spanish infantry, who had
                        gone into action trusting to the support of their cavalry, were cut to
                        pieces and the cavalry, unable to stand the attack of the Roman infantry
                        after their own had all fallen, and taken in rear by Laelius and his
                        cavalry, closed up and for a time stood their ground and kept up their
                        resistance, but at last all were killed to a man. Not a single combatant out
                        of the cavalry and infantry which fought in the valley remained alive. The
                        third division which had been standing on the mountain side, looking on in
                        safety instead of participating in the fight, had room and time enough to
                        make good their retreat. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Amongst them
                        were the two chieftains, who escaped in the confusion before the entire army
                        was surrounded. </p>

                        himself on his knees before the victor he put everything down to the fatal

                        only the Ilergetes and Lacetanians but even a Roman army with madness. He
                        declared that he and his brother and the rest of their countrymen were in
                        such a condition that they would, if he thought it right, give back
                            <milestone n="6??" unit="section"/> their lives to the same P. Scipio
                        from whom they had received them, or, if they were spared a second time,
                        they would devote the whole of their lives to the one man to whom they owed
                        them. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Previously they had trusted to the
                        strength of their cause and had not made trial of his clemency, now that
                        their cause was hopeless they put all their trust in their conqueror's
                        mercy. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> It was the traditional practice of
                        the Romans, in the case of a conquered nation with whom no friendly
                        relations had previously existed either through treaty or community of
                        rights and laws, not to accept their submission or allow any terms of peace
                        until all their possessions sacred and profane had been surrendered,
                        hostages given, their arms taken away and garrisons placed in their cities.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> In the present instance however,
                        Scipio, after sternly reprimanding Mandonius and the absent Indibilis at
                        considerable length, said that <milestone n="10??" unit="section"/> their
                        lives were justly forfeited by their crime, but that through his own
                        kindness and that of the Roman people, they would be spared. <milestone
                            n="11" unit="section"/> He would not, however, demand hostages, since
                        these were only a security for those who feared a fresh outbreak of
                        hostilities, nor would he take away their arms, he would leave their minds

                        unoffending hostages but they themselves who would feel the weight of his
                        arm; he would inflict punishment not upon a defenceless but upon an armed
                        foe. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> He would leave it to them whether
                        they preferred the favour or the wrath of Rome; they had experience of both.

                        into Southern Spain, Scipio stayed where he was for a few days until the

                        Masinissa were delayed for various reasons. He wanted in any case to meet
                        Scipio personally and to grasp his hand in confirmation of the league
                        between them, and this was the reason why Scipio undertook at that time such
                        a long and out-of-the-way journey. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                        Masinissa was at Gades, and on being informed by Marcius that Scipio was
                        coming, he represented to Mago that his horses were getting out of condition
                        through being confined in so small an island, and were causing a general
                        scarcity from which all alike suffered, whilst his cavalry were becoming
                        enervated through inaction. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He persuaded
                        the Carthaginian commander to allow him to cross to the mainland for the
                        purpose of plundering the adjacent country. When he had landed he sent three
                        Numidian chieftains to Scipio to fix the time and place of the interview.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Two were to be detained by Scipio as

                        escort. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> From what he had heard of his
                        achievements the Numidian had already conceived a great admiration for the
                        Roman commander and had pictured him in imagination as a man of grand and
                        imposing presence. But when he saw him he felt a deeper veneration for him.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The majesty, natural to Scipio, was
                        heightened by his flowing hair and the simplicity of his general appearance,
                        which was devoid of all adornment and decoration, and in the highest degree
                        manly and soldierly. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> He was at the most
                        vigorous time of life, and his recovery from his recent illness had given

                        youth. </p>
                    <p> Almost speechless with astonishment at this his first meeting with him, the
                        Numidian began by thanking him for having sent his nephew home. <milestone

                        was offered him by the kindness of heaven he would not let it slip.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> He was desirous of rendering such
                        service to Scipio and to Rome that no one of foreign birth might ever be
                        found to have afforded more zealous assistance. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> This had long been his wish, but Spain was a strange
                        and unknown land to him, and he had been unable to carry out his purpose
                        there; it would, however, be easy to do it in the land of his birth, where
                        he had been brought up in the expectation of succeeding to his father's
                        throne. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> If the Romans sent Scipio as

                        would be very short. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Scipio watched him
                        and listened to him with great pleasure. He knew that Masinissa was the
                        master-spirit in all the enemy's cavalry, and the youth's whole bearing
                        showed high courage. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> After they had

                        mixed together, and there was much more noise and tumult than fighting

                        open and the Romans burst out with a cheer; the enemy were thrown into
                        confusion, turned their backs at the very first discharge of missiles and
                        were pursued with heavy loss down to the shore. <milestone n="11"

                        hurry and confusion; the crews drew up the ladders, lest the enemy should
                        clamber on board with their comrades, and cut the cables and hawsers so as
                        not to lose time in weighing anchor. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Many

                        to keep our faith with you to the last, still the kindness which you and
                        your generals have shown to us has made us forget our misery. <milestone
                            n="3" unit="section"/> For us you have undertaken war and for fourteen
                        years have carried it on with such determination that often you have brought
                        yourselves and often reduced the Carthaginians to the last extremities.
                        Though you had in the heart of Italy such a terrible war and such an enemy
                        as Hannibal, you nevertheless sent a consul with his army to Spain to
                        collect, as it were, the remains of our wreckage. From the day that the two
                        Scipios, Publius and C. Cornelius, came into the province they never at any
                        moment failed to do good to us and injury to our enemies. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> First of all, they restored our city to us, and sent

                        and set them free. When our fortunes, from being utterly miserable, had
                        become almost enviable, your two generals Publius and C. Cornelius met with
                        their deaths, a loss which we felt even more bitterly than you. It seemed at
                        the time as though we had been brought back from distant exile to our old
                        home only to see for the second time our own ruin and our country's

                        been quite able to extinguish us. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> And just
                        when we had lost all hope, you suddenly sent P. Scipio, whom we are more
                        fortunate than all our fellow-citizens in seeing here today. We shall carry
                        back to our people the news that we have seen, as your consul-elect, the one

                        throughout Spain, and in every instance he picked out the Saguntines from

                        deadly enemies to us that had their strength remained unimpaired Saguntum
                        must have fallen, even they have been brought so low by his arms that they

                        to Africa. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> In the event of the senate's
                        opposition he asserted openly that he would carry his proposal by the
                        authority of the people. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The project was
                        most distasteful to the leaders of the senate, and as the rest of the
                        senators, afraid of becoming unpopular, refused to speak out, Q. Fabius
                        Maximus was asked for his opinion. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> This he
                        gave in the following speech: "I am quite aware, senators, that many of you
                        regard the question before us today as already decided, and consider that
                        any one who discusses the destination of Africa as though it were still an
                        open question is wasting words. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> I do not
                        quite understand, however, how Africa can have been definitely assigned as
                        the province of our gallant and energetic consul, when neither the senate
                        nor the people have decided that it shall be included amongst the provinces
                        for the year. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> If it has been so assigned
                        then I think the consul is quite wrong in inviting a sham discussion upon a
                        measure that has been decided upon; he is not only stultifying the senate as
                        a body, but each individual senator who is called upon in turn for his
                        opinion. </p>

                        attractive, experience shows that mine are better. The other charge against
                        me will be that I am actuated by motives of malevolence and envy against the

                        against another foe would not be thought to fear rather than to despise him.

                        from here to where Hannibal is and carry the war thither instead of taking a

                        Roman people, left your province and your army without any legal authority,
                        without any instructions from the senate, and entrusted to a couple of ships
                        the fortunes of the State and the majesty of the empire which were for the

                        guard this city and the soil of Italy, and not for consuls to transport to
                        any part of the world they please in the arrogant style of kings and

                        the circumstances under which it was delivered, and backed up by the weight
                        of his character and his long-established reputation for prudence, produced
                        a great effect upon most of those present, especially upon the seniors.
                        Seeing that the majority approved of the sage counsels of age in preference
                        to the impetuous temper of youth, Scipio is reported to have made the
                        following reply: "Senators, at the beginning of his speech, Q. Fabius
                        admitted that what he had to say might lay him under a suspicion of
                        jealousy. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Personally, I should not dare to
                        accuse so great a man of that weakness, but either through the inadequacy of
                        his defence or the impossibility of making a successful one, he has utterly
                        failed to clear himself of the charge. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> For
                        in his anxiety to dispel the suspicion, he spoke about his distinctions and
                        his reputation in such exaggerated terms as to give the impression that I
                        was in danger of finding a rival in the lowest of the Romans, not in him
                        who, because he stands above all others-a position which I frankly confess I
                        am striving to attain, denies the possibility of any rivalry between us.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> He has represented himself as an old
                        man full of honours, and me as a youth not even as old as his son, as if the
                        passion for glory did not extend beyond the span of human life and find its
                        chief satisfaction in the memory of future generations. I am quite certain
                        that it is the lot of all great men to compare themselves not with their
                        contemporaries alone, but also with the illustrious of all ages. <milestone

                        that we would prevent any of our fellow-citizens from reaching our level.

                        misfortune as soon as he landed. He forgets that that very commander,

                        him, and for the first twelve months won some brilliant victories, and as
                        far as the Carthaginian generals were concerned, remained undefeated to the

                        Hannibal, with either the army which had served under L. Veturius, or the
                        one which Q. Caecilius had commanded. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                        These two were to ballot and arrange which of them was to act in Bruttium

                        and provinces had their commands extended for a year. It fell to Q.
                        Caecilius to act with the consul against Hannibal in Bruttium. </p>
                    <p> Scipio exhibited the Games amidst the applause of a large and enthusiastic
                        crowd of spectators. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> M. Pomponius Matho
                        and Q. Catius were sent on a mission to Delphi to carry thither the offering
                        made from the plunder of Hasdrubal's camp. It was a golden crown of 200
                        pounds' weight, and there were facsimiles of the pieces of spoil made in
                        silver weighing in the aggregate 1000 pounds. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> Scipio did not succeed in obtaining permission to levy
                        troops and indeed he did not press the point, but he was allowed to enlist
                        volunteers. As he had stated that his fleet would not be a charge on the
                        State he was given liberty to accept any materials contributed by the allies
                        for the construction of his ships. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The
                        cantons of Etruria were the first to promise assistance, each according to
                        its means. Caere contributed corn and provisions of all kinds for the crews;
                        Populonia, iron; Tarquinii, cloth for the sails; Volaterrae, timber for the
                        hulls and corn; Arretium, 3000 shields and as many helmets, whilst they were
                        ready to supply as many as 50,000 darts, javelins and long spears.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> They also offered to furnish all the
                        axes, spades, sickles, gabions and hand-mills required for forty warships as
                        well as 120,000 pecks of wheat and provision for the sailing-masters and the
                        rowers on the voyage. Perusia, Clusium and Russellae sent pine-wood for the
                        timbers of the ships and a large quantity of corn. The Umbrian communities
                        as well as the inhabitants of Nursia, Reate and Amiternum and the whole of
                        the Sabine country promised to furnish men. <milestone n="12" unit="section"
                        /> Numerous contingents from the Marsi, the Paeligni and the Marrucini
                        volunteered to serve on board the fleet. Camerinum, a city leagued on a
                        basis of equal rights with Rome, sent a cohort of six hundred men-at-arms.
                        The keels of thirty ships-twenty quinqueremes and ten quadriremes-were laid
                        down, and Scipio pressed on the work so rapidly that forty-five days after
                        the timber had been brought from the forests, the ships were launched with
                        their tackle and armament complete. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Scipio sailed to Sicily with 7000
                        volunteers on board his thirty warships, and P. Licinius proceeded to
                        Bruttium. Of the two consular armies stationed there he selected the one
                        which the former consul L. Veturius had commanded. <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> He allowed Metellus to keep the legions he was in
                        command of, as he thought he would do better with men accustomed to his
                        leadership. The praetors also departed for their several provinces.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> As money was needed for the war the
                        quaestors received instructions to sell that part of the Capuan territory
                        which extends from the Fossa Graeca to the coast, and evidence was asked for
                        of any cases where land had been appropriated by a citizen of Capua, that it
                        might be included in the Roman stateland. The informer was to receive a
                        gratuity of ten per cent. of the value of the land. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> The City praetor, Cnaeus Servilius, was also to see
                        that the citizens of Capua were residing where the senate had given them
                        permission to reside, and any who were living elsewhere were to be punished.
                        During the summer Mago who had been wintering in Minorca embarked with a
                        force of 12,000 infantry and 2000 cavalry, and set sail for Italy with about
                        thirty warships and a large number of transports. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> The coast was quite unguarded and he surprised and
                        captured Genua. From there he went on to the Ligurian coast on the chance of
                        rousing the Gauls. One of their tribes-the Ingauni-were at the time engaged
                        in a war with the Epanterii, an Alpine tribe. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> After storing his plunder in Savo and leaving ten
                        vessels as guardships, Mago sent the remainder of his ships to Carthage to
                        protect the coast, as it was rumoured that Scipio intended to invade Africa,
                        and then he formed an alliance with the Ingauni, from whom he expected more
                        support than from the mountaineers, and commenced to attack the latter. His
                        army grew in numbers every day; the Gauls, drawn by the spell of his name,
                        flocked to him from all parts. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The
                        movement became known in Rome through a despatch from Spurius Lucretius, and
                        the senate were filled with the gravest apprehensions. It seemed as though
                        the joy with which they heard of the destruction of Hasdrubal and his army
                        two years before would be completely stultified <milestone n="8??"
                            unit="section"/> by the outbreak of a fresh war in the same quarter,
                        quite as serious as the former one, the only difference being in the
                        commander. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> They sent orders to the
                        proconsul M. Livius to move the army of Etruria up to Ariminum, and the City
                        praetor, Cnaeus Servilius, was empowered, in case he thought it advisable,
                        to order the City legions to be employed elsewhere and give the command to
                        the man whom he thought most capable. M. Valerius Laevinus led these legions
                        to Arretium. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> About this time Cnaeus
                        Octavius who was commanding in Sardinia captured as many as eighty
                        Carthaginian transports in the neighbourhood. According to Coelius' account
                        they were loaded with corn and supplies for Hannibal; Valerius, however,
                        says that they were carrying the plunder from Etruria and the Ligurian and
                        Epanterian prisoners to Carthage. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Hardly
                        anything worth recording took place in Bruttium this year. A pestilence
                        attacked the Romans and the Carthaginians and was equally fatal to both, but
                        in addition to the epidemic, the Carthaginians were suffering from scarcity
                        of food. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Hannibal spent the summer near
                        the temple of Juno Lacinia, where he built and dedicated an altar with a
                        long inscription recording his exploits in Phoenician and also in Greek.
