                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> DURING the consulate of Lucius Genucius and
                    Servius Cornelius, the state enjoyed almost uninterrupted rest from foreign
                    wars. Colonies were led out to Sora and Alba. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    For the latter, situated in the country of the Aequans, six thousand colonists
                    were enrolled. Sora had formerly belonged to the Volscian territory, but had
                    fallen into the possession of the Samnites: thither were sent four thousand
                    settlers. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> This year the freedom of the state
                    was granted to the Arpinians and Trebulans. The Frusinonians were fined a third
                    part of their lands, because it was discovered that the Hernicians had been
                    tampered with by them; and the heads of that conspiracy, after a trial before
                    the consuls, held in pursuance of a decree of the senate, were beaten with rods
                    and beheaded. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> However, that the Romans might
                    not pass the year entirely exempt from war, a little expedition was made into
                    Umbria; intelligence being received from thence, that excursions of men, in
                    arms, had been made, from a certain cave, into the adjacent country. <milestone
                        n="5" unit="section"/> Into this cave the troops penetrated with their
                    standards, and, the place being dark, they received many wounds, chiefly from
                    stones thrown. At length the other mouth of the cave being found, for it was
                    pervious, both the openings were filled up with wood, which being set on fire,
                    there perished by means <pb n="629" xml:id="p.629"/> of the smoke and heat, no
                    less than two thousand men; <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> many of whom, at
                    the last, in attempting to make their way out, rushed into the very flames.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The two Marci, Livius Denter and Aemilius,
                    succeeding to the consulship, war was renewed with the Aequans; who, being
                    highly displeased at the colony established within their territory, as if it
                    were a fortress, having made an attempt, with their whole force, to seize it,
                    were repulsed by the colonists themselves. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    They caused, however, such an alarm at Rome, that, to quell this insurrection,
                    Caius Junius Bubulcus was nominated dictator: for it was scarcely credible that
                    the Aequans, after being reduced to such a degree of weakness, should by
                    themselves alone have ventured to engage in a war. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> The dictator, taking the field, with Marcus Titinius,
                    master of the horse, in the first engagement reduced the Aequans to submission;
                    and returning into the city in triumph, on the eighth day, dedicated, in the
                    character of dictator, the temple of Health, which he had vowed when consul, and
                    contracted for when censor. </p>
                <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> During this year a fleet of Grecians, under
                    the command of Cleonymus, a Lacedaemonian, arrived on the coast of Italy, and
                    took Thuriae, a city in the territory of the Sallentines. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> Against this enemy the consul Aemilius was sent, who, in
                    one battle, completely defeated them, and drove them on board their ships.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Thuriae was then restored to its old
                    inhabitants, and peace re-established in the country of the Sallentines. In some
                    annals, I find that Junius Bubulcus was sent dictator into that country, and
                    that Cleonymus, without hazarding an engagement with the Romans, retired out of
                    Italy. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> He then sailed round the promontory of
                    Brundusium, and, steering down the middle of the Adriatic gulf, because he
                    dreaded, on the left hand, the coasts of Italy destitute of harbours, and, on
                    the right, the Illyrians, Liburnians, and Istrians, nations of savages, and
                    noted in general for piracy, he passed on to the coasts of the Venetians.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Here, having landed a small party to
                    explore the country, and being informed that a narrow beach stretched along the
                    shore, beyond which were marshes, overflowed by the tides; <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> that dry land was seen at no great distance, level in the
                    nearest part, and rising behind into hills, beyond which was the mouth of a very
                    deep river, into which they had seen ships brought round and moored in safety,
                    (this was the river Meduacus,) he ordered his fleet to sail into it and <pb
                        n="630" xml:id="p.630"/> go up against the stream. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> As the channel would not admit the heavy ships, the troops,
                    removing into the lighter vessels, arrived at a part of the country occupied by
                    three maritime cantons of the Patavians, settled on that coast. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> Here they made a descent, leaving a small guard with the
                    ships, made themselves masters of these cantons, set fire to the houses, drove
                    off a considerable booty of men and cattle, and, allured by the sweets of
                    plunder, proceeded still further from the shore. <milestone n="9" unit="section"
                    /> When news of this was brought to Patavium, where the contiguity of the Gauls
                    kept the inhabitants constantly in arms, they divided their young men into two
                    bands, one of which was led towards the quarter where the marauders were said to
                    be busy; the other by a different route, to avoid meeting any of the pirates,
                    towards the station of the ships, fifteen miles distant from the town.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> An attack was made on the small craft,
                    and the guards being killed, the affrighted mariners were obliged to remove
                    their ships to the other bank of the river. By land, also, the attack on the
                    dispersed plunderers was equally successful; and the Grecians, flying back
                    towards their ships, were opposed in their way by the Venetians. <milestone
                        n="11" unit="section"/> Thus they were enclosed on both sides, and cut to
                    pieces; and some, who were made prisoners, gave information that the fleet, with
                    their king, Cleonymus, was but three miles distant. <milestone n="12"
                        unit="section"/> Sending the captives into the nearest canton, to be kept
                    under a guard, some soldiers got on board the flat-bottomed vessels, so
                    constructed for the purpose of passing the shoals with ease; others embarked in
                    those which had been lately taken from the enemy, and proceeding down the river,
                    surrounded their unwieldy ships, which dreaded the unknown sands and flats more
                    than they did the Romans, and which showed a greater eagerness to escape into
                    the deep than to make resistance. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> The
                    soldiers pursued them as far as the mouth of the river; and having taken and
                    burned a part of the fleet, which in the hurry and confusion had been stranded,
                    returned victorious. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Cleonymus, having met
                    success in no part of the Adriatic sea, departed with scarce a fifth part of his
                    navy remaining. Many, now alive, have seen the beaks of his ships, and the
                    spoils of the Lacedaemonians, hanging in the old temple of Juno. <milestone
                        n="15" unit="section"/> In commemoration of this event, there is exhibited
                    at Patavium, every year, on its anniversary day, a naval combat on the river in
                    the middle of the town. <pb n="631" xml:id="p.631"/>
                </p>
                <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> A treaty was this year concluded at Rome with
                    the Vestinians, who solicited friendship. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    Various causes of apprehension afterwards sprung up. News arrived, that Etruria
                    was in rebellion; the insurrection having arisen from the dissensions of the
                    Arretians; for the Cilnian family having grown exorbitantly powerful, a party,
                    out of envy of their wealth, had attempted to expel them by force of arms.
                    [Accounts were also received] that the Marsians held forcible possession of the
                    lands to which the colony of Carseoli, consisting of four thousand men, had been
                    sent. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> By reason, therefore, of these
                    commotions, Marcus Valerius Maximus was nominated dictator, and chose for his
                    master of the horse Marcus Aemilius Paullus. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    This I am inclined to believe, rather than that Quintus Fabius, at such an age
                    as he then was, and after enjoying many honours, was placed in a station
                    subordinate to Valerius: but I think it not unlikely that the mistake arose from
                    the surname Maximus. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The dictator, having set
                    out at the head of an army, in one battle utterly defeated the Marsians, drove
                    them into their fortified towns, and afterwards, in the course of a few days,
                    took Milionia, Plestina, and Fresilia; and then finding Marsians in a part of
                    their lands, granted them a renewal of the treaty. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> The war was then directed against the Etrurians; <milestone
                        n="7" unit="section"/> and when the dictator had gone to Rome, for the
                    purpose of renewing the auspices, the master of the horse, going out to forage,
                    was surrounded by an ambuscade, and obliged to fly shamefully into his camp,
                    after losing several standards and many of his men. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> The occurrence of which discomfiture to Fabius is
                    exceedingly improbable; not only because, if in any particular, certainly, above
                    all, in the qualifications of a commander, he fully merited his surname; but
                    besides, mindful of Papirius's severity, he never could have been tempted to
                    fight, without the dictator's orders. </p>
                <milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The news of this disaster excited at Rome an
                    alarm greater than suited the importance of the affair; <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> for, as if the army had been destroyed, a justitium was
                    proclaimed, guards mounted at the gates, and watches set in every street: and
                    armour and weapons were heaped on the walls. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    All the younger citizens being compelled to enlist, the dictator was ordered to
                    join the army. There he found every thing in a more tranquil state than he
                    expected, and regularity established, <pb n="632" xml:id="p.632"/> through the
                    care of the master of the horse; <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> the camp
                    removed to a place of greater safety; the cohorts, which had lost their
                    standards, left without tents on the outside of the ramparts; <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> and the troops ardently impatient for battle, that their

                    therefore immediately advanced his camp into the territory of Rusella. Thither
                    the enemy also followed; and although, since their late success, they
                    entertained the most sanguine hopes from an open trial of strength, yet they
                    endeavoured to circumvent the enemy by a stratagem which they had before
                    practised with success. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> There were, at a small
                    distance from the Roman camp, the half-ruined houses of a town which had been

                    body of troops being concealed there, some cattle was driven on, within view of
                    a Roman post, commanded by a lieutenant-general, Cneius Fulvius. When no one was
                    induced by this temptation to stir from his post, one of the herdsmen, advancing
                    close to the works, called out, that others were driving out those cattle at
                    their leisure from the ruins of the town, why did they remain idle, when they
                    might safely drive them through the middle of the Roman camp? <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> When this was interpreted to the lieutenant-general, by
                    some natives of Caere, and great impatience prevailed through every company of
                    the soldiers, who, nevertheless, dared not to move without orders, he commanded
                    some who were skilled in the language to observe attentively, whether the
                    dialect of the herdsmen resembled that of rustics or of citizens. <milestone

                        <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The lieutenant-general thought their
                    force too powerful for his small band to cope with. He therefore sent in haste
                    to Valerius for support, and in the mean time, by himself, sustained the enemy's

                    snatched up, and they were with difficulty restrained from running impetuously
                    on; both indignation at their late defeat stimulated them, as well as the shouts

                    and ordered them to march at a slower rate. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> On
                    the other side, the Etrurians, putting themselves in motion, on the first
                    beginning of the fray had come up with their whole force; and several expresses
                    came to the dictator, one after another, that all the legions of the Etrurians
                    had joined in the fight, and that his men could not any longer withstand them:
                    at the same time, he himself saw, from the higher ground, in how perilous a
                    situation the party was. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Confident, however,
                    that the lieutenant-general was able, even yet, to support the contest, and
                    considering that he himself was at hand to rescue him from defeat, he wished to
                    let the enemy be fatigued, as much as might be, in order that, when in that
                    state, he might fall on them with his fresh troops. <milestone n="6"

                    sufficient for the cavalry to begin their career for a charge. The battalions of
                    the legions marched in front, lest the enemy might suspect any secret or sudden
                    movement, but intervals had been left in the ranks of the infantry, affording
                    room for the horses to gallop through. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> At the
                    same instant the line raised the shout, and the cavalry, charging at full speed,
                    poured on the enemy, and spread at once a general panic. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> After this, as succour had arrived, almost too late, to the
                    party surrounded, so now they were allowed entire rest, the fresh troops taking
                    on themselves the whole business of the fight. Nor was that either long or
                    dubious. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The enemy, now routed, fled to their
                    camp, and the Romans advancing to attack it, they give way, and are crowded all
                    together in the remotest part of it. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> In their
                    flight they are obstructed by the narrowness of the gates, the greater number
                    climbed up on the mounds and ramparts, to try if they could either defend
                    themselves with the aid of the advantageous ground, or get over, by any means,
                    and escape. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> One part of the rampart,

                    weight of the multitude who stood on it, and fell into the trench. On which,
                    crying out that the gods had opened that pass to give them safety, they made
                    their way out, most of them leaving their arms behind. <milestone n="12"
                        unit="section"/> By this battle the power of the Etrurians was, a second
                    time, effectually crushed, so that, engaging to furnish a year's pay, and corn
                    for two months, with the dictator's permission, they sent ambassadors to Rome to
                    treat of peace. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> This was refused, but a truce
                    for two years was granted to them. The dictator returned into the city in
                    triumph. I have seen it asserted, that tranquillity was restored in Etruria by
                    the dictator, without any memorable battle, only by composing the dissensions of
                    the Arretians, and effecting a reconciliation between the Cilnian family and the

                    held by an interrex. In one point all agree, that he held the consulship with

                        unit="section"/> Their losses sustained in war, together with the truce,
                    kept the Etrurians quiet. The Samnites, depressed by the misfortunes of many
                    years, had not yet become dissatisfied with their new alliance. At Rome, also,
                    the carrying away of such multitudes to colonies, rendered the commons tranquil,
                    and lightened their burthens. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> But, that things
                    might not be tranquil on all sides, a contention was excited between the
                    principal persons in the commonwealth, patricians on one hand, and plebeians on
                    the other, by the two Ogulnii, Quintus and Cneius, <milestone n="4??"
                        unit="section"/> plebeian tribunes, who, seeking every where occasions of
                    criminating the patricians in the hearing of the people, and having found other
                    attempts fruitless, set on foot a proceeding by which they might inflame, not
                    the lowest class of the commons, but their chief men, the plebeians of consular
                    and triumphal rank, to <milestone n="5??" unit="section"/> the completion of
                    whose honours nothing was now wanting but the offices of the priesthood, which
                    were not yet laid open to them. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> They therefore
                    published a proposal for a law, that, whereas there were then four augurs and
                    four pontiffs, and it had been determined that the number of priests should be
                    augmented, the four additional pontiffs and <pb n="635" xml:id="p.635"/> five
                    augurs should all be chosen out of the commons. <milestone n="7" unit="section"
                    /> How the college of augurs could be reduced to the number of four, except by
                    the death of two, I do not understand: for it is a rule among the augurs, that
                    their number should be composed of threes, so that the three ancient tribes, the
                    Ramnes, Titienses, and Luceres, should have each its own augur; <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> or, in case there should be occasion for more, that each
                    should increase its number of augurs, in equal proportion with the rest, in like
                    manner as when, by the addition of five to four, they made up the number nine,
                    so that there were three to each tribe. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    However, as it was proposed that they should be chosen out of the commons, the
                    patricians were as highly offended at the proceeding, as when they saw the
                    consulship made common; <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> yet they pretended
                    that the business concerned not them so much as it did the gods, who would

                        for their parts, they only wished that no misfortune might ensue to the

                    hope to reach, the higher honours; but already in possession of all those

                        was heard a repetition of the same arguments; that the right of auspices was

                        legally entitled to the supreme command, and the auspices both in peace and

                        been, and will continue to be, equally prosperous in plebeian hands as in
                        patrician. Have ye never heard it said, that the first created patricians
                        were not men sent down from heaven, but such as could cite their fathers,
                        that is, nothing more than free born. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> I

                        never obtain any thing without a refusal. The patricians wish only for a

                    a protest, from which on the day following the tribunes were deterred; and it

                    Publius Decius Mus, the advocate for the law; Publius Sempronius Sophus, Caius

                    However, the Porcian law seems intended, solely, for the security of the persons

                    The Valerian law, after forbidding a person, who had appealed, to be beaten with
                    rods and beheaded, added, in case of any one acting contrary thereto, that it
                    shall yet be only deemed a wicked act. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> This, I
                    suppose, was judged of sufficient strength to enforce obedience to the law in
                    those days; so powerful was then men's sense of shame; at present one would
                    scarcely make use of such a threat seriously. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    The Aequans rebelling, the same consul conducted the war against them; in which
                    no memorable event occurred; for, except ferocity, they retained nothing of
                    their ancient condition. The other consul, Appuleius, invested the town of

                    whereon Narnia now stands, was steep (on one side even perpendicular); this
                    rendered the town impregnable either by assault or works. That business,
                    therefore, came unfinished into the hands of the succeeding consuls, Marcus

                    state; and a large share of the attention of the senate was turned from Etruria

                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Heralds were then sent, to require of the

                    for the purpose by the Samnites, who gave them warning, that <quote>if they

                    Then, having attacked Bovianum, and not long after Aufidena, he took them by

                        body, nor of his mind, remained the same; and he dreaded fortune herself,
                        lest to some god she should seem too bountiful to him, and more constant
                        than the course of human affairs allowed. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>

                        to his glory. There was no scarcity at Rome, either of honours suited to men
                        of the highest merit, or of men of eminent merit suited to the highest

                    <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> The recommendation was deemed well founded,
                    and all the remaining centuries voted Quintus Fabius and Publius Decius consuls.
                    This year, great numbers were prosecuted by the aediles, for having in
                    possession larger quantities of land than the state allowed; and hardly any were

                    his legions towards Samnium through the territory of Sora, and Decius his
                    through that of Sidicinum. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> As soon as they

                        unit="section"/> Accordingly the fact did not escape the notice of the
                    Romans, that the enemy were drawn up in a retired valley, near Tifernum, which,
                    when the Romans entered, they were preparing to attack them from the higher
                    ground. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Fabius, sending away his baggage to a
                    place of safety, and setting a small guard over it, and having given <pb n="645"
                        xml:id="p.645"/> notice to his soldiers that a battle was at hand, advanced
                    in a square body to the hiding-place of the enemy already mentioned. <milestone

                    attack, determined on a regular engagement, as the matter was now likely to come
                    to an open contest. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> They therefore marched out
                    into the plain; and, with a greater share of spirit than of hopes, committed
                    themselves to the disposal of fortune. However, whether in consequence of their
                    having drawn together, from every state, the whole of the force which it
                    possessed, or that the consideration of their all being at stake, heightened
                    their courage, they occasioned, even in open fight, a considerable alarm.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Fabius, when he saw that the enemy in no
                    place gave way, ordered Marcus Fulvius and Marcus Valerius, military tribunes,
                    with whom he hastened to the front, to go to the cavalry, <milestone n="11??"
                        unit="section"/> and to exhort them, that, <quote> if they remembered any
                        instance wherein the public had received advantage from the service of the
                        horsemen, they would, on that day, exert themselves to insure the invincible
                        renown of that body; <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> telling them that
                        the enemy stood immovable against the efforts of the infantry, and the only
                        hope remaining was in the charge of horse. </quote> He addressed
                    particularly both these youths, and with the same cordiality, loading them with
                    praises and promises. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> But considering that,
                    in case that effort should also fail, it would be necessary to accomplish by
                    stratagem what his strength could not effect; <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                    he ordered Scipio, one of his lieutenants-general, to draw off the spearmen of
                    the first legion out of the line; to lead them round as secretly as possible to
                    the nearest mountains; and, by an ascent concealed from view, to gain the
                    heights, and show himself suddenly on the rear of the enemy. <milestone n="15"
                        unit="section"/> The cavalry, led on by the tribunes, rushing forward
                    unexpectedly before the van, caused scarcely more confusion among the enemy than
                    among their friends. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> The line of the Samnites
                    stood firm against the furious onset of the squadrons; it neither could be
                    driven from its ground, nor broken in any part. The cavalry, finding their
                    attempts fruitless, withdrew from the fight, and retired behind the line of
                    infantry. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> On this the enemies' courage
                    increased, so that the Roman troops in the van would not have been able to
                    support the contest, nor the force thus increasing by confidence in itself, had
                    not the second line, by the consul's order, come up into the place of the first.
                        <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> These fresh troops <pb n="646"
                        xml:id="p.646"/> checked the progress of the Samnites, who had now began to
                    gain ground; and, at this seasonable juncture, their comrades appearing suddenly
                    on the mountains, and raising a shout, occasioned in the Samnites a fear of
                    greater danger than really threatened them; <milestone n="19" unit="section"/>
                    Fabius called out aloud that his colleague Decius was approaching; on which all
                    the soldiers, elated with joy, repeated eagerly, that the other consul was come,
                    the legions were arrived! <milestone n="20" unit="section"/> This artifice,
                    useful to the Romans, filled the Samnites with dismay and terror; terrified
                    chiefly lest, fatigued as they were, they should be overpowered by another army
                    fresh and unhurt. <milestone n="21" unit="section"/> As they dispersed
                    themselves in their flight on every side, there was less effusion of blood than
                    might have been expected, considering the completeness of the victory. There
                    were three thousand four hundred slain, about eight hundred and thirty made
                    prisoners, and twenty-three military standards taken. </p>

                    likewise, there was more of flight than of bloodshed. Two thousand of the
                    Apulians were slain; but Decius, despising such an enemy, led his legions into
                    Samnium. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> There the two consular armies,
                    overrunning every part of the country during the space of five months, laid it
                    entirely waste. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> There were in Samnium
                    forty-five places where Decius, and eighty-six where the other consul, encamped.

                    also took the city of Cimetra, where he made prisoners two thousand four hundred
                    soldiers; and there were slain in the assault about four hundred and thirty.
                    Going thence to Rome to preside at the elections, he used all expedition in
                    despatching that business. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> All the
                    first-called centuries voted Quintus Fabius consul. Appius Claudius was a

                        unit="section"/> and as he wished not more ardently for the attainment of
                    that honour for himself, than he did that the patricians might recover the
                    possession of both places in the consulship, he laboured, with all his own
                    power, supported by that of the whole body of the nobility, to prevail on them
                        <pb n="647" xml:id="p.647"/> to appoint him consul along with Quintus

                    first, the same reasons which he had advanced the year before. The nobles then
                    all gathered round his seat, and besought him to raise up the consulship out of
                    the plebeian mire, and to restore both to the office itself, and to the
                    patrician rank, their original dignity. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    Fabius then, procuring silence, allayed their warmth by a qualifying speech,
                    declaring, that <quote> he would have so managed, as to have received the names
                        of two patricians, if he had seen an intention of appointing any other than
                        himself to the consulship. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> As things now
                        stood, he would not set so bad a precedent as to admit his own name among

                    Volumnius, a plebeian, who had likewise been colleagues in that office before,
                    were elected consuls. The nobility reproached Fabius for declining to act in

                    next year also, in the consulate of Lucius Volumnius and Appius Claudius,
                    Publius Decius, who had been left consul in Samnium by his colleague, in the
                    character of proconsul, ceased not to spread devastation through all parts of

                    were backed by such a powerful armed force, and could intermix terror with their

                    early arrival in this particular, that the awe of the Roman name kept in check
                    some states of Etruria which were disposed to war, rather than from any
                    judicious or successful enterprise achieved under the guidance of the consul.

                    the soldiers rely much on their leader, nor the leader on his soldiers. It
                    appears in three several histories, that a letter was sent by the consul to call
                    his colleague from Samnium. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> But I will not
                    affirm what requires stronger proof, as that point was a matter of dispute

                    same office; Appius denying that the letter was sent, and Volumnius affirming
                    that he was called thither by a letter from Appius. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> Volumnius had, by this time, taken three forts in Samnium,
                    in which three thousand of the enemy had been slain, and about half that number
                    made prisoners; and, a sedition having been raised among the Lucanians by the
                    plebeians and the more indigent of the people, he had, to the great satisfaction
                    of the nobles, quelled it by sending thither Quintus Fabius, proconsul, with his
                    own veteran army. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> He left to Decius the
                    ravaging of the enemy's country; and proceeded with his troops into Etruria to

                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Appius, if he did not write the letter,
                    being conscious of this, had, in my opinion, just ground of displeasure; but if
                    he had actually stood in need of assistance, his disowning it, as he did, arose
                    from an illiberal and ungrateful mind. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> For,
                    on going out to receive him, when they had scarcely exchanged salutations, he

                    <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Volumnius answered, that <quote> affairs in

                        compliance with the request in his letter. But, if that were a forged
                        letter, and that there was no occasion for him in Etruria, he would

                    ordered the signal to be sounded, and the standard to be advanced from the camp.
                    It is said that Appius hesitated, perceiving that, whether he fought or remained

                    Appius came up to the enemy, consequently the engagement commenced, their front
                    in the battle being uneven; and by some accidental interchange of their usual
                    opponents, the Etrurians fought against Volumnius; and the Samnites, after
                    delaying some time on account of the absence of their general, against Appius.
                        <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> We are told that Appius, during the heat
                    of the fight, raising his hands toward heaven, so as to be seen in the foremost
                    ranks, prayed thus, <quote>Bellona, if thou grantest us the victory this day, I
                        vow to thee a temple.</quote> And that after this vow, as if inspirited by

                    They therefore routed and put to flight the enemy, who were ill able to

                    then pressing them as they gave ground, and pursuing them closely as they fled,
                    they drove them into their camp. There, by the interposition of Gellius and his
                    Samnite cohorts, the fight was renewed for a little time. <milestone n="21"

                    against one of the gates, Appius, frequently invoking Bellona the victorious,
                    inflamed the courage of his men, they broke in through the rampart and trenches.

                    Roman empire, passed over through the country of the Vescians, into the
                    Campanian and Falernian territories, and committed great depredations.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Volumnius, as he was hastening back to
                    Samnium, by forced marches, because the term for which Fabius and Decius had
                    been continued in command was nearly expired, heard of this army of Samnites,
                    and of the mischief which they had done in Campania; determining, therefore, to
                    afford protection to the allies, he altered his route towards that quarter.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> When he arrived in the district of Cales,
                    he found marks of their recent ravages; and the people of Cales informed him
                    that the enemy carried with them such a quantity of spoil, that they could
                    scarcely observe any order in their march: <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> and
                    that the commanders then directed publicly that the troops should go immediately
                    to Samnium, and having deposited the booty there, that they should return to the
                    business of the expedition, as they must not commit to the hazard of an
                    engagement an army so heavily laden. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    Notwithstanding that this account carried every appearance of truth, he yet
                    thought it necessary to obtain more certain information; <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> accordingly he despatched some horsemen, to seize on some
                    of the straggling marauders; from these he learned, on inquiry, that the enemy
                    lay at the river Vulturnus; that they intended to remove thence at the third
                    watch; and that their route was towards Samnium. <milestone n="7" unit="section"

                    his approach could not be discovered by his being too near them, and, at the
                    same time, that he might surprise them, as they should be coming out of their
                    camp. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> A long time before day, he drew nigh to
                    their post, and sent persons, who understood the Oscan language, to discover how
                    they were employed: these, mixing with the enemy, which they could easily do
                    during the confusion in the night, found that the standards had gone out thinly
                    attended; that the booty, and those appointed to guard it, were then setting
                    out, a contemptible train; <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> each busied about
                    his own affairs, without any concert with the rest, or much regard to orders.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> This was judged the fittest time for the
                    attack, and day-light was now approaching; he gave orders to sound the charge,
                    and fell on the enemy as they were marching out. The Samnites being embarrassed
                    with the spoil, and very few armed, some quickened their pace, and drove the
                    prey before them; others halted, deliberating whether it would be safer to
                    advance, or to return again to the camp; and while they hesitated, they were
                    overtaken and cut off. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The Romans had by this
                    time passed over the rampart, and filled the camp with slaughter and confusion:
                    the Samnite army, in addition to the disorder caused by the enemy, had their
                    disorder increased by a sudden insurrection of their prisoners; <milestone
                        n="12" unit="section"/> some of whom, getting loose, set the rest at
                    liberty, while others snatched the arms which were tied up among the baggage,
                    and being intermixed with the troops, raised a tumult more terrible than the
                    battle itself. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> They then performed a
                    memorable exploit: for making an attack on Statius Minacius, the general, as he
                    was passing between the ranks and encouraging his men; then, dispersing the
                    horsemen who attended him, they gathered round himself; and dragged him, sitting
                    on his horse, a prisoner to the Roman consul. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                    By this movement the foremost battalions of the Samnites were brought back, and
                    the battle, which seemed to have been already decided, was renewed: but they
                    could not support it long. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> Six thousand of
                    them were slain, and two thousand five hundred taken, among whom were four
                    military tribunes, together with thirty standards, and, what gave the conquerors
                    greater joy than all, seven thousand four hundred prisoners were recovered. The
                    spoil which had been taken from the allies was immense, and the owners were
                    summoned <pb n="655" xml:id="p.655"/> by a proclamation, to claim and receive
                    their property. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> On the day appointed, all the
                    effects, the owners of which did not appear, were given to the soldiers, who
                    were obliged to sell them, in order that they might have nothing to think of but
                    their duty. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The depredations, committed on the lands of

                        unit="section"/> and it happened, that about the same time intelligence was
                    brought from Etruria, that, after the departure of Volumnius's army, all that
                    country had risen up in arms; and that Gellius Egnatius, the leader of the
                    Samnites, was causing the Umbrians to join in the insurrection, and tempting the
                    Gauls with high offers. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Terrified at this
                    news, the senate ordered the courts of justice to be shut, and a levy to be made
                    of men of every description. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Accordingly not
                    only free-born men and the younger sort were obliged to enlist, but cohorts were
                    formed of the elder citizens, and the sons of freed-men were incorporated in the
                    centuries. Plans were formed for the defence of the city, and the praetor,
                    Publius Sempronius, was invested with the chief command. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> However, the senate was exonerated of one half of their
                    anxiety, by a letter from the consul, Lucius Volumnius, informing them that the
                    army, which had ravaged Campania, had been defeated and dispersed: whereupon,
                    they decreed a public thanksgiving for this success, in the name of the consul.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The courts were opened, after having been

                    for the future security of the country depopulated by the Samnites; and, with
                    this view, it was resolved, that two colonies should be settled on the frontiers
                    of the Vescian and Falernian territories; <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> one
                    at the mouth of the river Liris, which has received the name of Minturnae; the

                    is said, stood Sinope, a city of Grecians, called thenceforth by the Roman
                    colonists Sinuessa. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The plebeian tribunes were
                    charged to procure an order of the commons, commanding Publius Sempronius, the
                    praetor, to create triumvirs for conducting the colonies to those places.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> But persons were not readily found to
                    give in their names; because they considered that they were being sent into what
                    was almost a perpetual advanced guard in a hostile country, not as a provision
                        <pb n="656" xml:id="p.656"/> of land. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    From these employments, the attention of the senate was drawn away by the
                    Etrurian war, growing now more formidable; and by frequent letters from Appius,
                    warning them not to neglect the disturbances in that quarter. <milestone n="12"
                        unit="section"/> That four nations were uniting their arms, the Etrurians,

                        there, in conjunction with his colleague, the war was too weighty to be

                        that it was now reported, that the Umbrians had since that time joined them,

                        four nations. For his own part, were he not confident that the Roman people
                        would concur in appointing to the consulship the man who was allowed, beyond
                        dispute, to be the first commander at present in the world, he would have

                    be chosen by universal consent; and accordingly, the prerogative, and all the

                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The speech of Fabius was to the same
                    purpose as it had been two years before; but afterwards, when he yielded to the
                    general wish, he applied himself to procure Decius to be appointed his

                        his mind could hardly conform itself to a new associate in command; and he
                        could more easily act in concert with a temper to which he had been

                    that Fabius should have Etruria for his province, without casting lots, and the
                    plebeians insisting that Decius should bring the matter to the decision of lots.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> There was certainly a contention in the
                    senate, and the interest of Fabius being superior there, the business was
                    brought before the people. Here, between military men who laid greater stress on
                    deeds than on words, the debate was short. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    Fabius said, <quote> that it was unreasonable, after he had planted a tree,
                        another should gather the fruit of it. He had opened the Ciminian forest,
                        and made a way for the Roman arms, through passes until then impracticable.
                        Why had they disturbed him, at that time of his life, if they intended to
                        give the management of the war to another? </quote>
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Then, in the way of a gentle reproof, he
                    observed, that <quote> instead of an associate in command, he had chosen an

                        honours; <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> and since merit, by its own
                        intrinsic power, had prevailed so far, as that it should not, in any rank of

                        All the consuls before him had disposed of the provinces by lots; now, the

                        mark of honour, the merits of Fabius were so great towards the commonwealth,
                        and towards <milestone n="12??" unit="section"/> himself in particular, that
                        he would gladly second the advancement of his reputation, provided only its

                        who did not see, that, when a war of difficulty and danger, and out of the
                        ordinary course, was committed to only that one consul, the other would be
                        considered as useless and insignificant. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                        Fabius gloried in his exploits performed in Etruria: Publius Decius wished

                        utterly extinguish that fire, which the other left smother- ed, in such a

                        That whether these directed the whole of their combined force against him

                    consuls set out for the campaign. Now, before the consuls arrived in Etruria,
                    the Senonian Gauls came in a vast body to Clusium, to attack the Roman legion

                    enemy, who had ascended on the other side. The legion was consequently attacked
                    on the rear, and surrounded in the middle, when the enemy pressed it on all

                    came within sight, carrying the heads of the slain, some hanging before their

                    Others affirm, that the defeat was by Umbrians, not Gauls, and that the loss
                    sustained was not so great. That a party of foragers, under Lucius Manlius
                    Torquatus, lieutenant-general, being surrounded, Scipio, the proprietor, brought
                    up relief from the camp, and the battle being renewed, that the Umbrians, lately

                    there at the distance of about four miles. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    Several <pb n="664" xml:id="p.664"/> councils were then held by the enemy, and
                    their plan of oper- ations was thus settled: that they should not encamp
                    together, nor go out together to battle; the Gauls were united to the Samnites,
                    the Umbrians to the Etrurians. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The day of
                    battle was fixed. The part of maintaining the fight was committed to the
                    Samnites and Gauls; and the Etrurians and Umbrians were ordered to attack the
                    Roman camp during the heat of the engagement. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    This plan was frustrated by three Clusian deserters, who came over by night to
                    Fabius, and after disclosing the above designs, were sent back with presents, in
                    order that they might discover, and bring intelligence of, any new scheme which
                    should be determined on. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The consuls then
                    wrote to Flavius and Postumius to move their armies, the one from the Faliscian,
                    the other from the Vatican country, towards Clusium; and to ruin the enemy's
                    territory by every means in their power. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The
                    news of these depredations drew the Etrurians from Sentinum to protect their own
                    region. The consuls, in their absence, practised every means to bring on an
                    engagement. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> For two days they endeavoured, by
                    several attacks, to provoke the enemy to fight; in which time, however, nothing
                    worth mention was performed. A few fell on each side, but still the minds [of
                    the Romans] were irritated to wish for a general engagement; yet nothing
                    decisive was hazarded. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> On the third day, both

                    in order of battle, a hind, chased by a wolf from the mountains, ran through the
                    plain between the two lines: there the animals taking different directions, the
                    hind bent its course towards the Gauls, the wolf towards the Romans: way was
                    made between the ranks for the wolf, the Gauls slew the hind with their

                    were the more likely to be worsted. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Decius,
                    more impetuous, as being in the prime of life and full flow of spirits, exerted
                    whatever force he had to the utmost in the first encounter; and thinking the
                    infantry not sufficiently energetic, brought up the cavalry to the fight.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Putting himself at the head of a troop of

                    At the second charge, when they advanced farther and were briskly engaged in the

                    thrown into dismay. A number of the enemy, mounted on chariots and cars, made

                    By this means the victorious cavalry were dispersed, through a panic, and men
                    and horses, in their headlong flight, were tumbled promiscuously on the ground.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Hence also the battalions of the legions

                    succeeded in the consulship by Lucius Postumius Megellus and Marcus Atilius
                    Regulus. The province of Samnium was decreed to both in conjunction; because
                    intelligence had been received that the enemy had embodied three armies;
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> with one that Etruria was to be recovered;
                    with another the ravages in Campania were to be repeated; and the third was

                    Sickness detained Postumius at Rome, but Atilius set out immediately, with
                    design to surprise the enemy in Samnium, before they should have advanced beyond
                    their own borders; for such had been the directions of the senate. <milestone
                        n="4" unit="section"/> The Romans met the enemy, as if by mutual
                    appointment, at a spot where, while they could be hindered, not only from
                    ravaging, but even from entering the Samnite territory, they could likewise
                    hinder the Samnites from continuing their progress into the countries which were
                    quiet, and the lands of the allies of the Roman people. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> While their camps lay opposite to each other, the Samnites
                    attempted an enterprise, which the Romans, so often their conquerors, would
                    scarcely have ventured to undertake; such is the rashness inspired by extreme
                    despair: this was to make an assault on the Roman camp. And although this
                    attempt, so daring, succeeded not in its full extent, yet it was not without
                    effect. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> There was a fog, which continued
                    through a great part of the day, so thick as to exclude the light of the sun,
                    and to prevent not only the view of any thing beyond the rampart, but scarcely
                    the sight of each other, when they should meet. <milestone n="7" unit="section"
                    /> Depending on this, as a covering to the design, when the sun was scarcely yet
                    risen, and the light which he did afford was obscured by the fog, the Samnites
                    came up to an advanced guard of the Romans at one of the gates, who were
                    standing carelessly on their post. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> In the
                    sudden surprise, these had neither courage nor strength to make resistance: an
                    assault was then made, through the Decuman gate, in the rear of the camp:
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> the quaestor's quarters in consequence
                    were taken, and the quaestor, Lucius Opimius Pansa, was there slain; on this a

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The consul, being roused by the tumult,
                    ordered two cohorts of the allies, a Lucanian and Suessanian, which happened to
                    be nearest, to defend the head-quarters, and led the companies of the legions
                    down the principal street. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> These ran into the
                    ranks, scarcely taking time to furnish themselves with arms; and, as they
                    distinguished the enemy by their shout rather than by sight, could form no
                    judgment how great their number might be: thus, ignorant of the circumstances of
                    their situation, they at first drew back, and admitted the enemy into the heart
                    of the camp. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Then when the consul cried out,
                    asking them, whether they intended to let themselves be beaten out beyond the
                    rampart, and then to return again to storm their own camp, they raised the
                    shout, and uniting their efforts, stood their ground; <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> then made advances, pushed closely on the enemy, and having
                    forced them to give way, drove them back, without suffering their first terror
                    to abate. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> They soon beat them out beyond the
                    gate and the rampart, but not daring to pursue them, because the darkness of the
                    weather made them apprehend an ambush, and content with having cleared the camp,
                    they retired within the rampart, having killed about three hundred of the enemy.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Of the Romans, including the first
                    advanced guard and the watchmen, and those who were surprised at the quaestor's
                    quarters, two hundred and thirty perished. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    This not unsuccessful piece of boldness raised the spirits of the Samnites so
                    high, that they not only did not suffer the Romans to march forward into their
                    country, but even to procure forage from their lands; and the foragers were
                    obliged to go back into the quiet country of Sora. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> News of these events being conveyed to Rome, with
                    circumstances of alarm magnified beyond the truth, obliged Lucius Postumius, the
                    consul, though scarcely recovered from his illness, to set out for the army.
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> However, before his departure, having
                    issued a proclamation that his troops should assemble at Sora, he dedicated the

                    aedile, out of the money arising from fines; and, joining the army, he advanced
                    from Sora towards Samnium, to the camp of his colleague. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> The Samnites, despairing of being able to make head against
                    the two armies, retreated from thence, on which the consuls, separating,
                    proceeded by different routes to lay waste the enemy's lands and besiege their

                    the city from the fourth hour until near the eighth, the result being a long

                    through the opposite gate, with all their effects which could be either carried
                    or driven. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The consul, on his arrival,
                    approached the walls with the same order and circumspection, as if he were to
                    meet an opposition here equal to what he had experienced at Milionia. <milestone
                        n="6" unit="section"/> Then, perceiving a dead silence in the city, and
                    neither arms nor men on the towers and ramparts, he restrains the soldiers, who
                    were eager to mount the deserted fortifications, lest they might fall into a
                    snare. He ordered two divisions of the confederate Latin horse to ride round the
                    walls, and explore every particular. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> These
                    horsemen observed one gate, and, at a little distance, another on the same side,
                    standing wide open, and on the roads leading from these every mark of the enemy
                    having fled by night. They then rode up leisurely to the gates, from whence,
                    with perfect safety, they took a clear view through straight streets quite
                    across the city. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> They report to the consul,
                    that the city was abandoned by the enemy, as was plain from the solitude, the

                    hearing this, the consul led round the army to that side of the city which had
                    been examined, and making the troops halt at a little distance from the gate,
                    gave orders that five horsemen should ride into the city; and when they should
                    have advanced a good way into it, then, if they saw all things safe, three
                    should remain there, and the other two return to him with intelligence.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> These returned and said, that they had

                    that nothing but silence and solitude reigned through the whole extent of it.
                    The consul immediately led some light-armed cohorts into the city; ordering the

                    border of the Lucerian territory. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Rage
                    supplied them, on this occasion, with strength to equal his: the battle was
                    stubbornly contested, and the victory doubtful; in the issue, however, more
                    calamitous on the side of the Romans, both because they were unaccustomed to
                    defeat, and that, on leaving the field, they felt more sensibly, than during the
                    heat of the action, how much more wounds and bloodshed had been on their side.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> In consequence of this, such dismay spread
                    through the camp, as, had it seized them during the engagement, a signal defeat
                    would have been the result. Even as the matter stood, they spent the night in
                    great anxiety; expecting, every instant, that the Samnites would assault the
                    camp; or that, at the first light, they should be obliged to stand a battle with

                    Neither party had any inclination to fight, and they would have separated, and

                    harassed, in retreat, by the other. Notwithstanding this shyness and reluctance,
                    an engagement unavoidably began, but spiritless, and with a shout which

                    infuse life into the action, ordered a few troops of cavalry to advance out of

                    put in disorder, several parties ran forward, both from the Samnite line, to cut
                    off those who had fallen, and from the Roman, to protect their friends.

                    only his own brave spirit, but fortune likewise aided the consul, for the
                    Samnites did not push their advantage; so that he had time to wheel round his

                    up towards heaven, and raising his voice so as to be heard at a distance, vowed
                    a temple to Jupiter Stator, if the Roman army should rally from flight, and,

                    restore the fight; officers, soldiers, the whole force, both of cavalry and
                    infantry; even the powers of heaven seemed to have looked, with favour, on the
                    Roman cause; so speedily was a thorough change effected in the fortune of the
                    day, the enemy being repulsed from the camp, and, in a short time, driven back
                    to the spot where the battle had commenced. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                    Here they stopped, being obstructed by the heap of baggage, lying in their way,
                    where they had thrown it together; and then, to prevent the plundering of their
                    effects, formed round them a circle of troops. <milestone n="14" unit="section"
                    /> On this, the infantry assailed them vigorously in front, while the cavalry,
                    wheeling, fell on their rear: and, being thus enclosed between the two, they
                    were all either slain, or taken prisoners. The number of the prisoners was seven
                    thousand two hundred, who were all sent under the yoke; the killed amounted to
                    four thousand eight hundred. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> The victory did
                    not prove a joyous one, even on the side of the Romans: when the consul took an

                    lost, was seven thousand three hundred. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>
                    During these transactions in Apulia, the Samnites with the other army having

                    and afterwards, on their marching out to protect their country, gained a
                    decisive victory over them, at a small distance from their own walls. Two
                    thousand two hundred of the Etrurians were slain; the proximity of their city

                    a peace, effected that year in Etruria, was still more important and honourable

                    between the plebeian tribunes; some of them declaring that they would protest

                    accounts regarding this year are by no means consistent; Claudius asserts, that
                    Postumius, after having taken several cities in Samnium, was defeated and put to

                    was vowed, the same vow having been formerly made by Romulus, but the fane only,
                    that is, the area appropriated for the temple, had been yet consecrated.
                        <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> However, in this year, the state having

                    with hurdles and boards, and covered over-head with linen cloth, the sides being

                    affirmed, that he took these ceremonials from the ancient ritual of the
                    Samnites, being the same which their ancestors used, when they <milestone

                    singly. Besides the other exhibitions of the solemnity, calculated to impress
                    the mind with religious awe, there were, in the middle of the covered enclosure,
                    altars erected, about which lay the victims slain, and the centurions stood

                    was led up to the altars, rather like a victim, than a performer in the
                    ceremony, and was bound by an oath not to divulge what he should see and hear in
                    that place. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> He was then compelled to swear,
                    in a dreadful kind of form, containing execrations on his own person, on his

                    should lead; and, if either he himself fled from the field, or, in case he
                    should see any other flying, did not immediately kill him. <milestone n="11"

                    have filled up the number of sixteen thousand. This body, from the covering of
                    the enclosure wherein the nobility had been thus devoted, was called the linen

                    with particular severity, arrived, Carvilius at Cominium, and Papirius at
                    Aquilonia, where the main force of the Samnites were posted. Here, for some

                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The day was generally spent in provoking
                    the enemy when quiet, and retiring when they offered resistance; in menacing,
                    rather than making an attack. By which practice of beginning, and then
                    desisting, even those trifling skirmishes were continually left without a

                    miles distant, and the advice of his absent colleague was appealed to on every

                    of his attention to Aquilonia, where the state of affairs was more <pb n="682"

                    on sending off the messenger, had instantly called an assembly, where he
                    descanted, at large, on the nature of the war in general, and <milestone

                    happened to receive intelligence from a deserter, that twenty cohorts of
                    Samnites, consisting of about four hundred each, had marched towards Cominium.
                    Lest his colleague should be ignorant of this, he instantly despatched a

                    consul's nephew, that there was a doubt about the auspices. The youth, born in
                    an age when that sort of learning which inculcates contempt of the gods was yet

                    the chickens in the front of the line. The Samnites likewise brought forward

                    of him, cawed with a clear voice; at which augury, the consul being rejoiced,
                    and affirming, that never had the gods interposed in a more striking manner in

                    proportioned to the number of men, the servants of the camp, mounted on the
                    mules, trailing boughs of trees, full of leaves, along the ground. <milestone
                        n="6" unit="section"/> Through the light thus obscured, arms and standards
                    were seen in front; behind, a higher and denser cloud of dust presented the
                    appearance of horsemen bringing up the rear. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    This effectually deceived, not only the Samnites, but the Romans themselves: and
                    the consul confirmed the mistake, by calling out among the foremost battalions,
                    so that his voice reached also the enemy, that <quote>Cominium was taken; and
                        that his victorious colleague was approaching;</quote> bidding his men
                        <quote> now make haste to complete the defeat of the enemy, before the glory

                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> This he said as he sat on horseback, and then
                    ordered the tribunes and centurions to open passages for the horse. He had given
                    previous directions to Trebonius and Caedicius, that, when they should see him
                    waving the point of his spear aloft, they should incite the cavalry to charge
                    the enemy with all possible violence. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Every
                    particular, as previously concerted, was executed with the utmost exactness. The
                    passages were opened between the ranks, the cavalry darted through, and, with
                    the points of their spears presented, rushed into the midst of the enemy's
                    battalions, breaking down the ranks wherever they charged. Volumnius and Scipio
                    seconded the blow, and taking advantage of the enemy's disorder, made a terrible
                    slaughter. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Thus attacked, the cohorts, called

                    cavalry directed their flight to Bovianum. The horse were pursued by the Roman
                    horse, the infantry by their infantry, while the wings proceeded by different
                    roads; the right, to the camp of the Samnites; the left, to the city. <milestone
                        n="12" unit="section"/> Volumnius succeeded first in gaining possession of
                    the camp. At the city, Scipio met a stouter resistance; not because the
                    conquered troops there had gained courage, but because walls were a better
                    defence against armed men than a rampart. From these they repelled the enemy
                    with stones. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Scipio, considering that unless
                    the business were effected during their first panic, and before they could
                    recover their spirits, the attack of so strong a town would be very tedious,
                    asked his soldiers <quote> if they could endure, without shame, that the other
                        wing should already have taken the camp, and that they, after all their

                    determination to the contrary, he himself advanced, the foremost, to the gate,
                    with his shield raised over his head: the rest, following under the like cover
                    of their shields conjoined, burst into the city, and dispersing the Samnites who
                    were near the gate, took possession of the walls, but they ventured not to push
                    forward into the interior of the city in consequence of the smallness of their

                    owing to his natural temper or to his confidence of success. <milestone n="7"

                    not suffer himself to be diverted from the war by the dispute about the

                    temples to the immortal gods, he vowed to Jupiter the victorious, that if he
                    should defeat the legions of the enemy, he would, before he tasted of any
                    generous liquor, make a libation to him of a cup of wine and honey. This kind of
                    vow proved acceptable to the gods, and they conducted the auspices to a

                        unit="section"/> Just as he was giving the signal, the alarming message from
                    his colleague, touching the march of the twenty Samnite cohorts, not only caused
                    him to delay the assault, but obliged him to call off a part of his troops, when
                    they were formed and ready to begin the attack. <milestone n="3" unit="section"
                    /> He ordered Decius Brutus Scaeva, a lieutenant-general, with the first legion,

                    assailants on the works, had possessed courage enough to oppose their approaches
                    to the city, yet now, when the action was no longer carried on at a distance,

                    Such was the course of events at Cominium, such at Aquilonia. In the middle
                    space between the two cities, where a third battle had been expected, the enemy
                    were not found; for, when they were within seven miles of Cominium, they were

                    being descried by the cavalry; who having gone in pursuit of the Samnites, that
                    left the town in the night, saw the multitude unprotected either by a rampart or

                    when the houses were cleared, set them on fire. <milestone n="2" unit="section"
                    /> Thus, on the same day, Aquilonia and Cominium were both reduced to ashes. The

                    withdrawing the army out of Samnium, the expediency was considered, as to

                        unit="section"/> It was concluded, that the lower the strength of the
                    Samnites was reduced, the greater perseverance and vigour ought to be used in
                    prosecuting the war, so that Samnium might be given up to the succeeding consuls
                    perfectly subjected. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> As there was now no army
                    of the enemy which could be supposed capable of disputing the field, there
                    remained one mode of operations, the besieging of the cities; by the destruction
                    of which, they might be enabled to enrich their soldiers with the spoil; and, at
                    the same time, utterly to destroy the enemy, reduced to the necessity of

                    the whole force of the Romans, employed against them, had made use of that

                    because they had refused to revolt from the Romans; and they besought the

                    greater loss on his side than on that of the enemy; but afterwards, encamping on
                    the spot, he shut them up within their works. The town was besieged and taken.
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> In these three towns were taken or slain
                    ten thousand men, of whom the prisoners composed somewhat the <pb n="691"
                        xml:id="p.691"/> greater part. On the consuls casting lots for the
                    provinces, Etruria fell to Carvilius, to the great satisfaction of the soldiers,
                    who could no longer bear the intensity of the cold in Samnium. <milestone n="12"
                        unit="section"/> Papirius was opposed at Saepinum with a more powerful
                    force: he had to fight often in pitched battles, often on a march, and often
                    under the walls of the city, against the eruptions of the enemy; and could
                    neither besiege, nor engage them on equal terms; for the Samnites not only
                    protected themselves by walls, but likewise protected their walls with numbers
                    of men and arms. At length, after a great deal of fighting, he forced them to
                    submit to a regular siege. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> This he carried on
                    with vigour, and made himself master of the city by means of his works, and by
                    storm. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> The rage of the soldiers on this
                    occasion caused the greatest slaughter in the taking of the town; seven thousand
                    four hundred fell by the sword; the number of the prisoners did not amount to
                    three thousand. The spoil, of which the quantity was very great, the whole
                    substance of the Samnites being collected in a few cities, was given up to the
                    soldiers. </p>

                        unit="section"/> While he was on his way to Rome, a triumph was decreed him
                    with universal consent; and accordingly he triumphed while in office, and with

                    magnificence and beauty, with those taken by his father, which were well known,
                    from being frequently exhibited as ornaments of the public places. Several
                    prisoners of distinction, renowned for their own exploits and those of their
                    ancestors, were led in the cavalcade. There were carried in the train two

                    </note> This money was said to be produced by the sale of the prisoners. Of

                    and brass were lodged in the treasury, no share of this part of the spoil being
                    given to the soldiers. The ill humour in the commons was further exasperated,
                    because the tax for the payment of the army was collected by contribution;
                    whereas, said they, if the vain parade of conveying the produce of the spoil to
                    the treasury had been disregarded, donations <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    might have been made to the soldiers out of the spoil, and the pay of the army
                    also supplied out of that fund. The temple of Quirinus, vowed by his father when
                    dictator, (for that he himself had vowed it in the heat of battle, I do not find
                    in any ancient writer, nor indeed could he in <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>

                    consul, dedicated and adorned with military spoils. And of <milestone n="9??"
                        unit="section"/> these, so great was the abundance, that not only that
                    temple and the forum were decorated with them, <milestone n="10" unit="section"
                    /> but some were also distributed among the allies and colonies in the
                    neighbourhood, to serve as ornaments to their temples and public places.
                    Immediately after his triumph, he led his army into winter quarters in the
                    territory of Vescia; because that country was harassed by the Samnites.
                    Meanwhile, <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> in Etruria, the consul Carvilius
                    having set about laying siege to Troilium, suffered four hundred and seventy of
                    the richest inhabitants to depart; they <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> had
                    paid a large sum of money for permission to leave the place: the town, with the
                    remaining multitude, he took by storm. He afterwards reduced, by force, five
                    forts strongly situated, wherein were slain two thousand four hundred of the
                    enemy, and not quite two thousand made prisoners. To the Faliscians, who sued
                    for peace, he granted <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> a truce for a year, on
                    condition of their furnishing a hundred thousand <hi rend="italics">asses</hi>

                    This business completed, he returned home to a triumph, which, though it was
                    less illustrious than that of his colleague, in respect of his share in the
                    defeat of the Samnites, was yet raised to an equality with it, by <milestone

                    He carried into the treasury three hundred and ninety thousand <hi

                    before the people, Postumius; who, on a prosecution being commenced against him
                    by Marcus Scantius, plebeian tribune, evaded, as was said, the jurisdiction of
                    the people, by procuring the commission of lieutenant-general, so the indictment
                    against him could only be held out as a threat, and not put in force. <milestone
                        n="2" unit="section"/> The year having now elapsed, new plebeian tribunes
                    had come into office; and for these, in consequence of some irregularity in
                    their appointments, others had been, within five days after, substituted in
                    their room. The lustrum was closed this year by the censors Publius Cornelius
                    Arvina and Caius Marcius Rutilus. The number of citizens rated was two hundred
                    and sixty-two thousand three hundred and twenty-two. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> These were the twenty-sixth pair of censors since the first
                    institution of that office; and this the nineteenth lustrum. In this year,
                    persons who had been presented with crowns, in consideration of meritorious
                    behaviour in war, first began to wear them at the exhibition of the Roman games.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Then, for the first time, palms were
                    conferred on the victors according to a custom introduced from Greece. In the
                    same year the paving of the road from the temple of Mars to Bovillae was
                    completed by the curule aediles, who exhibited those games out of fines levied
                    on the farmers of the pastures. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Lucius
                    Papirius presided at the consular election, and returned consuls Quintus Fabius
                    Gurges, son of Maximus, and Decius Junius Brutus Scaeva. Papirius himself was
                    made praetor. This year, prosperous in many particulars, was scarcely sufficient
                    to afford consolation for one calamity, a pestilence, which afflicted both the
                    city and country: the mortality was prodigious. <milestone n="6" unit="section"
                    /> To discover what end, or what remedy, was appointed by the gods for that
                    calamity, the books were consulted: in the books it was found that Aesculapius
                    must be brought to Rome from Epidaurus. Nor were any steps taken that year in
                    that matter, because the consuls were fully occupied in the war, except that a
                    supplication was performed to Aesculapius for one day. </p>
