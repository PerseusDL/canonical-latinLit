                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> In the opening months of the year in which
                        the above events occurred several unimportant engagements took place in
                        Spain between Sextus Digitius, the praetor, and the numerous cantons which
                        after the departure of M. Cato had recommenced hostilities. <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> These were on the whole so costly to the Romans that
                        the force which the praetor handed over to his successor was hardly half
                        what he had received. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> There would
                        undoubtedly have been a general rising throughout Spain had not the other
                        praetor, P. Cornelius Scipio, fought several successful actions beyond the
                        Ebro and so cowed the natives that no less than fifty towns went over to
                        him. This was whilst he was praetor. As pro-praetor he inflicted a severe
                        defeat on the Lusitanians. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> They had
                        devastated Further Spain and were on <milestone n="5??" unit="section"/>
                        their way home with an immense quantity of plunder when he attacked them on
                        the march and fought from the third hour of the day to the eighth without
                        arriving at any decision. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> He was inferior
                        in numbers, but in everything else he had the advantage, for he was with
                        close and serried ranks attacking a long column hampered by many herds of
                        cattle, and his soldiers were fresh while the enemy were wearied with their
                        long march. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> They had started in the third
                        hour of the night on a march which was prolonged through three hours of
                        daylight and they were forced to accept battle without taking any rest.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> So it was only in the first stage of
                        the battle that they showed any spirit or energy. At first they threw the
                        Romans into some disorder, but soon the fighting became even. In the crisis
                        of the struggle the praetor vowed that he would celebrate Games to Jupiter
                        if he should rout and destroy the enemy. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                        At length the Roman attack became more insistent and the Lusitanians began
                        to give ground. Finally they broke and fled, and in the hot pursuit which
                        followed as many as 12,000 of the enemy were killed, 540 prisoners taken,
                        nearly all mounted troops, and 134 standards captured. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> The losses in the Roman army amounted to 73. The scene
                        of the action was not far from the city of Ilipa, and P. Cornelius led his
                        victorious army, enriched with spoil, to that place. <milestone n="11"
                            unit="section"/> The whole of the booty was laid out in front of the
                        city and the owners were allowed to claim their property. <milestone n="12"
                            unit="section"/> The rest was made over to the quaestor to be sold and
                        the proceeds distributed to the soldiers. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> C. Flaminius had not left Rome when these
                        things happened in Spain. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Naturally he and
                        his friends talked much more about the defeats than about the successes, and
                        as a widespread war had broken out in his province and he was going to take
                        over from Sex. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Digitius a miserable
                        remnant of an army, and that utterly demoralised, he had tried to induce the
                        senate to assign to him one of the City legions. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> From this and from the force which the senate had
                        empowered him to raise he could select 6200 infantry and 300 cavalry, and
                        with that legion-for there was not much to be expected from Digitius'
                        army-he said he could manage very well. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                        The senior members of the House said that their decisions must not depend
                        upon rumours started <milestone n="6??" unit="section"/> by private
                        individuals in the interest of particular magistrates, and that no
                        importance should be attached to anything but the despatches of the praetors
                        from their provinces or the reports which their officers brought home.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> If there was a sudden rising in Spain
                        they considered that emergency troops ought to be promptly raised by the
                        praetor outside Italy. What they had in their minds was that these troops
                        should be raised in Spain. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Valerius Antias
                        asserts that C. Flaminius went to Sicily to enlist men, and that whilst on
                        his way from there to Spain he was carried by a storm to Africa, where he
                        administered the military oath to soldiers who had belonged to the
                            <milestone n="9??" unit="section"/> army of P. Africanus. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> In Italy, too, the Ligurian war was
                        growing more serious. Pisae was now surrounded by 40,000 men, and their
                        numbers were being swelled daily by crowds who were attracted by the love of
                        fighting and the hope of plunder. Minucius arrived in Arretium on the day
                        which he had appointed for the assembling of his soldiers. <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> From there he marched in close order to Pisae, and
                        though the enemy had moved their camp across the river to a position not
                        more than a mile distant from the place, he succeeded in entering the city,
                        which his arrival undoubtedly saved. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The
                        day following he, too, crossed the river and fixed his camp about half a
                        mile distant from that of the enemy. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> From
                        this position he sent out skirmishers, and so protected the land of the
                        friendly tribes from depredation. As his troops were new levies, drawn from
                        various classes and not yet sufficiently acquainted with each other to feel
                        mutual confidence, he did not venture to challenge a regular engagement.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The Ligurians, relying on their
                        numbers, marched out and offered battle, prepared for a decisive conflict,
                        and even detached bodies to go in all directions beyond their frontiers to
                        secure plunder. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> When they had collected a
                        vast quantity of cattle and other booty an armed escort was ready to take it
                        to their forts and villages. </p>

                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="4" type="chapter">
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> As the Ligurian operations were confined
                        to Pisae the other consul led his army through the furthest limits of
                        Liguria into the country of the Boii. Here totally different tactics were
                        pursued; it was the consul who offered battle and the enemy who declined it.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> As they met with no opposition the
                        Romans dispersed on plundering forays, the Boii preferring to let their
                        property be carried off with impunity rather than risk a battle in its
                        defence. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> After the whole country had been
                        laid waste with fire and sword the consul left the enemy's territory and
                        marched in the direction of Mutina, taking as little precaution against
                        attack as though he were in a friendly country. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> When the Boii found that their enemy had withdrawn from
                        their frontiers, they followed noiselessly, looking out for a suitable place
                        for a surprise attack. Passing by the Roman camp in the night, they seized a
                        pass through which the Romans would have to go. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> This movement did not escape observation, and the
                        consul, who had been in the habit of marching in the dead of the night,
                        decided to wait for daylight so that the dangers incident to a tumultuary
                        battle might not be augmented by darkness. Though it was quite light when he
                        started, he sent on a squadron of cavalry to reconnoitre. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> On receiving their report as to the strength and
                        position of the enemy he ordered the whole of the baggage to be collected
                        together, and the triarii were told off to surround it with a breastwork.
                        With the rest of his army in battle formation he advanced against the enemy.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The Gauls did the same when they found
                        that their stratagem was exposed and that they would have to fight an open
                        and regular battle. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The action began about eight o'clock. The
                        left wing of the allied cavalry and the "special" corps were fighting in the
                        front line, and two generals of consular rank-M. Marcellus and Tiberius
                        Sempronius; the latter had been consul the previous year-were in command of
                        them. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The consul Merula was at one moment
                        at the front and at another holding back the legions who were in reserve,
                        lest in their eagerness they should go forward before the signal was given.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Two military tribunes, Q. Minucius and
                        P. Minucius, received orders to take the cavalry of these two legions
                        outside the line and when the signal was given to deliver an attack from the
                        open. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Whilst the consul was making these
                        dispositions a message came from Ti. Sempronius Longus informing him that
                        the special corps were not able <milestone n="5??" unit="section"/> to
                        withstand the onslaught of the Gauls, a great many had been killed, and the
                        survivors, wearied out and dispirited, had lost all heart for fighting. He
                        asked the consul, therefore, if he approved, to send up one of the legions
                        before they were humiliated by defeat. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The
                        second legion was sent up and the special corps was withdrawn. The battle
                        was now restored, as the legion came up with its men fresh and its maniples
                        complete. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> As the left division was
                        withdrawn from the fighting the right came up into the front line. The hot
                        sun was blazing down on the Gauls, who were incapable of standing the heat;
                        nevertheless they sustained the attacks of the Roman army in mass formation,
                        leaning against each other or on their shields. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> On perceiving this the consul ordered C. Livius
                        Salinator, the allied cavalry leader, to send his men at a hard gallop
                        against them, and the cavalry of the legions to act as supports. <milestone
                            n="9" unit="section"/> This hurricane of cavalry confused, disordered,
                        and finally broke up the Gaulish lines, but they did not turn to flee.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Their officers began to stop any
                        attempt at flight by striking the waverers with their spears and forcing
                        them back into their ranks, but the cavalry, riding in amongst them, did not
                        allow them to do this. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The consul urged
                        his men on; only a little more effort was needed, he said; victory was
                        within their grasp, they saw how disordered and demoralised the enemy were,
                        and they must press the attack. If they allowed them to re-form their ranks,
                        the battle would begin all over again with doubtful result. <milestone
                            n="12" unit="section"/> He ordered the standard-bearers to advance, and
                        with one united effort they at last forced the enemy to give way. When once
                        the Gauls were scattered in flight the cavalry of the legions was sent in
                        pursuit. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Fourteen thousand of the Boii
                        were killed in that day's fighting, 1902 taken prisoners, as well as 721 of
                        their cavalry, including three officers; 212 standards were also captured
                        and 63 military wagons. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Nor was the
                        victory a bloodless one for the Romans; they and the allied contingents
                        together lost over 5000 men, including 23 centurions, four praefects of
                        allies and three military tribunes in the second legion-M. Genucius, Q.

                        Minucius, at Pisae, stated that the conduct of the elections had fallen to
                        his lot, but the whole position in Liguria was so uncertain that it was
                        impossible for him to leave without bringing ruin on the friendly tribes and
                        injury to the interests of the republic. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                        He suggested that if the senate thought proper they should send word to his
                        colleague, who had practically brought the war in Gaul to a close,
                        requesting him to return to Rome for the elections. <milestone n="4"

                        part of his allotted duties, he was ready to do whatever the senate decided
                        upon. But he begged them to give long and careful consideration to the
                        question whether it would be more in the interest of the State that an
                        interrex should be appointed than that he should leave his province in such
                        a condition. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The senate instructed C.
                        Scribonius to send two commissioners of senatorial rank to L. Cornelius to

                        which had hardly begun. The commissioners brought back word that L.
                        Cornelius would come to Rome for the election of the new magistrates.

                        majority of the senators stating that it was the good fortune of Rome and
                        the valour of the soldiers that they had to thank for any success that had
                        been gained. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> All the consul had done was
                        to lose a large number of his men and let the enemy slip out of his hands
                        when he had the chance of annihilating them. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> His losses were mainly due to the delay in bringing up
                        the reserves to relieve the first line, who were being overpowered. The
                        enemy were able to escape because he was too late in giving the order to the

                        pressing question to be dealt with. The citizens were suffering from
                        money-lenders, and though numerous laws had been made in restraint of
                        avarice they were evaded through the fraudulent transferring of the bills to
                        subjects of the allied States who were not bound by these laws. In this way
                        debtors were being overwhelmed by unlimited interest. <milestone n="3"

                        make a return of the amounts so lent, and the debtor was to be at liberty to

                        the plebs, was authorised by the senate to propose a measure, which the
                        plebs adopted, providing that debts contracted with members of the Latin and

                        Q. Metellus, who had filled the offices of consul and dictator, said that

                        that it might take place when the writers of these letters were present.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> He had been expecting, therefore, that
                        the consul, who knew that his lieutenant had made statements reflecting on

                        army ought really to have been handed over to Tiberius Sempronius, who had
                        the imperium, and not to a staff officer. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        It seemed now as if the man had been purposely kept out of the way who could

                        himself with military glory. But it was the brothers of the two candidates
                        who most of all made the contest such an exciting one, for they were the two
                        most brilliant commanders of their day. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                        Scipio had the more splendid reputation, but its very splendour exposed him
                        all the more to jealousy; Quinctius' reputation was of more recent growth,
                        as his triumph had been celebrated during the year. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> Moreover, the former had been continually before the
                        public eye for nearly ten years, a circumstance which tends to diminish the
                        reverence felt for great men as people become surfeited with their praises.
                        He had been made consul for the second time after his final defeat of
                        Hannibal, and also censor. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> In the case of
                        Quinctius, all his claims to popular favour were founded upon his recent
                        successes; since his triumph he had not sought for nor received anything
                        from the people. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> He said that he was
                        canvassing for his own brother, not for a step-brother; for one who had as
                        lieutenant shared with him the management of the war; whilst he commanded on
                        land his brother commanded at sea. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> By
                        these arguments he succeeded in beating his competitor, though his
                        competitor was supported by his brother Africanus, by the house of the
                        Cornelii-it was a Cornelius who was conducting the election-and by the
                        splendid testimonial which the senate gave when they pronounced Africanus to
                        be the best man among all the citizens and most worthy to receive the Mater
                        Idaea on her arrival from Pessinus. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> L.
                        Quinctius and Cneius Domitius Ahenobarbus were the two elected, so that even
                        in the case of the plebeian candidate C. Laelius, Scipio, who had been
                        working for him, was unable to secure his return. <milestone n="11"
                            unit="section"/> The next day the praetors were elected. The successful

                        Serranus, M. Baebius Tamphilus, L. Valerius Tappo and Q. Salonius Sarra. M.
                        Aemilius Lepidus and L. Aemilius Paulus distinguished themselves as aediles
                        this year. They inflicted fines on a large number of graziers, and out of
                        the proceeds they had gold-plated shields made, which they placed on the
                        pediment of the temple of Jupiter. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> They
                        also built an arcade outside the Porta Trigemina, and in connection with it
                        a wharf on the Tiber, and a second arcade leading from the Porta Fontinalis
                        to the altar of Mars in the Campus Martius. </p>

                        difficulty, and when, not long after, the Roman army was marching through a

                            unit="section"/> As the exit was blocked the consul decided to go back
                        and countermarched his men. But the entrance behind them had been also
                        occupied by a portion of the enemy forces, and the disaster of Candium not
                        only occurred to the minds of the soldiers but almost presented itself
                        before their eyes. Amongst his auxiliary troops the consul had about 800
                        Numidian horse. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Their commander assured
                        the consul that he would break through on whichever side he chose if only he
                        could tell him in which direction lay the most numerous villages, as he
                        would attack them and instantly fire the houses so that <milestone n="5??"
                            unit="section"/> the alarm thus created might compel the Ligurians to
                        leave their position in the pass and help their countrymen. The consul
                        highly approved of his plan and promised to reward him richly. <milestone

                        ride towards the enemy's outposts without showing any aggressiveness.
                        Nothing could at first sight look more contemptible than the appearance they
                        presented; horses and men were alike thin and diminutive; <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> the riders were without body armour and, except for the
                        javelins they carried, unarmed; the horses had no bridles and their pacing
                        was most ungainly, trotting as they did with head and neck stuck straight
                        out. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The contempt which they aroused they
                        did their best to increase; they fell from their horses and presented a
                        ridiculous spectacle. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Consequently the men
                        at the outposts who had at first been on the alert, prepared to meet an
                        attack, now laid their arms aside and sat down to watch the show. The
                        Numidians rode forward and then galloped back, but always got a little
                        nearer <milestone n="10??" unit="section"/> to the mouth of the pass, as
                        though they were carried forward by their horses which they were incapable

                        had evacuated Greece they expected that Antiochus would take possession of

                        placed, for after a victory which was won through them, they, of all the
                        States and cities in Greece, had been shown the least consideration.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> He advised that envoys should be sent
                        to each of the three kings to find out their intentions and to urge such

                            unit="section"/> Democritus was sent to Nabis, Nicander to Philip, and
                        Dicaearchus, the brother of Thoas, to Antiochus. Democritus pointed out to
                        the tyrant that by the loss of his maritime cities the very sinews of his
                        power were cut; <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> it was from them that he
                        drew his soldiers, his ships and his crews. <milestone n="8" unit="section"
                        /> Little more than a prisoner within his own walls, he saw the Achaeans
                        fording it over the Peloponnese; he would never have another opportunity of
                        winning back his dominion if he let this one go by; there was no Roman army
                        in Greece, and they would never think it worth their while to send their
                        legions back again for the sake of Gytheum and the other Laconian cities on
                        the coast. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Such were the arguments used to
                        influence the tyrant, so that when Antiochus landed in Greece the
                        consciousness of having broken his amity with Rome through his ill-treatment
                        of her allies might force him to join arms with the Syrian monarch. </p>
                    <p> Nicander took much the same line in his interview with Philip. <milestone
                            n="10" unit="section"/> He spoke with all the greater force because the
                        king had been brought down from a loftier position than the tyrant and had
                        lost more of his power. He reminded the king of the former prestige of
                        Macedonia and the world-wide victories of his nation. <milestone n="11"
                            unit="section"/> Nicander assured him that the policy recommended was a
                        safe one both in its initiation and its execution. On the one hand he was
                        not asking Philip to take any action before Antiochus was in Greece with his
                        army, on the other there was every prospect of final success. <milestone

                        Aetolians, who were at the time a more formidable enemy than the Romans? He
                        also spoke about Hannibal as a foe to Rome from his birth, who had slain
                        more of her generals and soldiers than still survived. <milestone n="14"

                        advanced by Dicaearchus in his interview with Antiochus were different.
                            <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> The spoils of war, he said, won from
                        Philip belonged to the Romans, but the victory over him to the Aetolians;
                        they and they alone had granted the Romans an entrance into Greece and
                        provided them with the strength which secured victory. <milestone n="16"
                            unit="section"/> He went on to enumerate the amount of infantry and
                        cavalry which they were prepared to furnish to Antiochus, the localities
                        which would be available for his land army and the harbours which could
                        receive his fleet. Then, as Philip and Nabis were not present to check him,
                        he falsely <milestone n="17??" unit="section"/> represented them as prepared
                        for immediate hostilities and ready to seize the very first opportunity of
                        recovering what they had lost in war. In this way the Aetolians tried to
                        stir up war against Rome throughout the world. </p>

                        warn him against disturbing the peace which he had so ardently sought for.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> They also sent succours to Gytheum,
                        which the tyrant was already attacking, and sent a report to Rome of what

                        went to Raphia in Phenicia to be present at the marriage of his daughter to

                        marched with the whole of his land army against the Pisidians in the

                        engaged the Roman commissioners, P. Sulpicius and P. Villius, who, as I have

                        visit Eumenes first, and after landing at Elea they went up to Pergamum,

                        Eumenes welcomed the prospect of a war with Antiochus, for he felt certain
                        that if a monarch so much more powerful than himself were left in peace he
                        would prove a troublesome neighbour, and if there was war Antiochus would be
                        no more a match for the Romans than Philip had been, and would either be
                        altogether got rid of or so completely defeated as to submit to terms of
                        peace. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> In this case much taken from

                            unit="section"/> Even at the worst, Eumenes thought it better to meet

                        that Publius Scipio Africanus was one of the commissioners, and that he had
                        conversations with Hannibal. One of these he reports. Africanus asked
                        Hannibal whom he considered to be the greatest commander, and the reply was,
                        "Alexander of Macedon, <milestone n="6??" unit="section"/> for with a small
                        force he routed innumerable armies and traversed the most distant shores of

                        /> Africanus then asked him whom he would put second, and Hannibal replied,
                        "Pyrrhus; <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> he was the first who taught how
                        to lay out a camp, and moreover no one ever showed more cleverness in the

                            unit="section"/> He possessed, too, the art of winning popularity to
                        such an extent that the nations of Italy preferred the rule of a foreign
                        king to that of the Roman people who had so long held the foremost place in
                        that country." On Scipio's again asking him whom he regarded as the third,
                        Hannibal, without any hesitation, replied, "Myself." <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> Scipio smiled and asked, "What would you say if you had
                        vanquished me?" <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> "In that case," replied
                        Hannibal, "I should say that I surpassed Alexander and Pyrrhus, and all
                        other commanders in the world." Scipio was delighted with the turn which the
                        speaker had with true Carthaginian adroitness given to his answer, and the
                        unexpected flattery it conveyed, <milestone n="12??" unit="section"/>
                        because Hannibal had set him apart from the ordinary run of military
                        captains as an incomparable commander. </p>

                        intelligence received of the death of the king's son, who, as already

                        great mourning in the court, and the young man's loss was deeply regretted.
                        He had already given proof of such qualities that it was certain, if his
                        life had been spared, he would have shown himself a great and just monarch.
                        The more universally he had made himself beloved, the stronger the

                        /> The king, it was said, looked upon the heir-apparent as a menace to his
                        old age, and so had him taken off by poison through the agency of certain
                        eunuchs, a class of men whose services kings are glad to employ in crimes of

                        attributed to the king strengthened this suspicion, for as he had given
                        Lysimachia to his son Seleucus he had no similar residence to which he could
                        remove Antiochus under presence of conferring an honour upon him. <milestone

                        signs of mourning for several days, and the Roman commissioner, not wishing
                        to be in the way at such an unseasonable time, withdrew to Pergamum.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The king abandoned the war which he
                        had begun and returned to Ephesus. There, with his palace closed on account
                        of the mourning, he held secret counsels with his favourite courtier, a man
                        called Minnio. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Minnio, utterly ignorant of
                        the outside world and measuring the king's power by his campaigns in Syria
                        and Asia, was fully convinced that Antiochus would prove no less superior to
                        the Romans in war than he was in the justice of his cause, as the demands of
                        the Romans were unjustifiable. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> As the king
                        avoided all further discussion with the commissioners, either because he
                        found that nothing was to be gained from them or owing to the depression due
                        to his recent bereavement, Minnio said that he would act as spokesman on the
                        king's behalf, and induced Antiochus to invite the commissioners up from

                        correspond to your words; you lay down one law for Antiochus, and another
                        for yourselves. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> For how are the

                        year by year a quaestor with full powers of life and death to Syracuse and
                        the other Greek cities of Sicily? The only reason that you could give would,
                        of course, be that you imposed these terms upon them after subjugating them
                        by force. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Then accept the same reason from
                        Antiochus in the case of Smyrna and Lampsacus and the cities of Ionia and
                        Aeolis. They were conquered by his ancestors and made to pay tribute and
                        taxes, and he claims the rights which have come down to him from ancient
                        times. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> I should be glad, therefore, if you
                        would answer him on these points, if, that is, you are prepared to discuss
                        them fairly, and are not simply seeking a pretext for war." </p>

                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Sulpicius replied: "If these are the only
                        arguments that can be advanced in support of his case, Antiochus has shown a
                        discreet modesty in letting them be brought forward by anybody rather than
                        by himself. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> For what possible resemblance
                        can there be between the circumstances of the two groups of cities which you
                        have mentioned? From the day when Regium, Tarentum, and Neapolis passed into
                        our hands we have demanded the fulfilment of their treaty obligations by an
                        unbroken tenor of right which has always been asserted and never

                        cities of Asia, and that after once becoming subject to the ancestors of
                        Antiochus they have remained in the uninterrupted possession of your

                            unit="section"/> Several were brought in, and as they each stated their

                        these were fair or not, they changed the discussion into a heated
                        altercation. Unable either to make or to obtain any concessions, the
                        commissioners resumed to Rome leaving everything as unsettled as when they
                        came. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> On their departure the king held a

                        "They tried to impose on Antiochus, the greatest monarch in Asia, as though

                        Nabis they allowed to remain as sovereign over his own country and to retain

                            n="7" unit="section"/> Others argued that those cities were for so great
                        a monarch slight and insignificant grounds of war, but unjust demands always
                        began with small matters, unless indeed they were to suppose that when the
                        Persians demanded earth and water from the Lacedaemonians they were actually
                        in need of a clod of earth and a draught of water. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> A similar attempt was now being made by the Romans in
                        respect of these two cities, and as soon as others saw that these had shaken
                        off the yoke they too would go over to the people who posed as liberators.

                        preferable to servitude, everyone, whatever his present condition may be,

                        the wealthier and more magnificent court of Antiochus. As he was thoroughly
                        familiar with the state of affairs in Greece and possessed some knowledge of
                        the Roman character he had come to be on such intimate terms with Antiochus

                        conducted, he said that he looked forward to certain victory if the king
                        would cross over into Europe and fix the seat of war in some part of Greece.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> He would first of all find the

                        recover Argos and the maritime cities from which the Romans had expelled him
                        and shut him up within his own walls. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> In
                        Macedonia Philip would take up arms the moment he heard the war-trumpet
                        sound; he knew his spirit, he knew his temper, he knew that he had been
                        revolving in his mind vast schemes of revenge, chafing like wild beasts that

                        not lose an hour in recommencing war. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Only
                        there must be no delay, no holding back, for victory depended upon their

                        in your favour by aspersing me, let them seek some other ground for

                        hesitation felt. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Some of the leaders
                        adhered to their opinion, others thought that after consulting T. Quinctius
                        they ought to act on his advice. The great majority, however, waited to hear
                        what line Philopoemen would take. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> He was
                        at the time their chief magistrate, and surpassed all his contemporaries in
                        sound common sense and force of character. He began by commending the wisdom
                        of the regulation which the Achaeans had adopted forbidding their chief
                        magistrate to express his own view when the discussion turned on war.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> He then urged them to come to a speedy
                        decision as to what they wanted; their chief magistrate would carry out
                        their decision faithfully and carefully, and as far as human wisdom could
                        avail would do his utmost to prevent their regretting it whether it were in
                        favour of peace or war. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> This speech did
                        more to incite them to war than if he had betrayed his desire for it by open
                        advocacy. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The council passed a unanimous
                        vote in favour of hostilities, but left the date and conduct of operations
                        absolutely to the chief magistrate. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                        Philopoemen himself was of the opinion which Quinctius had already
                        expressed, that they ought to wait for the Roman fleet which could protect
                        Gytheum by sea, but he was afraid that <milestone n="12??" unit="section"/>
                        the position did not admit of delay and that not only Gytheum but also the
                        force sent to defend it might be lost. Accordingly, he ordered the Achaean
                        vessels to put to sea. </p>

                        possession of a rock which overhung a mountain torrent, so that he might
                        have a water supply. Here he collected the camp-followers and the whole of

                        camp, whilst the rest of the army went off in pursuit of the enemy.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The route they had taken was such that

                        got through with great difficulty, but now, when the rearmost ranks were
                        being assailed and cries of terror penetrated to the head of the column, it

                        falling with their heads towards the enemy, formed a kind of stockade across
                        the road. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Philopoemen ordered the
                        auxiliaries to press the pursuit as much as possible, since flight would be

                            unit="section"/> They came in at the first watch with the news that the

                        army were without arms, scattered in the forest. He told them to take food
                        and rest. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The rest of the army, having
                        come earlier into camp, had already done so and were now refreshed after a
                        short sleep. Selecting some of their number and telling them to take nothing
                        but their swords, he posted them on two of the roads which led from the
                        city, one to Pharae and the other to Barnosthenes, as he expected that the
                        fugitives would return by these roads. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                        His expectation was justified, for the Lacedaemonians as long as daylight

                        they kept out of sight on hidden paths. After they had got past it, and
                        thought all was safe, they came out into the open road. <milestone n="11"

                        that hardly a quarter of their whole army escaped. Now that Philopoemen had
                        shut the tyrant up in his city he spent nearly a month in devastating the
                        Lacedaemonian fields, and after thus weakening and almost shattering the

                        Athens was the first place they visited, from there they proceeded to

                        on to Demetrias, where a council of the Magnetes was assembled. Here they
                        had to be careful as to what they said, for some of the leading men were in
                        opposition to Rome and gave wholehearted support to Antiochus and the
                        Aetolians. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Their attitude was due to the
                        fact that when it was learnt that Philip's son, who had been detained as a
                        hostage, was released and the tribute imposed upon him remitted, it was
                        stated, amongst other false rumours, that the Romans intended to restore

                        that happen Eurylochus, the president of the Magnetes, and some of his party
                        were anxious that the arrival of Antiochus and the Aetolians should bring
                        about a complete change of policy. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> In
                        meeting this hostile spirit the Roman envoys had to be on their guard lest
                        while removing this groundless suspicion they should so far destroy
                            <milestone n="8??" unit="section"/> Philip's hopes as to make an enemy
                        of a man who was for every reason of more importance to them than the

                        themselves to pointing out that the whole of Greece was under obligations to
                        Rome for the boon of liberty, Magnesia so especially. Not only had a
                        Macedonian garrison been stationed there, but Philip had built a palace
                        there so that they were forced to have their lord and master always before
                        their eyes. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> But all that Rome had done
                        for them would be useless if the Aetolians brought Antiochus into that
                        palace and they had to have a new unknown king in place of one whom they had
                        known and had experience of. </p>

                        "Magnetarch," and Eurylochus was holding that office at the time. Feeling
                        secure in the power which his office gave him, he said that he and the
                        Magnetes could not be silent about the report which was widely current that
                        Demetrias was to be given back to Philip. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                        To prevent this the Magnetes were prepared to make every effort and face

                        he threw out the ill-advised remark that even then Demetrias was only free
                        in appearance, in reality everything was at the nod and beck of Rome. These
                        words were received with murmurs and protests; some in the assembly
                        approved, but others were filled with indignation at his having dared to
                        speak in that way. As for Quinctius, he was so angry that he lifted up his
                        hands towards heaven and called upon the gods to witness the ingratitude and
                        perfidy of the Magnetes. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> This exclamation
                        created universal alarm and Zeno, one of their leading men, who had gained
                        great influence amongst them, partly by the refinement which characterised
                        his private life and partly because he had always been a staunch friend to
                        Rome, implored Quinctius and other envoys not to make the whole city
                        responsible for one man's madness; it was at his own risk that anyone
                        behaved like a madman. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> The Magnetes were
                        indebted to Titus Quinctius and the Roman people for more than their
                        liberty-for everything, in fact, which men hold dear and sacred; there was
                        nothing which a man could ask the gods to give him that they had not
                        received from them. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> They would sooner lay

                        They declared that a great host of infantry and cavalry were on their way,
                        elephants had been brought from India and-what they thought would most of

                        effect this sort of talk would have on the council, for their arrival and
                        all their proceedings were duly reported to the Roman envoy. <milestone

                        Quinctius thought it might not be altogether useless if some representatives
                        of the friendly cities attended the council who would have the courage to
                        speak frankly in reply to the king's envoy and remind the Aetolians of their
                        treaty engagements with Rome. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The
                        Athenians seemed best fitted for the task on account of the prestige which
                        their city enjoyed and also because of their old alliance with the
                        Aetolians. Quinctius therefore requested them to send delegates to the

                        the best thing for all the peoples of Greece and Asia would have been for
                        Antiochus to have intervened whilst Philip's power was still unimpaired,

                        only you resolutely carry out the designs you have formed, he will be able
                        with the help of the gods and the assistance of the Aetolians to restore the

                        for his official position, told him that a more pressing matter demanded his

                        themselves and simply waiting for his arrival; consequently they did not

                        everywhere understood that the leading men and the aristocracy in the

                        a project alike audacious and impudent, namely the occupation of Demetrias,
                        Chalcis and Lacedaemon. One of their leaders was sent to each of these
                        cities: Thoas went to Chalcis, Alexamenus to Lacedaemon, Diocles to

                        did he see any prospect of returning home. He wrote to his friends and

                        children dressed in mourning and carrying suppliant emblems into the
                        assembly, which was crowded. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> They appealed
                        to those present individually and implored the assembly as a whole not to
                        allow a man innocent and uncondemned to waste his life in exile. The simple
                        and unsuspecting were moved by pity, the evil-minded and seditious by the
                        prospect of profiting by the confusion which the Aetolian agitation would

                        preparatory step having been taken, Diocles, who was at that time in command

                        cavalry who were coming up from being shut out, he took Eurylochus, holding
                            <milestone n="11??" unit="section"/> him by the hand, through the heart

                        and speared his horse. The tyrant was flung off, and whilst he lay on the

                        The general, shutting himself up in the palace, spent a whole day and night

                        wished to appear as the liberators. The indignation this aroused and a
                        feeling of contempt for the scanty number of Aetolians gave the
                        Lacedaemonians courage to unite together. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                        Some advised that the Aetolians should be driven out and the liberty

                        secure. Others thought that one of the royal blood should be chosen as the
                        ostensible head of the movement. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> There was
                        a scion of the old royal house called Laconicus who had been brought up with

                        slew the Aetolians who were strolling about the city. Then they forced their

                            unit="section"/> It so happened that the annual festival of Diana of
                        Amarynthis was being held at the time in Eretria, and this festival was
                        attended not only by the natives but also by the people of Carystus.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> A deputation was sent from Chalcis to
                        beg the Eretrians and the Carystians to take compassion on those who were
                        born in the same island as themselves, to remember their alliance with Rome,
                        and not to allow Chalcis to pass into the hands of the Aetolians. <milestone
                            n="5" unit="section"/> If they held Chalcis they would hold Euboea; the
                        Macedonians had been harsh masters, the Aetolians would be much more
                        insupportable. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The two cities were
                        influenced mainly by their respect for the Romans, whose courage in the late
                        war as well as their justice and considerateness they had had practical
                        experience of. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Each city accordingly armed
                        and despatched all their fighting men. The Chalcidians left the defence of
                        their walls to them, and crossing the Euripus with their entire force fixed
                        their camp at Salganeus. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> From there they
                        sent first a herald and then delegates to the Aetolians to inquire what they
                        had done or said that their allies and friends should come to attack them.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Thoas, who was in command, replied
                        that they were come not to attack them but to deliver them from the Romans.

                        more glittering but also with heavier chains than when you had a Macedonian
                        garrison in your citadel." The Chalcidians declared that they were not in
                        bondage to any man, nor did they need any man's protection. <milestone
                            n="11" unit="section"/> They then left the conference and returned to
                        their camp. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Thoas and the Aetolians had
                        placed all their hopes on taking the enemy by surprise, and as they were
                        unequal to a sustained conflict and the siege of a city powerfully protected
                        both by land and sea they returned home. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>

                        Demetrias, and judging that the liberation of Chalcis would do much towards
                        inducing the Magnetes to resume friendly relations with Rome, he wrote to
                        Eunomus, the chief magistrate of the Thessalians, asking him to put his
                        fighting men on a war footing as a support to the party of his adherents.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> At the same time he sent Villius to

                        there were a large number who were inclined to restore the old friendly
                        relations. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> He went in a quinquereme, and
                        had reached the harbour mouth when he found that the whole population had
                        poured out to see him. Villius asked them whether they preferred that he
                        should come to them as friends or as enemies. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> Eurylochus, their chief magistrate, told him that he
                        had come to friends, but he must keep away from the harbour and allow the
                        Magnetes to live in harmony and liberty and not seduce the populace under
                        cover of a political discussion. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> This
                        started a hot dispute, not a conference, as the Roman envoy bitterly
                        reproached the Magnetes for their ingratitude and predicted the disasters
                        which would quickly overtake them, whilst the townsmen shouted out in reply
                        angry aspersions on the conduct of the senate and Quinctius. <milestone

                        consular elections-for that was the point at which I digressed-the new
                        consuls, L. Quinctius and Cn. Domitius, left for their provinces, Quinctius
                        for Liguria and Domitius for the country of the Boii. <milestone n="3"

                        a formal surrender to the consul. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The

                        but also many of his fellow-citizens and members of the friendly States who
                        had been in the hands of the enemy. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> During

                        at Vibo; 3700 infantry and 300 cavalry were sent there. <milestone n="6"

                        belonged to the Bruttii, who had taken it from the Greeks. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> During this time two alarming incidents occurred in

                        the time business was suspended amidst general anxiety and alarm.
                        Intercessions were offered up for three successive days to avert the peril.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The other was no groundless alarm, it
                        was a widespread disaster. A fire broke out in the Forum Boarium; for a day

                        not wish to leave them in his rear during his invasion of Europe. A further
                        cause of delay was his uncertainty about Hannibal. <milestone n="3"

                        Hannibal to Africa were not ready, and then the question was raised, mainly
                        by Thoas, whether he ought to be sent at all. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> Thoas asserted that the whole of Greece was in a state
                        of unrest and that Demetrias had passed into his hands. The lies about the
                        king and the wild exaggerations as to the forces which Antiochus possessed
                        with which he had excited many minds in Greece he now employed to feed the
                        king's hopes. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> He told him that all were
                        praying for him to come; there would be a universal rush to the shore from
                        which they had caught the first glimpse of the royal fleet. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> He actually ventured to disturb the judgment which the
                        king had now without a shadow of doubt formed of Hannibal and gave it as his
                        opinion that no ships ought to be detached from the king's fleet, or if any
                        were sent Hannibal was the very last person who ought to be in command of
                        them. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> He was a banished man and a

                        fresh prospects every day. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Then, again,
                        the military reputation which led to Hannibal's being sought after like a
                        woman with a rich dowry was too great for any who was only officer in the
                        king's service; the king ought to be the central figure, the sole leader the
                        sole commander. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> If Hannibal were to lose a

                        that they were fortunate enough to inflict a decisive defeat on the Romans
                        and win the war, how <milestone n="11??" unit="section"/> could they hope
                        that Hannibal would live quietly under a monarch, under one man's rule,
                        after he had been unable to bear the restraints imposed by the laws of his
                        own country? His youthful aspirations and his hopes of winning world-wide
                        dominion had not fitted him to endure a master in his old age. <milestone
                            n="12" unit="section"/> There was no necessity for the king to give
                        Hannibal a command, he might find him employment as a member of his suite
                        and an adviser on matters concerning the war. <milestone n="13"
                            unit="section"/> A moderate demand upon such abilities as his would be
                        neither dangerous nor useless; but if the highest services he could render
                        were called for, they would prove too burdensome both for him who rendered

                        Encouraged by the defection of Demetrias, Antiochus determined to postpone

                            unit="section"/> After the ships which had lost their course during the
                        voyage had rejoined him, he sailed on to Pteleum, the first point on the
                        mainland. Here he was met by Eurylochus and the Magnetan leaders from
                        Demetrias, and the sight of so many supporters put him in excellent spirits.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The following day he entered the
                        harbour of Demetrias and disembarked his force at a spot not far from the
                        city. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> His total strength consisted of
                        10,000 infantry, 500 cavalry and six elephants, a force hardly sufficient
                        for the occupation of Greece, even if there were no troops there, to say
                        nothing of maintaining a war against Rome. When the Aetolians received
                        intelligence that Antiochus was at Demetrias they at once convened a council
                        and passed a resolution inviting him to attend. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> As the king knew that this resolution would be passed
                        he had already left Demetrias and advanced to Phalara on the Maliac Gulf.

                        the resolution he went on to Lamia, where he received <milestone n="9??"
                            unit="section"/> an enthusiastic welcome from the populace, who showed
                        their delight by loud cheers and other manifestations by which the common
                        crowd express their extravagant joy. </p>

                        everyone had hoped and expected. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> This
                        ought to be taken, he said, as the greatest proof of his friendship and
                        devotion towards them, for though he was quite unprepared and the season was
                        unsuitable for a sea-passage he had unhesitatingly complied with the request
                        of their delegates, convinced as he was that when the Aetolians saw him
                        amongst them they would realise that, even had he come alone, it was in him
                        that their safety and protection lay. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> At
                        the same time, he was going to fulfil to the utmost the hopes of those whose
                        expectations seemed for the moment to be disappointed. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> As soon as ever the season of the year made navigation

                        would shrink from no toil or danger till he had delivered Greece from the

                        armies from Asia; for the time being it must be the care of the Aetolians to
                        furnish his troops with an abundant supply of corn and other provisions at a

                        Aetolian leaders, Phaeneas and Thoas. Phaeneas argued that as their leader
                        in war Antiochus would not be so useful <milestone n="3??" unit="section"/>
                        to them as he would be were he to act as peace-maker and as an umpire to
                        whom their differences with Rome might be referred for decision. <milestone
                            n="4" unit="section"/> His presence amongst them and his regal dignity
                        would do more to win the respect of the Romans than his arms. Many men, to
                        avoid the necessity of war, will make concessions which could not be
                        extorted from them by war and armed force. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                        Thoas, on the other hand, asserted that Phaeneas was not really anxious for
                        peace; he only wanted to hinder their preparations for war so that the king,
                        tired of delays, might relax his efforts and the Romans gain time for
                        completing their own preparations. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        Notwithstanding all the deputations which had been despatched to Rome and
                        all the personal discussions with Quinctius, they had learnt by experience
                        that no equitable terms could be procured from Rome, nor would they have
                        sought help from Antiochus had not all their hopes been dashed to the
                        ground. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Now that he had presented himself
                        sooner than anyone expected they must not slacken their purpose, rather must
                        they beg the king, as he had come as the champion of Greece, which was the
                        main thing, to summon all his military and naval forces. A king in arms
                        would gain something, a king without arms would not have the slightest
                        weight with Romans, either as acting on behalf of the Aetolians or even
                        defending his own interests. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> These
                        arguments carried the day and they decided to appoint the king as their
                        commander-in-chief with absolute powers, and thirty of their <milestone

                        dispersed to their respective cities. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The
                        next day the king consulted the council as to where operations should
                        commence. It was thought best to begin with Chalcis, where the Aetolians had
                        recently made their futile attempt, and where they considered success would
                        depend on quick action more than on serious preparations or sustained
                        effort. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The king accordingly, with a force
                        of 1000 infantry which had come up from Demetrias, marched through Phocis,
                        and the Aetolian leaders, who had called out a few of their fighting men,
                        taking a different route, assembled at Chaeronea and followed him in ten
                        ships of war. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Fixing his camp at Salganeus
                        he crossed the Euripus with the Aetolians, and when he was within a short
                        distance from the harbour the magistrates and leading men of Chalcis came
                        forward in front of their gate. A small party from each side met to confer.
                        The Aetolians did their utmost to persuade the Chalcidians to receive the
                        king as an ally and friend without disturbing their friendly relations with
                        Rome. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> They said that he had sailed across
                        to Europe not to levy war <milestone n="6??" unit="section"/> but to
                        liberate Greece, not with empty professions as the Romans had done, but to
                        make her really free. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Nothing could be
                        more advantageous for the States of Greece than to enter into friendly
                        relations with both parties, for then they would be secure against
                        ill-treatment from either side through the protection which the other would
                        be pledged to afford. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> If they refused to
                        receive the king, let them consider what they would at once have to go
                        through, with the Romans too far away to help and Antiochus, whom they were
                        powerless to resist, before their gates as an enemy. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> Micythio, one of the Achaean leaders, said in reply
                        that he was wondering who the people were that Antiochus had left his
                        kingdom and come across to Europe to liberate. He knew of no city in Greece
                        which held a Roman garrison or paid tribute to Rome or had to submit against
                        its will to conditions imposed by a one-sided treaty. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> The Chalcidians needed no one to vindicate their
                        liberty, for they were a free State; nor did they require protection, for it
                        was owing to this same Roman people that they were in the enjoyment of peace
                        and liberty. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> They did not reject the

                        and the Athamanian king, Amynander. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> They
                        were under the impression that the Boeotians had been estranged from Rome
                        ever since the death of Brachylles and the results which flowed from it, and
                        they <milestone n="4??" unit="section"/> also believed that Philopoemen, the
                        chief magistrate of the Achaeans, was an object of dislike and jealousy on
                        the part of Quinctius owing to the reputation he had gained in the Laconian
                        war. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Amynander had married Apama, the
                        daughter of a certain Alexander of Megalopolis, who represented himself as

                        the names of Philip, Alexander and Apama. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        Her marriage with the king had made Apama much talked about and her elder

                        the East to liberate Greece, he asked for nothing from the Achaeans which
                        could impair their loyalty to Rome, their old friend and ally. <milestone

                        against them, all he wanted was that they should stand aloof from both

                        mind those in whose presence rather than those to whose ears he was
                        addressing his remarks, <milestone n="2??" unit="section"/> for you Achaeans
                        know perfectly well that all the warlike spirit of the Aetolians lies in
                        words not in deeds, and shows itself in haranguing councils more than on the
                        battlefield. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> So they are indifferent to
                        the opinion which the Achaeans have of them, because they are aware that
                        they are thoroughly known to them. It is for the king's representatives, and
                        through them for the king himself, that he has uttered this bombast.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> If anyone did not know before what it
                        was that led Antiochus to make common cause with the Aetolians, it came out
                        clearly in their delegate's speech. By lying to one another and boasting of
                        forces which neither of them possess they have filled each other with vain
                        hopes. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> These say that it was through them
                        that Philip was defeated and by their courage that the Romans were
                        protected, and as you heard just now, they talk as though you and all other
                        cities and nations were going to follow their lead. The king, on the other
                        hand, vaunts of his clouds of infantry and cavalry and covers all the seas
                        with his fleets. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> It is very like something
                        that happened when we were at supper with my host in Chalcis, a worthy man
                        and one who knows how to feed his guests. It was at the height of summer; we
                        were being sumptuously entertained, and were wondering how he managed to get
                        such an abundance and variety of game at that season of the year. <milestone
                            n="7" unit="section"/> The man, not a boaster like these people, smiled
                        and said, 'That variety of what looks like wild game is due to the
                        condiments and dressing, it has all been made out of a home-bred pig.' This
                        might be fitly said of the king's forces which were just now so extolled.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> All that variety of equipment and the
                        crowd of names no one ever heard of-Dahae, Medes, Cadusians and
                        Elymaeans-are nothing but Syrians, whose servile, cringing temper makes them
                        much more like a breed of slaves than a nation of soldiers. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> I wish I could bring before your eyes, Achaeans, the
                        flying visits which the 'Great King' paid to the national council of the
                        Aetolians at Lamia and afterwards to Chalcis. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> You would see what looked like two badly depleted
                        legions in the king's camp; you would see the king almost on his knees
                        begging corn from the Aetolians and trying to raise a loan from which to pay
                        his men, and then standing at the gates of Chalcis, and on finding himself
                        shut out from there returning to Aetolia having gained nothing but a glimpse
                        of Aulis and the Euripus. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The king's
                        confidence in the Aetolians is misplaced, so is theirs in his empty
                        professions. You must not, therefore, let yourselves be deceived; trust
                        rather in the good faith of Rome, of which you have had actual experience.
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> As to their saying that the best
                        course for you is to have nothing to do with the war, <milestone n="13??"
                            unit="section"/> nothing on the contrary could be further from your
                        interests, for then, winning neither gratitude nor respect, you would fall
                        as a prize to the victor." </p>

                        was to the point, and his speech easily won the approbation of the council.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> There was no debate and no hesitation
                        in coming to a unanimous decision that the Achaeans would count as their
                        friends or foes those whom the Romans considered such, and would also
                        declare war on Antiochus and the Aetolians. <milestone n="3" unit="section"
                        /> On the instruction of Quirinus they at once despatched a contingent of
                        500 men to Chalcis and an equal number to the Piraeus. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> At Athens matters were fast approaching a state of
                        civil war through the action of certain individuals who by holding out the
                        prospect of bribes were drawing the mob, who can always be bought by gold,
                        over to Antiochus. The supporters of Rome sent to Quirinus asking him to go
                        to Athens, and Apollodorus, the ringleader of the movement, was tried at the
                        instance of a man called Leontes, found guilty and sent into banishment.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The delegates returned to the king
                        with an unfavourable reply from the Achaeans; the Boeotians gave no definite
                        answer. They simply promised that when Antiochus appeared in Boeotia they
                        would deliberate as to what action they should take. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> When Antiochus heard that the Aetolians and Eumenes had
                        each sent reinforcements to Chalcis he saw that he must act promptly and be
                        the first to enter the place and if possible intercept the enemy on their
                        advance. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> He sent Menippus with about 3000
                        men and Polyxenidas with the whole of the fleet, and a few days later
                        marched thither in person with 6000 of his own men and a smaller body of
                        Aetolians, taken from such force as could be hastily concentrated at Lamia.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The 500 Achaeans and the small
                        contingent supplied by Eumenes under Xenoclides of Chalcis crossed the
                        Euripus, as the route was still open, and reached Chalcis. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> The Roman troops, who were about 500 strong, came after
                        Menippus had encamped before Sanganeus at the Hermaeum, the point of
                        departure from Boeotia to the island of Euboea. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> They were accompanied by Micythio, who had been sent
                        from Chalcis to Quirinus to ask for this very contingent. <milestone n="11"
                            unit="section"/> When, however, he found that the passes were blocked,
                        he abandoned the one leading to Aulis and took the one to Delium, intending
                        to sail across from there. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Delium is a temple of Apollo overlooking
                        the sea, five miles distant from Tanagra and four miles from the nearest
                        point of Euboea by sea. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Here in the fane
                        and in the grove, sacred and therefore inviolable, with its rights of
                        sanctuary which it possessed in common with those temples which the Greeks
                        call "asyla," the soldiers were walking about perfectly at their ease, not
                        having yet heard that a state of war existed or that swords had been drawn
                        and blood shed. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Some were exploring the
                        temple and the grove, others strolling along the beach without any weapons,
                        while a large number had gone off to procure wood and fodder. Whilst thus
                        dispersed they were suddenly attacked by Menippus. Many were killed, as many
                        as fifty were made prisoners; very few made their escape. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> Amongst these was Micythio, who was taken on board a
                        small transport. The losses incurred greatly disquieted Quinctius and the
                        Romans, but at the same time it was regarded as an additional justification
                        for the war. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Antiochus had moved his army
                        up to Aulis and from there he despatched a second mission to Chalcis,
                        consisting of some of his own people and some Aetolians. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> They employed the same arguments as before, but in much
                        more threatening tone, and in spite of the efforts of Micythio and
                        Xenoclides he had little difficulty in inducing the townsmen to open the
                        gates to him. The adherents of Rome left the city just before the king's
                        entry. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The Achaean troops and those of
                        Eumenes were holding Salganeus, and a small body of Romans were fortifying a
                        post on the Euripus to defend the position. Menippus commenced the attack on
                        Salganeus and Antiochus prepared to capture the fortified post. <milestone
                            n="8" unit="section"/> The Achaeans and the soldiers of Eumenes were the
                        first to abandon the defence on condition of being allowed to depart in
                        safety. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The Romans offered a much stouter
                        resistance, but when they found that they were blockaded by land and sea and
                        that siege artillery was being brought up they were unable to hold out any
                        longer. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> As the king was now in possession
                        of the capital of Euboea, the other cities on the island did not dispute his
                        dominion. He flattered himself that he had made a most successful
                        commencement of the war, considering how large an island and how many
                        serviceable cities had fallen into his hands. </p>
