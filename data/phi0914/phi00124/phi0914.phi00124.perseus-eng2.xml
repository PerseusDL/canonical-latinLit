                    <p> Hieronymus, king of Syracuse, whose grandfather Hiero had been a faithful
                        ally of Rome, revolts to the Carthaginians, and for his tyranny is put to
                        death by his subjects. Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, the pro-consul, defeats
                        the Carthaginians under Hanno at Beneventum chiefly by the services of the
                        slaves in his army, whom he subsequently liberated. Claudius Marcellus, the
                        consul, besieges Syracuse. War is declared against Philip, king of Macedon;
                        he is routed by night at Apollonia and retreats into Macedonia. This war is
                        intrusted to Valerius the praetor. Operations of the Scipios against the
                        Carthaginians in Spain. Syphax, king of the Numidians, is received into
                        alliance by the Romans, and is defeated by Masinissa, king of the
                        Massillians, who fought on the side of the Carthaginians. The Celtiberians
                        joined the Romans, and their troops having been taken into pay, mercenary
                        soldiers for the first time served in a Roman camp. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> ON his return from Campania into Bruttium,
                    Hanno, with the assistance and under the guidance of the Bruttians, made an
                    attempt upon the Greek cities; which were the more disposed to continue in
                    alliance with the Romans, because they perceived that the Bruttians, whom they
                    feared and hated, had taken part with the Carthaginians. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> The first place attempted was Rhegium, where several days
                    were spent without effect. Meanwhile the Locrians hastily conveyed from the
                    country into the city, corn, wood, and other things necessary for their use, as
                    also that no booty might be left for the enemy. <milestone n="3" unit="section"
                    /> The number of persons which poured out of every gate increased daily, till at
                    length those only were left in the city whose duty it was to repair the walls
                    and gates, and to collect weapons in the fortresses. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> Against this mixed multitude, composed of persons of all
                    ages and ranks, while rambling through the country, and for the most part
                    unarmed, Hamilcar, the Carthaginian, sent out his cavalry, who, having been
                    forbidden to hurt any one, only interposed their squadrons, so as to cut them
                    off from the city when dispersed in flight. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    The general himself, having posted himself upon an eminence which commanded a
                    view of the country and the city, ordered a cohort of Bruttians to approach the
                    walls, call out <pb n="897" xml:id="p.897"/> the leaders of the Locrians to a
                    conference, and promising them the friendship of Hannibal, exhort them to
                    deliver up the city. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> At first the Bruttians
                    were not believed in any thing they stated in the conference, but afterwards,
                    when the Carthaginian appeared on the hills, and a few who had fled back to the
                    city brought intelligence that all the rest of the multitude were in the power
                    of the enemy, overcome with fear, they said they would consult the people.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> An assembly of the people was immediately
                    called, when, as all the most fickle of the inhabitants were desirous of a
                    change of measures and a new alliance, and those whose friends were cut off by
                    the enemy without the city, had their minds bound as if they had <milestone
                        n="8??" unit="section"/> given hostages, while a few rather silently
                    approved of a constant fidelity than ventured to support the opinion they
                    approved, the city was surrendered to the Carthaginians, with an appearance of
                    perfect unanimity. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Lucius Atilius, the captain
                    of the garrison, together with the Roman soldiers who were with him, having been
                    privately led down to the port, and put on board a ship, that they might be
                    conveyed to Rhegium, Hamilcar and the Carthaginians were received into the city
                    on condition that an alliance should be formed on equal terms; <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> which condition, when they had surrendered, the
                    Carthaginian had very nearly not performed, as he accused them of having sent
                    away the Roman fraudulently, while the Locrians alleged that he had
                    spontaneously fled. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> A body of cavalry went in
                    pursuit of the fugitives, in case the tide might happen to detain them in the
                    strait, or might carry the ships to land. The persons whom they were in pursuit
                    of they did not overtake, but they descried some ships passing over the strait
                    from Messana to Rhegium. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> These contained
                    Roman troops sent by the praetor, Claudius, to occupy the city with a garrison.
                    The enemy therefore immediately retired from Rhegium. <milestone n="13"
                        unit="section"/> At the command of Hannibal, peace was concluded with the
                    Locrians on these terms: that <quote> they should live free under their own
                        laws; that the city should be open to the Carthaginians, the harbour in the
                        power of the Locrians. That their alliance should rest on the principle,
                        that the Carthaginian should help the Locrian and the Locrian the
                        Carthaginian in peace and war. </quote>
                </p>
                <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Thus the Carthaginian troops were led back
                    from the strait, while the Bruttians loudly complained that Locri and <pb
                        n="898" xml:id="p.898"/> Rhegium, cities which they had fixed in their minds
                    that they should have the plundering of, they had left untouched. <milestone
                        n="2" unit="section"/> Having therefore levied and armed fifteen thousand of
                    their own youth, they set out by themselves to lay siege to Croto, which was
                    also a Greek city, and on the coast; <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> believing
                    that they would obtain a great accession to their power, if they could get
                    possession of a city upon the sea-coast, which had a port and was strongly
                    defended by walls. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> This consideration annoyed
                    them, that they neither could venture on the business without calling in the
                    Carthaginians to their assistance, lest they should appear to have done any
                    thing in a manner unbecoming allies; and on the other hand, lest, if the
                    Carthaginian general should again show himself to have been rather an umpire of
                    peace than an auxiliary in war, they should fight in vain against the liberty of
                    Croto, as before in the affair of the Locrians. <milestone n="5" unit="section"
                    /> The most advisable course, therefore, appeared to be, that ambassadors should
                    be sent to Hannibal, and that a stipulation should be obtained from him that
                    Croto, when reduced, should be in possession of the Bruttians. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> Hannibal replied, that it was a question which should be
                    determined by persons on the spot, and referred them to Hanno, from whom they
                    could obtain no decisive answer. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> For they were
                    unwilling that so celebrated and opulent a city should be plundered, and were in
                    hopes that if the Bruttians should attack it, while the Carthaginians did not
                    ostensibly approve or assist in the attack, the inhabitants would the more
                    readily come over to them. The Crotonians were not united either in their
                    measures or wishes. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> All the states of Italy
                    were infected with one disease, as it were; the commons dissented from the
                    nobles; the senate favouring the Romans, while the commons endeavoured to draw
                    the states over to the Carthaginians. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> A
                    deserter announced to the Bruttii that such a dissension prevailed in the city;
                    that Aristomachus was the leader of the commons, and the adviser of the
                    surrender of the city; that the city was of wide extent and thinly inhabited,
                    that the walls in every part were in ruins, that it was only here and there that
                    the guards and watches were kept by senators, and that wherever the commons kept
                    guard, there an entrance lay open. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Under the
                    direction and guidance of the deserter, the Bruttians completely invested the
                    city; and being received into it by the commons, got possession of every <pb
                        n="899" xml:id="p.899"/> part, except the citadel, on the first assault.
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The nobles held the citadel, which they
                    had taken care beforehand to have ready as a refuge against such an event. In
                    the same place Aristomachus took refuge, as though he had advised the surrender
                    of the city to the Carthaginians, and not to the Bruttians. </p>
                <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The wall of the city of Croto in circuit
                    extended through a space of twelve miles, before the arrival of Pyrrhus in
                    Italy. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> After the devastation occasioned by
                    that war, scarcely half the city was inhabited. The river which had flowed
                    through the middle of the town, now ran on the outside of the parts which were
                    occupied by buildings, and the citadel was at a distance from the inhabited
                    parts. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Six miles from this celebrated city
                    stood the temple of Juno Lacinia, more celebrated even than the city itself, and
                    venerated by all the surrounding states. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Here
                    was a grove fenced with a dense wood and tall fir trees, with rich pastures in
                    its centre, in which cattle of every kind, sacred to the goddess, fed without
                    any keeper; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> the flocks of every kind going out
                    separately and returning to their folds, never being injured, either from the
                    lying in wait of wild beasts, or the dishonesty of men. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> These flocks were, therefore, a source of great revenue,
                    from which a column of solid gold was formed and consecrated; and the temple
                    became distinguished for its wealth also, and not only for its sanctity.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Some miracles are attributed to it, as is
                    generally the case with regard to such remarkable places. Rumour says that there
                    is an altar in the vestibule of the temple, the ashes of which are never moved
                    by any wind. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> But the citadel of Croto,
                    overhanging the sea on one side, on the other, which looks towards the land, was
                    protected formerly by its natural situation only, but was afterwards surrounded
                    by a wall. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> It was in this part that Dionysius,
                    the tyrant of Sicily, took it by stratagem, approaching by way of some rocks
                    which faced from it. This citadel, which was considered sufficiently secure, was
                    now occupied by the nobles of Croto, the <milestone n="10??" unit="section"/>
                    Bruttians, in conjunction even with their own commons, besieging them.
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The Bruttians, however, perceiving at
                    length that it was impossible to take the citadel by their own efforts,
                    compelled by necessity, implored the aid of Hanno. He endeavoured to bring the
                    Crotonians to surrender, under an agreement that they should allow a colony of
                    Bruttians to <pb n="900" xml:id="p.900"/> settle there; <milestone n="12"
                        unit="section"/> so that their city, desolate and depopulated by wars, might
                    recover its former populousness: but not a man besides Aristomachus did he move;
                        <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> they affirmed, that <quote> they would

                    guilty to the innocent, and feigned that Thraso was the originator of the plot,

                    never would have been bold enough to attempt so daring a deed, he threw the

                    equity required that the whole of Sicily should be conceded to him, and that the
                    dominion of Italy should be acquired as the peculiar possession of the

                            unit="section"/> by any restrictions either of duration or of authority,
                        which might prevent him from executing or planning every thing according as
                        the exigencies of the war shall require. But with us the year is gone merely
                        in making preparations, and when we are only commencing our operations.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Having said enough as to what sort of
                        persons you ought to elect as consuls, it remains that I should briefly
                        express my opinion of those on whom the choice of the prerogative century
                        has fallen. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Marcus Aemilius Regillus is
                        flamen of Quirinus, whom we can neither send abroad nor retain at home
                        without neglecting the gods or the war. Otacilius is married to my sister's
                        daughter, and has children by her, but the favours you have conferred upon
                        me and my ancestors, are not such' as that I should prefer private
                        relationship to the public weal. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Any
                        sailor or pas- <pb n="906" xml:id="p.906"/> senger can steer the vessel in a
                        calm sea, but when a furious storm has arisen, and the vessel is hurried by
                        the tempest along the troubled deep, then there is need of a man and a
                        pilot. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> We are not sailing on a tranquil
                        sea, but have already well nigh sunk with repeated storms; you must
                        therefore employ the utmost caution and foresight in determining who shall
                        sit at the helm. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Of you, Titus Otacilius,
                        we have had experience in a business of less magnitude; and, certainly, you
                        have not given us any proof that we ought to confide to you affairs of
                        greater moment. The fleet which you commanded this year we fitted out for
                        three objects: to lay waste the coast of Africa, to protect the shores of
                        Italy, but, above all, to prevent the conveyance of reinforcements with pay
                        and provisions from Carthage to Hannibal. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>
                        Now if Titus Otacilius has performed for the state, I say not all, but any
                        one of these services, make him consul. But if, while you had the command of
                        the fleet, supplies of whatever sort were conveyed safe and untouched to
                        Hannibal, even as though he had no enemy on the sea; <milestone n="16"
                            unit="section"/> if the coast of Italy has been more infested this year
                        than that of Africa, what can you have to urge why you should be preferred
                        before all others as the antagonist of Hannibal? <milestone n="17"
                            unit="section"/> Were you consul, we should give it as our opinion that
                        a dictator should be appointed in obedience to the example of our ancestors.
                        Nor could you feel offended that some one in the Roman nation was deemed
                        superior to you in war. It concerns yourself more than any one else, Titus
                        Otacilius, that there be not laid upon your shoulders a burthen under which
                        you would fall. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> I earnestly exhort you,
                        that with the same feelings which would influence you if standing armed for
                        battle, you were called upon suddenly to elect two generals, under whose
                        conduct and auspices you were to fight, you would this day elect your
                        consuls; <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> to whom your children are to
                        swear allegiance, at whose command they are to assemble, and under whose

                        The Trasimene Lake and Cannae are melancholy precedents to look back upon,
                        but form useful warnings to guard against similar disasters. Crier, call

                    commons were under the influence of the youth, and the state of Tarentum in the
                    hands of the commons. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Hannibal after bestowing
                    the highest commendations upon them, and loading them with immense promises, bid
                    them return home to mature their plans, saying that he would be there in due
                    time. With these hopes, the Tarentines were dismissed. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> Hannibal had himself conceived the strongest desire of
                    getting possession of Tarentum. He saw that it was a city opulent and
                    celebrated, on the coast, and lying conveniently over against Macedonia. And
                    that as the Romans were in possession of Brundusium, king Philip would make for
                    this port if he crossed over into Italy. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    Having completed the sacrifice for which he came, and during his stay there laid
                    waste the territory of Cumae as far as the promontory of Misenum, he suddenly
                    marched his troops thence to Puteoli to surprise the Roman garrison there.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> It consisted of six thousand men, and the
                    place was secured not only by its natural situation, but by works also. The
                    Carthaginian having waited there three days, and attempted the garrison in every
                    quarter, without any success, proceeded thence to devastate the territory of
                    Naples, influenced by resentment more than the hope of getting possession of the
                    place. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The commons of Nola, who had been long
                    disaffected to the Romans and at enmity with their own senate, moved into the
                    neighbouring fields on his approach; and in conformity with this movement
                    ambassadors came to invite Hannibal to join them, bringing with them a positive
                    assurance that the city would be surrendered to him. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> The consul, Marcellus, who had been called in by the
                    nobles, anticipated their attempt. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> In one day
                    he had reached Suessula from Cales, though the river Vulturnus had delayed him
                    crossing; and from thence the ensuing night introduced into Nola for the
                    protection of the senate, six thousand foot and three hundred horse. <milestone
                        n="11" unit="section"/> The dilatoriness of Hannibal was in proportion to
                    the expedition which the consul used in every thing he did in order to preoccupy
                    Nola. Having twice already made the attempt unsuccessfully, he was slower to
                    place confidence in the Nolans. </p>

                    to attempt Casilinum, which was occupied by a Carthaginian garrison; and, as if
                    by concert, Hanno approached Beneventum on <pb n="912" xml:id="p.912"/> one side
                    from the Bruttians, with a large body of foot and horse, while on the other side
                    Gracchus approached it from Luceria. The latter entered the town first.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Then, hearing that Hanno had pitched his
                    camp three miles from the city, at the river Calor, and from thence was laying
                    waste the country, he himself marched without the walls, and pitching his camp
                    about a mile from the enemy, harangued his soldiers. The legions he had
                    consisted for the most part of volunteer slaves, who chose rather to earn their
                    liberty silently by another year's service, than demand it openly. <milestone

                    quarters, had perceived that the troops murmured, asking when the time would
                    arrive that they should serve as free citizens. <milestone n="4" unit="section"
                    /> He had written to the senate, stating not so much what they wanted as what
                    they had deserved; he said they had served him with fidelity and courage up to
                    that day, and that they wanted nothing but liberty, to bring them up to the
                    model of complete soldiers. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Permission was
                    given him to act in the business as he thought for the interest of the state,
                    and, accordingly, before he engaged with the enemy, he declared that the time
                    was now arrived for obtaining that liberty which they had so long hoped for;
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> that on the following day he should fight
                    a pitched battle on a level and open plain, in which the contest would be
                    decided by valour only, without any fear of ambuscade. <milestone n="7"

                    would instantly order to be set free; but that he would punish, in a manner
                    suited to a slave, the man who should quit his post; <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> that every man's fortune was in his own hands; that not he
                    himself alone would authorize their enfranchisement, but the consul, Marcus
                    Marcellus, and the whole body of the fathers, who, on being consulted by him on
                    the subject, had left the matter to his disposal. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> He then read the letter of the consul and the decree of the
                    senate, on which they raised a general shout of approbation, demanded to be led
                    to battle, and vehemently urged him to give the signal forthwith. <milestone

                    the battle for the following day. The soldiers, highly delighted, particularly
                    those whose enfranchisement was to be the reward of one day's prowess, employed
                    the remaining time in getting ready their arms. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The next day, as soon as the trumpets began to
                    sound, they were the first to assemble at the general's tent, armed <pb n="913"
                        xml:id="p.913"/> and ready for action. When the sun had risen, Gracchus led
                    out his troops to the field of battle; nor did the enemy delay to engage him.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> His troops consisted of seventeen thousand
                    infantry, principally Bruttians and Lucanians, with twelve hundred horse, among
                    which were very few Italians, almost all the rest being Numidians and Moors. The
                    contest was fierce and protracted. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> For four
                    hours neither side had the advantage, nor did any other circumstance more impede
                    the Romans, than that the heads of their enemies were made the price of their
                    liberty. For when each man had gallantly slain his enemy, first, he lost time in
                    cutting <milestone n="4??" unit="section"/> off his head, which was done with
                    difficulty amid the crowd and confusion, and secondly, all the bravest troops
                    ceased to be engaged in fight, as their right hands were employed in holding the
                    heads; and thus the battle was left to be sustained by the inactive and
                    cowardly. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> But when the military tribunes
                    reported to Gracchus that the soldiers were employed not in wounding any of the
                    enemy who were standing, but in mangling those who were prostrate, their right
                    hands being occupied in holding the heads of men instead of their swords, he
                    promptly ordered a signal to be given that they should throw down the heads and
                    charge the enemy; <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> that they had given evident
                    and signal proofs of valour, and that the liberty of such brave men was certain.
                    Then the fight was revived, and the cavalry also were sent out against the
                    enemy. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The Numidians engaging them with great
                    bravery, and the contest between the cavalry being carried on with no less
                    spirit than that between the infantry, the victory again became doubtful; when,
                    the generals on both sides vilifying their opponents, the Roman saying, that
                    their enemies were Bruttians and Lucanians, who had been so often vanquished and
                    subjugated by their ancestors; the Carthaginian, that the troops opposed to them
                    were Roman slaves, soldiers taken out of a workhouse; <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> at last Gracchus exclaimed, that his men had no ground to
                    hope for liberty unless the enemy were routed and put to flight that day. </p>
                <milestone n="16" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> These words at length kindled their courage so
                    effectually, and renewing the shout, as if suddenly changed into other men, they
                    bore down upon the enemy with such impetuosity that they could not longer be
                    withstood. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> First, those of the Carthaginians
                    who stood before the standards; <pb n="914" xml:id="p.914"/> then the standards
                    were thrown into disorder; and lastly, the whole line was compelled to give way.
                    They then turned their backs downright, and fled precipitately to their camp
                    with such terror and consternation, that not a man made a stand in the gates or
                    on the rampart; while the Romans, who pursued them so close as to form almost a
                    part of their body, commenced the battle anew, enclosed within the rampart of
                    the enemy. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Here the battle was more bloody as
                    the combatants had less room to move, from the narrowness of the place in which
                    they fought. The prisoners too assisted; for snatching up swords in the
                    confusion, and forming themselves into a body, they slew the Carthaginians in
                    the rear and prevented their flight. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Thus less
                    than two thousand men out of so large an army, and those principally cavalry,
                    effected their escape with their commander, all the rest were slain or taken
                    prisoners. Thirty-eight standards were taken. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    Of the victors about two thousand fell. All the booty except that of the
                    prisoners was given up to the soldiery. Such cattle also as the owners should
                    identify within thirty days was excepted. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> When
                    they returned to their camp loaded with spoil, about four thousand of the
                    volunteer slaves who had fought with less spirit, and had not joined in breaking
                    into the enemy's camp, through fear of punishment, took possession of a hill not
                    far from the camp. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Being brought down thence
                    the next day by a military tribune, it happened that they arrived during an
                    assembly of the soldiers which Gracchus had called. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> At this assembly the proconsul, having first rewarded the
                    veteran soldiers with military presents, according to the valour displayed, and
                    the service rendered by each man in the engagement, then observed, with respect
                    to the volunteer slaves, that he would rather that all should be praised by him
                    whether deserving it or not, than that any one should be chastised on that day.
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> I bid you, said he, all be free, and may
                    the event be attended with advantage, happiness, and prosperity to the state and

                    the most cordial acclamations, the soldiers sometimes embracing and
                    congratulating one another, at other times lifting up their hands to heaven, and
                    praying that every blessing might attend the Roman people, and Gracchus in
                    particular; when Gracchus addressed them thus: <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>

                        any marks by which the brave and dastardly soldier might be distinguished.

                        being redeemed, lest all distinction between courage and cowardice should

                    <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> He then gave the signal for packing up the

                    booty, returned to Beneventum in so playful a mood, that they appeared to

                    them at the gate, embraced, congratulated, and invited the troops to

                    banquets in the courts of their houses, to which they invited the soldiers, and
                    of which they entreated Gracchus to allow them to partake. Gracchus gave
                    permission, with the proviso that they should feast in the public street. Each

                    even seemed a fitting occasion that Gracchus, on his return to Rome, should
                    order a picture representing the festivities of that day to be executed in the
                    temple of Liberty, which his father caused to be built on the Aventine out of

                    approach, sent for Pomponius the proprietor, with the troops he had in the camp
                    above Suessula; and then prepared to meet the enemy and to make no delay in
                    fighting. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He sent out Caius Claudius Nero in
                    the dead of night with the main strength of the cavalry, through the gate which
                    was farthest removed <pb n="916" xml:id="p.916"/> from the enemy, with orders to
                    make a circuit so as not to be observed, and then slowly to follow the enemy as
                    they moved along, and as soon as he perceived the battle begun, to charge them
                    on the rear. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Whether Nero was prevented from
                    executing these orders by mistaking the route, or from the shortness of the

                    the battle was fought, the Romans had unquestionably the advantage; but as the
                    cavalry did not come up in time, the plan of the battle which had been agreed
                    upon was disconcerted, and Marcellus, not daring to follow the retiring enemy,
                    gave the signal for retreat when his soldiers were conquering. <milestone n="6"

                    through the day and night, without even having seen the enemy, returned about
                    sunset; when the consul went so far in reprimanding him as to assert, that he
                    had been the only obstacle to their retorting on the enemy the disaster
                    sustained at Cannae. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The following day the
                    Roman came into the field, but the Carthaginian, beaten even by his own tacit
                    confession, kept within his camp. Giving up all hope of getting possession of

                    not only from Syracuse, but far from all Sicily. Epicydes, lest by being present

                    ought to send back was, that the Leontines also considered themselves entitled

                    grapple, attached to a strong chain, by means of a tolleno which projected from
                    the wall, and overhung them, having a heavy counterpoise of lead which forced

                    commotion, had gone over to the Carthaginians, regained Helorus and Herbessus by
                    voluntary surrender. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Megara, which he took by
                    storm, he demolished and plundered, in order to terrify the rest, but
                    particularly the Syracusans. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Much about the
                    same time, Himilco, who had kept his fleet for a long time at the promontory of
                    Pachynus, landed twenty-five thousand infantry, three thousand horse, and twelve
                    elephants, at Heraclea, which they call Minoa. This force was much greater than
                    that which he had before on board his fleet at Pachynus. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> But after Syracuse was seized by Hippocrates, he proceeded
                    to Carthage, where, being aided by ambassadors from Hippocrates, and a letter
                    from Hannibal, who said that now was the time to recover Sicily with the highest
                    honour, while his own advice given in person had no small influence, he had
                    prevailed upon the Carthaginians to transport into Sicily as large a force as
                    possible, both of foot and horse. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Immediately
                    on his arrival he retook Heraclea, and within a few days after Agrigentum;
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> and in the other states which sided with
                    the Carthaginians, such confident hopes were kindled of driving the Romans out
                    of Sicily, that at last even those who were besieged at Syracuse took courage;
                    and thinking that half their forces would be sufficient for the defence of the
                    city, they divided the business <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/> of the war
                    between them in such a manner, that Epicydes superintended the defence of the
                    city, while Hippocrates, in conjunction with Himilco, prosecuted the war against
                    the Roman consul. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The latter, having passed by
                    night through the intervals between the posts, with ten thousand foot and five
                    hundred horse, was pitching a camp near the city Acrillae, when Marcellus came
                    upon them, while engaged in raising <pb n="939" xml:id="p.939"/> the
                    fortifications, on his return <milestone n="9??" unit="section"/> from
                    Agrigentum, which was already occupied by the enemy, having failed in his
                    attempt to get there before the enemy by expeditious marching. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> Marcellus calculated upon any thing rather than meeting
                    with a Syracusan army at that time and place; but still through fear of Himilco
                    and the Carthaginians, for whom he was by no means a match with the forces he
                    had with him, he was marching with all possible circumspection, and with his
                    troops so arranged, as to be prepared for any thing which might occur. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> It happened that the caution he had observed
                    with intent to guard him against the Carthaginians, proved useful against the
                    Sicilians. Having caught them in disorder and dispersed, employed in forming
                    their camp, and for the most part unarmed, he cut off all their infantry. Their
                    cavalry, having commenced a slight engagement, fled to Acrae with Hippocrates.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> This battle having checked the Sicilians
                    in their purpose of revolting from the Romans, Marcellus returned to Syracuse,
                    and a few days after Himilco, being joined by Hippocrates, encamped on the river
                    Anapus, about eight miles distant from that place. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> Nearly about the same time, fifty-five ships of war of the
                    Carthaginians, with Bomilcar as commander of the fleet, put into the great
                    harbour of Syracuse from the sea, and a Roman fleet of thirty quinqueremes
                    landed the first legion at Panormus; and so intent were both the contending
                    powers upon Sicily, that the seat of war might seem to have been removed from
                    Italy. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Himilco, who thought that the Roman
                    legion which had been landed at Panormus, would doubtless fall a prey to him on
                    its way to Syracuse, was mistaken in his road; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    for the Carthaginian marched through the inland parts of the country, while the
                    legion, keeping along the coast, and attended by the <milestone n="6??"
                        unit="section"/> fleet, came up with Appius Claudius, who had advanced to
                    Pachynum with a part of his forces to meet it. Nor did the Carthaginians delay
                    longer at Syracuse. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Bomilcar, who at the same
                    time that he did not feel sufficient confidence in his naval strength, as the
                    Romans had a fleet more than double his number, was aware that delay which could
                    be attended with no good effect, would only increase the scarcity of provisions
                    among the allies by the presence of his troops, sailed out into the deep, and
                    crossed over into Africa. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Himilco, who had in
                    vain followed <pb n="940" xml:id="p.940"/> Marcellus to Syracuse, to see if he
                    could get any opportunity of engaging him before he was joined by larger forces,
                    failing in this object, and seeing that the enemy were secured at Syracuse, both
                    by their fortifications and the strength of their forces, to avoid wasting time
                    in sitting by as an idle spectator of the siege of <milestone n="9??"
                        unit="section"/> his allies, without being able to do any good, marched his
                    troops away, in order to bring them up wherever the prospect of revolt from the
                    Romans might invite him, and wherever by his presence he might inspire
                    additional courage in those who espoused his interest. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> He first got possession of Murgantia, the Roman garrison
                    having been betrayed by the inhabitants themselves. Here a great quantity of
                    corn and provisions of every kind had been laid up by the Romans. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> To this revolt the minds of other states also
                    were stimulated; and the Roman garrisons were now either driven out of the
                    citadels, or treacherously given up and overpowered. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> Enna, which stood on an eminence lofty and of difficult
                    ascent on all sides, was impregnable on account of its situation, and had
                    besides in its citadel a strong garrison commanded by one who was very unlikely
                    to be overreached by treachery, Lucius Pinarius, a man of vigorous mind, who
                    relied more on the measures he took to prevent treachery, than on the fidelity
                    of the Sicilians; <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> and at that time
                    particularly the intelligence he had received of so many cities being betrayed,
                    and revolting, and of the massacre of the garrisons, had made him solicitous to
                    use every precaution. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Accordingly, by day and
                    night equally, every thing was kept in readiness, and every place furnished with
                    guards and watches, the soldiery being continually under arms and at their
                    posts. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> But when the principal men in Enna, who
                    had already entered into a covenant with Himilco to betray the garrison, found
                    that they could get no opportunity of circumventing the Roman, they resolved to
                    act openly. They urged, that <quote> the city and the citadel ought to be under
                        their control, as they had formed an alliance <milestone n="6??"
                            unit="section"/> with the Romans on the understanding that they were to
                        be free, and had not been delivered into their custody as slaves. That they
                        therefore thought it just that the keys of the gates should be restored to
                        them. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> That their honour formed the
                        strongest tie upon good allies, and that the people and senate of Rome would
                        entertain feelings of gratitude towards them if they continued in friendship
                        with them of their own free will, and <pb n="941" xml:id="p.941"/> not by
                        compulsion. </quote>
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The Roman replied, that <quote> he was placed
                        there by his general to protect the place; that from him he had received the
                        keys of the gates and the custody of the citadel, trusts which he held not
                        subject to his own will, nor that of the inhabitants of Enna, but to his who
                        committed them to him. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> That among the
                        Romans, for a man to quit his post was a capital offence, and that parents
                        had sanctioned that law by the death even of their own children. That the
                        consul Marcellus was not far off; that they might send ambassadors to him,

                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> But they said, they would certainly not send

                        which we have hitherto employed, has been directed against covert treachery,

                        demand back the keys of the gates; but as soon as we shall have delivered
                        them up, Enna will be instantly in the hands of the Carthaginians, and we

                    upon Apollonia, having approached it by sailing up the river with a hundred and

                    was not secured either by fortifications or by men and arms, was overpowered at
                    the first assault. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> At the same time that they
                    delivered this intelligence, they entreated him to bring them succour, and repel
                    that decided enemy of the Romans by land or by a naval force, since they were

                    lieutenant-general charged with the protection of that quarter, set sail with
                    his fleet equipped and prepared, having put on board of ships of burthen such
                    soldiers as there was not room for in the men of war, and reached Oricum on the

                    slight garrison, which Philip had left on his departure thence, he retook it
                    without much opposition. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Here ambassadors came
                    to him from Apollonia, stating that they were subjected to a siege because they
                    were unwilling to revolt from the Romans, and that they would not be able any
                    longer to resist the power of the Macedonians, unless a Roman force were sent
                    for their protection. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Having undertaken to
                    perform what they wished, he sent two thousand chosen armed men in ships of war
                    to the mouth of the river, under the command of Quintus Naevius Crista, prefect
                    of the allies, a man of enterprise, and experienced in military affairs.
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Having landed his troops, and sent back
                    the ships to join the rest of the fleet at Oricum, whence he had come, he
                    marched his troops at a distance from the river, by a way not guarded at all by
                    the king's party, and entered the city by night, so that none of the enemy

                    Apollonia, together with the arms and resources of the city. Having derived
                    considerable confidence from a review and inspection of these, and at the same
                    time discovering from scouts the supineness and negligence which prevailed among
                    the enemy, he marched out of the city during the dead <pb n="945" xml:id="p.945"

                    the camp of the enemy, which was in such a neglected and exposed state, that it
                    was quite clear that a thousand men had passed the rampart before any one
                    perceived them, and that had they abstained from putting them to the sword, they
                    might have penetrated to the royal pavilion. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    The killing of those who were nearest the gate aroused the enemy; and in
                    consequence, they were all seized with such alarm and dismay, that not only none
                    of the rest attempted to take arms or endeavour to expel the enemy from the

                    himself to flight, in a manner half naked and just as he was when roused from
                    his sleep, hurried away to the river and his ships in a garb scarcely decent for
                    a private soldier, much less for a king. Thither also the rest of the multitude
                    fled with the utmost precipitation. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Little

                    into their city the catapults, ballistas, and other engines which had been got
                    together for the purpose of assaulting their city, for the protection of their

                    among them. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The Romans first encamped at a
                    place called the High Camp, which is remarkable for the death of the great

                    a fortress strongly defended by works, and thither they had previously conveyed
                    corn; but as the whole circumjacent country was full of enemy's troops, and the
                    Roman army on its march had been charged by the cavalry of the enemy without
                    being able to take revenge upon them, two thousand men, who either loitered
                    behind or had strayed through the fields, having been slain, the Romans quitted
                    this place to get nearer to a friendly country, and fortified a camp at the
                    mount of Victory. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> To this place came Cneius
                    Scipio with all his forces, and Hasdrubal, son of Gisgo, and a third
                    Carthaginian general, with a complete army, all of whom took up a position
                    opposite the Roman camp and on the other side the river. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> Publius Scipio, going out with some light troops to take a
                    view of the surrounding country, was observed by the enemy; and he would have
                    been overpowered in the open plain, had he not seized an eminence near him.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Here too he was closely invested, but was
                    rescued from the troops which environed him by the arrival of his brother.
                    Castulo, a city of Spain, so strong and celebrated, and so closely connected
                    with the Carthaginians, that Hannibal had taken a wife from it, revolted to the
                    Romans. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The Carthaginians commenced the siege
                    of Illiturgi, because there was a Roman garrison in it; and it seemed that they
                    would carry the place, chiefly in consequence of a lack of provisions.
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Cneius Scipio, setting out with a legion
                    lightly equipped, in order to bring succour to his allies and the garrison,
                    entered the city, passing between the two camps of the enemy, and slaying a
                    great number of them. The next day also he sallied out and fought with equal
                    success. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Above twelve thousand were slain in
                    the two battles, more than a thousand made prisoners, and thirty-six military
                    standards captured. In consequence of this they retired from Illiturgi.
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> After this the siege of Bigerra, a city
                    which was also in alliance with the Romans, was commenced by the Carthaginians;
                    but Scipio coming up, raised the siege without experiencing any opposition. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The Carthaginians then removed their camp to
                    Munda, whither the Romans speedily followed them. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> Here a pitched battle was fought, which lasted almost four
                    hours; and while the Romans were carrying all before them in the most glorious
                    manner, the signal for retreat was sounded, because the thigh of Cneius Scipio
                    had been transfixed with a javelin. <pb n="947" xml:id="p.947"/> The soldiers
                    round about him were thrown into a state of great alarm, lest the wound should
                    be mortal. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> However, there was no doubt but
                    that if they had not been prevented by the intervention of this accident, they
                    might have taken the Carthaginian camp that day. By this time, not only the men,
                    but the elephants, were driven quite up to the rampart; and even upon the top of
                    it nine and thirty elephants were pierced with spears. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> In this battle, too, as many as twelve thousand are said to
                    have been slain, nearly three thousand captured, with fifty-seven military
                    standards. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The Carthaginians retired thence to
                    the city Auringis, whither the Romans followed them, in order to take advantage
                    of their terror. Here Scipio again fought them, having been carried into the
                    field in a small litter; the victory was decisive; but not half so many of the
                    enemy were slain as before, because fewer survived to fight. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> But this family, which possessed a natural talent at
                    renewing war and restoring its effects, in a short time recruited their army,
                    Mago having been sent by his brother to press soldiers, and assumed courage to
                    try the issue of a fresh struggle. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Though the
                    soldiers were for the most part different, yet as they fought in a cause which
                    had so often been unsuccessful within the space of a few days, they carried into
                    the field the same state of mind as those which had been engaged before, and the
                    issue of the battle was similar. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> More than
                    eight thousand were slain, not much less than a thousand captured, with
                    fifty-eight military standards. The greater part of the spoils had belonged to
                    the Gauls, consisting of golden chains and bracelets in great numbers. Also two
                    distinguished Gallic petty princes, whose names were Mœnicaptus and Civismarus,
                    fell in this battle. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Eight elephants were
                    captured and three slain. When affairs went on so prosperously in Spain, the
                    Romans began to feel ashamed that Saguntum, on account of which the war had
                    originated, should continue for now the eighth year in the power of the enemy.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Accordingly, having expelled by force the
                    Carthaginian garrison, they retook that town, and restored it to such of the

                    between that people and the Carthaginians, they reduced under their power, sold

                    orders were given to enlist two legions for the city, and twenty thousand men
                    from the allies. With these leaders and these forces did they fortify the Roman
                    empire against the many wars which had either actually broken out, or were

                    enlisting the city legions and raising troops to make up the numbers of the

                    were reported. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> A wall and a gate had been
                    struck by lightning; and at Aricia even the temple of Jupiter had been struck by
                    lightning. Other illusions of the eyes and ears were credited as realities. An
                    appearance as of ships had been seen in the river at Tarracina, when there were
                    none there. A clashing of arms was heard in the temple of Jupiter Vicilinus, in
                    the territory of Compsa; and a river at Amiternum had flowed bloody. <milestone

                    decree of the pontiffs, the consuls set out, Sempronius for Lucania, Fabius for
                    Apulia. The father of the latter came into the camp at Suessula, as his
                    lieutenant-general; and when the son advanced to meet him, the lictors, out of
                    respect for his dignity, went on in silence. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    The old man rode past eleven of the fasces, when the consul ordered the lictor
                    nearest to him to take care, and he called to him to dismount; then at length
                    dismounting, he exclaimed, <quote>I wished to try, my son, whether you were duly

                        would seem to aggravate his baseness by recompensing those whom he had
                        formerly betrayed, by fresh betrayal. That a man whose custom it was to
                        espouse one side, while his heart was on another, was unworthy of confidence
                        as an ally, and contemptible as an enemy; that he ought to be made a third

                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> On the other hand, Fabius, the father of the

                        on the contrary, they urge that an example ought to be made of any who might

                    was excited, as if they had lost their leader, and, from the apprehension of
                    some attempt to alter the present state of things, messengers were immediately
                    despatched to Hannibal. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> With this the
                    Carthaginian was far from being displeased, both because he had long regarded
                    the man himself with suspicion, as one of doubtful fidelity, and because he had

                    about the siege of Arpi; and having pitched his camp about half a mile from it,
                    he took a near view of the site and walls of the city, and resolved to attack
                    it, in preference, in that quarter where it was most secured by works, and where
                    the least care was taken in guarding it. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> After
                    getting all things together which could be of use in besieging a city, he
                    selected the most efficient of the centurions out of the whole army, placing
                    them under the command of tribunes of approved valour, and giving them six
                    hundred soldiers, a number which was thought sufficient for the purpose. These
                    he ordered to bring the scaling ladders to the place which he had marked out, as

                        unit="section"/> In this part there was a low and narrow gate, opening into
                    a street which was little frequented, and which led through a deserted part of
                    the city. He ordered them, after scaling the wall, to proceed to this gate, and
                    break down the bars on the inside by force; and when they were in possession of
                    that part of the city, to give a signal with a cornet, that the rest of the
                    troops might be brought up, observing, that he would have every thing prepared
                    and ready. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> These orders were executed
                    promptly; and that which seemed likely to impede their operations, served more
                    than any thing to conceal them. A shower of rain, which came on suddenly at
                    midnight, compelled the guards and watches to slip away from their posts, <pb

                    first prevented their hearing that which was made by the men in breaking open
                    the gate. Afterwards, when it fell upon the ear more gently and uniformly, it
                    lulled a great number of the men to sleep. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    After they had secured possession of the gate, they placed cornet-players in the
                    street at equal distances, and desired them to sound, in order to call the
                    consul. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> This being done according to the plan
                    previously agreed upon, the consul ordered the troops to march, and a little

                    on at first in the dark, and in the narrow streets, the Romans having seized not

                    before the consul, and after exchanging assurances in the midst of the standards
                    and the troops, the Arpinians suddenly turned their arms against the

                    Spaniards also, little less than a thousand in number, after only stipulating

                    out unmolested, in conformity with the stipulation, they joined Hannibal in
                    Salapia. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Thus was Arpi restored to the

                    into Spain, to receive the ratification of the alliance from the Roman generals.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> He gave it in charge to the same persons,
                    forthwith to induce the Numidians, who were serving as auxiliaries among the
                    Carthaginian troops, to go over to the other side. <milestone n="11"
                        unit="section"/> Statorius raised a body of infantry for the king out of the
                    large number of young men which he found; and having formed them into companies,
                    in close imitation of the Roman method, taught them to follow their standards
                    and keep their ranks when being marshalled, and when performing their
                    evolutions; <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> and he so habituated them to
                    military works and other military duties, that in a short time the king relied
                    not more on his cavalry than on his infantry; and in a regular and pitched
                    battle, fought on a level plain, he overcame his enemies, the Carthaginians.
                        <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> In Spain also the arrival of the king's
                    ambassadors was of the greatest advantage to the Romans, for at the news thereof
                    the Numidians began <pb n="955" xml:id="p.955"/> rapidly to pass over. Thus the
                    Romans and Syphax were united in friendship, which the Carthaginians hearing of,
                    immediately sent ambassadors to Gala, who reigned in another part of Numidia,
                    over a nation called Massylians. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Gala had a son named Masinissa, seventeen
                    years of age, but a youth of such talents, that even at that time it was evident
                    that he would render the kingdom more extensive and powerful than when he
                    received it. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The ambassadors represented that,
                        <quote> since Syphax had united himself with the Romans, that by their
                        alliance he might strengthen his hands against the kings and nations of
                        Africa, it would be better for Gala also to unite with the Carthaginians as
                        soon as possible, before Syphax crossed over into Spain, or the Romans into
                        Africa; that Syphax might be overpowered, while as yet he derived nothing
                        from his league with the Romans but the name of it. </quote>
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Gala, his son claiming to be intrusted with
                    the conduct of the war, was easily prevailed upon to send an army, <milestone
                        n="4??" unit="section"/> which, joined by the legions of the Carthaginians,
                    totally defeated Syphax in a great battle. In this thirty thousand men are said
                    to have been slain. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Syphax, with a few
                    horsemen, fled from the field, and took refuge among the Maurusian Numidians, a
                    nation dwelling at the extremity of Africa, near the ocean, and over against
                    Gades. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> But the barbarians flocking to his
                    standard from all sides, in consequence of his great renown, he speedily armed a
                    very large force. Before he passed over with these forces into Spain, which was
                    separated only by a narrow strait, Masinissa came up with his victorious army;
                    and here he acquired great glory in the prosecution of the war with Syphax, in
                    which he acted alone and unsupported by any aid from the Carthaginians.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> In Spain nothing worth mentioning was
                    performed, except that the Romans drew over to their side the Celtiberian youth,
                    by giving them the same pay which they had stipulated with the Carthaginians to
                    pay them. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> They also sent above three hundred
                    Spaniards of the greatest distinction into Italy, to bring over their
                    countrymen, who served among the auxiliary troops of Hannibal. The only
                    memorable circumstance of this year in Spain was, that the Romans then, for the
                    first time, employed mercenary troops in their camp, namely, the Celtibe- rians.
