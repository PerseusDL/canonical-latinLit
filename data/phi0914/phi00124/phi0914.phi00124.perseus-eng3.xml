                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> After his return to Bruttium, Hanno, with
                        the assistance and guidance of the Bruttians, made an attempt on the Greek
                        cities. They were steadfast in their adherence to Rome, and all the more so
                        because they saw that the Bruttians, whom they feared and hated, were taking
                        sides with the Carthaginians. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Rhegium was
                        the first place he attempted, and several days were spent there without any
                        result. Meanwhile the Locrians were hastily carrying their corn and wood and
                        everything else they might want out of the fields into the city, not only
                        for safety, but also that no plunder whatever might be left for the enemy.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Every day larger numbers of people
                        poured out of all the gates, till at last only those remained in the city
                        whose duty it was to repair the walls and gates and provide a store of
                        weapons on the ramparts. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Against this
                        miscellaneous crowd of all ranks and ages wandering through the fields
                        mostly unarmed, Hamilcar sent his cavalry with orders not to injure any one
                        but simply to scatter them in flight and then cut them off from returning to
                        the city. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> He had taken up his position
                        upon some high ground where he had a view of the country and the city, and
                        he sent orders to one of the Bruttian cohorts to go up to the walls and
                        invite the principal men of the place to a conference, and if they consented
                        they were to endeavour to persuade them to betray the city, promising them,
                        if they did so, Hannibal's friendship. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The
                        conference took place, but no credence was placed in what the Bruttians
                        said, until the Carthaginians showed themselves on the hills and a few who
                        escaped to the city brought the news that the whole population was in the
                        hands of the enemy. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Unnerved by terror
                        they replied that they would consult the people, and a meeting was at once
                        convened. All who were restless and discontented preferred a fresh policy
                        and a fresh alliance, whilst those whose kinsfolk had been shut out of the
                        city by the enemy felt as much pledged as though they had given hostages.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> A few were in favour of maintaining
                        their loyalty to Rome, but they kept silence rather than venture to defend
                        their opinion. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> A resolution was passed
                        with apparent unanimity in favour of surrendering to the Carthaginians. L.
                        Atilius, the commandant of the garrison, and his men were conducted down to
                        the harbour and placed on board ship for conveyance to Regium; Hamilcar and
                        his Carthaginians were received into the city on the understanding that a
                        treaty with equal rights should be at once concluded. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> This condition was within a very little of being
                        broken, for the Carthaginians charged the Locrians with treachery in sending
                        away the Romans, whilst the Locrians pleaded that they had escaped.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Some cavalry went in pursuit in case
                        the tide in the straits should either delay the departure of the ships or
                        drift them ashore. They did not overtake those whom they were in pursuit of,
                        but they saw some other ships crossing the straits from Messana to Regium.
                        These were Roman soldiers who had been sent by Claudius to hold the city.
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> So the Carthaginians at once retired
                        from Regium. By Hannibal's orders peace was granted to the Locrians; they
                        were to be independent and live under their own laws; <milestone n="13"
                            unit="section"/> the city was to be open to the Carthaginians, the
                        Locrians were to have sole control of the harbour, and the alliance was to
                        be based on the principle of mutual support: the Carthaginians were to help
                        the Locrians and the Locrians the Carthaginians in peace and in war. </p>
                </div>
                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="2" type="chapter">
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Thus the Carthaginians marched back from
                        the straits amidst the protests of the Bruttians, who complained that the
                        cities which they had marked for themselves for plunder had been left
                        unmolested. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> They determined to act on
                        their own account, and after enrolling and arming 15,000 of their own
                        fighting men they proceeded to attack Croto, a Greek city situated on the
                        coast. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> They imagined that they would gain
                        an immense accession of strength if they possessed a seaport with a strongly
                        fortified harbour. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> What troubled them was
                        that they could not quite venture to summon the Carthaginians to their aid
                        lest they should be thought not to have acted as allies ought to act, and
                        again, if the Carthaginian should for the second time be the advocate of
                        peace rather than of war, they were afraid that they would fight in vain
                        against the freedom of Croto as they had against that of Locri. <milestone
                            n="5" unit="section"/> It seemed the best course to send to Hannibal and
                        obtain from him an assurance that on its capture Croto should pass to the
                        Bruttians. Hannibal told them that it was a matter for those on the spot to
                        arrange and referred them to Hanno, <milestone n="6??" unit="section"/> for
                        neither he nor Hanno wanted that famous and wealthy city to be plundered,
                        and they hoped that when the Bruttians attacked it and it was seen that the
                        Carthaginians neither assisted nor approved of the attack, the defenders
                        would come over to Hannibal all the sooner. </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> In Croto there was neither unity of
                        purpose nor of feeling; it seemed as though a disease had attacked all the
                        cities of Italy alike, everywhere the populace were hostile to the
                        aristocracy. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The senate of Croto were in
                        favour of the Romans, the populace wanted to place their state in the hands
                        of the Carthaginians. This division of opinion in the city was reported by a
                        deserter to the Bruttians. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> According to
                        his statements, Aristomachus was the leader of the populace and was urging
                        the surrender of the city, which was extensive and thickly populated, with
                        fortifications covering a large area. The positions where the senators kept
                        watch and ward were few and scattered, wherever the populace kept guard the
                        way lay open into the city. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> At the
                        suggestion of the deserter and under his guidance the Bruttians completely
                        invested the town, and at the very first assault were admitted by the
                        populace and took possession of the whole place with the exception of the
                        citadel. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> This was held by the
                        aristocrats, who had prepared it beforehand as a place of refuge in case
                        anything of this sort should happen. Aristomachus, too, fled there, and gave
                        out that he had advised the surrender of the city to the Carthaginians, not
                        to the Bruttians. </p>
                </div>
                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="3" type="chapter">
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Before Pyrrhus' arrival in Italy, the city
                        of Croto had walls which formed a circuit of twelve miles. <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> After the devastation caused by that war hardly half
                        the place was inhabited; the river which used to flow through the middle of
                        the city now ran outside the part where the houses were, and the citadel was
                        at a considerable distance from them. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                        Sixteen miles from this famous city there was a still more famous temple to
                        Juno Lacinia, an object of veneration to all the surrounding communities.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> There was a grove here enclosed by a
                        dense wood and lofty fir-trees, in the middle of which there was a glade
                        affording delightful pasture. In this glade cattle of every kind, sacred to
                        the goddess, used to feed without any one to <milestone n="5??"
                            unit="section"/> look after them, and at nightfall the different herds
                        separated each to their own stalls without any beasts of prey lying in wait
                        for them or any human hands to steal them. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        These cattle were a source of great profit, and a column of solid gold was
                        made from the money thus gained and dedicated to the goddess. <milestone
                            n="7" unit="section"/> Thus the temple became celebrated for its wealth
                        as well as for its sanctity, and as generally happens in these famous spots,
                        some miracles also were attributed to it. It was commonly reported that an
                        altar stood in the porch of the temple, the ashes on which were never

                        its natural position; afterwards it was further protected by a wall, on the
                        side where Dionysius, the Sicilian tyrant, had captured it by stratagem,

                        It was this citadel that the aristocrats of Croto now occupied, regarding it

                        Aristomachus, finding himself powerless to persuade them to surrender and
                        not getting any opportunity of betraying the citadel as he had betrayed the
                        city, went off by himself to Hanno. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                        Shortly after some envoys from Locri, who had, with Hanno's permission,
                        obtained access to the citadel, persuaded them to suffer themselves to be
                        transferred to Locri instead of facing the last extremity. <milestone n="15"

                        is said, seeing what was going to happen, was anxious at the close of his

                        His project met with the most determined opposition from his daughters. They
                        imagined that whilst the boy retained the name of king, the supreme power

                        in his thoughts. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> So all he could do was to
                        leave fifteen guardians for his son, and he implored them on his deathbed to

                        for fifty years, and to see to it that the young man, above all things,
                        followed in his footsteps and adhered to the principles in which he had been
                        brought up. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Such were his instructions.
                        When the king had breathed his last the guardians produced the will and
                        brought the boy, who was then about fifteen, before the assembled people.

                        assuming the government; by himself resigning the guardianship which he
                        shared with several others, he concentrated all their powers in his own

                        more keenly felt, showed on his very first appearance in public how

                        their countrymen, now saw Hieronymus clad in purple, wearing a diadem,
                        surrounded by an armed escort, and sometimes even proceeding from his palace
                        in a <milestone n="4??" unit="section"/> chariot drawn by four white horses,
                        after the style of Dionysius the tyrant. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                        Quite in harmony with this extravagant assumption of state and pomp was the
                        contempt he showed for everybody; the insolent tone in which he addressed
                        those who sought audiences of him; the way he made himself difficult of
                        access not only to strangers but even to his guardians; his monstrous lusts;
                        his inhuman cruelty. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Such terror seized
                        everybody that some of his guardians anticipated a death of torture by
                        suicide or flight. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Three of them, the only

                        Hiero's sons-in-law, and a certain Thraso, did not rouse much interest in
                        him when talking of other matters, but as two of them took the side of the
                        Carthaginians and Thraso that of the Romans, their heated arguments and
                        quarrels attracted the young king's attention. <milestone n="8"

                        disclosed by a certain Callo, a lad of about the same age as Hieronymus and
                        accustomed from his boyhood to associate with him on terms of perfect

                        at once arrested and handed over to Andranodorus for torture. He confessed
                        his own complicity without any hesitation, but was silent about the others.
                        At last, when he was racked with tortures too terrible for human endurance,
                        he pretended to be overcome by his sufferings, and instead of disclosing the

                        against an innocent man, and falsely accused Thraso of being the ringleader

                        them they would never have ventured upon so serious an undertaking.
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> He went on inventing his story amidst
                        groans of anguish and mentioning names just as they occurred to him, taking

                        is only right that you should exercise your franchise in the election of
                        consuls with as much circumspection as you show when going armed into
                        battle. Every man must say to himself, 'I am nominating a consul who is to

                        against a veteran and permanent strategist who is not shackled by any

                        not such that I can place private relationship before the welfare of the

                        is really a pilot. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> We are not sailing now
                        in smooth water, already we have almost foundered in the many storms that
                        have overtaken us, and therefore you must use the utmost foresight and
                        caution in choosing the man who is to take the helm. </p>
                    <p> "As for you, T. Otacilius, we have had some experience of your conduct of
                        comparatively unimportant operations, and you have certainly not shown any
                        grounds for our entrusting you with more important ones. <milestone n="14"
                            unit="section"/> There were three objects for which we equipped the
                        fleet this year which you commanded: it was to ravage the African coast, to
                        render the coast of Italy safe for us, and, what was most important of all,
                        to prevent any reinforcements, money, or supplies from being sent from

                        carried out-I will not say all, but-any one of these objects for the State,
                        then by all means elect him consul. But if, whilst you were in command of
                        the fleet, everything required reached Hannibal safe and sound from home, if
                        the coast of Italy has this year been in greater danger than the coast of

                        nominate a Dictator, and you could not take it as an insult that somebody
                        amongst all the citizens of Rome was looked upon as a better strategist than
                        yourself. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> It is of more importance to
                        you, T. Otacilius, than it can be to any one else that you should not have a

                        the instructions of the senate, published an order to meet the case. Every
                        one who had been assessed or whose father had been assessed in the
                        censorship of L. Aemilius and C. Flaminius at from 50,000 to 100,000 ases or
                        whose property had since reached that amount, was to furnish one sailor with
                        six months' pay; <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> those whose assessment
                        was from 100,000 to 300,000 were to supply three sailors with twelve months'
                        pay; from 300,000 to 1,000,000 the contribution was to be five sailors, and
                        above that amount seven. The senators were to furnish eight sailors and a
                        year's pay. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The sailors forthcoming under
                        this order, after being armed and equipped by their masters, went on board
                        with thirty days' rations. This was the first occasion on which a Roman
                        fleet was manned by seamen provided at private cost. </p>

                        preparations were made threw the Campanians into a state of consternation;
                        they were in dread lest the Romans should begin their campaigns for the year
                        by besieging Capua. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> So they sent to
                        Hannibal imploring him to move his army to Capua; fresh armies, they
                        informed him, had been raised in Rome with a view to attacking them, and
                        there was no city whose defection the Romans more bitterly resented than
                        theirs. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Owing to the urgency of the
                        message, Hannibal felt he ought to lose no time in case the Romans
                        anticipated him, and leaving Arpi he took up his position in his old camp at
                        Tifata, overlooking Capua. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Leaving his
                        Numidians and Spaniards to protect the camp and Capua at the same time, he
                        descended with the rest of his army to Lake Avernus, ostensibly for the
                        purpose of offering sacrifice, but really to make an attempt on Puteoli and

                        night and day, and sent orders to Ti. Gracchus to move his forces from
                        Luceria to Beneventum, whilst Q. Fabius, the praetor, the consul's son, was
                        instructed to take Gracchus' place at Luceria. <milestone n="7"

                        visited by five young nobles from Tarentum who had been made prisoners, some
                        at Trasumennus and the others at Cannae, and afterwards sent to their homes
                        with the same courteous treatment that the Carthaginian had shown to all the
                        allies of Rome. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> They told him that they
                        had not forgotten his kindness, and out of gratitude had persuaded most of
                        the younger men in Tarentum to choose the friendship and alliance of
                        Hannibal in preference to that of the Romans; they had been sent by their
                        compatriots to ask him to march his army nearer to Tarentum. <milestone
                            n="3" unit="section"/> "If only," they declared, "your standards and
                        camp are visible at Tarentum, there will be no hesitation in making the city
                        over to you. The populace is in the hands of the younger men, and the
                        government of Tarentum is in the hands of the populace." <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> Hannibal expressed his warm approval of their
                        sentiments, loaded them with splendid promises, and bade them return home to
                        mature their plans. He would himself be with them at the right time. With
                        this hope the Tarentines were dismissed. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                        Hannibal himself was extremely anxious to gain possession of Tarentum; he
                        saw that it was a wealthy and famous city, and, what was more, it was a
                        maritime city on the coast opposite Macedonia, and as the Romans were
                        holding Brundisium, this would be the port that King Philip would make for
                        if he sailed to Italy. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> After performing
                        the sacred rites which were the object of his coming, and having during his
                        stay laid waste the territory of Cumae as far as the promontory of Misenum,
                        he suddenly marched to Puteoli, hoping to surprise the Roman garrison.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> There were 6000 troops there, and the
                        place was not only one of great strength, but had also been strongly
                        fortified. The Carthaginian spent three days there in attempting the
                        fortress on every side, and as he met with no success he proceeded to ravage
                        the district round Naples, more out of disappointed rage than in hopes of
                        gaining possession of the city. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The
                        populace of Nola, who had long been disaffected towards Rome and at variance
                        with their own senate, were greatly excited by his presence in a territory
                        so close to their own. Their envoys accordingly came to invite Hannibal and
                        brought him a positive assurance that the city would be delivered up to him.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Their design was forestalled by the
                        consul Marcellus, who had been summoned by the leading citizens. <milestone

                        night he threw into Nola 6000 infantry and 500 cavalry as a protection to
                        the senate. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> While the consul was acting
                        with the utmost energy in making Nola safe against attack, Hannibal was
                        losing time, and after two unsuccessful attempts was less inclined to put
                        faith in the populace of Nola. </p>

                        made an attempt on Casilinum, which was held by a Carthaginian garrison,
                        while, as though they were acting in concert, Hanno, marching from Bruttium
                        with a strong body of horse and foot, reached Beneventum on the one side and
                        Ti. Gracchus, from Luceria, approached it in the opposite direction.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He got into the town first, and
                        hearing that Hanno had encamped by the river Caloris about three miles from
                        the city and was ravaging the country, he moved out of the place and fixed
                        his camp about a mile from the enemy. Here he harangued his troops. His
                        legions were composed mostly of volunteer slaves who had made up their minds
                        to earn their liberty, without murmuring, by another year's service rather
                        than demand it openly. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He had, however, on
                        leaving his winter quarters noticed that there were discontented "rumblings
                        going on in the army, men were asking whether they would ever serve as free
                        men. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> In consequence of this he had sent a
                        despatch to the senate in which he stated that the question was not so much
                        what they wanted as what they deserved; they had rendered him good and
                        gallant service up to that day, and they only fell short of the standard of
                        regular soldiers in the matter of personal freedom. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> On that point permission had been granted to him to do
                        what he thought best in the interests of the State. So before closing with
                        the enemy he announced that the hour which they had so long hoped for, when
                        they would gain their freedom, had now come. <milestone n="6" unit="section"
                        /> The next day he was going to fight a pitched battle in a free and open
                        plain where there would be full scope for true courage without any fear of
                        ambuscade. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Whoever brought back the head
                        of an enemy would be at once by his orders declared to be a free man;
                        whoever quitted his place in the ranks he would punish with a slave's death.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Every man's fortune was in his own
                        hands. It was not he alone that guaranteed their liberty, but the consul
                        Marcellus also and the whole of the senate whom he had consulted and who had
                        left the question of their liberty to him. He then read the despatch from
                        Marcellus and the resolution passed in the senate. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> These were greeted with a loud and ringing cheer. They

                        The soldiers were in high spirits, those especially who had the prospect of
                        earning their freedom by one day's strenuous work, and they spent the rest

                        led his forces into the field, and the enemy showed no slackness in meeting
                        him. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He had 17,000 infantry, mostly
                        Bruttians and Lucanians, and 1200 cavalry, amongst whom were very few
                        Italians, the rest were almost all Numidians and Moors. The battle was a
                        severe and protracted one; for four hours neither side gained any advantage.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Nothing hampered the Romans more than
                        the setting a price upon the heads of their foes, the price of liberty, for

                        than he <milestone n="4??" unit="section"/> lost time in cutting off his
                        head-a difficult matter in the tumult and turmoil of the battle-and then, as

                        were no longer able to fight, and the battle was left to the slow and the
                        timid. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The military tribunes reported to
                        their general that not a man of the enemy was being wounded as he stood,
                        whilst those who had fallen were being butchered and the soldiers were

                        throw down the heads and attack the enemy, and to tell them that their
                        courage was sufficiently clear and conspicuous, and that there would be no
                        question about liberty for brave men. On this the fighting was renewed and
                        even the cavalry were sent against the enemy. <milestone n="7"

                        amongst the infantry, making the issue of the contest again uncertain. The
                        generals on both sides now appealed to their men; the Roman pointed to the
                        Bruttians and Lucanians who had been so often defeated and crushed by their
                        ancestors; the Carthaginian showered contempt upon Roman slaves and soldiers
                        taken out of the workshops. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> At last
                        Gracchus gave out that there would be no hope whatever of liberty if the

                        in such haste and panic that not even in the gates or on the rampart was
                        there any attempt at resistance. The Romans followed almost on their heels
                        and commenced a fresh battle inside the enemies' rampart. Here the
                        combatants had less space to move and the battle was all the more bloody.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The prisoners in the camp also helped

                        battle. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Then turning to the volunteer
                        slaves he said that he would much rather have praised all alike, whether
                        deserving or undeserving, than that any man should be punished that day.
                        "And," he continued, "I pray that what I am now doing may prove to be for
                        the benefit, happiness, and felicity of yourselves and of the commonwealth-I
                        bid you all be free." <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> At these words they
                        broke out into a storm of cheering; <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> at

                        lifted up their hands to heaven and prayed that every blessing might descend
                        upon the people of Rome and upon Gracchus himself. <milestone n="11"
                            unit="section"/> Gracchus continued: "Before making you all equal as
                        free men I did not want to affix any mark by which the brave soldier could
                        be distinguished from the coward, but now that the State has fulfilled its
                        promise to you I shall not let all distinction between courage and cowardice
                        be lost. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> I shall require the names to be
                        brought to me of those who, conscious of their skulking in battle, lately
                        seceded from us, and when they have been summoned before me I shall make
                        each of them take an oath that he will never as long as he is with the
                        colours, unless prevented by illness, take his meals other than standing.
                            <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> You will be quite reconciled to this
                        small penalty when you reflect that it would have been impossible to mark
                        you with any lighter stigma for your cowardice." </p>

                        <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> He then gave orders for the tents and
                        other things to be packed up, and the soldiers carrying their plunder or
                        driving it in front of them with mirth and jest returned to Beneventum in
                        such happy laughing spirits that they seemed to be coming back after a day
                        of revelry rather than after a day of battle. <milestone n="15"
                            unit="section"/> The whole population of Beneventum poured out in crowds

                        and congratulated the soldiers and invited them to partake of their
                        hospitality. Tables had been spread for them all in the forecourts of the
                        houses; the citizens invited the men and begged Gracchus to allow his troops
                        to enjoy a feast. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> Gracchus consented on
                        condition that they all banqueted in public view, and each citizen brought
                        out his provision and placed his tables in front of his door. <milestone
                            n="18" unit="section"/> The volunteers, now no longer slaves, wore white
                        caps or fillets of white wool round their heads at the feast; some were
                        reclining, others remained standing, waiting on the others and taking their
                        food at the same time. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> Gracchus thought
                        the scene worth commemorating, and on his return to Rome he ordered a
                        representation of that celebrated day to be painted in the temple of
                        Liberty; the temple which his father had built and dedicated on the Aventine

                        his approach he sent for Pomponius, the propraetor, to join him with the
                        army which was in camp above Suessula, and prepared to meet the enemy
                        without delay. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He sent C. Claudius Nero
                        with the best of the cavalry out through the camp gate which was furthest
                        from the enemy, in the dead of night, with instructions to ride round to the
                        rear of the enemy without being observed and follow him slowly, and when he
                        saw the battle begin, throw himself across his rear. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> Nero was unable to follow out his instructions, whether
                        because he lost his way or because he had not sufficient time is uncertain.
                        The battle commenced in his absence and the Romans undoubtedly had the
                        advantage, but owing to the cavalry not making their appearance in time the
                        general's plans were all upset. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Marcellus
                        did not venture to pursue the retreating Carthaginians, and gave the signal
                        for retreat though his soldiers were actually conquering. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> It is asserted that more than 2000 of the enemy were
                        killed that day, whilst the Romans lost less than 400. About sunset Nero
                        returned with his horses and men tired out to no purpose and without having
                        even seen the enemy. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> He was severely
                        censured by the consul who even went so far as to say that it was entirely

                        crushing as the one at Cannae. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The next
                        day the Romans marched into the field, but the Carthaginian remained in
                        camp, thereby tacitly admitting that he was vanquished. The following day he
                        gave up all hope of gaining possession of Nola, his attempts having been
                        always foiled, and proceeded to Tarentum, where he had better hopes of
                        securing the place through treachery. </p>

                        during the war, just as constitutions enfeebled by long illness naturally
                        develop other evils. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> They began by
                        summoning before them those who were reported to have formed plans for
                        abandoning Italy after the defeat of Cannae; the principal person concerned,

                        censors pronounced them guilty of having uttered treasonable language both
                        privately and publicly in order that a conspiracy might be formed for
                        abandoning Italy. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Next to these were
                        summoned those who had been too clever in explaining how they were absolved
                        from their oath, the prisoners who imagined that when they had furtively
                        gone back, after once starting, to Hannibal's camp they were released from
                        the oath which they had taken to return. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        In their case and in that of those above mentioned, all who possessed horses

                        from their tribes and disfranchised. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Nor

                        was followed by severe action on the part of the senate. They passed a
                        resolution that all those whom the censors had degraded were to serve as
                        foot soldiers and be sent to the remains of the army of Cannae in Sicily.
                        This class of soldiers was only to terminate its service when the enemy had

                        were frequently approached by those who had been in the habit of tendering

                        Campanians and 700 of Hannibal's troops. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                        Statius Metius had been sent by Gnaevius Magius of Atella, who was the

                        and he sent word to his colleague at Nola that a second army would be needed
                        to hold the Campanians while he was delivering the assault, and either
                            <milestone n="4??" unit="section"/> he should come himself and leave a

                        this message Marcellus left 2000 men to protect Nola and came with the rest
                        of his army to Casilinum. His arrival put an end to any movement on the part
                        of the Campanians, and Casilinum was now besieged by both consuls.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Many of the Roman soldiers were
                        wounded by rashly venturing too near the walls, and the operations were by
                        no means successful. Fabius thought that the enterprise, which was of small
                        importance though quite as difficult as more important ones, ought to be
                        abandoned, and that they ought to go where more serious business awaited
                        them. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Marcellus urged that while there
                        were many things which a great general ought not to undertake, still, when
                        he had undertaken them, he ought not to let them drop, as in either case it
                        had great influence on public opinion. He succeeded in preventing the siege
                        from being abandoned. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Now the assault
                        commenced in earnest, and when the vineae and siege works and artillery of
                        every kind were brought against the walls, the Campanians begged Fabius to
                        be allowed to depart under safe conduct to Capua. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> After a few had got outside the town Marcellus occupied
                        the gate through which they were leaving, and an indiscriminate slaughter
                        began, first amongst those near the gate and then, after the troops burst
                        in, in the city itself. About fifty of the Campanians had already passed out
                        and they fled to Fabius, under whose protection they reached Capua.

                        troops who were made prisoners were sent to Rome and shut up in prison;

                        with a view to winning the sympathies of the Tarentines. When, however, he

                        him aside from the envoys and reminded him of an oft-quoted saying of
                        Dionysius the tyrant that one ought to relinquish sovereign power when
                        dragged by the heels not when mounted on a horse. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> It was easy for any one who wished to resign in a

                        These feminine suggestions Andranodorus did not wholly reject, nor did he at

                        the time being, so he told the envoys to take back word that he should

                        observation or being suspected of plotting a counter-revolution, they
                        approached the praetors, and through them were admitted to an audience of
                        the senate. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> They declared publicly that
                        they had been sent by Hannibal to Hieronymus as to a friend and ally; they

                        that they might have an escort to conduct them to Socri in Italy, in this
                        way the Syracusans would confer a great obligation on Hannibal with very

                        was very readily granted, for they were anxious to see the last of the

                        was a man of respectable family and position, nor did his profession in any

                        to the crown, seized, as though he were the rightful owner, what he had held
                        simply as trustee. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Then, when he was

                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> if we all pull different ways, the war
                        between the Carthaginians and the Romans will not be a more bitter one than

                        to secure unanimity. Which alliance will be the more advantageous to us is a

                        guided by the authority of Hiero in choosing our allies rather than by that
                        of Hieronymus; in any case we ought to prefer a tried friendship of fifty
                        years' standing to one of which we now know nothing and once found
                        untrustworthy. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> There is also another
                        serious consideration-we can decline to come to terms with the Carthaginians
                        without having to fear immediate hostilities with them, but with the Romans
                        it is a question of either peace or an immediate declaration of war."

                        party spirit from this speech gave it all the greater weight, and a council
                        of war was at once summoned, in which the praetors and a select number of
                        senators were joined by the officers and commanders of the auxiliaries.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> There were frequent heated
                        discussions, but finally, as there appeared to be no possible means of
                        carrying on a war with Rome, it was decided to conclude a peace and to send
                        an embassy along with the envoys who had come from Marcellus to obtain its

                        came from Leontini begging for a force to protect their territory. This
                        request seemed to afford a most favourable opportunity for relieving the
                        city of a number of insubordinate and disorderly characters and getting rid
                        of their leaders. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Hippocrates received
                        orders to march the deserters to Leontini, with these and a large body of

                        who were despatching them: the former saw the opportunity, long hoped for,
                        of effecting a revolution; the latter were thankful that the dregs of the
                        city were being cleared out. It was, however, only a temporary alleviation
                        of the disease, which afterwards became all the more aggravated. <milestone
                            n="4" unit="section"/> For Hippocrates began to devastate the country
                        adjacent to the Roman province; at first making stealthy raids, then, when
                        Appius had sent a detachment to protect the fields of the allies of Rome, he
                        made an attack with his entire force upon one of the outposts and inflicted
                        heavy loss. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> When Marcellus was informed of
                        this he promptly sent envoys to Syracuse to say that the peace they had
                        guaranteed was broken, and that an occasion of war would never be wanting
                        until Hippocrates and Epicydes had been banished far away, not only from
                        Syracuse, but from Sicily. Epicydes feared that if he remained he should be
                        held responsible for the misdeeds of his absent brother, and also should be
                        unable to do his share in stirring up war, so he left for Leontini, and
                        finding the people there sufficiently exasperated against Rome, he tried to
                        detach them from Syracuse as well. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> "The
                        Syracusans," he said, "have concluded a peace with Rome on condition that

                        also think it right that they should be free, and that for two reasons; it
                        was on Leontine soil that the tyrant fell, and it was at Leontini that the
                        cry of liberty was first raised, and from Leontini the people flocked to
                        Syracuse, after deserting the royal leaders. Either that provision of the
                        treaty must be struck out, or if it is insisted upon, the treaty must not be

                        the defiant reply that the Leontines had given no mandate to the Syracusans
                        to conclude a treaty with Rome, nor were they bound by any compacts which

                        against Leontini and summoned Appius to attack it on the opposite side. The

                        actually going on that they carried the place at the first assault.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> When Hippocrates and Epicydes saw that
                        the enemy were getting possession of the walls and bursting in the gates,
                        they retreated with a small following to the citadel, and during the night
                        made their escape secretly to Herbesus. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                        The Syracusans had already started with an army of 8000 men, and were met at
                        the river Myla with the news that the city was captured. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> The rest of the message was mostly false: their
                        informant told them that there had been an indiscriminate massacre of
                        soldiers and civilians, and he thought that not a single adult was left
                        alive; the city had been looted and the property of the wealthy citizens
                        given to the troops. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> On receiving this
                        shocking intelligence the army halted; there was great excitement in all
                        ranks, and the generals, Sosis and Dinomenes, consulted as to what was to be
                        done. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> What lent a certain plausibility to
                        the story and afforded apparent grounds for alarm was the scourging and
                        beheading of as <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/> many as two thousand
                        deserters, but otherwise not one of the Leontines or the regular troops had
                        been injured after the city was taken and every man's property was restored
                        to him beyond what had been destroyed in the first confusion of the assault.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The men could not be induced to
                        continue their march to Leontini, though they loudly protested that their
                        comrades had <milestone n="9??" unit="section"/> been given up to massacre,
                        nor would they consent to remain where they were and wait for more definite
                        intelligence. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The praetors saw that they
                        were inclined to mutiny, but they did not believe that the excitement would
                        last long if those who were leading them in their folly were put out of the
                        way. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> They conducted the army to Megara
                        and rode on with a small body of cavalry to Herbesus, hoping in the general
                        panic to secure the betrayal of the place. <milestone n="12" unit="section"
                        /> As this attempt failed, they resolved to resort to force, and the
                        following day marched from Megara with the intention of attacking Herbesus
                        with their full strength. Now that all hope was cut off, Hippocrates and
                        Epicydes thought that their only course, and that not at first sight a very
                        safe one, was to give themselves up to the soldiers, who knew them well, and
                        were highly incensed at the story of the massacre. <milestone n="13"
                            unit="section"/> So they went to meet the army. It so happened that the
                        front ranks consisted of a body of 600 Cretans who had served under these
                        very men in Hieronymus's army and had had experience of Hannibal's kindness,
                        having been taken prisoners with other auxiliary troops at Trasumennus and

                        Epicydes recognised them by their standards and the fashion of their arms
                        they held out olive branches and other suppliant emblems and begged them to
                        receive and protect them and not give them up to the Syracusans, who would
                        surrender them to the Romans to be butchered. </p>

                        there, and cries of joy from the whole army showed unmistakably how glad
                        they were that they had come, the praetors rode up to the front and sternly
                        demanded: "What is the meaning of this conduct? <milestone n="3"

                        any attack by the Romans. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> One of the gates
                        of the Hexapylon had already been thrown open and the troops were beginning
                        to be admitted when the praetors appeared on the scene. At first they used
                        commands and threats, then they brought their personal authority to bear,
                        and at last, finding all their efforts useless, they resorted to entreaties,
                        regardless of their dignity, and implored the citizens not to betray their
                        country to men who had once danced attendance on a tyrant and were now
                        corrupting the army. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> But the ears of the
                        maddened people were deaf to their appeals and the gates were battered as
                        much from within as from without. After they had all been burst open the
                        army was admitted through the whole length of the Hexapylon. <milestone
                            n="7" unit="section"/> The praetors and the younger citizens took refuge
                        in the Achradina. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The enemies' numbers
                        were swelled by the mercenaries, the deserters, and all the late king's
                        guards who had been left in Syracuse, with the result that the Achradina was
                        captured at the first attempt, and all the praetors who had failed to make
                        their escape in the confusion were put to death. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> Night put an end to the massacre. The following day the
                        slaves were called up to receive the cap of freedom and all who were in gaol
                        were released. This motley crowd elected Hippocrates and Epicydes praetors,
                        and Syracuse, after its short-lived gleam of liberty, fell back into its old
                        bondage. </p>

                        what was going on they at once broke their camp at Leontini and marched to
                        Syracuse. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Some envoys had been sent by
                        Appius to pass through the harbour on board a quinquereme, and a quadrireme
                        which had sailed in advance of them was captured, the envoys themselves
                        making their escape with great difficulty. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                        It soon became apparent that not only the laws of peace but even the laws of
                        war were no longer respected. The Roman army had encamped at the Olympium-a
                        temple of Jupiter-about a mile and a half from the city. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> It was decided to send envoys again from there; and
                        Hippocrates and Epicydes met them with their attendants outside the gate, to
                        prevent them from entering the city. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The
                        spokesman of the Romans said they were not bringing war to the Syracusans
                        but help and succour, both for those who had been cowed by terror and for
                        those who were enduring a servitude worse than exile, worse even than death
                        itself. "The Romans," he said, "will not allow the infamous massacre of
                        their allies to go unavenged. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> If,
                        therefore, those who have taken refuge with us are at liberty to return home
                        unmolested, if the ringleaders of the massacre are given up and if Syracuse
                        is allowed once more to enjoy her liberty and her laws, there is no need of
                        arms; but if these things are not done we shall visit with all the horrors
                        of war those, whoever they are, who stand in the way of our demands being
                        fulfilled." <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> To this Epicydes replied: "If
                        we had been the persons to whom your demands are addressed we should have
                        replied to them; when the government of Syracuse is in the hands of those to
                        whom you were sent, then you can return again. If you provoke us to war you
                        will learn by experience that to attack Syracuse is not quite the same thing
                        as attacking Leontini." <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> With these words
                        he left the envoys and closed the gates. Then a simultaneous attack by sea
                        and land was commenced on Syracuse. The land attack was directed against the
                        Hexapylon; that by sea against Achradina, the walls of which are washed by
                        the waves. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> As they had carried Leontini at
                        the first assault owing to the panic they created, so the Romans felt
                        confident that they would find some point where they could penetrate into
                        the wide and scattered city, and they brought up the whole of their siege
                        artillery against the walls. </p>

                        undoubtedly succeeded had it not been for one man living at the time in
                        Syracuse. That man was Archimedes. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                        Unrivalled as he was as an observer of the heavens and the stars, he was
                        still more wonderful as the inventor and creator of military works and
                        engines by which with very little trouble he was able to baffle the most
                        laborious efforts of the enemy. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The city
                        wall ran over hills of varying altitude, for the most part lofty and
                        difficult of access, but in some places low and admitting of approach from
                        the level of the valleys. This wall he furnished with artillery of every
                        kind, according to the requirements of the different positions. <milestone
                            n="4" unit="section"/> Marcellus with sixty quinqueremes attacked the
                        wall of Achradina, which as above stated is washed by the sea. <milestone
                            n="5" unit="section"/> In the other ships were archers, slingers, and
                        even light infantry, whose missile is an awkward one to return for those who
                        are not expert at it, so they hardly allowed any one to remain on the walls
                        without being wounded. As they needed space to hurl their missiles, they
                        kept their ships some distance from the walls. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> The other quinqueremes were fastened together in pairs,
                        the oars on the inside being shipped so as to allow of the sides being
                        brought together; <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> they were propelled like
                        one ship by the outside set of oars, and when thus fastened together they
                        carried towers built up in stories and other machinery for battering the
                        wall. </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> To meet this naval attack Archimedes
                        placed on the ramparts engines of various sizes. The ships at a distance he
                        bombarded with immense stones, the nearer ones he raked with lighter and
                        therefore more numerous missiles; lastly he pierced the entire height of the
                        walls with loopholes about eighteen inches wide so that his men might
                        discharge their missiles without exposing themselves. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> Through these openings they aimed arrows and small
                        so-called "scorpions" at the enemy. Some of the ships which came in still
                        more closely in order to be beneath the range of the artillery were attacked
                        in the following way. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> A huge beam
                        swinging on a pivot projected from the wall and a strong chain hanging from
                        the end had an iron grappling hook fastened to it. This was lowered on to
                        the prow of a ship and a heavy lead weight brought the other end of the beam
                        to the ground, raising the prow into the air and making the vessel rest on
                        its stern. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Then the weight being removed,
                        the prow was suddenly dashed on to the water as though it had fallen from
                        the wall, to the great consternation of the sailors; the shock was so great
                        that if it fell straight it shipped a considerable amount of water.
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> In this way the naval assault was
                        foiled, and all the hopes of the besiegers now rested upon an attack from
                        the side of the land, delivered with their entire strength. <milestone
                            n="13" unit="section"/> But here too Hiero had for many years devoted
                        money and pains to fitting up military engines of every kind, guided and
                        directed by the unapproachable skill of Archimedes. The nature of the ground
                        also helped the defence. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> The rock on
                        which the foundations of the wall mostly rested was for the greater part of
                        its length so steep that not only when stones were hurled from the engines
                        but even when rolled down with their own weight they fell with terrible
                        effect on the enemy. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> The same cause made
                        any approach to the foot of the walls difficult and the foothold precarious.
                            <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> A council of war was accordingly held
                        and it was decided, since all their attempts were frustrated, to desist from
                        active operations and confine themselves simply to a blockade, and cut off
                        all supplies from the enemy both by land and sea. </p>

                        Himilco, who had been for a considerable time cruising with his fleet off

                        Syracuse had been seized by Hippocrates. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                        Supported by the envoys from Hippocrates and by a despatch from Hannibal in

                        glorious way, and by the weight of his own personal presence, he had no
                        difficulty in persuading the government to send to Sicily as large a force
                        as they could of both infantry and cavalry. <milestone n="5" unit="section"
                        /> Sailing back to the island he landed at Heraclea an army of 20,000
                        infantry, 3000 cavalry, and twelve elephants, a very much stronger force
                        than he had with him at Pachynus. Immediately on his arrival he took
                        Heraclea and a few days later Agrigentum. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        Other cities which had taken the side of Carthage were now so hopeful of
                        expelling the Romans from Sicily that even the spirits of the blockaded
                        Syracusans began to rise. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Their generals
                        considered that a portion of their army would be adequate for the defence of
                        the city, and accordingly divided their force; Epicydes was to superintend
                        the defence of the city, whilst Hippocrates was to conduct the campaign
                        against the Roman consul in conjunction with Himilco. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> Hippocrates marched out of the city in the night
                        through an unguarded part of the Roman lines and selected a site for his
                        camp near the city of Acrillae. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Marcellus
                        came upon them while they were entrenching themselves. He had marched
                        hastily to Agrigentum in the hope of reaching it before the enemy, but,
                        finding it already occupied, was returning to his position before Syracuse
                        and expected least of all to find a Syracusan force at that time and in that
                        place. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Knowing that he was no match with
                        the troops he had for Himilco and his Carthaginians, he had advanced with

                        Hippocrates, and the preparations he had made to meet the Carthaginians
                        served him in good stead against the Syracusans. He caught them whilst
                        forming their camp, dispersed and in disorder, and for the most part
                        unarmed. The whole of their infantry were cut off, the cavalry offered but
                        slight resistance and escaped with Hippocrates to Acrae. <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> That battle checked the Sicilians in their revolt from
                        Rome and Marcellus returned to Syracuse. A few days later Himilco, who had
                        been joined by Hippocrates, fixed his camp by the river Anapus, about eight
                        miles from Syracuse. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> A Carthaginian fleet
                        of fifty-five vessels of war sailed about the same time into the great
                        harbour of Syracuse from the high seas; and a Roman fleet, also, of thirty
                        quinqueremes, landed the first legion at Panormus. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> It looked as if the war had been wholly diverted from
                        Italy, so completely were both peoples devoting their attention to Sicily.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Himilco fully expected that the legion
                        which had been landed at Panormus would fall into his hands on its march to
                        Syracuse, but he was disappointed as it did not take the route he expected.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Whilst he marched inland, the legion
                        proceeded along the coast, accompanied by the fleet, and joined Appius
                        Claudius who had come to meet it with a portion of his force. <milestone
                            n="7" unit="section"/> Now the Carthaginians despaired of relieving
                        Syracuse and left it to its fate. Bomilcar did not feel sufficient
                        confidence in his fleet as the Romans had one of double the number, and he
                        saw that by remaining there inactive he was only aggravating the scarcity
                        which prevailed amongst his allies, so he put out to sea and sailed across
                        to Africa. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Himilco had followed upon
                        Marcellus' track to Syracuse, hoping for a chance of fighting before he was
                        joined by superior forces; and as no opportunity of doing so occurred and he
                        saw that the enemy were in great strength and safe within their lines round
                        Syracuse he marched away, not caring to waste time by looking on in idleness
                        at the investment of his allies. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> He also
                        wished to be free to march wherever any hope of defection from Rome summoned

                        sides was naturally impregnable, and it had also a strong Roman garrison and
                        a commandant who was not at all a suitable man for traitors to approach. L.
                        Pinarius was a keen soldier and trusted more to his own vigilance and

                        take every possible precaution. So by day and night alike, everything was in
                        readiness, every position occupied by guards and sentinels, and the soldiers

                        saw that they would have to use forcible measures. "The city and its

                        the Roman alliance we did not hand ourselves over to be kept in custody as

                        I only hope the rest of our time may be spent without suffering or

                        the majority took their stand round the theatre and on the ground above it;

                        The Roman commandant was introduced to the assembly by the magistrates. He
                        said that it was the consul and not he who had the right and the power to
                        decide the matter, and went pretty much over the same ground as on the day
                        before. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> At first one or two voices were
                        heard and then several, demanding the surrender of the keys, till the whole
                        assembly broke out into loud and threatening shouts, and seemed on the point
                        of making a murderous attack upon him as he still hesitated and delayed.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Then, at last, he gave the agreed
                        signal with his toga, and the soldiers, who had long been ready and waiting,
                        raised a shout and rushed down upon the crowd, while others blocked the
                        exits from the densely packed theatre. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                        Hemmed in and caged, the men of Henna were ruthlessly cut down and lay about
                        in heaps; not only where the dead were piled up, but where in trying to
                        escape they scrambled over each other's heads and fell one upon another, the

                        the city was filled with dead bodies and people fleeing for their lives, for
                        the soldiers slew the defenceless crowd with as much fury as though they
                        were fighting against an equal foe, and glowing with all the ardour of

                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> So Henna was saved for Rome by a deed
                        which was criminal if it was not unavoidable. Marcellus not only passed no
                        censure on the transaction, but even bestowed the plundered property of the
                        citizens upon his troops, thinking that by the terror thus inspired the
                        Sicilians would be deferred from any longer betraying their garrisons.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The news of this occurrence spread
                        through Sicily almost in a day, for the city, lying in the middle of the

                        was for the sacred associations which connected every part of it with the

                        was universally felt that a foul and murderous outrage had been offered to

                        for the camp he left a small detachment to hold the city and returned to the

                        and unless the Romans protected them, they should be unable to withstand the

                        Macedonia by land, the greater part of his army having lost their arms and
                        all their belongings. M. Valerius wintered with his fleet at Oricum. </p>

                        with varying success. Before the Romans crossed the Ebro Mago and Hasdrubal

                        confirmed the wavering allies. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The Romans
                        first fixed their camp at Castrum Album, a place made famous by the death of
                        the great Hamilcar, and had accumulated supplies of corn there. <milestone

                        enemy, and his cavalry had attacked the Romans while on the march with
                        impunity; they lost as many as 2000 men who had fallen behind or were
                        straying from the line of march. They decided to withdraw to a less hostile
                        part and entrenched themselves at the Mount of Victory. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> Cn. Scipio joined them here with his entire force, and
                        Hasdrubal, the son of Gisgo, came up also with a complete army. There were
                        now three Carthaginian generals and they all encamped on the other side of

                        Scipio went out with some light cavalry to reconnoitre, but in spite of all
                        his precautions he did not remain unobserved, and would have been
                        overpowered in the open plain had he not seized some rising ground that was
                        near. Here he was surrounded and it was only his brother's timely arrival
                        that rescued him. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Castulo, a powerful and
                        famous city of Spain, and in such close alliance with Carthage that Hannibal

                        The Carthaginians commenced an attack upon Illiturgis, owing to the presence
                        of a Roman garrison there, and it looked as if they would certainly reduce
                        it by famine. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Cn. Scipio went to the
                        assistance of the besieged with a legion in light marching order, and
                        fighting his way between the two Carthaginian camps, entered the town after
                        inflicting heavy losses upon the besiegers. The following day he made a
                        sortie and was equally successful. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Above
                        12,000 men were killed in the two battles and more than a thousand were made

                        Romans were winning a splendid victory when the signal was given to retire.
                        Cn. Scipio was wounded in the thigh with a javelin and the soldiers round
                        him were in great fear lest the wound should prove fatal. <milestone n="3"

                        not occurred the Carthaginian camp could have been captured that same day,
                        for the men and the elephants, too, had been driven back to their lines, and
                        thirty-nine of the latter had been transfixed by the heavy Roman javelins.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> It is stated that 12,000 men were
                        killed in this battle and about 3000 made prisoners, whilst fifty-seven
                        standards were taken. From there the Carthaginians retreated to Auringis,
                        the Romans following them up slowly and allowing them no time to recover
                        from their defeats. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> There another battle
                        was fought, and Scipio was carried into the field on a litter. The victory
                        was decisive, though not half as many of the enemy were killed as on the
                        previous occasion, for there were fewer left to fight. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> But the Spaniards have a natural instinct for repairing
                        the losses in war, and when Mago was sent by his brother to raise troops,
                        they very soon filled up the gaps in the army and encouraged their generals
                        to try another battle. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Though they were
                        mostly fresh soldiers, yet as they had to defend a cause which had been
                        repeatedly worsted in so short a time, they fought with the same spirit and
                        the same result as those before them had done. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> More than 8000 men were killed, not less than 1000 made
                        prisoners, and fifty-eight standards were captured. Most of the spoil had
                        belonged to Gauls, there were a large number of golden armlets and chains,
                        and two distinguished Gaulish chieftains, Moeniacoepto and Vismaro, fell in
                        the battle. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Eight elephants were captured
                        and three killed. As things were going so prosperously in Spain, the Romans
                        at last began to feel ashamed of having left Saguntum, the primary cause of
                        the war, in the possession of the enemy for almost eight years. <milestone

                        they recovered the town and restored it to all the former inhabitants whom
                        the ravages of war had spared. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The

                        Italy. The other nine tribunes, however, interposed their veto against their

                        liberty to return to her, who can fail to see that in a short time the Roman
                        empire, bereft of its allies, will find every part of Italy bound by treaty
                        to Carthage? <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Still I am not going to
                        advise that any confidence be placed in Altinius; I shall suggest a middle
                        course in dealing with him. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> I should
                        recommend that he be treated neither as an enemy nor as a friend, but be
                        interned in some city we can trust not far from our camp and kept there
                        during the war. When that is over, then we should discuss whether he
                        deserves punishment for his former disloyalty more than he merits pardon for
                        his coming back to us now. Fabius' suggestions met with general approval,
                        and Altinius was handed over to some officials from Cales together with
                        those who accompanied him. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> He had brought
                        with him a considerable amount of gold, and this was ordered to be taken
                        care of for him. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> At Cales he was free to
                        move about in the daytime, but was always followed by a guard, who kept him
                        in confinement at night. At Arpi he was missed from home and a search was
                        commenced, rumours soon ran through <milestone n="11??" unit="section"/> the
                        city and naturally caused intense excitement, seeing they had lost their
                        leader. Fears were entertained of a revolution, and messengers were at once
                        despatched to Hannibal. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The Carthaginian
                        was not at all concerned at what had happened; he had long suspected the man
                        and doubted his loyalty, and he had now a plausible reason for seizing and
                        selling the property of a very rich man. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                        But, in order to create a belief that he was swayed more by anger than by
                        avarice, he aggravated his rapacity by an act of atrocious cruelty.
                            <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> He sent for the wife and children,
                        and after questioning them first about the circumstances under which
                        Altinius had disappeared, and then about the amount of gold and silver which
                        he had left at home, and so finding out all he wanted to know, he had them
                        burnt alive. </p>

                        decided to begin by an attack on Arpi. He encamped about half a mile from
                        it, and on examining from a near position the situation of the city and its
                        fortifications, he saw one part where it was most strongly fortified and,
                        therefore, less carefully guarded, and at this point he determined to
                        deliver his assault. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> After seeing that
                        everything required for the storm was in readiness, he selected out of the
                        whole army the pick of the centurions and placed them under the command of
                        tribunes who were distinguished for courage. He then furnished them with six
                        hundred of the rank and file, a number which he deemed quite sufficient for
                        his purpose, and gave them orders to carry scaling ladders to that point
                        when they heard the bugles sound the fourth watch. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> There was a low narrow gate which led into an
                        unfrequented street running through a lonely part of the city. His orders
                        were that they were first to scale the wall with their ladders, and then
                        open the gate or break the bolts and bars from the inside and when they were
                        in possession of that quarter of the city they were to give a signal on the
                        bugle, so that the rest of the troops might be brought up, and he would have
                        everything in order and ready. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> His
                        instructions were carried out to the letter, and what seemed likely to prove
                        a hindrance turned out to be of the greatest help in concealing their
                        movements. A rain storm which began at midnight drove all the sentries and
                        outposts to seek shelter in the houses, and the roar of the rain which at
                        first came down <milestone n="5??" unit="section"/> like a deluge prevented
                        the noise of those who were at work on the gate from being heard. Then when
                        the sound of the rain fell upon the ear more gently and regularly, it
                        soothed most of the defenders to sleep. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> As
                        soon. as they were in possession of the gate, they placed the buglers at
                        equal distances along the street and ordered them to sound the signal to
                        give notice to the consul. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> This having
                        been done as previously arranged, the consul ordered a general advance, and

                            unit="section"/> Hannibal's garrison in the city amounted to about 5000
                        men, and the citizens themselves had raised a force of 3000. These the
                        Carthaginians put in front to meet the enemy, that there might be no attempt
                        at treachery in their rear. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The fighting
                        began in the dark in the narrow streets, the Romans having occupied not only
                        the streets near the gate but the houses also, that they might not be
                        assailed from the roofs. Gradually as it grew light some of the citizen
                        troops and some of the Romans recognised one another, and entered into
                        conversation. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The Roman soldiers asked
                        what it was that the Arpinians wanted, what wrong had Rome done them, what
                        good service had <milestone n="5??" unit="section"/> Carthage rendered them
                        that they, Italians-bred and born, should fight against their old friends
                        the Romans on behalf of foreigners and barbarians, and wish to make Italy a
                        tributary province of Africa. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The people
                        of Arpi urged in their excuse that they knew nothing of what was going on,
                        they had in fact been sold by their leaders to the Carthaginians, they had
                        been victimised and enslaved by a small oligarchy. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> When a beginning had been once made the conversations
                        became more and more general; at last the praetor of Arpi was conducted by
                        his friends to the consul, and after they had given each other mutual
                        assurances, surrounded by the troops under their standards, the citizens
                        suddenly turned against the Carthaginians and fought for the Romans.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> A body of Spaniards also, numbering
                        something less than a thousand, transferred their services to the consul
                        upon the sole condition that the Carthaginian garrison should be allowed to
                        depart uninjured. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The gates were opened
                        for them and they were dismissed, according to the stipulation, in perfect
                        safety, and went to Hannibal at Salapia. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                        Thus Arpi was restored to the Romans without the loss of a single life,
                        except in the case of one man who had long ago been a traitor and had
                        recently deserted. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The Spaniards were
                        ordered to receive double rations, and the republic availed itself on very

                        to the Roman camp above Suessula, and when they came up to the outposts they
                        told them that they wished for an interview with the commander, Cn. Fulvius.

                        that, after the recapture of Capua, their property might be restored to

                        similar results in Africa. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Syphax, king of
                        the Numidians, had suddenly taken up a hostile attitude towards Carthage.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The Scipios sent three centurions on a
                        mission to him, with instructions to conclude a friendly alliance with him
                        and to assure him that if he would go on persistently harassing the
                        Carthaginians he would confer an obligation on the senate and people of

                        barbarian was delighted at the mission and held frequent conversations with
                        the centurions upon the methods of warfare. As he listened to the seasoned
                        soldiers he found out how many things he was ignorant of, and how great the
                        contrast was between his own practice and their discipline and organisation.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> He asked that whilst two of them
                        carried back the report of their mission to their commanders, the third
                        might remain with him as a military instructor. He explained that the
                        Numidians made very poor infantry soldiers, they were only useful as mounted
                        troops; he explained that this was the style of warfare which his ancestors
                        had adopted from the very earliest times, it was the style to which he had
                        been trained from his boyhood. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> They had an

                        they would do what he wished, on the distinct understanding that if their
                        commanders did not approve of the arrangement he would at once send back the
                        one who remained. This man's name was Statorius. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> The king sent some Numidians to accompany the two
                        Romans to Spain and obtain sanction for the arrangement from the commanders.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> He also charged them to take

                        with the Carthaginian troops to come over to the Romans. Out of the large
                        number of young men which the country contained Statorius enrolled a force
                        of infantry for the king. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> These he formed
                        into companies pretty much on the Roman model, and by drilling and
                        exercising them he taught them to follow their standards and keep their
                        ranks. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> He also made them so familiar with
                        the work of entrenchment and other regular military tasks that the king
                        placed quite as much confidence in his infantry as in his cavalry, and in a
                        pitched battle fought on a level plain he proved superior to the

                        between Syphax and the Romans friendly relations were established. As soon
                        as the Carthaginians heard what was going on, they sent envoys to Gala, who

                        cross over with them into Spain, which was only separated by a narrow
                        strait, Masinissa arrived with his victorious army, and won a great
                        reputation by the way in which he concluded the war against Syphax without
                        any help from the Carthaginians. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> In Spain
                        nothing of any importance took place except that the Romans secured for
                        themselves the services of the Celtiberians by offering them the same pay
                        which the Carthaginians had agreed to pay. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                        They also sent to Italy three hundred of the leading Spanish nobility to win
                        over their countrymen who were serving with Hannibal. That is the solitary
                        incident in Spain worth recording for the year, and its interest lies in the
                        fact that the Romans had never had a mercenary soldier in their camp until
                        they employed the Celtiberians. </p>
