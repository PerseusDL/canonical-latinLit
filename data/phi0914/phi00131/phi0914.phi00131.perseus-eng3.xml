                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> I, too, feel as much relief in having
                        reached the end of the Punic War as if I had taken a personal part in its
                        toils and dangers. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> It ill befits one who
                        has had the courage to promise a complete history of Rome to find the
                        separate sections of such an extensive work fatiguing. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> But when I consider that the sixty-three years from the
                        beginning of the First Punic War to the end of the Second take up as many
                        books as the four hundred and eighty-seven years from the foundation of the
                            <milestone n="4??" unit="section"/> City to the consulship of Appius
                        Claudius under whom the First Punic War commenced, I see that I am like
                        people who are tempted by the shallow water along the beach to wade out to
                        sea; the further I progress, the greater the depth, as though it were a
                        bottomless sea, into which I am carried. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> I
                        imagined that as I completed one part after another the task before me would
                        diminish; as it is, it almost becomes greater. The peace with Carthage was
                        very soon followed by war with Macedonia. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        There is no comparison between them as regards the critical nature of the
                        contest, or the personality of the commander or the fighting quality of the
                        troops. But the Macedonian war was, if anything, more noteworthy owing to
                        the brilliant reputation of the <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/> former
                        kings, the ancient fame of the nation and the vast extent of its dominion
                        when it held sway over a large part of Europe and a still larger part of
                        Asia. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The war with Philip which had
                        commenced some ten years previously had been suspended for the last three
                        years, and both the war and its cessation were due to the action of the
                        Aetolians. The peace with Carthage now left the Romans free. <milestone
                            n="9" unit="section"/> They were angry with Philip for his attacking the
                        Aetolians and the other friendly States in Greece while he was nominally at
                        peace with Rome, and also for his having given assistance in both men and
                        money to Hannibal and Carthage. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> He had
                        ravaged the Athenian territory and driven the inhabitants into the city, and
                        it was their request for help which decided the Romans to recommence the
                        war. </p>

                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="2" type="chapter">
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Just about the same time envoys arrived
                        from King Attalus and also from Rhodes with the information that Philip was
                        trying to gain the States of Asia Minor. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                        The reply made to both deputations was that the situation in Asia was
                        engaging the attention of the senate. The question of war with Macedonia was
                        referred to the consuls, who were at the time in their respective provinces.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> In the meanwhile, C. Claudius Nero, M.
                        Aemilius Lepidus and P. Sempronius Tuditanus were sent on a mission to
                        Ptolemy, king of Egypt, to announce the final defeat of Hannibal and the
                        Carthaginians and to thank the king for having remained a staunch friend to
                        Rome at a critical time, when even her nearest allies deserted her.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> They were further to request him, in
                        case Philip's aggressions compelled them to declare war against him, that he
                        would maintain his old friendly attitude towards the Romans. <milestone
                            n="5" unit="section"/> During this period P. Aelius, the consul who was
                        commanding in Gaul, learnt that the Boii, prior to his arrival, had been
                        raiding the territories of friendly tribes. <milestone n="6" unit="section"
                        /> He hastily raised a force of two legions in view of this disturbance and
                        strengthened it with four cohorts from his own army. This force, thus
                        hurriedly collected, he entrusted to C. Ampius, a prefect of allies, and
                        ordered him to march through the canton of Umbria called Sapinia and invade
                        the country of the Boii. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> He himself
                        marched over the mountains by an open road. Ampius crossed the enemy's
                        frontier, and after devastating his country without meeting any resistance,
                        he selected a position at the fortified post of Mutilum as a suitable place
                        for cutting the corn which was now ripe. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                        He commenced the task without previously examining the neighbourhood or
                        posting armed parties in sufficient strength to protect the foragers, who
                        had laid aside their weapons and were intent on their work. Suddenly he and
                        his foragers were surprised by the Gauls who appeared on all sides.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The panic and disorder extended to the
                        men on guard; 7000 men who were dispersed through the cornfields were
                        killed, amongst them C. Ampius himself, the rest fled to the camp.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The following night the soldiers, as
                        they had no regular commander, decided to act for themselves, and leaving
                        most of their possessions behind made their way through almost impassable
                        forests to the consul. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Beyond ravaging
                        the Boian country and making a league with the Ligurian Ingauni the consul
                        did nothing worth mentioning in his province before his return to Rome. </p>
                </div>
                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="3" type="chapter">
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> At the first meeting of the senate after
                        his return there was a general demand that the action of Philip and the
                        grievances of the friendly States should take precedence of all other
                        business. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The question was at once put in
                        a crowded House and a decree was made that the consul P. Aelius should send
                        the man whom he thought best, with full command to take over the fleet which
                        Cn. Octavius was bringing back from Africa and proceed to Macedonia.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He selected M. Valerius Laevinus, who
                        was sent with the rank of propraetor. Laevinus took thirty-eight of
                        Octavius' ships which were lying at anchor off Vibo and with these he sailed
                        for Macedonia. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> He was met by M. Aurelius,
                        who gave him details about the strength of the land and sea forces which the
                        king had got <milestone n="5??" unit="section"/> together and the extent to
                        which he was securing armed assistance not only from the cities on the
                        mainland, but also from the islands in the Aegean, partly by his own
                        personal influence, partly through his agents. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> Aurelius pointed out that the Romans would have to
                        display far greater energy in the prosecution of this war, or else Philip,
                        encouraged by their slackness, would venture on the same enterprise which
                        Pyrrhus, whose kingdom was considerably smaller, had ventured on before. It
                        was decided that Aurelius should send this information in a despatch to the
                        consuls and the senate. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Towards the close of the year the question
                        was brought up as to the holdings which were to be assigned to the veteran
                        soldiers who had served with Scipio in Africa. <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> The senator decreed that M. Junius, the City praetor,
                        should at his discretion appoint ten commissioners for the purpose of
                        measuring and allotting that portion of the Samnite and Apulian territory
                        which had become State domain. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The
                        commissioners were P. Servilius, Q. Caecilius Marcellus, the two Servilii,
                        Caius and Marcus-who were known as "The Twins"-the two Hostilii Catones,
                        Lucius and Aulus, P. Villius Tappulus, M. Fulvius Flaccus, P. Aelius Paetus
                        and T. Quinctius Flamininus. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The elections
                        were conducted by the consul P. Aelius. The consuls-elect were P. Sulpicius
                        Galba and C. Aurelius Cotta. The new praetors were Q. Minucius Rufus, L.
                        Furius Purpureo, Q. Fulvius Gillo and C. Sergius Plancus. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> The Roman Scenic Games were celebrated this year with
                        unusual splendour by the curule aediles, L. Valerius Flaccus and T.
                        Quinctius Flamininus, and were repeated for a second day. They also
                        distributed to the people with strict impartiality and to the general
                        satisfaction a vast quantity of corn which Scipio had sent from Africa.

                        the City, during the consulship of P. Sulpicius Galba and C. Aurelius and
                        within a few months of the conclusion of peace with Carthage, the war with
                        King Philip began. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> On March 15, the day on
                        which the consuls entered office, P. Sulpicius made this the first business
                        before the senate. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> A decree was made that
                        the consuls should sacrifice full-grown victims to those deities whom they
                        might decide upon, and should offer up the following prayer: <milestone

                        Latin allies!" After the sacrifice and prayer the consuls were to consult
                        the senate as to the policy to be pursued and the allocation of provinces.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Just at this time the war-spirit was
                        stimulated by the receipt of the despatches from M. Aurelius and M. Valerius
                        Laevinus as well as by a fresh embassy from Athens which announced that the
                        king was nearing their frontiers and would soon be master of their territory
                        and of their city as well if Rome did not come to the rescue. <milestone
                            n="6" unit="section"/> The consuls reported the due performance of the
                        sacrifices and the declaration of the augurs that the gods had listened to
                        their prayer, for the victims had given favourable omens and portended
                        victory, triumph, and an enlargement of the dominion of Rome. <milestone

                        were read and an audience given to the Athenian envoys. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> A resolution was passed by the senate that thanks be

                        deferred a definite answer until the consuls had balloted for their
                        provinces, and the one to whom the Macedonian province fell had submitted to
                        the people the question of declaring war against Philip of Macedon. </p>

                        Gaul. The proposed declaration of war against Macedonia was almost
                        unanimously rejected at the first meeting of the Assembly. The length and
                        exhausting demands of the late war had made men weary of fighting and they
                        shrank from incurring further toils and dangers. <milestone n="4"

                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The patricians were extremely angry
                        and the tribune was bitterly attacked in the senate, each of the senators in

                        you any option as to that, he is preparing war on an enormous scale both by
                        land and sea. The only question is whether you will transport the legions

                        upon. When Saguntum was beseiged and our allies were imploring us for help,
                        who doubts that if we had sent prompt assistance, as our fathers did to the
                        Mamertines, we should have confined within the borders of Spain that war
                        which, most disastrously for ourselves, we allowed through procrastination
                        to enter Italy. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Why, this very Philip had
                        entered into an agreement with Hannibal through his agents and in his
                        despatches that he would invade Italy, and there is not the smallest doubt
                        that we kept him in Macedonia by sending Laevinus with a fleet to take the
                        offensive against him. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Are we hesitating
                        to do now what we did then, when we had Hannibal for our enemy in Italy-now
                        that Hannibal has been driven out of Italy and out of Carthage, and Carthage
                        itself is completely vanquished? <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> If we

                        today a very small accession to the kingdom of Macedonia. The whole of the

                        Vermina himself had commenced his military education by an attack on the

                        before he could have any title to be styled 'king, ally and friend.' The

                        providing that he left the fixing of those conditions absolutely to the
                        Roman people. If he wanted anything added or cancelled or altered in the

                        now that he had leagued himself with Antiochus, king of Syria, he was more
                        determined on war than ever. They had agreed to divide the rich kingdom of
                        Egypt between them, and on hearing of the death of Ptolemy they both
                        prepared to attack it. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The Athenians, who
                        retain nothing of their ancient greatness but their pride, had become
                        involved in hostilities with Philip through a quite unimportant incident.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> During the celebration of the
                        Eleusinian Mysteries two young Acarnanians who had not been initiated
                        entered the temple of Ceres with the rest of the crowd, quite unaware of the
                        sacrilegious nature of their action. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> They
                        were betrayed by the silly questions which they asked, and were brought
                        before the temple authorities. Though it was quite evident that they had
                        sinned in ignorance, they were put to death as though guilty of a horrible
                        crime. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The Acarnanians reported this
                        hostile and barbarous act to Philip and obtained his consent to their making
                        war on Athens supported by a Macedonian contingent. Their army began by
                        laying the land of Attica waste with fire and sword, after which they
                        returned to Acarnania with plunder of every description. <milestone n="10"

                        sides, subsequently, by a decree of the citizens, Athens made a formal
                        declaration of war. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> For when King Attalus
                        and the Rhodians who were following up Philip in his retreat to Macedonia
                        had reached Aegina, the king sailed across to the Piraeus for the purpose of
                        renewing and confirming his alliance with the Athenians. <milestone n="12"

                        with their wives and children; the priests in their sacred robes received
                        him as he entered the city; even the gods themselves were almost summoned
                        from their shrines to welcome him. </p>

                        assembly, in order that the king might lay his wishes before them.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> It was, however, thought to be more in
                        accordance with his dignity that he should put what he wanted into writing,
                        rather than let his blushes be called up by having to recount his services
                        to the city or his modesty be shocked by the fulsome flattery of the
                        applauding crowd. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Accordingly he drew up a
                        written statement which was read in the assembly, in which he enumerated the
                        benefits he had conferred on their <milestone n="4??" unit="section"/> city
                        and described his contest with Philip, and urged them in conclusion to take
                        their part in the war while they had him and the Rhodians and, now
                        especially, the Romans to support them. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> If
                        they hung back now they would never have such an opportunity again. Then the
                        envoys from Rhodes were heard; they had quite lately done a good turn for
                        the Athenians, for they had recaptured and sent back to Athens four Athenian
                        warships which the Macedonians had taken. War against Philip was unanimously
                        decided upon. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Extraordinary honours were
                        paid to King Attalus and also to the Rhodians. A proposal was carried to add
                        to the old ten tribes a new one to be called the Attalis tribe. The people
                        of Rhodes were presented with a golden crown in recognition of their
                        bravery, and the full citizenship was granted to them just they had
                        previously granted it to the Athenians. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                        After this Attalus rejoined his fleet at Aegina and the Rhodians sailed to
                        Cia, and from there made their way home through the Cyclades. <milestone
                            n="8" unit="section"/> All the islands joined them with the exception of
                        Andros, Paros and Cythnos which were held by Macedonian garrisons. Attalus
                        had sent messengers to Aetolia and was waiting for the envoys who were
                        coming from there; their non-arrival kept him inactive for some time.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> He could not induce the Aetolians to
                        take up arms, they were only too glad to remain at peace with Philip on any
                        terms. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> But had he in conjunction with the
                        Rhodians vigorously opposed Philip, they might have won the glorious title
                        of Liberators of Greece. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Instead of this,
                        they allowed him to cross the Hellespont a second time and seize an
                        excellent position in Thrace where he could concentrate his forces, and thus
                        they gave fresh life to the war and surrendered the glory of bringing it to
                        a close the Romans. </p>

                        he had not held his own against Attalus and the Rhodians he was not alarmed
                        even at the prospect of a war with Rome. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                        Philocles, one of his generals, was sent with a force of 2000 infantry and
                        200 cavalry to ravage the lands of the Athenians, and Heraclides was placed
                        in charge of the fleet with instructions to sail for Maronea. <milestone

                        men in light marching order, and took the place at the first assault.

                        but he finally effected its capture through the treachery of Callimedes, who
                        was holding the place for Ptolemy. Cypsela, Doriscos and Serrheum were taken
                        in rapid succession and he then advanced to the Chersonese where Elaeus and
                        Alopeconnesus voluntarily surrendered. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                        Callipolis and Madytos fell through treachery; together with some other
                        unimportant fortified places. The people of Abydos would not even admit his
                        envoys and closed their gates against the king. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> The siege of this place detained Philip for a
                        considerable time, and if Attalus and the Rhodians had shown the smallest
                        energy they might have saved the place. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                        Attalus sent only 300 men to assist in the defence and the Rhodians
                        despatched one quadrireme out of their fleet which was lying at anchor off
                        Tenedos. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Later on, when they could hardly
                        hold out any longer, Attalus himself sailed to Tenedos, and after raising
                        their hopes by his approach did not afford his allies any assistance either
                        by land or sea. </p>

                        throw the gold and silver and the apparel on board the ships into the sea

                        remonstrated against the war that had been made on Attalus and the Rhodians,

                        To one who seldom heard the truth this language seemed too bold to address
                        to a king. "Your youth, your good looks and, above all, the fact of your
                        being a Roman make you too venturesome. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> It
                        is my wish that you should remember treaty obligations and keep the peace

                        Philip took possession of the gold and silver which had been collected, but

                        For such a madness fell on the people that they believed that all who had

                        another of perjury, especially the priests, for they were surrendering to
                        the enemy those whom they had devoted to death. Seized by one sudden impulse
                        they all rushed off to kill their wives and children, and then they

                        allow the people of Abydos three days in which to die. During this interval
                        the vanquished wrought more horrors upon themselves than the victors would

                        returned to his kingdom. As the destruction of Saguntum strengthened
                        Hannibal's resolve to war against Rome, so the fall of Abydos encouraged
                        Philip to do the same. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> On his way he was

                        fatigued after their rapid march, and the shouts of the Gauls recalled their
                        comrades, who, leaving the plunder which they had gathered behind, ran back
                        to their camp. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The next day they marched
                        out to battle. The Romans were not slow in accepting the challenge, but they
                        had hardly time to complete their formation, so rapidly did the enemy come
                        on. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Furius had formed the allied troops
                        into two divisions, and the right division was stationed in the first line,

                        M. Furius was in command of this division, M. Caecilius commanded the

                        they endeavoured to work round the flanks and envelop the enemy's line,
                        which, considering their numbers and the fewness of their opponents, seemed
                        an easy task. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> When the praetor saw this
                        maneuver he extended his front by bringing up the two legions in reserve to
                        the right and left of the allied troops, and he also vowed a temple to

                        break through the opposing ranks. This was decisive; the wings were repulsed

                        the camp. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> Not 6000 men succeeded in
                        making their escape; more than 35,000 were killed or made prisoners; 70

                        at the same speed and crossing the Euripus by the bridge marched through

                        suddenly thrown open to admit a body of troops sent by Attalus and the

                        however, he found that the defenders were quite on the alert, and that the

                        project and marched to Megara, and then straight to Corinth. On learning
                        that the Council of the Achaeans was sitting at Argos he made his appearance
                        in the assembly quite unexpectedly. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> They
                        were at the time discussing the question of war with Nabis, tyrant of the
                        Lacedaemonians. When the supreme command was transferred from Philopoemen to
                        Cycliades. who was by no means his equal as a general, Nabis, finding that
                        the Achaeans had dismissed their mercenaries, resumed hostilities, and after
                        devastating his neighbours' fields was now threatening their cities.

                        would not only protect the soil of his allies from their ravages, but he
                        would at once roll back all the terror of war upon Laconia itself by
                        marching his army thither. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> When these
                        words were greeted with loud applause he went on to say, "If, however, your

                        Nabis and the Lacedaemonians free from misgivings." The Achaeans were not
                        slow to detect his motive in making such a generous promise and offering aid
                        against the Lacedaemonians. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> They saw that
                        his real aim was to draw the fighting strength of the Achaeans out of the

                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Cycliades, seeing that further

                        did not allow discussion on any matters other than those which the council
                        had been convened to consider. After a decree had been passed for raising an
                        army to act against Nabis, he dismissed the council over which he had

                        Macedonians for the purpose of ravaging the Athenian territory. He crossed
                        the forest of Cithaeron in the neighbourhood of Eleusis, and there he
                        divided his forces. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Half were sent forward
                        to harry and plunder the fields in all directions, the other half he
                        concealed in a position suitable for an ambuscade so that if an attack were

                            unit="section"/> His ruse, however, was detected, so he recalled the
                        scattered pillagers and made a regular attack upon the fort. After a
                        fruitless attempt in which many of his men were wounded he retired and
                        joined forces with Philip who was on his way from Achaea. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> The king himself made an attempt on the same fort but
                        the arrival of the Roman ships from the Piraeus and the presence of a
                        reinforcement which had been thrown into the place compelled him to abandon
                        the undertaking. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> He then sent Philocles
                        with a part of his army to Athens, and with the rest he proceeded to the
                        Piraeus in order that while Philocles kept the Athenians within their city
                        by approaching the walls and threatening an assault, he might seize the
                        opportunity of storming the Piraeus whilst it was left with a feeble guard.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> But the assault on the Piraeus proved
                        to be quite as difficult as the one on Eleusis, as practically the same
                        troops defended both. Leaving the Piraeus he hurried up to Athens.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Here a force of infantry and cavalry
                        from the city attacked him within the dilapidated Long Walls which connect
                        the Piraeus with Athens and he was repulsed. Seeing that any attempt on the
                        city was hopeless he divided his army with Philocles and set himself to
                        complete the devastation of the country. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                        His former work of destruction had been confined mainly to the sepulchres
                        round the city; <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> now he determined to
                        leave nothing free from profanation and gave orders for the temples which
                        the people had consecrated in every deme to be destroyed and set on fire.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The land of Attica was famous for
                        that class of building as well as for the abundance of native marble and the
                        genius of its architects, and therefore it afforded abundant material for
                        this destructive fury. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> He was not
                        satisfied with overthrowing the temples with their statues, he even ordered
                        the blocks of stone to be broken in pieces lest if they retained their shape
                        they might form imposing ruins. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> When

                        appropriate all the plunder he levelled the walls and burnt the city.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Fear of similar treatment brought
                        about the surrender of Codrion-a fairly strong and fortified town-without

                        their kits into the centre of the column, and formed his line. The king's
                        soldiers did not stand the charge of the Romans, many were killed and more
                        taken prisoners. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Apustius brought back his

                        repentance which, however, is too late, and quite unavailing; decisions
                        hastily and precipitately formed cannot be recalled, nor can the mischief be
                        undone." <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He thought that an interval ought
                        to be allowed for mature deliberation, and the time could be fixed there and
                        then. As they were forbidden by law to discuss questions of peace and war
                        anywhere but in the Pan-Aetolian Council, they ought at once to pass a
                        decree exempting the chief magistrate from all penalties, if he summoned a

                        After the matter was adjourned the envoys were dismissed, and Damocritus

                        Lyncus near the river Bevus, and from there he sent parties to collect corn

                    <p> Philip saw that there was consternation everywhere and that the population
                        were in a state of panic, but he did not know what part the consul was
                        making for, and accordingly he sent a cavalry detachment to reconnoitre and
                        find out in what direction the enemy were marching. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> The consul was equally in the dark, he knew that the
                        king had moved out of his winter quarters, but was ignorant of his
                        whereabouts, so he too sent out cavalry to reconnoitre. <milestone n="8"

                        along unknown roads amongst the Dassaretii, they at last took the same road.
                        When the noise of men and horses was heard in the distance, they both became
                        aware that an enemy was approaching. So before they came in sight of one
                        another they put their horses and weapons in readiness, and as soon as they
                        saw their enemy they charged. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> They were
                        not unfairly matched in numbers and courage, for each corps consisted of
                        picked men, and for some hours they kept up an even fight, until the
                        exhaustion of men and horses put a stop to the battle without either side
                        gaining the victory. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Forty of the
                        Macedonians fell and thirty-five of the Romans. Neither side gained any

                        difficult to gauge as the temper of a mass of people. The very thing which

                        with hesitancy and fear. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Philip's men had
                        been accustomed to fighting with Greeks and Illyrians and had only seen
                        wounds inflicted by javelins and arrows and in rare instances by lances. But
                        when they saw bodies dismembered with the Spanish sword, arms cut off from
                        the shoulder, heads struck off from the trunk, bowels exposed and other
                        horrible wounds, they recognised the style of weapon and the kind of man
                        against whom they had to fight, and a shudder of horror ran through the
                        ranks. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Even the king himself felt
                        apprehensive, though he had not yet met the Romans in a pitched battle, and

                        recalled his son and the troops who were stationed in the Pelagonian pass,
                        thus leaving the road open to Pleuratus and the Dardanians for the invasion
                        of Macedonia. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> He now advanced against the
                        enemy with an army of 20,000 infantry and 4000 cavalry, and came to a hill
                        near Athacus where he strongly intrenched himself about a mile from the
                        Roman camp. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> It is said that as he looked
                        down on it and gazed with admiration on the appearance of the camp as a
                        whole and its various sections marked off by the rows of tents and the roads
                        crossing each other, he exclaimed, "No one can possibly take that for a camp
                        of barbarians." For two whole days the king and the consul kept their
                        respective armies in camp, each waiting for the other to attack. <milestone

                        a general engagement so soon, and contented himself with sending forward a

                        about half a mile distant, sent forward their velites and about two

                        was equal to that of the enemy. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The king's
                        troops expected the style of fighting to be that with which they were
                        familiar; the cavalry would make alternate charges and retirements, at one
                        moment using their missiles, then galloping to the rear; the swift-footed
                        Illyrians would be employed in sudden onsets and rushes; the Cretans would
                        discharge their arrows on the enemy as he dashed forward to attack.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> But this order of combat was
                        completely upset by the method of the Roman attack, which was as sustained
                        as it was fierce. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> They fought as steadily
                        as though it had been a regular engagement; the velites after discharging
                        their javelins came to close quarters with their swords; the cavalry, when
                        once they had reached the enemy, halted their horses and fought, some on
                        horseback whilst others dismounted and took their places amongst the
                        infantry. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Under these conditions Philip's
                        cavalry, unaccustomed to a stationary combat, were no match for the Roman
                        horse, and his infantry, trained to skirmish in loose order and unprotected
                        by armour, were at the mercy of the velites who with their swords and
                        shields were equally prepared for defence and attack. <milestone n="7"

                        to bring the whole of his cavalry and light-armed troops into action.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> During the night he concealed a body
                        of caetrati, whom they call peltasts, in a position between the two camps
                        well adapted for an ambush, and instructed Athenagoras and his cavalry in

                        give ground slowly and draw the enemy to the place where the ambush was set.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The cavalry did retire, but the

                        of success. The Romans, victorious in the open battle and safe from the

                        next day the consul went out to battle with his whole force. In front of his
                        line were posted some elephants which the Romans were using for the first
                        time, having captured some in the Punic war. <milestone n="5" unit="section"

                        mounted some rising ground close to their rampart and taunted them with
                        their timidity. Even then no chance of fighting was offered him, and as
                        foraging was by no means safe while the camps were in such close proximity
                        since Philip's cavalry would attack his men when they were dispersed amongst
                        the fields, he shifted his camp to a place called Ottolobum, about eight
                        miles off, <milestone n="6??" unit="section"/> to allow of his foraging more
                        safely owing to the greater distance. As long as the Romans were cutting

                        the king kept his men within their lines in order that the enemy might grow
                        more venturesome and careless. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> When he saw
                        them scattered far afield he set off with the whole of his cavalry and the
                        Cretan auxiliaries at such a rapid pace that only the fleetest of the
                        infantrymen could keep up with the troopers. On reaching a position between
                        the foragers and their camp he divided his force. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> One division was sent in pursuit of the scattered
                        foragers, with orders not to leave a single man alive; with the other he
                        beset the various roads by which the enemy would have to return to their
                        camp. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Now men were fleeing and being cut

                        of the king's troops who were waiting for them; more were killed by those
                        who were blocking the roads than by those who had been sent in pursuit.

                        the less surprising since a report was current that Pleuratus and the
                        Dardanians had already invaded Macedonia with an immense force. <milestone

                        might well believe that the Romans would finish the war without striking a

                        actions Philip thought that he would be running considerable risk in
                        remaining any longer in his standing camp. As he wanted to conceal his
                        departure from the enemy he sent a flag of truce just after sunset to ask
                        for an armistice for the purpose of burying the dead. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> Having thus deceived the enemy he marched out at the

                        the camp. </p>

                        brought to him of the arrival of the herald and the reason of his coming.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> All his reply was that an interview
                        would be granted on the following morning. This was just what Philip wanted,
                        as it gave him the night and a part of the following day in which to get the
                        start of his opponent. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He took the road
                        over the mountains, which he knew that the Roman general would not attempt
                        with his heavy column. At daybreak the consul granted the armistice and
                        dismissed the herald and not long afterwards became aware that the enemy had
                        disappeared. Not knowing in what direction to follow him he spent some days
                        in camp, collecting corn. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Then he marched
                        to Stuberra and gathered out of Pelagonia the corn which was in the fields.
                        From there he advanced to Pluinna without, so far, discovering the route
                        which the enemy had taken. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Philip at first
                        fixed his camp at Bryanium and then advancing by cross-roads created a
                        sudden alarm amongst the enemy. The Romans in consequence left Pluinna and
                        encamped by the river Osphagus. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The king
                        pitched his camp not far away by a river which the natives call Erigonus,
                        and carried his intrenchment along the bank. Then, having definitely
                        ascertained that the Romans intended to march to Eordaea, <milestone n="7??"
                            unit="section"/> he determined to anticipate them and occupied a narrow
                        pass with the object of making it impossible for the enemy to pass through
                        it. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> He barricaded it in various ways, in
                        some parts with rampart, in others with fosse, in other places with piled-up
                        stones to serve as a wall, and elsewhere with tree-trunks as the nature of
                        the ground or the materials allowed, until, as he <milestone n="9??"
                            unit="section"/> believed, he had made a road which was naturally
                        difficult, absolutely impassable by the obstacles which he had placed across
                        every exit. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The country was mostly
                        forest, difficult for troops to work in, especially for the Macedonian
                        phalanx, for unless they can make a kind of chevaux de frise with the
                        extraordinarily long spears which they hold in front of their shields-and
                        this requires a free and open space-they are of no use whatever. <milestone

                        of an enormous length, were hampered and obstructed by the branches on all

                        that was of any service, and this only to a very limited extent, for though
                        when attacked by an unprotected horse and rider they could discharge their
                        arrows with effect, there was not sufficient force in their missiles to
                        penetrate the Roman shields nor was there any exposed part of the body at
                        which they could take aim. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Finding
                        therefore that mode of attack useless, they pelted the enemy with the stones
                        which were lying all over the ravine. This caused more noise than injury,
                        but the drumming on their shields checked the advance of the Romans for a
                        few minutes. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> They soon ceased to pay any
                        attention to them, and some of them forming a shield-roof over their heads
                        forced their way through the enemy in front, while others by making a short
                        circuit gained the crest of the hill and drove the Macedonians from their
                        posts of observation. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> Escape was almost

                        trouble than they had anticipated, and they entered the district of Eordaea.
                        After ravaging the fields in all directions, the consul moved into Elimia.
                        Here he made an attack on Orestis and approached the town of Celetrum.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> This was situated on a peninsula, the
                        walls were surrounded by a lake and there was only one road to the adjacent

                        their position, closed their gates and rejected the summons to surrender.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> When, however, they saw the standards
                        advancing and the legions marching under their shield-roof up to the gate
                        and the narrow neck of land covered by the hostile column, their hearts
                        failed them and they surrendered without risking a battle. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> From Celetrum he advanced into Dassaretia and took the

                        strong garrison in it. It was well adapted from its position to serve as a
                        base for his operations against Macedonia. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        After thus scouring the enemy's country, the consul returned to friendly
                        territories and led his force back to Apollonia, which had been his
                        starting-point for the campaign. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Philip
                        had been called away by the Aetolians, the Athamanians, the Dardanians and

                        when he sent Athenagoras with the light infantry and the greater part of the
                        cavalry to attack them from the rear as they retreated, and by harassing
                        their rear make them less eager to send their armies away from home.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> As to the Aetolians, Damocritus their

                        proceeded to invest Cercinium. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The

                        is not clear, as Philip's troops were holding the place. However, in a few
                        days Cercinium was taken and burnt, and those who survived the wholesale
                        slaughter, slaves and citizens alike, were carried off with the rest of the
                        booty. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Dread of a similar fate drove the

                        take to the mountains. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> There being no
                        further chance of plunder, the Aetolians left that part of the country and
                        proceeded to go into Perrhaebia. Here they took Cyretiae by storm and
                        ruthlessly sacked it. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The population of
                        Maloea surrendered voluntarily and were admitted into the Aetolian League.
                        Leaving Perrhaebia, Amynander advised them to attack Gomphi, as it was close
                        to Athamania and there was every probability of its being carried without
                        much fighting. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The Aetolians, however,
                        wanted plunder and made for the fertile plains of Thessaly. Amynander
                        accompanied them, though he did not approve of the disorderly way in which
                        they carried on their depredations nor of their careless method of pitching
                        their camp on any chance ground without taking the trouble to select a good

                        He was afraid that their recklessness and carelessness might bring disaster
                        to him and his men, and when he saw them fixing their camp on flat open

                        of Phaeca stood, he took possession of some rising ground little more than a

                        the Aetolians seemed to have almost forgotten that they were in an enemy's
                        country; some were roaming about unarmed, others were turning day into night
                        with wine and sleep, leaving the camp altogether unguarded. </p>

                        his appearance, and Damocritus and the other generals were in dire
                        consternation. It happened to be midday, when most of the soldiers were
                        asleep after their heavy meal. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Their
                        officers roused them, ordered some to arm themselves and sent off others to
                        recall the plundering parties dispersed over the fields. So great was the
                        hurry and confusion that some of the cavalry went off without their swords
                        and most of them had not put on their body-armour. Sent out thus hurriedly,
                        barely amounting to 600 horse and foot they met the king's cavalry, who were
                        superior to them in numbers, equipment and moral. <milestone n="13"

                        Orders were given to the cavalry to get water and take their dinner a troop
                        at a time, and the light infantry to do the same, a maniple at a time;

                        arms waiting for the main body of infantry, who owing to the weight of their
                        armour had marched more slowly. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> When these
                        arrived they were ordered to plant their standards and put their arms down

                        felt safe, they were quite courageous, but as soon as the Macedonians got
                        into motion and began to advance towards their camp fully prepared for
                        battle, they all promptly deserted their posts and made their escape through

                        camp stood. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Philip felt quite certain that
                        he could have deprived the Athamanians also of their camp, had sufficient
                        light remained, but the day had been consumed, first in the battle and then
                        in plundering the Aetolian camp. So he took up his position on the level

                            unit="section"/> But the Aetolians, who had not recovered from the panic
                        in which they had abandoned their camp, fled in various directions during
                        the night. Amynander proved of the greatest assistance to them; under his

                        continued to harass them, as they had no troops of the same kind to protect
                        them, and their equipment rendered them immobile. The ground, too, was in
                        favour of the assailants. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Very few were
                        actually killed, but there were many wounded; no prisoners were taken
                        because they were cautious about leaving their ranks and kept up the
                        retreating fight in close order. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Thus
                        Philip through his bold initiative as much as by its successful results kept
                        the two nations in check by his well-timed movements and so made good the
                        losses he had sustained in the war with Rome. An incident which occurred
                        subsequently gave him a further advantage by diminishing the number of his
                        Aetolian enemies. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Scopas, one of their
                        principal men, who had been sent by King Ptolemy from Alexandria with a
                        considerable amount of gold, conveyed to Egypt a mercenary army consisting
                        of 6000 infantry and 500 cavalry. He would not have left a single man of
                        military age in Aetolia if Damocritus had not kept some of them at home by
                        sternly reminding them <milestone n="6??" unit="section"/> of the war which
                        was imminent and the defenceless condition of a country deprived of its
                        manhood. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> It is uncertain whether his
                        action was dictated by patriotism or by personal enmity to Scopas who had
                        not bribed him. Such were the various undertakings in which the Romans and
                        Philip were engaged during this summer. </p>

                        then left for Andros with a heavy cargo of decrees quite as extravagant in
                        their praises of their friends as in their expressions of wrath against
                        their enemy. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> They brought up in the

                        await an assault. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> They replied that they
                        were not their own masters, as the place was held by Philip's troops.
                        Thereupon the forces were landed and all the usual preparations for an

                        promptly fled to the citadel, leaving the enemy in possession of the city.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> There they held out for two days,
                        trusting more to the strength of the place than to their own arms; on the

                        Boeotia. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The city itself was made over by
                        the Romans to Attalus; they themselves carried off the plunder and all that
                        adorned the city. Anxious not to have the island a solitude, Attalus
                        persuaded nearly all the Macedonians, as well as some of the Andrians, to
                        remain there. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Subsequently those who had,
                        in accordance with the terms of surrender, migrated to Delium were induced
                        by the king's promises to return, for the love of country made them more

                        Here they spent some days in a fruitless attack on the city, and as it
                        seemed hardly worth while to continue their efforts, they sailed away.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> At Prasiae, a place on the mainland
                        of Attica, the Issaeans joined the Roman fleet with twenty fast

                        brought back to the ships a supply of corn and whatever other food they
                        could find. There was no plunder, nor had the Greeks done anything to
                        deserve being plundered. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> From there they
                        directed their course to Cassandrea, and touched at Mendae, a village on the

                        to the walls when they were caught and scattered by a violent storm in which
                        the vessels almost foundered. It was with difficulty that they gained the

                        This storm was also a presage of their land operations, for after they had
                        collected their vessels and landed their troops they were repulsed in their
                        attack on the city with heavy loss, owing to the strength of the garrison
                        which held the place for Philip. After this failure they withdrew to
                        Canaestrum in Pallene, and from there sailing round the promontory of Torone
                        they headed for Acanthus. After ravaging the territory they took the city by
                        assault and sacked it. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> As their ships
                        were by this time heavily laden with booty they did not go any further, and
                        retracing their course they reached Sciathus, and from Sciathus they sailed

                        made war on Philip. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The demand was refused
                        on the ground that the Aetolians had declined to march out and ravage the
                        Macedonian country at the time that Philip was burning everything round
                        Pergamum, sacred and profane, and so draw him off to look after his own
                        interests. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> So the Aetolians were dismissed
                        with expectations rather than with actual assistance, as the Romans confined
                        themselves to promises. Apustius returned with Attalus to the fleet. Plans
                        were now discussed for attacking Oreus. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        This was a strongly fortified city and, after the former attempt upon it,
                        had been held by a strong garrison. After the capture of Andros twenty
                        Rhodian vessels commanded by Agesimbrotus, all decked ships, joined the
                        Roman fleet. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> This squadron was sent to
                        take its station off Zelasium, a promontory in Phthinia beyond Demetrias,
                        where it would be admirably placed for meeting any movement on the part of
                        the Macedonian ships. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Heraclides, the
                        king's admiral, was anchored at Demetrias, waiting for any chance which the
                        enemy's negligence might offer him rather than venturing on open battle. </p>
                    <p> The Romans and Attalus attacked Oreus on different sides; the former
                        directed their assault against the citadel which faced the sea, whilst
                        Attalus directed his towards the hollow between the two citadels where a
                        wall separates one portion of the city from the other. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> And as they attacked at different points, so they
                        employed different methods. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The Romans
                        brought their vineae and battering rams close up to the wall, protecting
                        themselves with their shield-roof; the king's troops poured in a hail of
                        missiles from their ballistae and catapults of every description. They
                        hurled huge pieces of rock, and constructed mines and made use of every

                        the respect of the future, and so they exhibited more courage and
                        resolution. The Roman general found that more time was being spent there
                        than he expected and that there was a better prospect of success in a
                        regular investment than in a sudden assault. <milestone n="12"

                        so, leaving a sufficient force to complete the investment, he sailed to the
                        nearest point on the mainland, and suddenly appearing before Larissa-not the
                        well-known city in Thessaly, but another, called Cremaste-he captured all
                        the city but the citadel. Attalus, too, surprised Aegeleon, where the
                        inhabitants were not in the least apprehending an attack from an enemy who
                        was engaged in the siege of another city. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                        By this time the siege-works round Oreus had begun to tell upon the place
                        and the garrison were weakened by <milestone n="14??" unit="section"/> their
                        losses and exhausted by the incessant labour of watches and guards by night
                        and day alike. A part of the wall had been loosened by the blows of the
                        battering-rams and had fallen down in several places. <milestone n="15"
                            unit="section"/> The Romans broke through the breach during the night
                        and forced their way into the citadel commanding the harbour. On receiving a
                        signal from the Romans in the citadel Attalus entered the city at daybreak
                        where a large portion of the wall lay in ruins. <milestone n="16"
                            unit="section"/> The garrison and townsmen fled to the other citadel and
                        in two days' time surrendered. The city fell to Attalus, the prisoners to

                        Furius, finding no scope for his activity in Etruria, and bent upon
                        obtaining a triumph for his victories in Gaul, which he thought he might
                        more easily do while the angry and jealous consul was out of the way,
                        suddenly returned to Rome and convened a meeting of the senate in the temple

                        supported him in view of the great services he had rendered, and also on
                        personal grounds. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The older members were
                        for refusing him a triumph, partly because the army which he had employed
                        had been assigned to another commander, and partly because in his eagerness
                            <milestone n="3??" unit="section"/> to snatch the chance of a triumph he
                        had quitted his province, an act contrary to all precedent. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> The consulars, in particular, insisted that he ought to
                        have waited for the consul, for he could then have fixed his camp near the
                        city and so have afforded sufficient protection to the colony to hold the
                        enemy in hand without fighting until the consul came. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> What he failed to do, the senate ought to do, namely,
                        wait for the consul; after hearing what the consul and the praetor had to
                        say, they would form a truer judgment about the case. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> Many of those present urged that the senate ought not
                        to consider anything beyond the praetor's success and the question whether
                        he had achieved it as a magistrate with full powers and under his own
                        auspices. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> "Two colonies," it was argued,
                        "had been planted as barriers to check risings amongst the Gauls. One had
                        been plundered and burnt, and the conflagration was threatening the other
                        colony which was so near it, like a fire running from house to house. What
                        was the praetor to do? <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> If no action ought
                        to have been taken in the consul's absence, either the senate was at fault
                        in furnishing the praetor with an army-for as it had decided that the
                        campaign should be fought by the consul's army and not by the praetor's
                        which was far away, so it could have passed a special resolution to the
                        effect that it should be fought under the consul and not under the
                        praetor-or else the consul was in the wrong in not joining <milestone
                            n="9??" unit="section"/> his army at Ariminum, after he had ordered it
                        to move from Etruria into Gaul, so that he might take his part in the war,
                        which you say ought not to have been undertaken without him. <milestone

                        procrastination and delays of commanders, and you sometimes have to fight,
                        not because you wish to do so, but because the enemy compels you. We ought
                        to keep in view the battle itself and its consequences. <milestone n="11"

                        taken and plundered; one colony relieved from siege; those of the other
                        colony who had been made prisoners recovered and restored to their homes and
                        friends; the war was finished in a single battle. <milestone n="12"
                            unit="section"/> Not to men only was that victory a cause of rejoicing;
                        thanksgivings for three days ought to be offered to the immortal gods
                        because L. Furius had upheld the cause of the republic well and happily, not
                        because he had acted ill and rashly. War with the Gauls was the destined
                        prerogative of the house of the Furii." </p>

                        him and his friends, the personal influence of the praetor, who was on the
                        spot, outweighed the dignity and authority of the absent consul, and by an
                        overwhelming majority a triumph was decreed to L. Furius. So L. Furius as
                        praetor celebrated a triumph over the Gauls during his magistracy.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He brought into the treasury 320,000
                        ases and 100,500 pounds of silver. No prisoners were led in procession
                        before his chariot, nor were any spoils exhibited, nor was he followed by
                        his soldiers. It was obvious that everything except the actual victory was
                        at the disposal of the consul. The Games which Scipio had vowed when he was
                        proconsul in Africa were celebrated with great splendour. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> A decree was made for the allotment of land to his
                        soldiers; each man was to receive two jugera for every year he had served in
                        Spain or in Africa, and the decemviri managed the allotment. Commissioners
                        were also appointed to fill up the number of colonists at Venusia, as the
                        strength of that colony had been diminished in the war with Hannibal.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> C. Terentius Varro, T. Quinctius
                        Flamininus and P. Cornelius, the son of Cnaeus Scipio, were the
                        commissioners who undertook the task. During this year C. Cornelius Cethegus
                        who was holding Spain as propraetor routed a large army of the enemy in the
                        Sedetan district. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> 15,000 Spaniards are
                        said to have been killed in that battle and seventy-eight standards taken.
                        On his return to Rome to conduct the elections, C. Aurelius did not, as was
                        anticipated, make it a ground of complaint that the senate had not awaited
                        his return or given him the opportunity of discussing the matter with the
                        praetor. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> What he did complain of was the
                        way in which the senate had passed the decree granting the triumph without
                        hearing any of those who had taken part in the war or indeed any one at all
                        except the man who was to enjoy the triumph. "Our ancestors," he said, "laid
                        it down that the lieutenants-general, the military tribunes, the centurions
                        and the soldiers should be present in order that the people of Rome might
                        have visible proof of the victory won by the man for whom such an honour was
                        decreed. Was there a single soldier out of the army which fought with the
                        Gauls, or even a single camp-follower from whom the senate might have
                        enquired as to the truth or falsehood of the praetor's report?" <milestone
                            n="7" unit="section"/> After making this protest he fixed the day for
                        the elections. The new consuls were L. Cornelius Lentulus and P. Villius
                        Tappulus. Then followed the election of praetors. Those returned were L.
                        Quinctius Flamininus, L. Valerius Flaccus, L. Villius Tappulus and Cn.
                        Baebius Tamphilus. </p>
                    <p> Provisions were remarkably cheap that year. A great quantity of corn had
                        been brought from Africa and the curule aediles, M. Claudius Marcellus and
                        Sex. Aelius Paetus, distributed it to the people at two ases the modius.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> They also celebrated the Roman Games
                        on a splendid scale and repeated them a second day. Five bronze statues from
                        the proceeds of fines were placed by them in the treasury. The Plebeian
                        Games were celebrated three times by the aediles, L. Terentius Massiliota
                        and Cn. Baebius Tamphilus, the latter being praetor-designate. <milestone
                            n="9" unit="section"/> Funeral Games were also exhibited in the Forum
                        for four days on the occasion of the death of M. Valerius Laevinus by his
                        sons, Publius and Marcus; they also gave a gladiatorial spectacle in which
                        five-and-twenty pairs fought together. One of the Keepers of the Sacred
                        Books, M. Aurelius Cotta, died and Manlius Acilius Glabrio was appointed to
                        succeed him. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> It so happened that the
                        curule aediles who were elected were both unable to take up their duties at
                        once; Gaius Cornelius Cethegus was elected while absent in Spain where he
                        held command; C. Valerius Flaccus was in Rome when he was elected, but as he
                        was a Flamen of Jupiter he could not take the oaths, and it was not
                        permitted to hold any magistracy for more than five days without doing so.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Flaccus asked that this condition
                        might be waived in his case and the senate decreed that if an aedile should
                        provide some one, with the approval of the consuls, to take the oaths for
                        him, the consuls might if they thought good arrange with the tribunes for
                        the matter to be referred to the plebs. L. Valerius Flaccus,
                        praetor-designate, was brought forward to take the oaths for his brother.
                        The tribunes brought the matter before the plebs, and the plebs decided that
                        it should be just as though the aedile himself had taken them. <milestone
                            n="12" unit="section"/> In the case of the other aedile, the tribunes
                        requested the plebs to appoint two men to command the armies in Spain, and
                        the plebs resolved that the curule aedile C. Cornelius should come home to
                        take up his duties and that L. Manlius Acidinus should retire from his
                        province after having held it for many years. They then made an order that
                        Cn. Cornelius Lentulus and T, Stertinius should have the full powers of
                        proconsuls in Spain. </p>
