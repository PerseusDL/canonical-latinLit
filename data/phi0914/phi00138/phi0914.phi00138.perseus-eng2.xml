                    <p> Marcus Fulvius the consul besieged Ambracia, in Epirus, and received its
                        surrender; he reduced Cephallenia, and granted peace to the Aetolians, on
                        their complete subjection. Cneius Manlius the consul, his colleague,
                        conquered the Gallograecians, including the Tolistoboii, Tectosagi, and
                        Trocmi, who, under the command of Brennus, had crossed over into Asia, since
                        they were the only refractory nation on this side of Mount Taurus. Their
                        origin is related, and likewise the manner in which they became masters of
                        the territories which they now hold An instance, also, of virtue and
                        chastity in a woman is recorded: for when the wife of Ortiagon, king of the
                        Gallogrœcians, was a captive, she slew a centurion who was sentinel over
                        her, because he offered her violence. The lustrum was closed by the censors.
                        Two hundred and fifty-eight thousand three hundred and twenty-eight citizens
                        were rated. A treaty of amity was entered into with Ariarathes, king of
                        Cappadocia. Cneius Manlius, although the ten ambassadors by whose advice he
                        had written the terms of the treaty with Antiochus, opposed him, pleaded his
                        cause in person in the senate, and triumphed over the Gallogrœcians. Scipio
                        Africanus, a day of trial being appointed him, as some say, by Quintus
                        Petillius, tribune of the people, as others say, by Naevius, on the charge
                        of having fraudulently deprived the treasury of the plunder taken from
                        Antiochus, when the day of trial came on, was summoned to the rostrum, and
                        said, <quote>On this day, Romans, I conquered Carthage;</quote> and,
                        followed by the people, ascended the Capitol. Subsequently, that he might
                        not receive any further annoyance from the injuries done him by the
                        tribunes, he retired into voluntary exile at Literaum: it is uncertain
                        whether he died there or at Rome, for monuments were erected to his memory
                        in both places. Lucius Scipio Asiaticus, brother of Africanus, was accused
                        and condemned on the same charge of embezzlement as his brother: when he was
                        being led to prison, Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, tribune of the commons,
                        who had been previously on unfriendly terms with the Scipios, vetoed it; and
                        in return for that kindness, received in marriage the daughter of Africanus.
                        When the quaestors were sent to take public posses- sion of the property of
                        Lucius Scipio, not only was no trace of the king's money apparent in it, but
                        not even so much was raised thereby as the amount in which he was fined. He
                        would not receive the countless sum collected by his relations and friends:
                        the mere necessaries of life were purchased back. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> WHILE the war is being carried on in Asia,
                    matters were not even then tranquil among the Aetolians, a com- <pb n="1722"
                        xml:id="p.1722"/> mencement of these disturbances having originated with the
                    nation of the Athamanians. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> At that period,
                    since the expulsion of Amynander, Athamania was kept in subjection by royal
                    garrisons, under governors appointed by Philip, who by their haughty and
                    overbearing exercise of power, had made the people regret the loss of Amynander.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The hope of recovering the kingdom was
                    presented to Amynander, then an exile in Aetolia, by the letters of his
                    partisans, who informed him of the state of Athamania: <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> and messengers were sent to Argithea, (for that was the
                    chief city of Athamania,) to inform the principal men, that, if they were
                    sufficiently assured of the inclinations of their countrymen, he, having
                    obtained succours from the Aetolians, would come into Athamania with a chosen
                    body of Aetolians, who constituted the council of that nation, and their
                    praetor, Nicander. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> And, when he found that
                    they were prepared for every thing, he gave them notice, immediately after, of
                    the day on which he would enter Athamania at the head of an army. <milestone
                        n="6" unit="section"/> At first there were four conspirators against the
                    Macedonian garrison; then each of these took as associates six assistants for
                    the execution of the business; but, afterwards, distrusting their small number,
                    which was rather calculated for the concealment than for the execution of the
                    design, they took in a number of associates, equal to the former. <milestone
                        n="7" unit="section"/> Being thus increased to fifty-two, they divided
                    themselves into four parties, one of which repaired to Heraclea, another to
                    Tetraphylia, where the royal treasure used to be kept, a third to Theudoria, and
                    the fourth to Argithea. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> It was agreed that
                    they should at first appear in the forum publicly, without any bustle, as if
                    they had come about their own ordinary concerns; and then, on a certain day,
                    raise the whole populace, so as to dislodge the Macedonian garrisons from the
                    citadels. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> When the day came, and Amynander
                    with a thousand Aetolians was on the frontiers, by the preconcerted plan the
                    Macedonian garrisons were driven from the four places at once, and letters were
                    despatched to all the other cities, calling on them to rescue themselves from
                    the exorbitant tyranny of Philip, and to reinstate their hereditary and lawful
                    prince. Accordingly, the Macedonians were, every where, expelled. <milestone
                        n="10" unit="section"/> The town of Theium, (in consequence of the letters
                    being intercepted by Teno, commander of the garrison, and owing to the citadel
                    being occupied by the king's troops,) stood a siege of a few <pb n="1723"
                        xml:id="p.1723"/> days, and then <milestone n="11??" unit="section"/>
                    surrendered to Amynander, who had now all Athamania in his power, except the
                    fort of Athenaeum, on the borders of Macedonia. </p>
                <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> When Philip heard of the defection of
                    Athamania, he set out, at the head of six thousand men, and proceeded, with the
                    utmost speed, to Gomphi. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Having left the
                    greater part of his force, as they would not have been equal to such long
                    marches, he went forward, with two thousand, to Athenaeum, the only place which
                    had been retained by his troops. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Then, having
                    made attempts on the nearest places, when he clearly perceived that all the rest
                    of the country was hostile to him, he retreated to Gomphi, and returned with the
                    whole of his army into Athamania. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> He then sent
                    Zeno, at the head of one thousand foot, with orders to seize on Ethopia, which
                    stands advantageously for commanding Argithea; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    and, as soon as he understood that this post was in possession of his party, he
                    himself encamped near the temple of Acraean Jupiter. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> Here he was detained one whole day, by a tremendous storm;
                    and on the next, proceeded to lead them towards Argithea. On the troops
                    commencing their march the Athamanians immediately appeared hastening to the
                    hills which overlooked the road. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> On the sight
                    of whom, the foremost battalions halted, while fear and confusion spread through
                    the whole army, and every one began to consider what might have been the
                    consequence, if the troops had gone down into the valleys commanded by those
                    cliffs. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> This confusion compelled the king, who
                    wished, if his men would follow him, to push on rapidly through the defile, to
                    call back the foremost, and return by the same road by which he came. <milestone
                        n="9" unit="section"/> The Athamanians at first followed at a distance,
                    without making any attempt: after the Aetolians joined them, they left these to
                    harass the rear, and extended themselves on both flanks. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> Some of them, by taking a shorter way, through known paths,
                    seized the passes; and such terror was struck into the Macedonians, that they
                    repassed the river in a manner more like a hasty flight than a regular march,
                    leaving behind many of their men and arms. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    Here was the end of the pursuit, and the Macedonians, in safety, returned to
                    Gomphi, and from Gomphi into Macedonia. The Athamanians and Aetolians ran
                    together, from all sides, to Ethopia, to crush Zeno and his thousand
                    Macedonians. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The Macedonians, distrusting
                    their position. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                    <pb n="1724" xml:id="p.1724"/> removed from Ethopia, to a hill which was higher
                    and steeper on all sides; from which the Athamanians, having found access in
                    several places, dislodged them; and while they were dispersed, and unable to
                    find the road for flight, through impassable and unknown rocks, slew part of
                    them and made part prisoners. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Great numbers,
                    in their panic, tumbled down the precipices; very few, with Zeno, effected their
                    escape to the king. Afterwards, permission to bury their dead was given to them
                    during the truce. </p>
                <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Amynander, on recovering possession of his
                    kingdom, sent ambassadors, both to the senate at Rome and to the Scipios in
                    Asia, who, since the grand battle with Antiochus, stayed at Ephesus. <milestone
                        n="2" unit="section"/> He requested a treaty of amity, and apologized for
                    having had recourse to the Aetolians, for the recovery of his hereditary
                    dominions. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He made many charges against
                    Philip. The Aetolians from Athamania proceeded into Amphilochia, and, with the
                    consent of the greater part of the inhabitants, reduced that nation under their
                    power and dominion. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> After the recovery of
                    Amphilochia, for it had formerly belonged to the Aetolians, they passed on, with
                    hopes of equal success, into Aperantia. That also, for the most part,
                    surrendered to the Aetolians without a contest. <milestone n="5" unit="section"
                    /> The Dolopians had never been subject to the Aetolians, but they were to
                    Philip. These, at first, ran to arms; but when they were informed of the
                    Amphilochians taking part with the Aetolians, of Philip's flight from Athamania,
                    and the destruction of his detachment, they also revolted from Philip to the
                    Aetolians. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Whilst the Aetolians believed that
                    they were now secured against the Macedonians on all sides, by these nations
                    surrounding them, the report is brought to them that Antiochus was conquered in
                    Asia by the Romans. Not very long after, their ambassadors came home from Rome,
                    without the prospect of peace, announcing that the consul Fulvius, with his
                    army, had already crossed the sea. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Dismayed at
                    these accounts, they send the chief men of the state to Rome to try the last

                    marched hence, with their whole force, to raise the siege; afterwards, when they
                    heard that the place was already, in a great measure, surrounded with works, and
                    that the Epirots were encamped on level ground, on the other side of the river,

                    Eupolemus, with one thousand light troops, marching to Ambracia, made his way

                    He broke down the walls with battering-rams, and tore down the battlements with

                    dismay seized the townsmen, at the formidable appearance of the works, and the

                    raising the siege by a bold effort, sent a person called Nicodamus, with five
                    hundred Aetolians, into Ambracia, and appointed a certain night, and <milestone

                    of the alarm on both sides, and night increasing the terror, something memorable
                    might be achieved. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> And Nicodamus, in the dead
                    of the night, (when he had escaped the notice of some of the parties on watch,
                    and broken through others by his determined onset,) having passed the
                    intrenchment, penetrated into the city; and gave the besieged considerable hope

                    the appointed time arrived, according to the plan pre- concerted, he made a

                    was more formidable in the attempt than in the effect, because no attack was

                    Aetolians had either been deterred by fear, or had judged it more advisable to
                    carry succours to Amphilochia, which had been lately reduced; which Perseus, the
                    son of Philip, who was sent to recover Dolopia and Amphilochia, was besieging

                    were carried on in three different places, as has been mentioned before, all
                    which works the Aetolians assaulted at once, but not with similar weapons or

                    they cut off many of the men on guard. Afterwards, when the shout and uproar
                    reached the camp, and the signal was given by the consul, the troops took arms
                    and poured out of all the gates to succour their friends. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> In one place the contest was carried on with fire and
                    sword; from the other two, the Aetolians retired with disappointment, after
                    essaying rather than supporting a fight. The whole brunt of the battle fell on
                    the one quarter with great fury. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Here the two
                    commanders, Eupolemus and Nicodamus, in their different posts, encouraged their
                    men and animated them with hope amounting almost to certainty, that Nicander
                    would, according to his agreement, come up speedily and attack the enemy's rear.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> This expectation for some time supported
                    their courage in the fight. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> But at last, as
                    they did not receive the concerted signal from their friends, and saw the number
                    of their enemies continually increasing, they pressed on with less energy, as if
                    deserted; finally, having abandoned the attempt, their retreat now becoming
                    almost impracticable, they were driven in flight into the city, after having
                    burned a part of the works, however, and killed a much greater number than they
                    lost themselves. If the affair had been conducted according to the plan
                    concerted, there was no reason to doubt but that one part at least of the works
                    might have been stormed with great havoc of the Romans. <milestone n="8"

                    not only in digging under the ground but also in carrying away the earth,
                    escaped the observation of the enemy. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> A heap
                    of it, however, rising suddenly, gave the townsmen intimation of their work, and
                    terrified lest, the wall being undermined, a passage should be opened into the

                    reached such a depth as the bottom of the mine could well be, then keeping
                    profound silence, having applied their ears to several different places, they
                    endeavoured to catch the sound of the miners; which being heard, they opened a
                    way directly towards them. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Nor did it require
                    much exertion, for they came in a short time to an open space where the wall was

                    joining here, as the passage was open from the trench to the mine, the parties
                    began to fight in the dark under ground, first of all with the tools which they
                    had used in the works, but afterwards armed men came quickly up. Subse- quently
                    the contest became less spirited; as the besieged <pb n="1729" xml:id="p.1729"/>
                    stopped the passage, sometimes by stretching strong haircloths across it,

                    exposing themselves, they were transfixed on all sides by arrows, leaden balls,
                    and darts; nor did they know what to do, their minds being paralysed by rage and
                    fear; and they were engaged in a kind of fight for which they were least of all
                    qualified. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> For, as in a close encounter, where
                    they can receive and give wounds in turn, rage inflames their courage; so when
                    they are wounded at a distance, with light weapons from unknown hands, and have
                    no object on which they can rush in their blind fury, they rush forward at
                    random, like wounded wild beasts, often upon their own party. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> Their wounds were more conspicuous because they always
                    fight naked, and their bodies are large and white, since they are never stripped
                    except in battle; thus more blood was poured from their large persons, and the
                    cuts appeared the more shocking, while the whiteness of their skins offered a
                    stronger contrast to the black blood. But they were not much moved by open
                    wounds. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Sometimes they even cut off the skin,
                    when the wound was more broad than deep, thinking that in this condition they
                    fought with the greater glory. But when the point of an arrow or a ball, sinking
                    deep in the flesh, tormented them, <milestone n="11??" unit="section"/> with a
                    wound small in appearance, and the weapon did not come forth although they used
                    every effort to extract it, then they fell into fits of phrensy and shame, at
                    being destroyed by so small a <pb n="1746" xml:id="p.1746"/> hurt; and dashing
                    themselves on the ground, they lay scattered over the place. Some rushing
                    against the enemy were overwhelmed with darts; and when any of them came near,
                    they were slain by the swords of the light infantry. <milestone n="12"

                    and the battalions of the legions advancing, fled in confusion to the camp, now
                    full of tumult and dismay, as the women, children, and others unfit to bear

                    after they came to insuperable steeps, turned towards that side of the mountain
                    which alone had a practicable ascent; <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> and
                    began, as if by concert, to follow the consul's party at a moderate distance;
                    being driven by necessity to adopt the plan, now, which would have been the best
                    at the beginning. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> For in such disadvantageous
                    ground reserves have often been of the utmost use; for instance, should the

                    being fresh, succeed to their place in the fight. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> The consul, as soon as the vanguard of the legions reached
                    the hills taken by the light infantry, ordered the troops to halt and take
                    breath; at the same time he showed them the bodies of the Gauls spread about the
                    hills, asking them, <quote> Since the light troops had fought such a battle,
                        what might be expected from the legions, from a regular army, and from the

                        certainly to take the camp into which the enemy had been driven in confusion

                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> He then orders the light infantry to go
                    forward, who, while the army halted, had not spent their time in idleness, but
                    in gathering weapons about the hills, that there might be a sufficient supply of
                    missiles. They now approached the camp. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The
                    Gauls, lest their fortifications might not give them sufficient protection, had
                    posted themselves, in arms, on the outside of the rampart. Then being <pb

                    since in proportion as they were more numerous and crowded together, the less
                    likely were the weapons to fall between them without effect, they were driven in
                    an instant within their trenches, leaving only strong guards at the entrances of
                    the gates. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Against the crowd that fled into
                    the camp a vast quantity of missile weapons was discharged, and the shouts,
                    intermixed with lamentations of the women and children, showed that great
                    numbers were wounded. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The first line of the
                    legions hurled their javelins against those who were posted to guard the gate;
                    these, however, were not wounded, but most of them, having their shields pierced
                    through, were entangled and fastened together, nor did they longer withstand the

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The gates being now open, a flight of the
                    Gauls in every direction from the camp took place before the victors could burst
                    in. They rushed on blindly through passable and impassable places; no craggy
                    cliffs, nor even perpendicular rocks, stopped them; they feared nothing but the
                    enemy. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Great numbers, therefore, falling down
                    precipices of vast height, were either maimed or killed. The consul, taking
                    possession of the camp, restrained the soldiers from plunder and booty; he
                    orders every one to pursue with his utmost speed, to press on the enemy, and to
                    increase their panic while they were in dismay. <milestone n="3" unit="section"
                    /> The other party, under Lucius Manlius, now came up. These he did not suffer
                    to enter the camp, but sent them forward in the pursuit, and followed shortly in
                    person, after committing the guard of the prisoners to some military tribunes:
                    for he thought that the war would be finished, if in that consternation the
                    greatest possible number should be slain or taken prisoners. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> After the consul's departure, Caius Helvius arrived, with
                    the third division: he was not able to prevent their sacking the camp; and, by a
                    most unjust dispensation, the booty fell into the hands of men who had not had
                    any concern in the action. The cavalry stood for a long time ignorant of the
                    fight, and of the success of their army. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> At

                    the Gauls, (who were now dispersed round the foot of the mountain,) either
                    killed or made prisoners of them. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The number
                    of the slain could not easily be ascertained, because the flight and slaughter
                    were widely ex- <pb n="1748" xml:id="p.1748"/> tended through all the windings
                    of the mountains; <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> and a great number fell from
                    impassable cliffs into cavities of prodigious depth; others were killed in the

                    battles on Mount Olympus, asserts, that forty thousand fell in them; yet
                    Valerius Antias, who is generally addicted to great exaggeration on the point of
                    numbers, says, not more than ten thousand. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The
                    number of prisoners undoubtedly amounted to forty thousand, because the Gauls
                    had dragged along with them a crowd of people of all descriptions and of all
                    ages, like men removing to another country, rather than going out to war.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The consul, having burnt the arms of the
                    enemy collected in one heap, then ordered all to bring together the rest of the

                    public, or distributed the remainder among the soldiers, taking care that the

                    to his merit; Attalus was distinguished above all, with the general approbation
                    of the rest. For not only were the courage and activity of that young prince
                    conspicuous in undergoing dangers and fatigue, but also the modesty of his

                        unit="section"/> Afterwards, in order to soothe her indignation at the
                    insult, he gives the lady hope of a return to her friends; and not even that
                    gratuitously, like a lover. He stipulated for a certain weight of gold, but,
                    being unwilling to have any of his countrymen privy to it, he gave her leave to
                    send any one of the prisoners, whom she chose, as a messenger to her friends.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> He appointed a spot near the river, to

                    which they were unwilling to risk, and also their wives and children, to the

                    led towards that quarter where the conference was to be held; for the tribunes
                    judged that to be the safest course, as they would have the consul's escort, and
                    himself, as a guard opposed to the enemy. However, they posted another guard of

                    sacrifice, he formed his troops in four divisions, that he might lead two up the

                    They dismounted their cavalry, in number ten thousand men, because horsemen
                    could not act among the uneven rocks, and placed them on the right wing.

                    auxiliary troops of Morzes, on the left, made up almost four thousand. The

                    Mount Olympus, took care that they should have ready at hand the same abundance
                    of weapons of every sort. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> When they approached
                    the enemy, all circumstances, on both sides, were the same as in the former
                    battle, excepting their spirits; those of the victors being elated by their
                    success, and those of the Gauls depressed; because, though they themselves had
                    not been defeated, yet they considered as their own, the overthrow of people of
                    their own race. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The battle, therefore,
                    commencing under similar circumstances, had the same issue. The cloud, as it
                    were, of light weapons that were thrown, overwhelmed the army of the Gauls;

                    they received, as the assailants directed their weapons as if at a mark.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The consul now judged, that if he should
                    once show the standards of the legions to them already disordered, they would

                    crossed the river Halys. A great part of the Romans lodged that night in the

                    to supplicate for peace. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Manlius ordered them
                    to attend him at Ephesus; and, being in haste to quit those cold regions, in the

                    Besides, their sling does not consist merely of a single strap, like the
                    Balearic and that of other nations, but the thong of the sling is three-fold,
                    and made firm by several seams, that the bullet may not, by the yielding of the

                    accustomed to drive their bullets through circular marks of small circumference,

                    their face that they aimed at. These slings checked the Samaeans from sallying
                    either so frequently or so boldly; insomuch that they would, sometimes, from the

                    account of these proceedings, war was declared against the Lacedaemonians, by a

                    its being commenced immediately. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> However, the
                    confines of the Lacedaemonians were laid waste by small expeditions, more like
                    freebooting than a regular war, made not only by land, but also by ships at sea.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> This commotion brought the consul into
                    Peloponnesus, and, by his order, a council being summoned at Elis, the
                    Lacedaemonians were called on to plead their own cause. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> There were not only violent debates then, but even
                    altercation. To which the consul, although his answer had been indecisive in
                    other respects, since he encouraged both parties through a very eager desire to
                    please, put an end, by one decisive order, that they should desist from
                    hostilities, until they sent ambassadors to Rome, to the senate. <milestone

                    The Lacedaemonian exiles intrusted their cause and embassy to the Achaeans.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Diophanes and Lycortas, both of them
                    Megalopolitans, were at the head of the Achaean embassy, who, being at variance
                    in their own republic, there also delivered speeches by no means in unison.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Diophanes was for leaving the
                    determination of every point to the senate —that they would best decide the

                        unit="section"/> while Lycortas, according to the instructions of

                    their own decrees, made conformable to the treaty, and their own <pb n="1757"

                    was resolved, that no alteration should be made respecting the Lacedaemonians;
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> but the answer given was so confused,
                    that, while the Achaeans understood it as full permission given to them in
                    relation to Lacedaemon, the Lacedaemonians construed it, that unlimited power
                    was not conceded to them. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The Achaeans used this power in an immoderate

                    in office, and he, in the beginning of spring, collecting an army, encamped in
                    the territory of the Lacedaemonians, and thence sent ambassadors to insist on
                    their delivering up the authors of the insurrection; <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> promising, that if they complied, their state should remain
                    in peace, and that those persons should not suffer any punishment, without
                    having pleaded their cause. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> There was silence
                    among the rest through fear; but the persons demanded by name, declared that
                    they would voluntarily go, if their faith was pledged by the ambassadors, that
                    violence would not be resorted to, until their cause were heard. Several other
                    men, of illustrious characters, went along with them, both as supporters of
                    those private individuals, and because they thought their cause concerned the

                    brought the Lacedaemonian exiles into the country, because they knew that
                    nothing would disgust the people so much; but now, the vanguard of almost their
                    whole army was composed of them. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> When the
                    Lacedaemonians came to the gate of the camp, these men met them in a body, and,
                    first, began to provoke them with insulting language; a wrangle then ensuing,
                    and their passions being inflamed, the most furious of the exiles made an attack
                    on the Lacedaemonians. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> While these appealed to
                    the gods, and the faith of the ambassadors; and while the ambassadors and the
                    praetor were driving back the crowd, and protecting the Lacedaemonians, and were
                    keeping back some who were already binding them in chains, —the <milestone n="8"

                    excited. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The Achaeans, at first, ran thither
                    to view the spectacle; but then the exiles, with loud clamours, complained of
                    the sufferings that they had undergone, implored assistance, and at the same
                    time insisted, that they would never have such an opportunity if they neglected
                    this; <pb n="1758" xml:id="p.1758"/> that the treaties, solemnly ratified in the
                    Capitol, at Olympia, and in the citadel of Athens, had been rendered void by
                    these men; and that before they should be bound by a new treaty, the guilty
                    ought to be punished. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The multitude being
                    inflamed by these expressions, at the voice of one who called out that they
                    should fall on, attacked them with stones; and seventeen persons, who, during
                    the disturbance, had been put in chains, were killed. <milestone n="11"

                    A decree for their restoration was made at Tegea, in a general council of the

                    had left the city and dispersed through the country, it was resolved, that,
                    before the army was disbanded, the praetor should go with some light troops,
                    and, seizing that description of people, sell them as spoil. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> Great numbers were accordingly seized, and sold; and with
                    that money a portico at Megalopolis, which the Lacedaemonians had demolished,
                    was rebuilt, with the approbation of the Achaeans. <milestone n="8"

                    so many pitched battles with one hundred thousand of your fiercest enemies; who
                    killed or made prisoners more than forty thousand; who stormed two of their

                    Conscript fathers, their charge, as you perceive, is two-fold: for they assert,

                    them, showing more affection towards his brother than regard for the laws.
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Of these acts, Gracchus himself
                    complained, saying, that the tribunitian power was annulled by a private person;
                    and at last, when he promises support to Lucius Scipio, he adds, that the
                    precedent would be more tolerable, if both the tribunitian authority and the
                    state appeared to be overpowered by a tribune of the commons, than if by a

                    reproaches for this signal instance of intemperate violence, in such a manner,
                    that while he charged him with having degenerated so far from himself, he gave
                    to him his long-established praises for moderation, self-control, with many-fold
                    increase, so as to make <pb n="1787" xml:id="p.1787"/> ample amends for the
                    present reprehension. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> For he said, that the
                    people were formerly severely rebuked by Scipio, because they wished to make him
                    perpetual consul and dictator; that he hindered statues from being erected to
                    him in the comitium, in the rostrum, in the senate-house, in the Capitol, in the
                    chapel of Jupiter's temple, and that he prevented a decree being passed, that
                    his image, in a triumphal habit, should be brought in procession out of the

                    that the contract was accordingly executed in due form, in the presence of this

                    senate considered so worthy, that the province of Asia and the war with
                    Antiochus were assigned him, without leaving it to the decision of the lots; and
                    by his brother, that, after two consulships, the censorship, and a triumph, he
                    attended him into Asia in quality of lieutenant-general. <milestone n="9"

                    the day when Lucius Scipio conquered Antiochus in a pitched battle at Magnesia,
                    Publius Scipio was absent at the distance of several days' journey, being sick

                        suspected as being too favourable to Antiochus. For his entire kingdom has

                        of an accusation were never sought against Quinctius on that account. The
                        reason was, that he had not Africanus for a brother, whose high renown ought
                        to have been serviceable to Lucius Scipio; but envy of his merit had done
                        him injury. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> A quantity of gold and silver

                        Where, then, was all this royal treasure; where the value of so many estates
