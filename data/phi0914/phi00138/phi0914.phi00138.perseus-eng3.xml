                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Whilst the war was going on in Asia, even
                        Aetolia did not remain free from disturbance. The Athamanians were the cause
                        of the trouble. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> After the expulsion of
                        Amynander, the country was held down by the governors whom Philip had
                        established and provided with troops, and their arbitrary and lawless rule
                        made the people feel keenly the disappearance of their king. <milestone
                            n="3" unit="section"/> He was spending his time of exile in Aetolia, and
                        the letters of his friends and their description of the condition of
                        Athamania led him to hope that he might recover his crown. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> He sent messengers to Argithea, their capital, to
                        inform their leaders that if he were fully assured of the sympathies of his
                        compatriots, he would obtain assistance from the Aetolians and enter the
                        country with the members of the Aetolian council and their captain-general,
                        Nicander. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> When he saw that they were
                        prepared for all eventualities, he told them at very short notice the day on
                        which he intended to enter Athamania with an army. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> The movement against the Macedonians was begun by four
                        men; they each selected six comrades, then feeling no confidence in so small
                        a number, which was more adapted to conceal than to execute their project,
                        they doubled the number of their fellow-conspirators. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> Having thus grown to fifty-two, they formed themselves
                        into four parties; one was to make for Heraclea, a second for Tetraphylia
                        where the royal treasure used to be kept, the third was to go to Theudoria,
                        and the fourth to Argithea. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> They had all
                        agreed to show themselves in the forums without making any disturbance, as
                        though they had come on private business, and on a fixed day they were to
                        raise the populations in the different cities and expel the Macedonian
                        garrisons from their citadels. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> When the
                        day came and Amynander was on the frontier with 1000 Aetolians, the
                        Macedonian garrisons were simultaneously driven out of the four cities, and
                        letters were sent to all the other cities urging them to shake themselves
                        free from the tyranny of Philip and win back their ancestral and legitimate
                        monarchy. The Macedonians were expelled from all parts of the country.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Xeno, the commandant of the garrison
                        in Theium, intercepted the message sent to that city, and by seizing the
                        citadel was able to stand a siege for a few days. <milestone n="11"
                            unit="section"/> At last that place, too, surrendered to Amynander, and
                        the whole of Athamania, with the exception of the fort of Athenaeum, which
                        lay close to the frontier of Macedonia, was now in his power. </p>

                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> On hearing of the revolution in Athamania,
                        Philip started off with a force of 6000 men, and after an extraordinarily
                        rapid march arrived at Gomphi. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Here he
                        left the greater part of his army, who were unable to keep up such long
                        marches, and went on with 2000 men to Athenaeum, the one place that had been
                        retained by his troops. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> From here he tried
                        to secure some of the places nearest to him, but he soon found that they
                        were all hostile, and accordingly he returned to Gomphi. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> Re-entering Athamania with the whole of his force, he
                        sent Xeno forward with 1000 infantry to seize Ethopia, a good position for
                        commanding Argithea. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> When Philip saw that
                        his men were in occupation of the place, he encamped near the temple of
                        Jupiter Acraeus. Here he was detained a whole day by a terrible storm; the
                        next day he decided to advance against Argithea. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> Whilst his men were on the march they suddenly caught
                        sight of the Athamanians running up to some high ground which commanded
                        their line of march. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> At this sight the
                        leading ranks halted and there was confusion throughout the column, as the
                        men all asked themselves what would happen if the column went down into the
                        valley where it was commanded by those heights. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> Philip wanted to push rapidly through the pass, but the
                        confusion that had been caused compelled him to recall the head of the
                        column and order them to counter-march along the way they had come.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> At first the Athamanians followed them
                        quietly at some distance, but when the Aetolians had joined them, they left
                        it to them to harass the enemy's rear while they themselves closed in on
                        their flank, and some making a short cut through country they were familiar
                        with, seized the head of the pass. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The
                        confusion amongst the Macedonians was such that their recrossing of the
                        river resembled a precipitate flight rather than an orderly march, and they
                        left many men and arms behind. Here the pursuit stopped and the Macedonians
                        got back safely to Gomphi and from there withdrew into Macedonia. <milestone
                            n="11" unit="section"/> The Athamanians and Aetolians mustered from all
                        sides round Ethopia with the object of expelling Xeno and his 1000
                        Macedonians. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Feeling their position to be
                        insecure they left Ethopia and took up a position on higher and more
                        precipitous ground. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> The Athamanians,
                        however, found out the approaches, attacked them from several different
                        points and drove them from the heights. Scattered in flight and unable to
                        find their way through pathless thickets and over rocky ground with
                            <milestone n="14??" unit="section"/> which they were unfamiliar, they
                        were killed or made prisoners, many in their panic fell down the cliffs, and
                        only a very few succeeded in making their escape with Xeno to the king.
                        Subsequently a truce was arranged for the burial of those who had fallen.

                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> His crown recovered, Amynander sent a
                        delegation to the senate and another to the Scipios, who were staying at
                        Ephesus after the battle with Antiochus. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                        He asked to be allowed to remain on a peaceful footing with Rome, and in
                        excusing himself for having sought the aid of the Aetolians in winning back
                        his ancestral throne, threw the whole responsibility for the war on Philip.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> From Athamania the Aetolians marched
                        into Amphilochia, and the voluntary surrender of the majority of the
                        population made them masters of the whole country. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> After recovering Amphilochia which had formerly
                        belonged to them, they invaded Aperantia, hoping for equal success, and this
                        State also to a large extent surrendered without offering any resistance.
                        The Dolopians had never been under Aetolia; they had formed part of Philip's
                        dominions. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> At first they flew to arms, but
                        when they learnt that the Amphilochians had joined the Aetolians, that
                        Philip had fled from Athamania and his force had been cut up, they too
                        revolted from him and joined the Aetolians. <milestone n="6" unit="section"
                        /> With these States all round them, the Aetolians considered themselves
                        secure on every side from the Macedonians. But in the midst of their
                        security they received intelligence of the defeat of Antiochus at the hands
                        of the Romans in Asia, and not long after, their envoys returned from Rome
                        bringing no hope of peace and announcing that the consul Fulvius had already
                        landed in Greece with an army. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Appalled at
                        these tidings they begged Rhodes and Athens to send delegates to Rome so
                        that with the support of these friendly nations their own petitions which
                        had been lately rejected might find readier access to the ear of the senate.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> They then sent their leaders to Rome
                        as their last hope, having taken no precautions to avoid war until the enemy
                        was almost in sight. M. Fulvius had now brought his army up to Apollonia and
                        was consulting the Epirot leaders as to where he should open the campaign.

                        lies at the foot of a rugged eminence which the natives call Perranthes.

                        assembled at Stratus, on the summons of Nicander, their captain-general.
                        Their first intention was to march thither with all their forces and raise
                        the siege, but when they found that a great part of the city was already
                        invested and that the Epirot camp was fixed on the level ground the other
                        side the river, they divided their forces. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                        Eupolemus with 1000 light infantry succeeded in entering the city at a point
                        where the lines were not yet closed. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                        Nicander intended to make a night attack with the rest of the troops upon
                        the Epirot camp, as the Romans would find it difficult to come to their
                        assistance with the river between them. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                        On second thoughts, however, the risk seemed too great in case the Romans
                        took the alarm and endangered his retreat, so he marched away and ravaged

                        when they saw that the walls were still standing, their courage revived and

                        large stones and stout beams of wood; they dragged with iron grapples the

                        state of things in Ambracia the Aetolians had returned from their plundering
                        raid to Stratus. Here Nicander hit upon a bold stroke by which he hoped to
                        raise the siege. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> His intention was to
                        introduce a certain Nicodamus into the city with 500 Aetolians, and he fixed
                        the night and the hour at which an attack was to be made from the city on
                        the hostile works directed against the Pyrrheum whilst he himself threatened
                        the Roman camp. By this double attack, all the more alarming because made in

                            unit="section"/> Nicander moved forward in the dead of the night and
                        after passing some of the advanced posts unobserved and forcing his way

                        then when the noise of the tumult and clamour reached the camp, the consul
                        gave the signal and the Romans, seizing their weapons, poured out of all the
                        gates to help their comrades. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Only at one
                        point was there a real fight between sword and fire; at the two others the

                        without effecting anything. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> A desperate

                        and encouraged them with the almost certain hope of Nicander's coming up as
                        he had promised and taking the enemy in the rear. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> This hope for some time kept up their spirits, but when
                        they failed to receive the agreed signal from their comrades and found that
                        the numbers of the enemy were increasing, their courage waned and at last
                        they gave up the attempt, and finding their retreat almost cut off, fled in

                        destroyed a new one was raised in its place and the citizens stood in arms
                        on the fallen masonry to bar all approach. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        Finding that he was making very little progress by direct assault, the
                        consul decided to construct a secret passage underground after first

                        was prepared to fit the other end. The cask was then filled with light
                        feathers, the cover fastened on, and through the holes some long spears-the

                        services they had rendered in the war against Philip. At that time no great
                        gratitude had been shown them; they ought not now to pay an excessive
                        penalty. The consul told them in reply that the Aetolians had frequently
                        asked for peace, but seldom with the honest intention of keeping it. They
                        must follow the example of Antiochus whom they had dragged into the war.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> He had ceded not only those few cities
                        whose liberty had been the cause of quarrel, but the whole of Asia on this

                        He, the consul, would not listen to any proposals unless the Aetolians laid
                        down their arms. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> They must first give up
                        their arms and all their horses; then they must pay 1000 talents; half the
                        sum to be paid down at once, if they wished to have peace. And in addition
                        to these terms it must be stipulated in the treaty that they would have the
                        same friends and the same enemies as Rome. </p>

                        with the Romans. Although these conditions were much less onerous than they
                        had expected, they asked to be allowed to lay them before their council.

                        delegates at last arrived, the consul meantime wondering what had delayed
                        them. On their informing him that the Aetolian Council accepted the
                        conditions of peace, he told them to go to Rome to appear before the senate;
                        the Rhodians and Athenians were also allowed to go to plead for them; and
                        the consul also allowed his brother, C. Valerius, to accompany them.

                        them. Through his representatives, in his despatches he had asserted that
                        Dolopia, Amphilochia and Athamania had been wrested from him, and his
                        garrisons and even his son Perseus had been expelled from Amphilochia.

                        the method of payment, the understanding with the consul held good. If they
                        preferred to pay it in silver rather than in gold, they might do so provided
                        that ten silver pieces were taken as the equivalent of one gold piece.

                        in Gallograecia. I will now proceed to narrate the events of this war. The
                        consul went to Ephesus at the beginning of spring and took over the troops

                        to encourage them to begin a fresh war against the Gauls. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> This nation, he reminded them, had gone to the
                        assistance of Antiochus, and so intractable was their temper that the
                        removal of Antiochus beyond the Taurus would be useless unless the power of
                        the Gauls was broken. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> He concluded his
                        address with a few sincere and unaffected words about himself. <milestone

                        applauded him; they looked upon the Gauls as simply a division of Antiochus'
                        army, and now that the king was overcome they did not think that there would
                        be much aggressive energy in the Gauls when left to themselves. <milestone
                            n="6" unit="section"/> Eumenes was in Rome at the time and the consul
                        regarded his absence as ill-timed, since he was familiar with the country
                        and the population and was personally interested in the destruction of the
                        power of the Gauls. The consul sent, therefore, for his brother Attalus, who
                        was at Pergamum, and pressed him to take his part in the war. <milestone
                            n="7" unit="section"/> Attalus promised on his own behalf and on that of

                        and was met at Magnesia by Attalus with 1000 infantry and 500 cavalry. His
                        brother Athenaeus was under orders to follow with the rest of the forces,
                        and the defence of Pergamum was entrusted to men whom he believed to be
                        loyal subjects of their king. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The consul
                        warmly approved of the young man's action and advanced with the whole of his

                        entrenched himself, and as the river was unfordable, vessels had to be

                        the river Harpasus. Here they were met by a deputation from Alabandi, who
                        came with a request to the consul to compel, either by his personal
                        authority or his arms, a revolted stronghold to return to its former
                        allegiance. Here, too, came Eumenes' brother Athenaeus with the Cretan

                        reduce the stronghold and it was restored to the people of Alabandi; he
                        himself continuing his march encamped at Antiochia on the Maeander.

                        was once the capital of Phrygia. The population migrated a short distance
                        from the old city and built a new one, which received the name of Apamea
                        after Apama, the sister of King Seleucus. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        The river Marsyas which rises not far from the sources of the Maeander flows
                        into that river, and the story goes that it was at Celaenae that Marsyas

                        auxiliaries under Attalus because Seleucus maintained that Antiochus had
                        only agreed to supply corn to the Roman soldiers. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> The dispute was settled by the firmness of the consul,
                        who sent a tribune from the headquarters tent to give notice that the Roman
                        soldiers were not to take the corn before the troops of Attalus had received
                        their share. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> From Antiochia they marched
                        to a place called Gordiutichi, and a further three days' march brought them
                        to Tabae. This place lies within the frontiers of Pisidia, in that part
                        which looks towards the Pamphylian sea. As this country was unwasted by war,
                        its population were in a bellicose mood. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                        On this occasion they made a vigorous attack on the Roman column and at
                        first created some confusion, but when it became evident that they were
                        outmatched in numbers and in courage and were driven back to their city,
                        they craved for mercy and offered to surrender the city. A fine of 25
                        talents of silver and 10,000 medimni of wheat was imposed upon them.
                            <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> On these terms they were allowed to

                        no deputation came from Moagetes, the faithless and cruel tyrant of that
                        city. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> In order to ascertain his attitude
                        the consul sent an advance-party of 4000 infantry and 500 cavalry under C.
                        Helvius. This force was already entering his territory when envoys met them
                        with the announcement that the tyrant was ready to comply with the consul's
                        orders. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> They begged Helvius to enter their
                        territory peaceably and to restrain his soldiery from plundering their

                        made into a crown. Helvius promised to protect their fields from pillage and
                        told them to go to the consul. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> When they
                        had spoken in a similar strain to him, he replied: "We Romans have received
                        no proofs of goodwill on the part of the tyrant towards us, and it is a
                        matter of common knowledge that he is the sort of man whom we ought to think
                        of punishing rather than treating as a friend." <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> The envoys were greatly perturbed at these words and
                        simply requested him to accept the golden crown and to allow the tyrant to
                        visit him in person with liberty to speak and clear himself of suspicions.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The consul gave permission and the
                        next day the tyrant arrived. His dress and his retinue were hardly equal to
                        those of a private citizen of moderate means; his language was abject and
                        broken, and he sought to excuse himself by pleading the poverty of his
                        cities and his dominions. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Besides Cibyra
                        he had the city of Sylleum and a place called Alimne, and out of these
                        cities he promised, though somewhat doubtfully, to raise 25 talents, but
                        only by robbing himself and his subjects. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                        "Really," replied the consul, "this trifling is intolerable! After trying,
                        unblushingly, to fool us through your envoys, you actually keep up the same
                        effrontery now you are here. You say 25 talents will exhaust your

                        appalled by the threat, the tyrant still persisted in his presence of
                        poverty. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Shuffling, whimpering and
                        shedding crocodile tears, he was at last brought to a fine of 100 talents,
                        and in addition 10,000 medimni of corn. All this was carried through in six

                        the Romans. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> They sent to the consul to
                        implore his assistance; shut up in their citadel with their wives and
                        children, they were daily looking forward to death either by sword or
                        famine. The consul gladly seized the pretext for a march into Pamphylia, and
                        raised the siege, granting peace to Termessus on the payment of 50 talents

                        continuously till he reached the city of Cormasa. The next city to this was
                        Dursa, which they found deserted by the panic-stricken inhabitants, but
                        abundantly supplied with all manner of stores. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> On his advance past the marshes a deputation came to
                        him from Lysinoe to surrender their city. From this point he entered the
                        territory of Sagalassus, a fertile district rich in all kinds of fruits.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Its Pisidian inhabitants are by far
                        the best soldiers in that part of the world. Their military superiority, the
                        fruitfulness of their soil, their large population, and the situation of
                        their exceptionally strong city make them a brave people. As no envoys
                        appeared when the consul reached their frontiers, he sent out plundering
                        parties into their fields. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> At last, as
                        they saw their crops carried off and their cattle driven away, their
                        stubbornness yielded. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The envoys whom
                        they sent agreed to pay a fine of 50 talents, 20,000 medimni of wheat and an
                        equal amount of barley, and on these terms they obtained peace. Making a

                        took longer than they expected, and a fresh quarrel broke out between the

                        their limbs become powerless with sweat and fatigue, their weapons hang
                        idly; their flabby bodies and, when their fury has spent itself, their
                        flabby spirits, too, are prostrated by sun and dust and thirst, even though

                        have made trial of them, not only legions against legions, but man against
                        man. T. Manlius and M. Valerius have shown how steady Roman courage can get
                        the better of Gaulish frenzy. M. Manlius flung down single-handed the Gauls
                        who were climbing the Capitol. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> And,
                        besides, those ancestors of ours had to deal with genuine Gauls bred in
                        their own land; these are degenerates, a mongrel race, truly what they are
                        called-Gallograeci. Just as in the case of fruits and cattle, the seed is
                        not so effective in keeping up the strain as the nature of the soil and
                        climate in which they are reared are in changing it. </p>

                        throwing out scouting parties. Marching continuously, he came to the river
                        Sangarius, and as there was no possibility of fording it, he decided to
                        construct a bridge. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The Sangarius rises in
                        the Adoreos range and flowing through Phrygia mingles its waters with the

                        Magna from Pessinus with their insignia, who prophesied in mystic and

                        have made this their business centre. The Romans found it deserted, the

                        was received from Oroanda to the effect that the Tolostobogii had actually

                        chiefs of these three tribes were Ortiagon, Comboiomarus and Gaulotus.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Their main reason for adopting this
                        mode of warfare was that by holding the principal heights in the country,
                        provided with everything they might require for an indefinite period, they
                        hoped to wear out the enemy. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> They never
                        imagined he would venture to approach them over such steep and difficult
                        ground; if he did make the attempt they believed that even a small force
                        would be sufficient to dislodge him or throw him back in confusion; whilst
                        if he remained inactive at the foot of the mountain he would be unable to
                        endure the cold and hunger. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Though the
                        height of their position was itself a protection, they drew a trench and
                        constructed other defences round the peaks on which they were established.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Missile weapons they troubled
                        themselves very little about as they thought the rocky ground would supply

                        fighting would not be at close quarters but would involve an attack upon
                        positions from a distance, he accumulated a large quantity of javelins,
                        light infantry spears, arrows and leaden balls and small stones suitable for
                        hurling from slings. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Provided with these
                        missile weapons, he marched towards Olympus and encamped about four miles'

                        he sent Attalus with 500 cavalry to reconnoitre the ground and the situation
                        of the Gaulish camp. While thus engaged a body of hostile cavalry, twice as
                        large as his own force, sallied from their camp and put him to flight; some
                        of his men were killed and several wounded. <milestone n="4" unit="section"
                        /> The next day the consul went out with the whole of his cavalry to
                        explore, and as none of the enemy appeared outside their lines he made the
                        circuit of the mountain in safety. He noticed that towards the south the
                        ground rose in gentle slopes and was covered with soil; on the north the
                        cliffs were precipitous and almost vertical. <milestone n="5" unit="section"
                        /> There were only three possible roads-everywhere else it was

                        which were difficult, one on the south-east and the other on the north-west.
                        After making these observations he encamped for the day close to the foot of
                        the mountain. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The following day, after he
                        had offered the sacrifices and the first victims had given favourable omens,

                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> the largest he commanded in person and
                        began the ascent where it afforded the easiest approach; his brother, L.

                        ground allowed of his doing so safely, but if he came to a dangerous or
                        precipitous part he was not to struggle against the difficulties of the path
                        nor try to force his way over insuperable obstacles. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> In that case he was to turn and march across the face
                        of the mountain and unite his division with the one which the consul was
                        leading. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> C. Helvius was to work gradually
                        round the lower slopes of the mountain and then take his division up the

                        at the bottom, and their commanders were under orders to watch carefully the

                        steep and they held their shields in front of them, not because they
                        expected a hand-to-hand contest, but simply to avoid the missiles.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> With the discharge of missiles the
                        battle began, and at first it was fought on even terms as the Gauls had the

                        their missile weapons. As the struggle went on, however, it became anything
                        but equal; the shields of the Gauls though long were not broad enough to
                        cover their bodies, and being flat also afforded poor protection. Moreover,
                        they had no weapons but their swords, and as they could not come to close
                        quarters these were useless. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> They tried to
                        make use of stones, but as they had not got any ready, they had to use what
                            <milestone n="6??" unit="section"/> each man in his hurry and confusion
                        could lay hands on, and unaccustomed as they were to these weapons, they
                        could not make them more effective by either skill or strength. <milestone
                            n="7" unit="section"/> On all sides they were being hit by the arrows
                        and leaden bullets and javelins which they were powerless to ward off;
                        blinded by rage and fear they did not see what they were to do, and they
                        found themselves engaged in the kind of fighting for which they were least
                        fitted. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> In close fighting where they can
                        receive and inflict wounds in turn, their fury stimulates their courage; so
                        when they are being wounded by missiles flung from a distance by an unseen
                        foe and there is no one against whom they can make a blind rush, they dash
                        recklessly against their own comrades like wild beasts that have been
                        speared. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Their practice of always fighting
                        naked makes their wounds more visible, and their bodies are white and fleshy
                        as they never strip except in battle. Consequently more blood flowed from
                        them, the open gashes appeared more horrible, and the whiteness of their
                        bodies showed up the stain of the dark blood. Open wounds, however, do not
                        trouble them much. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Sometimes, where it is
                        a surface bruise rather than a deep wound, they cut the skin, and even think
                        that in this way they win greater glory in battle. <milestone n="11"
                            unit="section"/> But when the head of an arrow has gone in or a leaden
                        bullet buried itself and it tortures them with what looks like a slight
                        wound and defies all their efforts to get rid of it, they fling themselves
                        on the ground in shame and fury at so small an injury threatening to prove
                        fatal. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> So they were lying about
                        everywhere, and some who rushed down on their enemy were being pierced with
                        missiles from all sides; those who got to close quarters the velites slew
                        with their swords. These soldiers carry a shield three feet long, javelins
                        in their right hand for use at a distance and a Spanish sword in their
                        belts. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> When they have to fight at close
                        quarters they transfer the javelins to their left hands and draw their
                        swords. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Few of the Gauls now survived,
                        and when they found themselves worsted by the light infantry and the legions
                        coming on, they fled in disorder back to their camp, which was full of
                        tumult and panic, as the women and children and other noncombatants were all
                        crowded there together. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> The Romans took

                        had marched up as far as the mountain-side afforded a path, and when they
                        came to a place where it was impossible to advance they each turned towards
                        the only <milestone n="2??" unit="section"/> part which was accessible, and
                        as though by mutual understanding, they followed the consul at some distance
                        from each other. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Necessity compelled them
                        to adopt now what would have been the best course at the outset, for over
                        such difficult ground supports have often proved of the greatest use; when
                        the first line has been thrown into disorder the second line can shelter
                        them and go into action fresh and unshaken. <milestone n="4" unit="section"

                        light infantry had captured, the consul ordered his men to rest and recover
                        their breath. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> He pointed to the bodies of
                        the Gauls scattered over the ground and said: "If the light infantry could
                        fight as they have done, what may I not expect from the legions, from those
                        who are fully armed, from the valour of my bravest soldiers? Surely after
                        the light infantry have driven the enemy in confusion into their camp, you
                        legionaries must storm and capture it." <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        During this halt the light infantry had been busy collecting the missiles
                        which were lying everywhere, in order that they might have a sufficient
                        supply, and the consul now ordered them to advance. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> As they approached the camp, the Gauls, fearing lest
                        their entrenchments should afford them insufficient protection, were
                        standing in arms in front of the rampart. They were at once overwhelmed by a
                        general discharge of missiles, for the greater their numbers and the closer
                        their formation so much more surely did every weapon find its mark. In a few
                        minutes they were driven inside their lines, leaving only strong bodies to
                        guard the camp gates. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> A heavy shower of
                        missiles was now directed upon the masses in the camp, and the mingled
                        shrieks of women and children showed that many of them were hit. <milestone

                        legionaries hurled their javelins. They were not wounded by them, but their
                        shields were pierced, and thus hopelessly entangled together they were not
                        able long to resist the Roman attack. </p>

                        in every direction from the camp before the victors burst in. Blindly they
                        dashed along the paths and over places where there was no path; no
                        precipices, no cliffs stopped them; they feared nothing but the enemy.

                        heights; they died, maimed and crushed. The consul kept his men from

                        harass the enemy and increase his panic. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                        When the second division under L. Manlius came up, he forbade them also to
                        enter the camp, and sent them off at once in pursuit. After placing the
                        prisoners in charge of the military tribunes he joined in the pursuit, for

                        killed or made prisoners whilst they were in such a state of panic.

                        which their comrades had won. Then they rode, wherever their horses could
                        travel, after the Gauls dispersed round the mountain, and either killed or

                        the enemy were only ten miles distant from it. <milestone n="2"

                        occurred in connection with a female prisoner. The wife of a chief named
                        Orgiagon, a woman of exceptional beauty, was with other captives in the
                        custody of a centurion who was notorious even amongst soldiers for his
                        licentiousness and greed. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> At first he made
                        improper proposals to her, but finding that she treated them with
                        abhorrence, he took advantage of her servile condition and violated her.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Then, to assuage her anger and shame
                        at the outrage, he held out hopes to her of returning to her friends, but
                        not as a lover would have done without ransom. He stipulated for a certain
                        weight of gold, and to prevent his men from knowing anything about it, he
                        allowed her to choose one of the prisoners and send a message by him to her

                        went there at the appointed time with an escort of 500 cavalry, but as not a

                        across the Halys, together with their wives and children; secondly, because

                        and their arms for battle, he met the first charge firmly without giving
                        ground. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Then when the weight of numbers
                        began to tell he slowly retired, keeping his ranks unbroken, but at last
                        when there was more danger in remaining on the field than safety in keeping
                        their ranks, they all broke and fled. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                        Thus scattered they were hard pressed by the Gauls, as they cut them down,
                        and a large proportion of them would have been destroyed had not the 600 who
                        were posted to protect the foragers met them in their flight. <milestone
                            n="14" unit="section"/> They had heard the shouts of alarm amongst their
                        comrades, and hurriedly getting their weapons and horses ready they came
                        fresh into the fight when it was almost over. This turned the fortunes of
                        the day. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> and the panic recoiled from the
                        defeated on to the conquerors. The Gauls were routed in the first charge,
                        and as the foragers came running up from the fields, the enemy found
                        themselves met on every side, with hardly any way of escape open. The Romans
                        on fresh horses were pursuing those which were tired and exhausted, and few
                        escaped. No prisoners were taken. By far the greater number paid the death
                        penalty for their breach of good faith. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>
                        Furious at this treachery the Romans advanced in full strength against the

                            unit="section"/> It was formed into four divisions; two of these he
                        intended to take up the middle of the mountain, the two others were to

                        Tectosagi and the Trocmi, who formed his main strength, numbering 50,000
                        men, held the centre; the cavalry, 10,000 strong, were dismounted as horses
                        were useless on that broken ground, and formed the right wing; the
                        Cappadocians under Ariarathes and the Morzian auxiliaries, in all about
                        4000, were posted on the left. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The consul
                        placed his light infantry in the first line as he had done in the battle on
                        Olympus, and took care that they should have an equally ample supply of
                        weapons at hand. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> When they approached the
                        enemy all the features of the former battle were reproduced except that the
                        courage of the one side was raised by their recent victory and that of the
                        other side depressed, for the enemy though not yet themselves defeated,
                        looked upon the defeat of their fellow-countrymen as tantamount to their
                        own. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> As the battle began, so it ended in
                        the same way. A perfect cloud of missiles overwhelmed the Gauls. <milestone

                        formation, they received more wounds the more densely they were packed, as

                        The consul thought that the sight of the standards of the legions would put
                        the already demoralised Gauls to instant flight, and accordingly he retired
                        the light infantry and other skirmishers within the ranks of the legions and

                        their ground somewhat longer on the wings, as it took longer to reach them;
                        they did not, however, wait for the first discharge of missiles. <milestone

                        and killed in all some 8000 men in the flight; there was no attempt at
                        fighting. The survivors crossed the Halys. A large part of the Roman army
                        passed the night in the enemy's camp; the rest the consul led back to their
                        own camp. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The day following, the consul
                        counted up the prisoners and the booty; the amount of the latter was as
                        great as even a nation that was always bent on rapine, and had for many

                            unit="section"/> There were very heavy floods this year; on twelve
                        several occasions the Tiber inundated the Campus Martius and the low-lying
                        parts of the City. After Cn. Manlius had brought the war against the Gauls
                        in Asia to a close, the other consul, M. Fulvius, now that the Aetolians
                        were subjugated, sailed across to Cephallania, and sent round to the
                            <milestone n="6??" unit="section"/> various cities in the island to ask
                        them which they preferred-surrender to the Romans or the chances of war.
                        Fear prevented them all from refusing to surrender, and they gave the
                        hostages, which the consul demanded in proportion to their scanty resources.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Peace beyond their hopes had now
                        dawned upon the Cephallanians, when suddenly, for some unknown reason, one
                        city that of Same, revolted. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> They said
                        that, as their city occupied an advantageous position, they were afraid that
                        the Romans might compel them to live elsewhere. <milestone n="9"

                        breach of the peace was due to imaginary fears, or whether the matter had
                        been talked about amongst the Romans and so come to their ears, is quite
                        uncertain. What is certain is that after giving hostages they closed their
                        gates, and though the consul sent these hostages to the walls to appeal to
                        the sympathies of their fellow-citizens and kinsmen, they refused to abandon
                        their opposition. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> As no peaceable reply

                        the way of defence against siege-works or assaults. Their method of
                        resistance was mainly two-fold. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> On the one
                        hand, where the wall was destroyed they always built a strong one inside
                        close to it, and on the other they made sudden sorties, at one time against
                        the siege-works, at another against the outposts. In these actions they
                        generally proved superior. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> One method was
                        discovered of keeping them back; a simple one, but worth mentioning.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> A hundred slingers were sent for from
                        Aegium, Patrae and Dymae. These men had been in the habit, as their fathers
                        had before them, of practicing with their slings, with which they used to
                        hurl into the sea the round stones lying on the beach. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> In this way they gained a more accurate and longer
                        range than the Baliaric slingers. Their slings, too, were not made of a
                        single strap, like those of the Baliarics and other nations, but they
                        consisted of three thongs, stiffened by beings sewn together. <milestone
                            n="6" unit="section"/> This prevented the bullet from flying off at
                        random when the thong was let go; when fixed in the sling it could be so
                        whirled round as to fly out as though from the string of a bow. <milestone
                            n="7" unit="section"/> They used to send their stones through rings at a
                        great distance, as targets, and were thus able to hit not only the head but
                        whatever part of the face they aimed at. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                        These slings kept the Samaeans from making such frequent or such daring
                        sorties; so much so in fact that they called to the Achaeans from their
                        walls and begged them to retire for a time and remain quiet spectators while
                        they fought with the Roman outposts. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Same
                        sustained a siege of four months. Day by day some of their scanty numbers
                        fell or were wounded, and the survivors became exhausted in mind and body.

                        wall and forced their way through the citadel which they call the Cyatis-the
                        city extends on the west down to the sea-and appeared in the forum. When the
                        Samaeans found that the city was partly captured by the enemy they took
                        refuge in the larger citadel with their wives and children. <milestone

                        importance or owing to its convenient situation, Aegium had been the
                        meeting-place of the Council of the League ever since it had been formed.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> This year for the first time
                        Philopoemen tried to do away with this custom, and was preparing to bring in

                        in turn. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Just before the consul's visit
                        the Damiourgi (the supreme magistrates) of the various States had convened a

                        summoned them to Argos. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> As they would
                        evidently almost all meet there, the consul, though he was in favour of
                        Aegium, went to Argos. Here the question was debated, and when he saw that
                        the Assembly were inclined towards Argos, he gave way. <milestone n="6"

                        grievances. The main cause of anxiety to their city was the threatening
                        attitude of the exiles, many of whom were living in forts and villages which
                        they had seized on the Laconian coast. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The
                        Lacedaemonians chafed under this state of things; they wanted to have access
                        to the sea somewhere or other in case they wanted to send a mission to Rome
                        or elsewhere, and also that they might have a free port in which to receive
                        merchandise and necessaries from abroad. They made an attack by night upon a
                        maritime village called Las. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The villagers
                        and exiles were at first terror-struck by the unlooked-for attack, but
                        before it was day they collected in a body and without much difficulty drove
                        the Lacedaemonians out. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Then the whole of
                        the coast took alarm and all the forts and villages and the exiles who had

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> From the first, Philopoemen had championed
                        the cause of the exiles and had always tried to persuade the Achaeans to
                        abridge the power and influence of the Lacedaemonians. <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> He now summoned a council to hear the envoys, and on
                        his initiative a decree was passed in the following terms: "Whereas T.
                        Quinctius and the Romans have committed to the good faith and protection of
                        the Achaeans the villages and forts on the coast of Laconia, and whereas the
                        village of Las has been attacked by the Lacedaemonians who were bound by
                        treaty not to interfere with them, and blood has been shed there, we decree
                        that unless the authors and abettors of this outrage are surrendered to the
                        Achaeans, the treaty shall be held to be broken." <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> A mission was at once despatched to Lacedaemon to
                        insist on this demand. So arbitrary and arrogant did it appear in the eyes
                        of the Lacedaemonians that if that city had been in the position it once
                        held they would undoubtedly have taken up arms. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> What they feared most of all was that if they submitted
                        to the yoke so far as to comply with this initial demand, Philopoemen would
                        carry out the policy he had long contemplated of handing Lacedaemon to the
                        exiles. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> In a frenzy of anger they put to
                        death thirty men who belonged to the party who were in league with
                        Philopoemen and the exiles, and then passed a decree denouncing the alliance
                        with the Achaeans and ordering the immediate despatch of a mission to
                        Cephallania to make a formal surrender of Lacedaemon to the consul and to
                        Rome, begging him to come to <milestone n="6??" unit="section"/> the
                        Peloponnesus and receive their city into the protection and suzerainty of
                        the people of Rome. </p>

                        the Achaeans, all the States of the League with one consent proclaimed war
                        against the Lacedaemonians. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Winter
                        prevented any immediate operations on a large scale, but their territories
                        were devastated by bodies of raiders both by land and sea, more in the
                        fashion of brigandage than of regular warfare. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> It was this disturbance that brought the consul to the
                        Peloponnesus, and by his orders a council was summoned to Elis and the
                        Lacedaemonians were invited to state their case. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> The discussion soon became a heated quarrel, which the
                        consul put an end to. He was anxious to befriend both sides and after giving
                        a reply which committed him to nothing, warned them both to abstain from
                        hostilities until their representatives had appeared before the Senate. Both
                        sides sent delegates to Rome; the Lacedaemonian exiles entrusted their cause
                        to the Achaeans. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The leaders of the
                        Achaean embassy were Diophanes and Lycortas, both natives of Megalopolis.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> They were opposed to one another in
                        their political views and the speeches they delivered showed a similar
                        divergence. Diophanes was for leaving the decision on every point to the
                        Senate as they would settle <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/> the matters
                        in dispute between the Achaeans and the Lacedaemonians in the best possible
                        way. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Lycortas, acting on instructions from
                        Philopoemen, claimed the right of the Achaeans to execute their decree in
                        accordance with the treaty and their laws, and pleaded that as the Senate
                        had been the instrument of their freedom, so they should preserve that
                        freedom for them undiminished and unimpaired. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> At that time the Achaeans stood high in Roman esteem;
                        it was, however, decided that the position of the Lacedaemonians should be
                        in no way changed. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The reply of the
                        senate was so ambiguous that while the Achaeans assumed that they had a free
                        hand with regard to Lacedaemon, the Lacedaemonians interpreted it to mean
                        that the Achaeans had not gained all they asked for. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The Achaeans made a most unscrupulous use
                        of the permission which they considered to have been granted them.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Philopoemen was still in office and in
                        the first days of spring he called out the army and fixed his camp on
                        Lacedaemonian territory. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Then he sent to
                        demand the authors of the revolt, and promised that if the city would
                        surrender them it should remain at peace, and the men themselves should
                        suffer no injury until their case had been heard. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> Fear kept the rest silent; those who had been named
                        declared their willingness to go, as they had received from Philopoemen's
                        emissaries a guarantee that they would be safe from violence until they had
                        pleaded their cause. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Others, men of high
                        position, went with them to support their friends and also because they
                        considered their cause to be the cause of the State. Never before had the
                        Achaeans brought the exiles with them on to Lacedaemonian soil, because they
                        thought that nothing would do more to estrange their fellow-countrymen from
                        them, but now they were almost in the forefront of the whole army.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> When the Lacedaemonians came to the
                        gate of the camp the exiles met them in a body. At first they assailed them
                        with insults; then passions became heated on both sides, and the more
                        ferocious of the exiles made an attack upon the Lacedaemonians. <milestone
                            n="7" unit="section"/> Whilst these were appealing to the gods and the
                        pledged word of Philopoemen's emissaries, and he and his emissaries were
                        keeping back the crowd and protecting the <milestone n="8??" unit="section"
                        /> Lacedaemonians and preventing some from actually manacling them, a large
                        crowd collected and the disturbance increased. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> The Achaeans ran up to see what was going on, and the
                        exiles, protesting loudly about the sufferings they had endured, implored
                        their help and told them if they let this opportunity slip they would never
                        again have such a favourable one. "The treaty which had been solemnly
                        published in the Capitol at Olympia and in the citadel at Athens had been
                        set at nought by these men, and before we are bound by another treaty the
                        guilty must be punished." <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> This language
                        excited the crowd, and one man shouted out "Kill them." On this they flung
                        stones at them, and seventeen men who had been thrown into chains during the
                        tumult were killed. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> On the following day
                        sixty-three were arrested whom Philopoemen had protected from violence, not
                        that he was concerned for their safety, but because he did not want them to
                        perish before the day of trial. Victims to the fury of the mob, they spoke
                        but little and that to deaf ears. All were found guilty and handed over for
                        punishment. </p>

                        they sent them peremptory orders: first, that they must destroy their walls;
                        secondly, that all the foreign mercenaries who had served under the tyrants
                        must depart from the land of Laconia; <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                        thirdly, that all the slaves whom the tyrants had set free, and of whom
                        there was a large number, must leave by a certain day; any who remained the

                            unit="section"/> lastly, they must abrogate the laws and customs of
                        Lycurgus and accustom themselves to the laws and institutions of the
                        Achaeans, as in this way they would form one body and unite more easily in a
                        common policy. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> With none of these demands
                        did they comply more readily than with that demanding the destruction of
                        their walls, and none roused such bitter feeling as that demanding the
                        restoration of the exiles. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> A decree for
                        their restoration was passed in the Council of the Achaeans at Tegea, and it
                        was stated that the foreign mercenaries had been disbanded, and that the
                        "naturalised Lacedaemonians," for so they designated the slaves set free by
                        the tyrants, had left the city and dispersed into the surrounding country.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> On receiving this intelligence it was
                        decided that before the army was demobilised the captain-general should go
                        with a light force and arrest those people and sell them as lawfully
                        acquired booty. Many were thus caught and sold. <milestone n="7"

                        of the Achaeans restored. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> This city also
                        won back the territory of Belbina, which the tyrants of Lacedaemon had
                        wrongfully taken possession of; this was in pursuance of an old decree made
                        by the Achaeans during the reign of Philip the son of Amyntas. <milestone

                        lost the sinews of her strength, and was for a long time at the mercy of the
                        Achaeans. No loss, however, affected her more deeply than the loss of the

                        children already born might be regarded as legitimate and capable of

                        the municipal boroughs of Formiae, Fundi and Arpinum. They had hitherto
                        enjoyed the citizenship without the power of voting. <milestone n="8"

                        ground that it had not received the sanction of the senate, but on being
                        informed that it rested with the people and not the senate to confer the
                        franchise on whom they chose, they abandoned their opposition. <milestone

                        to vote in the Aemilian tribe, and those of Arpinum in the Cornelian. In
                        these tribes, therefore, they were for the first time enrolled by virtue of
                        the plebiscite, passed on the motion of Valerius. The censor M. Claudius
                        Marcellus, to whom the ballot gave precedence over T. Quinctius, closed the
                        lustrum. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The census gave the number of
                        citizens as 258,318. After these matters were settled the consuls left for

                        that they must put a stop to their custom of making armed forays and confine

                        the coast, and with the addition of Eumenes' fleet, which was brought up by
                        his brother Athenaeus, the consul was able to transport the whole of his
                        force to Europe. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The army was heavily
                        weighted with spoils of every description and its advance consequently
                        through the Chersonese was at a moderate pace till they reached Lysimachia.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Here they rested for some time in

                        Lysimachia the consul reached Melas, and the next day he arrived at Cypsela.
                        From Cypsela a ten miles' march over broken ground shut in by forests
                        awaited them. In view of the difficulties of the route the army was formed
                        into two divisions. One was ordered to march in advance, the other, at a
                        considerable distance, to bring up the rear. The baggage was placed between
                        them. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> This included the wagons carrying
                        the State money and other valuable booty. Whilst marching through a pass in
                        this order a body of Thracians drawn from the four tribes of Astii, Caeni,
                        Maduateni and Coreli, not more than 10,000 in number, occupied each side of
                        the road at its narrowest part. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> It was
                        generally thought that this was due to treachery on Philip's part, that he
                        knew the Romans would return through Thrace and was also aware of the amount
                        of money they were carrying. </p>

                        and the broken and difficult ground made him anxious. As long as the armed
                        troops were passing through, the Thracians did not stir, but when they saw
                        that the vanguard had <milestone n="10??" unit="section"/> cleared the
                        narrowest part of the pass and those behind were nowhere near, they attacked
                        the baggage and the pack animals, and killing the escort began to loot the
                        wagons, while others led off the horses with their packs. <milestone n="11"

                        who had already entered the pass; then they reached the leading division.
                        From both directions a rush was made to the centre, and irregular fighting
                        began at several points. The booty itself exposed the Thracians to
                        slaughter, hampered as they were by the loads they were carrying, and most
                        of them without arms that they might have their hands free for pillage.
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The unfavourable ground on the other
                        hand exposed the Romans to the barbarians, who ran up through paths they
                        were familiar with or concealed themselves in the recesses of the rocks.
                        Even the packs and wagons obstructed the combatants and interfered with the
                        movements of one side or the other just as it chanced. <milestone n="13"

                        changed as first one side and then the other was on favourable or

                        preponderated on either side, some engaged with larger, others with smaller
                        bodies than their own. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> Many fell on both
                        sides and night was already coming on when the Thracians drew off from the
                        fight, not to escape wounds and death, but because they had as much plunder
                        as they wanted. </p>

                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The fighting had practically extended
                        the whole length of the pass, a portion of the pack animals and camp
                        servants had fallen and a considerable number of soldiers. But the most
                        serious loss was that of the gallant and energetic Q. Minucius Thermus.

                        not less precipitous than the one already surmounted, but as there was no
                        wooded country around it, it afforded no concealment for an ambush.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Another Thracian tribe, the Thrausi,
                        had assembled here, quite as greedy of plunder, but their movements, as they
                        tried to block the pass, were visible from afar owing to the bareness of the
                        landscape. The Romans were very little perturbed as though the ground was
                        ill-adapted for maneuvering, they saw that they could fight on a proper
                        front in a regular action. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Charging in
                        close order and raising their battle-cry they drove the enemy from his
                        ground and then put him to flight. The narrowness of the pass crowded the

                        remained, taking in corn partly from the country people, who brought it in

                        Abdera, they arrived at Neapolis. The whole of this march through the Greek
                        colonies was unmolested, but the other part through the heart of Thrace,
                        though not actually opposed, demanded caution both by day and night.

                        route under Scipio they found the Thracians less aggressive; the only reason
                        for this being that there was less chance of plunder, plunder being their
                        one object. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> We are, however, told by
                        Claudius that a body of Thracians, amounting to some 15,000, sought to
                        oppose Muttines the Numidian, who was reconnoitring in advance of the main
                        army. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> There were 400 Numidian cavalry and

                        protested against both consuls being confined to the valleys of Liguria.

                        that there should be armies in those countries it was more fitting that

                        ungrateful to their foremost men. Rome was the more ungrateful of the two,
                        for whilst Carthage after her defeat drove the defeated Hannibal into exile,
                        Rome would banish the victorious Scipio in the hour of her victory.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Others again took the ground that no
                        single citizen should stand on such an eminence that he could not be
                        required to answer according to law. Nothing contributed more towards
                        maintaining liberty for all than the power of putting the most powerful

                        matter was discussed until the day of trial came. Never before had anyone,

                        with Rome were solely in his hands; that Scipio had behaved towards the
                        consul in his province as dictator rather than subordinate; that he had gone
                        out with no other object than to make clear to Greece and Asia and all the
                        kings and nationalities in the East what had long been the settled
                        conviction of Spain and Gaul and Sicily and Africa, that he alone was the

                        should be suspended. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> I am going at once to
                        the Capitol and the Citadel to make my devotions to Jupiter Optimus Maximus,

                        forestalled your honours by my services; then pray now to the gods that you
                        may always have leaders like me." <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> From
                        the Rostra he went straight up to the Capitol, and the whole Assembly
                        turning their backs on the tribunes followed him; even the secretaries and
                        apparitors left the tribunes; there was no one with them except their
                        attendant slaves and the usher who used to stand at the Rostra and call the
                        defendants. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Scipio not only went up to
                        the Capitol; he visited all the temples throughout the City, accompanied by
                        the Roman people. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> The enthusiasm of the
                        citizens and their recognition of his real greatness made that day almost a
                        more glorious one for him than when he entered the City in triumph after his
                        victories over Syphax and the Carthaginians. </p>

                        brightness for Scipio. He saw before him envious attacks and contests with
                        the tribunes, and so after a somewhat lengthy adjournment had been agreed
                        upon, he retired to Liternum, firmly resolved not to appear in his defence.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> His spirit was too high, his mind too
                        great; he had all through held a position too lofty to allow him to accept
                        the position of a defendant or submit to the humiliation of having to plead
                        his cause. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> When the day arrived and his
                        name was called, L. Scipio apologised for his absence on the ground of
                        ill-health. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The prosecuting tribunes did
                        not accept the excuse and gave out that his refusal to appear was dictated
                        by the same spirit of pride and arrogance in which he had left the seat of
                        judgment and the tribunes and the Assembly. <milestone n="5" unit="section"
                        /> Surrounded by the very men whom he had deprived of the right and liberty
                        of passing sentence upon him, and dragging them after him like prisoners of
                        war, he had celebrated a triumph over the people of Rome and had made a
                        secession on that day from the tribunes to the Capitol. "So now," they
                        continued, "you have the due reward of your folly; the man at whose
                        instigation and under whose leadership you deserted us, has now deserted
                        you. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> So low is our courage falling day by

                        and a fleet at his command, that man we dare not now, though he is only a
                        private citizen, fetch from his country-house to stand his trial." L. Scipio
                        appealed to the tribunes of the plebs as a body, and they passed the
                        following resolution: "If illness be pleaded as an excuse, it is our
                        pleasure that this excuse be accepted, and our colleagues must again adjourn
                        the day of trial." <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Tiberius Sempronius
                        Gracchus was one of the tribunes. He was a political opponent of Scipio, and
                        had forbidden his colleagues to add his name to their resolution. <milestone
                            n="9" unit="section"/> It was generally expected that he would give a
                        more severe sentence, but he drew up a resolution in the following terms:
                        "Since L. Scipio has pleaded illness as the reason for his brother's
                        absence, I hold that to be sufficient excuse, and will not allow P. Scipio
                        to be put on his trial before his return to Rome; <milestone n="10"

                        by the common consent of gods and men attained such a lofty position through
                        his own acts and the honours which the Roman people have conferred upon him,
                        that for him to stand beneath the Rostra as a defendant, and have to listen
                        to the insults of young men, would be a greater ignominy for the people of
                        Rome than for him." </p>

                        speech: Is Scipio, the conqueror of Africa, to stand at your feet, tribunes?
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Was it for this that he broke and
                        routed four armies in Spain under the most famous generals that Carthage
                        possessed? <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Was it for this that he
                        captured Syphax and crushed Hannibal, made Carthage tributary to us, removed
                        Antiochus beyond the Taurus-for his brother Lucius allowed him to share his
                        glory-was it simply that he might succumb to the two Petillii, and that you
                        might claim the palm of victory over Publius Africanus. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> Will you allow the claim, citizens? Will illustrious

                        not venerated, at least inviolate?" <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> His
                        resolution and the speech which followed it had their effect upon the other
                        tribunes, even upon the prosecutors, who said that they would deliberate as
                        to what their right and duty demanded. After the Assembly broke up, a
                        meeting of the senate was held. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Here a
                        most hearty vote of thanks to Tiberius Gracchus was passed by the whole
                        order, especially the men of consular rank and the elder senators, for
                        having placed the interests of the State before his own private feelings,
                        and the Petillii were taunted with wanting to shine by darkening another's
                        reputation and enrich themselves by a triumph over Africanus. <milestone
                            n="7" unit="section"/> After this nothing more was said about
                        proceedings against Scipio. He passed his life at Liternum without any wish
                        to return to the City, and it is said <milestone n="8??" unit="section"/>
                        that on his death-bed he gave orders that he should be buried and his
                        monument set up there, so that there might be no funeral rites performed for
                        him by his ungrateful country. He was an extraordinary man, more
                        distinguished, however in the arts of war than in those of peace. <milestone
                            n="9" unit="section"/> The earlier part of his life was more brilliant
                        than the later; as a young man he was constantly engaged in war; with
                        advancing years the glory of his achievements faded, and there was nothing
                        to call forth his genius. What additional lustre did his second consulship
                        confer as compared with his first, or even his censorship? <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> What further distinction did he gain during his
                        subordinate command in Asia, rendered useless through bad health and
                        saddened by the misfortune which overtook his son? Then, again, after his
                        return he was under the necessity of either standing his trial or of
                        absenting himself from his native city. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                        Still, he alone won the unique glory of bringing the war with Carthage to a
                        close, the greatest and most serious war that the Romans have ever waged.

                        his enemies rose. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The foremost of these
                        was M. Porcius Cato, who even during Scipio's lifetime was constantly
                        belittling his greatness, and it was at his instigation, it was thought,
                        that the Petillii attacked him whilst he was alive. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> After his death they introduced into the Assembly the
                        following motion: "Touching the money which was seized, confiscated and
                        exacted from Antiochus and his subjects, is it your will and pleasure,
                        Quirites, that in respect of such money as has not been accounted for to the
                        State, the City praetor Servius Sulpicius shall consult the senate as to
                        which of the acting praetors it shall appoint to investigate the matter?"
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The two Mummii, Quintus and Lucius,
                        interposed their veto to this proposal; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                        they considered that where money had not been accounted for to the State, it
                        was only right and proper that the senate should conduct such investigation
                        as it always had done previously. The Petillii accused the nobility and the
                        despotic power which the Scipios possessed over the senate. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> L. Furius Purpurio, a man of consular rank, one of the
                        ten commissioners, thought that the inquiry ought to go further. <milestone

                        suggested that it ought to include not only the amount taken from Antiochus,

                            unit="section"/> L. Scipio, who it was evident would speak more in his
                        own defence than against the proposal, came forward to oppose it. He
                        protested strongly against this question being raised after the death of his
                        brother P. Africanus, of all men the bravest and most illustrious.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> No public eulogium had been made over
                        him when he died, but that was not enough, now accusations must be levelled
                        at him. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Even the Carthaginians were
                        content with banishing Hannibal; the Roman people were not satisfied with
                        the death of Africanus, but his reputation must be torn to pieces over his
                        tomb, and as an aggravation of malice, his brother also must be sacrificed.
                        M. Cato supported the motion; his speech, "Concerning the money of King
                        Antiochus," is still extant. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The weight
                        of his authority deterred the Mummii from opposing it, and as these withdrew

                        that this praetor was so attached to the family of the Cornelii that at the

                        a cap of liberty just as though he were marching in a triumphal procession,
                        and at the Porta Capena he distributed wine sweetened with honey to those
                        who followed the body, because amongst the other captives in Africa he had
                        been delivered by Scipio. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Another account
                        is that he was hostile to the family; that, knowing this, the party opposed
                        to the Scipios selected him as the one man to conduct the inquiry.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> However this may be, it was before

                        At Liternum there was a monument surmounted by a statue which we have seen

                        brought into agreement. The title of Scipio's speech gives the prosecutor's

                        he describes him as a knave, sometimes as a trifler. <milestone n="6"

                        those authorities who aver that at the time when Lucius Scipio was tried and
                        convicted of having taken bribes from the king, Africanus was serving in a
                        subordinate command in Etruria and, on hearing of the misfortune which had
                        befallen his brother, hurried back to Rome. <milestone n="8" unit="section"
                        /> On learning that his brother was being taken to prison, he went straight
                        to the Forum, drove off the officer who had charge of him and, his affection
                        for his brother getting the better of his citizenship, even used violence
                        towards the tribunes who tried to hold him back. </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Gracchus himself complains that in this
                        instance the authority of the tribunes was successfully defied by a private
                        citizen, and at the end of his speech where he promises to support Scipio,
                        he adds that it would form a better precedent were it to appear that the
                        tribunitian and State authority had been overborne by a tribune of the plebs
                        rather than by a private citizen. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> But
                        while he reproaches him bitterly for losing his self-control in this one
                        outbreak of lawlessness, and censures him for having fallen so far below
                        himself, he makes up for his censures in recalling the high esteem in which
                        Scipio was held in the old days for his equable and self-disciplined
                        character. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> He reminded his hearers how
                        severely Scipio rebuked the people for wishing to make him perpetual consul
                        and dictator; how he had prevented them from raising statues to him in the
                        Comitium, the Rostra, the senate house, and in the shrine of Jupiter on the
                        Capitol, and how he had prevented a decree from being passed authorising his
                        image decked in triumphal garb to be borne in procession from the temple of

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> It is generally understood that the
                        younger of his two daughters was married to this same Gracchus, and the
                        elder one was certainly disposed of by her father to P. Cornelius Nasica,

                        story goes that when Gracchus saw that L. Scipio was on the point of being
                        carried off to prison and that none of his fellow-tribunes interfered on his
                        behalf, he swore that though his enmity towards the Scipios was as strong as
                        ever, and he would do nothing to <milestone n="4??" unit="section"/> win his
                        favour, yet he would not look on whilst the brother of Africanus was being
                        taken to a dungeon into which he had seen Africanus himself taking kings and
                        commanders. The senate happened to be dining that day in the Capitol, and
                        rising in a body they begged Scipio to betroth his daughter to Gracchus
                        there and then. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The betrothal having been
                        formally completed in the presence of the whole gathering, Scipio went home.
                        On meeting his wife, he told her that he had betrothed their youngest
                        daughter. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> She was naturally hurt and
                        indignant at not having been consulted in the disposal of their child, and
                        observed that even if he were giving her to Tiberius Gracchus, her mother
                        ought to have had a voice in the matter. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                        Scipio was delighted to find that they were of one accord, and told her that
                        it was to that man that she was betrothed. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                        It is right that in the case of so great a man the various opinions and the

                            unit="section"/> P. Scipio Nasica formally appealed to the tribunes in a

                        out that the two distinguished men, Cn. and P. Scipio, were the fathers

                        prison. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> These two men had for many years
                        fought in Spain against numerous armies of Carthaginians and Spaniards, and
                        had not only added to the glory of Rome, but after presenting to those two

                        and good faith, had at last given their lives for the commonwealth. It would

                            <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/> P. Africanus had so far surpassed
                        his father's renown that men believed him to be sprung from no human
                        parents, but to be of divine origin. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> As to
                        Lucius Scipio, whose case was before them, he would pass over all that he
                        had done as his brother's lieutenant in Spain and Africa, and would remind
                        them that when he was consul the senate thought him worthy of being
                        entrusted with Asia and the war with Antiochus as his province, without
                        having recourse to the ballot. His brother, too, though he had been censor
                        and twice consul, and graced with a triumph, went to him to serve as his
                        lieutenant in Asia. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Whilst he was there,
                        as though to prevent the greatness and splendour of the lieutenant from
                        eclipsing the fame of the consul, it so happened that on the day when Lucius
                        Scipio completely defeated Antiochus in the great battle of Magnesia,
                        Publius Scipio was several days' journey away, lying ill at Elaea.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The army that Lucius engaged was not
                        less than that which Hannibal commanded at the battle in Africa. Hannibal
                        who had commanded all through the Punic war was also among the generals with
                        Antiochus. The conduct of the war was such that no one could charge even
                        Fortune with caprice. It is in respect of the peace that the charges are
                        made; the peace is said to have been sold. <milestone n="11" unit="section"
                        /> If so, the ten commissioners are also involved in the charge; it was on

                        And though out of those ten men some came forward to accuse Cn. Manlius, not

                        peace formed the grounds of suspicion as being too favourable to Antiochus.
                        "His kingdom," they say, "has been left to him in its entirety; after his
