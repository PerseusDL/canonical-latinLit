                    <p> During the siege of Veii winter dwellings erected for the soldiers. This
                        being a novelty, affords the tribunes of the people a pretext for exciting
                        discontent. The cavalry for the first time serve on horses of their own.
                        Furius Camillus, dictator, takes Veii after a siege of ten years. In the
                        character of military tribune, whilst laying siege to Falisci, he sends back
                        the children of the enemy, who were betrayed into his hands. Furius
                        Camillus, on a day being appointed for his trial, goes into exile. The
                        Senonian Gauls lay siege to Clusium. Roman ambassadors, sent to mediate
                        peace between the Clusians and Gauls, are found to take part with the
                        former; in consequence of which the Gauls march directly against Rome, and
                        after defeating the Romans at Allia take possession of the city with the
                        exception of the Capitol. They scaled the Capitol by night, but are
                        discovered by the cackling of geese, and repulsed, chiefly by the exertions
                        of Marcus Manlius. The Romans, compelled by famine, agree to ransom
                        themselves. Whilst the gold is being weighed to them, Camillus, who had been
                        appointed dictator, arrives with an army, expels the Gauls, and destroys
                        their army. He successfully opposes the design of removing to Veii. </p>
                </argument>
                <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> PEACE being established in every other
                    quarter, the Romans and Veientians were still in arms with such rancour and
                    animosity, that it was evident that ruin awaited the vanquished party. The
                    elections in the two states were conducted in very different methods. <milestone
                        n="2" unit="section"/> The Romans augmented the number of military tribunes
                    with consular power. Eight, a number greater than on any previous occasion, were
                    appointed, Manius Aemilius Mamercinus a second time, Lucius Valerius Potitus a
                    third time, Appius Claudius Crassus, Marcus Quintilius Varus, Lucius Julius
                    Iulus, Marcus Postumius, Marcus Furius Camillus, Marcus Postumius Albinus. The
                    Veientians, on the contrary, through disgust at the annual intriguing which was
                    sometimes the cause of dissensions, elected a king. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> That step gave offence to the feelings of the states of
                    Etruria, not more from their hatred of kingly government than of the <pb n="323"
                        xml:id="p.323"/> king himself. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> He had
                    before this become obnoxious to the nation by reason of his wealth and
                    arrogance, because he had violently broken off the performance of some annual
                    games, the omission of which was deemed an impiety: <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> when through resentment of a repulse, because another had
                    been preferred to him as a priest by the suffrages of the twelve states, he
                    suddenly carried off, in the middle of the performance, the performers, of whom
                    a great part were his own slaves. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The nation,
                    therefore, devoted beyond all others to religious performances, because they
                    excelled in the method of conducting them, passed a decree that aid should be
                    refused to the Veientians, as long as they should be subject to a king.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> All allusion to this decree was suppressed
                    at Veii through fear of the king, who would have considered the person by whom
                    any such matter might be mentioned as a leader of sedition, not as the author of
                    an idle rumour. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Although matters were
                    announced to the Romans as being quiet in Etruria, yet because it was stayed
                    that this matter was being agitated in all their meetings, they so managed their
                    fortifications, that there should be security on both sides; <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> some were directed towards the city and the sallies of the
                    townsmen; by means of others a front looting towards Etruria was opposed to such
                    auxiliaries as might happen to come from thence. </p>
                <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> When the Roman generals conceived greater
                    hopes from a blockade than from an assault, winter huts also, a thing quite new
                    to the Roman soldier, began to be built; and their determination was to continue
                    the war by wintering there. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> After an account
                    of this was brought to Rome to the tribunes of the people, who for a long time
                    past <milestone n="3??" unit="section"/> had found no pretext for exciting
                    disturbances, they run forward into the assembly, stir up the minds of the
                    commons, saying that <quote> this was the motive for which pay had been
                        established for the soldiers, nor had it escaped their knowledge, that such
                        a present from the enemies was tainted with poison. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> That the liberty of the commons had been sold; that
                        their youth removed for ever, and exiled from the city and the republic, did
                        not now even yield to the winter and to the season of the year, and visit
                        their homes and private affairs. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> What
                        could they suppose was the cause for continuing the service without
                        intermission? That undoubtedly they should find none other than [the fear]
                        lest any thing might be done in furtherance of their interests by <pb
                            n="324" xml:id="p.324"/> the attendance of those youths in whom the
                        entire strength of the commons lay. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        Besides that they were harassed and worked much more severely than the
                        Veientians. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> For the latter spent the
                        winter beneath their own roofs, defending their city by strong walls and its
                        natural situation, whilst the Roman soldier, in the midst of toil and
                        hardship, continued beneath the covering of skins, overwhelmed with snow and
                        frost, not laying aside his arms even during the period of winter, which is
                        a respite from all wars by land and sea. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                        Neither kings, nor those consuls, tyrannical as they were before the
                        institution of the tribunitian office, nor the stern authority of the
                        dictator, nor the overbearing decemvirs, ever imposed such slavery as that
                        they should perform unremitting military service, which degree of regal
                        power the military tribunes now exercised over the Roman commons. <milestone
                            n="9" unit="section"/> What would these men have done as consuls or
                        dictators, who have exhibited the picture of the proconsular office so
                        implacable and menacing? but that all this happened justly. Among eight
                        military tribunes there was no room even for one plebeian. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> Formerly the patricians filled up three places with the
                        utmost difficulty; now they went in file eight deep to take possession of
                        the various offices; and not even in such a crowd is any plebeian
                        intermixed; <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> who, if he did no other good,
                        might remind his colleagues, that it was freemen and fellow citizens, and
                        not slaves, that constituted the army, who ought to be brought back during
                        winter at least to their homes and roofs; <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                        and to come and see at some part of the year their parents, children, and
                        wives, and to exercise the rights of freedom, and to take part in electing
                        magistrates. </quote>
                    <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> While they exclaimed in these and such terms,
                    they found in Appius Claudius an opponent not unequal to them, who had been left
                    behind by his colleagues to check the turbulence of the tribunes; a man trained
                    even from his youth in contests with the plebeians; <milestone n="14"
                        unit="section"/> who several years before, as has been mentioned,
                    recommended the dissolution of the tribunitian power by means of the protests of
                    their colleagues. </p>
                <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> He, not only endowed with good natural powers,
                    but well trained also by experience, on that particular occasion, delivered the
                    following address: <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> "If, Romans, there was ever
                    reason to doubt, whether the tribunes of the people have ever promoted sedition
                    for your sake or their own, I am certain <pb n="325" xml:id="p.325"/> that in
                    the course of this year that doubt must have ceased to exist; <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> and while I rejoice that an end has at length come of a
                    mistake of such long continuance, I in the next place congratulate you, and on
                    your account the republic, that this delusion has been removed during a course
                    of prosperous events. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Is there any person who
                    can feel a doubt that the tribunes of the commons were never so highly
                    displeased and provoked by any wrongs done to you, if ever such did happen, as
                    by the munificence of the patricians to the commons, when pay was established
                    for those serving in the army. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> What else do
                    you suppose that they either then dreaded, or now wish to disturb, except the
                    union between the orders, which they think contributes most to the dissolution
                    of the tribunitian power? <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Thus, by Jove, like
                    workers in iniquity, they are seeking for work, who also wish that there should
                    be always some diseased part in the republic, that there may be something for
                    the cure of which they may be employed by you. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    For, [tribunes,] whether do you defend or attack the commons? whether are you
                    the enemies of those in the service, or do you plead their cause? <milestone
                        n="8" unit="section"/> Unless perhaps you say, whatever the patricians do,
                    displeases us; whether it is for the commons, or against the commons; and just
                    as masters forbid their slaves to have any dealing with those belonging to
                    others, and deem it right that they should equally refrain from having any
                    commerce with them, either for kindness or unkindness; ye, in like manner,
                    interdict us the patricians from all intercourse with the people, lest by our
                    courteousness and munificence we may challenge their regard, and they become
                    tractable and obedient to our direction. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> And
                    if there were in you any thing of the feeling, I say not of fellow-citizens, but
                    of human beings, how much more ought you to favour, and, as far as in you lay,
                    to promote rather the kindly demeanour of the patricians and the tractability of
                    the commons! <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> And if such concord were once
                    permanent, who would not venture to engage, that this empire would in a short
                    time become the highest among the neighbouring states? </p>
                <milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> "I shall hereafter explain to you how not only
                    expedient, but even necessary has been this plan of my colleagues, according to
                    which they would not draw off the army from Veii until the business has been
                    completed. For the present I am disposed to speak concerning the condition of

                    a second time. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> During their tribuneship,
                    whilst the solicitude of all was directed to the Veientian war, the garrison at
                    Anxur was neglected in consequence of the absence of the soldiers on leave, and
                    from the indiscriminate admission of Volscian traders was overpowered, the

                    Less of the soldiers perished, because they were all trafficking through the

                    matters conducted more successfully at Veii, which was then the chief object of
                    all public solicitude. For both the Roman commanders had more quarrels among
                    themselves, than spirit against the enemy; and the severity of the war was
                    exaggerated by the sudden arrival of the Capenatians and the Faliscians.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> These two states of Etruria, because they
                    were contiguous in situation, judging that in case Veii was conquered, they
                    should be next to the attacks of the Romans in war; <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> the Faliscians also, incensed from a cause affecting
                    themselves, because they had already on a former occasion mixed themselves up in
                    a Fidenatian war, being bound together by an oath by reciprocal embassies,
                    marched unexpectedly with their armies to Veii. It so happened, they attacked
                    the camp in that quarter where Manius Sergius, military tribune, commanded, and
                    occasioned great alarm; because the Romans imagined that all Etruria was aroused
                    and were advancing in a great mass. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The same
                    opinion aroused the Veientians in the city. Thus the Roman camp was attacked on
                    both sides; <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> and crowding together, whilst they
                    wheeled round their battalions from one post to another, they were unable either
                    to confine the Veientians within their fortifications, or repel the assault from
                    their own works, and to defend themselves from the enemy on the outside. The
                    only hope was, if succour could be brought from the greater camp, that the
                    different legions should fight, some against the Capenatians and Faliscians,
                    others against the sallies of the townsmen. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    But Virginius had the command of that camp, who, from personal grounds, was
                    hateful to and incensed <pb n="333" xml:id="p.333"/> against Sergius. <milestone

                    assistance, his colleague would send to him. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    His arrogance was equalled by the obstinacy of the other; who, that he might not
                    appear to have sought any aid from an adversary, preferred being defeated by an
                    enemy to conquering through a fellow-citizen. His men were for a long time cut
                    down between both: at length, abandoning their works, a very small number made
                    their way to the principal camp; the greater number, with Sergius himself, made
                    their way to Rome. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Where, when he threw the
                    entire blame on his colleague, it was resolved that Virginius should be sent for

                    senate, and the dispute was carried on between the colleagues with (mutual)

                    Then Caius Servilius Ahala, a military tribune, observed, <quote> With respect

                        in a proper manner, victory was granted them over the Veientians: before

                    Capenatian war, and that matters were not more tranquil within the walls, by
                    reason of the dissensions between the patricians and commons; considering that
                    amid these [troubles] there was an opportunity for an attack, they send their

                    run heedlessly to the walls. A fabulous narrative <milestone n="6"

                    suddenly discharged the armed troops in the temple of Juno which was in the

                        considered by Niebuhr as extremely ridiculous. He deems the circumstance

                    struck out of ordering the people to refund the spoil, so that the due
                    proportion might be set aside out of it for sacred purposes. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> At length they had recourse to this which seemed the
                    easiest course, that, whoever wished to acquit himself and his family of the
                    religious obligation, after he had made his own estimate of his portion of the
                    plunder, should pay into the treasury the value <milestone n="11??"
                        unit="section"/> of the tenth part, so that out of it a golden offering
                    worthy of the grandeur of the temple and the divinity of the god might be made,
                    suitable to the dignity of the Roman people. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    This contribution also tended to alienate the affections of the commons from
                    Camillus. During these transactions ambassadors came from <pb n="353"
                        xml:id="p.353"/> the Volscians and Aequans to sue for peace; and peace was
                    obtained, rather that the state wearied by so tedious a war might obtain repose,

                    time, Lucius Furius Medullinus a fifth time, Quintus Servilius a third time. To
                    the Cornelii the Faliscian war, to Valerius and Servilius the Capenatian war,
                    fell by lot. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> By them no cities were attempted
                    by storm or by siege, but the country was laid waste, and the plunder of the
                    effects on the lands was driven off; not a single fruit tree, not a vegetable
                    was left on the land. These losses reduced the people of Capena; peace was
                    granted to them on their suing for it. The war among the Faliscians still
                    continued. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> At Rome in the mean time sedition
                    became multiplied; and for the purpose of assuaging this they resolved that a
                    colony should be sent off to the Volscian country, for which three thousand
                    Roman citizens should be enrolled; and the triumvirs appointed for the purpose,
                    distributed three acres and seven-twelfths to each man. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> This donation began to be scorned, because they thought
                    that it was offered as a solace for the disappointment of higher hopes. For why
                    were the commons to be sent into exile to the Volscians, when the magnificent
                    city of Veii was still in view, and the Veientian territory, more fertile and
                    extensive than the Roman territory? <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The city
                    also they extolled as preferable to the city of Rome, both in situation, in the
                    grandeur of its enclosures, and buildings, both public and private. Nay, even
                    that scheme was proposed, which after the taking of Rome by the Gauls was still
                    more strongly urged, of removing to Veii. But they destined Veii to be inhabited
                    by half the commons and half the senate; and that two cities of one common
                    republic might be inhabited by the Roman people. <note anchored="true"

                    generosity the honour was conferred on the matrons, that they might use covered
                    chariots [when going] to public worship and the games, and open chaises on

                    they chiefly dreaded as an antagonist, acquired an increase of glory among the

                    confined themselves within the walls, considering it the safest plan, by laying
                    waste their lands and burning their houses, he compelled them to come forth from
                    the city; but their fears prevented them from proceeding to any considerable
                    length. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> At about a mile from the town they
                    pitch their camp; trusting that it was sufficiently secure from no other cause,
                    than the difficulty of the approaches, the roads around being rough and craggy,
                    in some parts narrow, in others steep. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> But
                    Camillus having followed the direction of a prisoner belonging to the country as

                    himself on ground considerably higher [than theirs]. The Romans worked at the
                    fortifications in three divisions: the rest of the army stood prepared for

                    enemy when they attempted to interrupt his works; and such terror was struck
                    into the Faliscians in consequence, that, in their precipitate flight passing by
                    their own camp which lay in their way, they made for the city. Many were slain
                    and wounded, before that in their panic they could make their way through the
                    gates. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Their camp was taken; the spoil was
                    given up to the quaestors, to the great dissatisfaction of the soldiers; but
                    overcome by the strictness of his authority, they both hated and admired the
                    same firmness of conduct. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Then a regular siege
                    of the city took place, and the lines of circumvallation were carried on, and
                    sometimes occasional attacks were made by the townsmen on the Roman posts, and
                    slight skirmishes took place: and the time was spent, no hope [of success]
                    inclining to either side, whilst corn and other provisions were possessed in

                    re-elect the opponents of the law; but the commons were more successful in the

                    because none of their college were likely to oppose them, and the consuls
                    resisted them with no less energy, the Aequans storm Vitellia, a Roman colony in

                    the honour of the senate was involved. For no one laid against them any other
                    impeachment, either of their mode of life or of their conduct in office, save

                        sentence on the tribune they abolished the right of protesting; that

                    preventing the Salpinians from hazarding an engagement; the troops secured

                    disregarded, on account of the humble station of the author, and also because

                    we have heard as follows. In the reign of Tarquinius Priscus at Rome, the
                    supreme government of the Celts, who compose the third part of Gaul, was in the
                    hands of the Biturigians: they gave a king to the Celtic nation. <milestone
                        n="2" unit="section"/> This was Ambigatus, one very much distinguished by
                    his merit, and both his great prosperity in his own concerns and in those of the
                    public; for under his administration Gaul was so fruitful and so well peopled,
                    that so very great a population appeared scarcely capable of being restrained by
                    any government. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He being now advanced in
                    years, and anxious to relieve his kingdom of so oppressive a crowd, declares his
                    intention to bend his sister's sons, Bellovesus and Sigovesus, two enterprising
                    youths, into whatever settlements the gods should grant them by augury:
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> that they should take out with them as
                    great a number of men as they pleased, so that no nation might be able to
                    obstruct them in their progress. Then to Sigovesus the Hercynian forest was
                    assigned by the oracle: to Bellovesus the gods marked out a much more cheering
                    route into Italy. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> He carried out with him from
                    the Biturigians, the Arvernians, the Senonians, the Aeduans, the Ambarrians, the
                    Carnutians, and the Aulercians, all that was superfluous in their population.
                    Having set out with an immense force of horse and foot, he arrived in the
                    country of the Tricastinians. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    <pb n="366" xml:id="p.366"/> Next the Alps were opposed [to their progress], and
                    I am not surprised that they should seem impassable, as they had never been
                    climbed over through any path as yet, as far at least as tradition can extend,

                    landing, covered with spacious woods. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> They

                    in which they had posted themselves was called Insubria, the same name as the
                    Insubres, a canton of the Aedui: embracing the omen of the place, they built a
                    city there, and called it Mediolanum. </p>

                    themselves near the ancient canton of the Ligurians called Laevi, inhabiting the

                    the barbarians seemed to them to demand what was just: but in the case of men of

                    indicated by a load shout that they were proceeding to Rome, taking up an

                    apprehended a stratagem; at length they began to collect the spoils of the

                    brought back word that the gates were not shut, that no guard was posted before
                    the gates, no armed troops on the walls, another cause of amazement similar to

                    night and ignorance of the situation of the city, they posted themselves between
                    Rome and the Anio, after sending scouts about the walls and the several gates to
                    ascertain what plans the enemy would adopt in their desperate circumstances.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> With respect to the Romans, as the greater
                    part had gone to Veii from the field of battle, and no one supposed that any

                    both those living and those dead, they caused the entire city to be filled with
                    wailings. The alarm for the public interest stifled private sorrow, as soon as
                    it was announced that the enemy were at hand. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    Presently the barbarians patrolling around the walls in troops, they heard their
                    yells and the dissonant clangour of their arms. All the interval up to the next
                    day kept their minds in such a state of suspense, that an assault seemed every
                    moment about to be made on the city: <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> on their
                    first approach, when they arrived at the city, [it was expected;] for if this
                    were not their design, that they would have remained at the Allia; then towards
                    sunset, because there was not much of the day remaining, they imagined that
                    there would attack them before night; then that the design was deferred until
                    night, in order to strike the greater terror. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    At length the approach of light struck them with dismay; and the calamity itself
                    followed closely upon their continued apprehension of it, when the troops
                    entered the gates in hostile array. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> During
                    that night, however, and the following day, the state by no means bore any
                    resemblance to that which which had fled in so dastardly a manner at the Allia.
                    For as there was not a hope that the city could be defended, so small a number
                        <pb n="372" xml:id="p.372"/> of troops now remaining, it was determined that
                    the youth fit for military service, and the abler part of the senate with their

                    e serve as a proof. They captured the city when lying open to them; a small

                    the slow process of a siege, they retire and spread themselves through the

                    Having gone forth to no great distance from the city, they found the camp of the
                    Gauls, as had been foretold, unprotected and neglected on every side, and attack
                    it with a shout. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> No fight any where, but
                    slaughter every where; their bodies, naked and relaxed with sleep, are cut to

                    by a strange and unheard-of enemy, that at that very time they made incursions
                    on the Roman territory; and laden with plunder, had it in contemplation to lay

                    the same order and with the same fortunate result. And further, under the
                    guidance of some prisoners, who had survived the nightly slaughter, they set out
                    to Salinae against another body of Tuscans, they suddenly made on the following

                    in his hands the sacred utensils, passed out through the midst of the enemy's
                    post, without being at all moved by the calls or threats of any of them, and

                    astounded at such an extraordinary manifestation of boldness, or moved even by
                    religious considerations, of which the nation is by no means regardless.

                    from Latium, to come in for share of the spoil. It now seemed high time that

                    regulate every proceeding, and so carefully did they observe the distinctions of
                    things in their almost desperate circumstances. They had to pass at great risk

                    found that the law was passed; because he could neither change his residence

                    with the boss of his shield and tumbles down a Gaul, who had already got footing
                    on the summit; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> and when the fall of this man

                    they clung. And now the others also having assembled beat down the enemy by
                    javelins and stones, and the entire band, having lost their footing, were hurled

                    consent of the soldiers, for they all carried to his house, which was in the
                    citadel, a contribution of half a pound of corn an half a pint of wine: a matter
                    trifling in the relation, but the [prevailing] scarcity had rendered it a strong
                    proof of esteem, when each man, depriving himself of his own food, contributed
                    in honour of one man a portion subtracted from his body and from his necessary
                    requirements. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Then the guards of that place
                    where the enemy had climbed up unobserved, we e summoned; <milestone n="10"

                    punish all according to the usage of military discipline, being deterred by the

                    the rest. The man, who was manifestly guilty of the crime, he threw down from

                    this time forth the guards on both sides became more vigilant on the part of the
                    Gauls, because a rumour spread that messengers passed between Veii and Rome, and

                    severely from the heat and suffocation, they were dying, the diseases spreading
                    as among cattle, now becoming weary of burying separately, they heaped up the

                    name of Gallic piles. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> A truce was now made
                    with the Romans, and conferences were held with the permission of the
                    commanders; in which when the Gauls frequently alluded to the famine, and
                    referred to the urgency of that as a further motive for their surrendering, for
                    the purpose of removing that opinion, bread is said to have been thrown in many

                    keeping guard and with watches, having surmounted all human sufferings, whilst
                    nature would not suffer famine alone to be overcome, looking forward from day to
                    day, to see whether any succour would come from the dictator, <milestone n="7??"
                        unit="section"/> at length not only food but hope also failing, and their
                    arms weighing down their debilitated bodies, whilst the guards were being
                    relieved, insisted that there should be either a surrender, or that they should
                    be bought off, on whatever terms were possible, the Gauls intimating in rather
                    plain terms, that they could be induced for no very great compensation to
                    relinquish the siege. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Then the senate was held
                    and instructions were given to the military tribunes to capitulate. Upon this
                    the matter was settled between Quintus Sulpicius, a military tribune, and
                    Brennus, the chieftain of the Gauls, and one thousand pounds' weight of gold was
                    agreed on as the ransom of a people, who were soon after to be the rulers of the

                    itself, insult was added. False weights were brought by the Gauls, and on the
                    tribune objecting, his sword was thrown in in addition to the weight by the
                    insolent Gaul, and an expression was heard intolerable to the Romans, <quote>Woe

                    the Romans from living on the condition of being ransomed; for by some chance,
                    before the execrable price was completed, all the gold being not yet weighed in
                    consequence of the altercation, the dictator comes up, and orders the gold to be
                    removed, and the Gauls to clear away. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> When
                    they, holding out against him, affirmed that they had concluded a bargain, he
                    denied that the agreement was a valid one, which had been entered into with a
                    magistrate of inferior authority without his orders, after he had been nominated
                    dictator; and he gives notice to the Gauls to get ready for battle. <milestone

                    children, and the soil of their country disfigured by the calamities of war, and
                    all those objects which they were solemnly bound <pb n="383" xml:id="p.383"/> to

                    draws up his army, as the nature of the place admitted, on the site of the
                    half-demolished city, and which was uneven by nature, and he secured all those
                    advantages for his own men, which could be prepared or selected by military
                    skill. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The Gauls, thrown into confusion by the
                    unexpected event, take up arms, and with rage, rather than good judgment, rushed
                    upon the Romans. Fortune had now changed; now the aid of the gods and human
                    prudence assisted the Roman cause. At the first encounter, therefore, the Gauls
                    were routed with no greater difficulty than they had found in gaining the
                    victory at Allia. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> They were afterwards beaten
                    under the conduct and auspices of the same Camillus, in a more regular
                    engagement, at the eighth stone on the Gabine road, whither they had betaken
                    themselves after their defeat. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> There the
                    slaughter was universal: their camp was taken, and not even one person was left
                    to carry news of the defeat. The dictator, after having recovered his country
                    from the enemy, returns into the city in triumph; and among the rough military

                    he unquestionably saved a second time in peace, when he hindered the people from

                    after the burning of the city, and the commons of themselves being more inclined
                    to that measure; <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> and that was the cause of his

                    performed. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> All these gods, both public and
                    private, do ye, Romans, pretend to forsake. What similarity does your conduct
                    bear [to that] which lately during the siege was beheld with no less admiration
                    by the enemy than by yourselves in that excellent Caius Fabius, when he
                    descended from the citadel amid the Gallic weapons, and performed on the
                    Quirinal hill the solemn rites of the Fabian family? <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> Is it your wish that the family religious rites should not
                    be intermitted even during war, but that the public rites and the Roman gods
                    should be deserted even in time of peace, and that the pontiffs and flamens
                    should be more negligent of public religious ceremonies, than a private
                    individual in the anniversary rite of a particular family? <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> Perhaps some one may say, that we will either perform these
                    duties at Veii, or that we will send our priests hither from thence in order to
                    perform them; neither of which can be done, without infringing on the
                    established forms. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> For not to enumerate all
                    the sacred rites severally and all the gods, whether in the banquet of Jupiter
                    can the lectisternium be performed in any other place, save in the Capitol?
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> What shall I say of the eternal fire of
                    Vesta, and of the statue, which, as the pledge of empire, is kept under the
                    safeguard of her temple? What, O Mars Gradivus, and you, father Quirinus, of
                    your Ancilia? Is it right that these sacred things, coeval with the city, some
                    of them more ancient than the origin of the city, should be abandoned to
                    profanation? <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> And, observe the difference
                    existing between us and our ancestors. They handed down to us certain sacred
                    rites to be performed by us on the Alban and on the Lavinian mounts. Was it in
                    conformity with religion that these sacred rites were transferred to us to Rome
                    from the cities of our enemies? shall we transfer them hence <pb n="387"
                        xml:id="p.387"/> to Veii, an enemy's city, without impiety? <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> Come, recollect how often sacred rites are performed anew,
                    because some ceremony of our country had been omitted through negligence or
                    accident. On a late occasion, what circumstance, after the prodigy of the Alban
                    lake, proved a remedy to the state distressed by the Veientian war, but the
                    repetition of the sacred rites and the renewal of the auspices? <milestone
                        n="10" unit="section"/> But further, as if duly mindful of ancient religious
                    usages, we have both transferred foreign deities to Rome, and have established
                    new ones. Very recently, imperial Juno was transferred from Veii, and had her
                    dedication performed on a day how distinguished for the extraordinary zeal of
                    the matrons, and with what a full attendance! <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    We have directed a temple to be erected to Aius Locutius, in consequence of the
                    heavenly voice heard in the New Street. To our other solemnities we have added
                    the Capitoline games, and, by direction of the senate, we have founded a new
                    college for that purpose. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Which of these
                    things need we have done, if we were to leave the Roman city together with the
                    Gauls? if it was not voluntarily we remained in the Capitol for so many months
                    of siege; if we were retained by the enemy through motives of fear? <milestone
                        n="13" unit="section"/> We are speaking of the sacred rites and of the
                    temples; what, pray, of the priests? Does it not occur to you, what a degree of
                    profaneness would be committed in respect of them. The Vestals, forsooth, have
                    but that one settlement, from which nothing ever disturbed them, except the
                    capture of the city. It is an act of impiety for the flamen Dialis to remain for
                    a single night without the city. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Do ye mean
                    to make them Veientian instead of Roman priests? And shall the virgins forsake
                    thee, O Vesta? And shall the flamen by living abroad draw on himself and on his
                    country such a weight of guilt every night? <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>
                    What of the other things, all of which we transact under auspices within the
                    Pomaerium, to what oblivion, to what neglect do we consign them? <milestone

                    military affairs; the assemblies of the Centuries, at which you elect consuls
                    and military tribunes, when can they be held under auspices, unless where they
                    are wont [to be held]? Shall we transfer them to Veii? <milestone n="17"

                    that it is the real motive, I think is evident to you, though I should say
                    nothing on the subject; for you remember that before the arrival of the Gauls,
                    when the buildings, both public and private, were still unhurt, and the city
                    still stood in safety, this same question was agitated, that we should remove to
                    Veii. Observe then, tribunes, what a difference there is between my way of
                    thinking and yours. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Ye think that though it
                    may not have been advisable to do it then, still that now it ought certainly to
                    be done; I, on the contrary, (and be not surprised until you shall have heard
                    the state of the case,) admitting it were advisable to remove when the entire
                    city was safe, would not vote for relinquishing these ruins now. <milestone

                    into a captured city, one that would be glorious to ourselves and our posterity;
                    whilst now this same removal would be wretched and disgraceful to us, and
                    glorious to the Gauls. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> For we shall appear not
                    to have left our country as conquerors, but to have lost it from having been
                    vanquished; the flight at Allia, the capture of the city, the blockading of the
                    Capitol, [will seem] to have imposed this necessity on us of forsaking our
                    household gods, of having recourse to exile and flight from that place which we
                    were unable to defend. And have the Gauls been able to demolish Rome, which the
                    Romans shall be deemed to have been unable to restore? <milestone n="6"

                    they feel disposed to dwell in this city, captured by them, and deserted by you,
                    would you suffer them? <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> What, if not the Gauls,
                    but your old enemies, the Aequans and Volscians, should form the design of

                    Veientians? Would ye prefer that this should be a desert in your possession, or
                    a city of the enemy? For my part I can see nothing more impious. Is it because
