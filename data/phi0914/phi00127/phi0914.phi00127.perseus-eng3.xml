                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Such was the position of affairs in Spain.
                        In Italy the consul Marcellus recovered Salapia, which was betrayed to him,
                        and gained forcible possession of two places belonging to the
                        Samnites-Marmoreae and Heles. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> 3000 of
                        Hannibal's troops who had been left to garrison these towns were destroyed.
                        The plunder, of which there was a considerable quantity, was given to the
                        soldiers; 60,000 bushels of wheat and 28,000 of barley were also found
                        there. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The satisfaction derived from this
                        success was, however, more than counterbalanced by a defeat which was
                        sustained a few days later not far from Herdonea. This city had revolted
                        from Rome after the disaster of Cannae, and Cn. Fulvius, the proconsul, was
                        encamped before it in the hope of recovering it. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> He had chosen a position for his camp which was not
                        sufficiently protected, and the camp itself was not in a proper state of
                        defence. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Naturally a careless general, he
                        was still less cautious now that he had reason to hope that the inhabitants
                        were weakening in their allegiance to the Carthaginians, since the news had
                        reached them of Hannibal's withdrawal into Bruttium after losing Salapia.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> This was all duly reported to Hannibal
                        by emissaries from Herdonea, and the intelligence made him anxious to save a
                        friendly city and at the same time hopeful of catching his enemy when off
                        his guard. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> In order to forestall any
                        rumours of his approach he proceeded to Herdonea by forced marches, and as
                        he approached the place he formed his men in battle order with the view of
                        intimidating the enemy. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The Roman
                        commander-his equal in courage, but far inferior to him in tactical skill
                        and in numbers-hastily formed his line and engaged. The action was begun
                        most vigorously by the fifth legion and the allies on the left wing.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Hannibal, however, had instructed his
                        cavalry to wait until the attention of the infantry was completely taken up
                        with the battle and then to ride round the lines; one division to attack the
                        Roman camp, the other the rear of the Roman line. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> He told his staff that he had defeated a Cn. Fulvius, a
                        praetor, on the same ground two years before, and as the names were the
                        same, so the result of the fight would be the same. <milestone n="11"
                            unit="section"/> His anticipations were realised, for after the lines
                        had closed and many of the Romans had fallen in the hand-to-hand fighting,
                        though the ranks still held their ground with the standards, the tumultuous
                        cavalry charge in the rear threw into disorder first the sixth legion
                        stationed in the second line, and then, as <milestone n="12??"
                            unit="section"/> the Numidians pressed on, the fifth legion and finally
                        the front ranks with their standards. Some were scattered in flight, others
                        were cut down between the two bodies of assailants. <milestone n="13"
                            unit="section"/> It was here that Cn. Fulvius fell together with eleven
                        military tribunes. As to the number of those killed, who could definitely
                        state it, when I find in one author the number given as 13,000, in another
                        not more than 7000? The victor took possession of the camp and its spoil.
                            <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> As he learnt that Herdonea was
                        prepared to go over to the Romans and would not remain faithful after his
                        withdrawal, he transported the whole population to Metapontum and Thurii and
                        burnt the place. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> Its leading citizens who
                        were discovered to have held secret conferences with Fulvius were put to
                        death. Those Romans who escaped from the fatal field fled by various routes,
                        almost wholly weaponless, to Marcellus in Samnium. </p>
                </div>
                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="2" type="chapter">
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Marcellus was not particularly disturbed
                        by this serious disaster. He sent a despatch to the senate informing them of
                        the loss of the general and his army at Herdonea and <milestone n="2??"
                            unit="section"/> adding that he himself was the same Marcellus who had
                        beaten Hannibal when flushed with his victory at Cannae, that he intended to
                        meet him and would soon put an end to any pleasure he might feel at his
                        recent success. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> In Rome itself there was
                        great mourning for what had happened and great apprehension as to what might
                        happen in the future. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The consul marched
                        out of Samnium and advanced as far as Numistro in Lucania. Here he encamped
                        on level ground in full view of Hannibal, who was occupying a hill.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> To show the confidence he felt, he was
                        the first to offer battle, and when Hannibal saw the standards emerging from
                        the gates of the camp, he did not decline the challenge. They formed their
                        lines so that the Carthaginian rested his right on the hill, while the Roman
                        left was protected by the town. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The troops
                        who were first engaged were, on the Roman side, the first legion and the
                        right wing of the allies; those under Hannibal comprised the Spanish
                        infantry and the Balearic slingers. When the action had commenced the
                        elephants were driven on to the field. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The
                        contest was prolonged from the third hour of the day until nightfall, and
                        when the front lines were worn out, the third legion relieved the first and
                        the left wing of the allies took the place of the right. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> Fresh troops also came into action on the other side,
                        with the result that instead of a spiritless and exhausted struggle a fierce
                        fight broke out anew between men who were fresh in mind and body. <milestone
                            n="9" unit="section"/> Night, however, separated the combatants whilst
                        the victory was yet undecided." The following day the Romans remained under
                        arms from sunrise till well on in the day, ready to renew the contest.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> But as no enemy showed himself, they
                        began to gather the spoils of the field, and after collecting the bodies of
                        the slain into one heap, they burnt them. Hannibal broke up his camp quietly
                        at night and withdrew into Apulia. When daylight revealed the enemies'
                        flight, Marcellus made up his mind to follow in his track. He left the
                        wounded with a small guard at Numistro under the charge of L. Furius
                        Purpurio, one of his military tribunes, and came up with Hannibal at
                        Venusia. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Here for some days there were
                        skirmishes between the outposts and slight actions in which both cavalry and
                        infantry took part, but no regular battle. <milestone n="12" unit="section"
                        /> In nearly every case the Romans had the advantage. Both armies traversed
                        Apulia without fighting any important action, Hannibal marching by night
                        always on the look-out for a chance of surprise or ambush, Marcellus never
                        moving but in daylight, and then only after careful reconnoitring. </p>

                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="3" type="chapter">
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> At Capua, in the meantime, Flaccus was
                        occupied with the sale of the property of the principal citizens and the
                        farming of the revenues from that part of the territory which had become
                        Roman domain-land; the impost being paid in corn. <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> As though there was never to be wanting some reason or
                        other for treating the Capuans with severity, disclosures were made of a
                        fresh crime which had been hatched in secret. Fulvius had moved his men out
                        of the houses in Capua, partly through fear lest his army should demoralised
                        by the attractions of the city, as Hannibal's had been, and partly that
                        there might be houses to go with the land which was being let. <milestone
                            n="3" unit="section"/> The troops were ordered to construct military
                        huts just outside the walls and gates. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                        Most of these they made of wattle or planking; some used plaited osiers and
                        covered them with straw, as though deliberately designing them to feed a
                        conflagration. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> One hundred and seventy
                        Capuans with the brothers Blossius at their head formed a plot to set fire
                        to all these huts simultaneously in the night. Some slaves belonging to the
                        Blossian household betrayed the secret. On receiving the information the
                        proconsul at once ordered the gates to be shut and the troops to arm. All
                        those involved in the crime were arrested, examined under torture, found

                        partly destroyed by fire and Nuceria completely demolished, Fulvius sent

                        occupying the public attention, the citadel of Tarentum was not lost sight
                        of. M. Ogulnius and P. Aquilius were appointed commissioners for the
                        purchase of corn in Etruria, and a force of 1000 men drawn from the home
                        army, with an equal number from the allied contingents, conveyed it to

                        the date of the consular elections was near at hand. Marcellus wrote to say
                        that it would be against the interests of the republic to lose touch with
                        Hannibal, as he was being pressed steadily back, and avoided anything like a
                        battle. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The senate were reluctant to
                        recall him just when he was most effectively employed; at the same time they
                        were anxious lest there should be no consuls for the coming year. <milestone
                            n="3" unit="section"/> They decided that the best course would be to
                        recall the consul Valerius from Sicily, though he was outside the borders of
                        Italy. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The senate instructed L. Manlius
                        the City praetor to write to him to that effect, and at the same time to
                        send on the despatch from M. Marcellus that he might understand the reason
                        for the senate recalling him rather than his colleague from his province.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> It was about this time that envoys
                        from King Syphax came to Rome. They enumerated the successful battles which
                        the king had fought against the Carthaginians, and declared that there was
                        no people to whom he was a more uncompromising foe than the people of
                        Carthage, and none towards whom he felt more friendly than the people of
                        Rome. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> He had already sent envoys to the
                        two Scipios in Spain, now he wished to ask for the friendship of Rome from

                        gave the envoys a gracious reply, but they in their turn sent envoys and

                        and a golden bowl weighing five pounds. After their visit to Syphax they
                        were commissioned to visit other petty kings in Africa and <milestone

                        Alexandria, to Ptolemy and Cleopatra, to remind them of the alliance already
                        existing, and to renew the friendly relations with Rome. The presents they
                        carried to the king were a purple toga and a purple tunic and an ivory
                        chair; to the queen they gave an embroidered palla and a purple cloak.

                        province to the praetor Cincius, and gave instructions to M. Valerius
                        Messala, the commander of the fleet, to sail with a part of his force to

                        had suffered many serious defeats there. Now he had completely reduced the
                        province, there was not a Carthaginian in the island, nor was there a single
                        Sicilian amongst those who had been driven away who had not now returned.

                        introduced, and the promises which the consul had made were redeemed by the

                        A resolution was carried in the Assembly, with the sanction of the senate,

                        plunder of every kind including a large number of prisoners. With these

                        5000 Numidians were at Carthage with Gala's son, Masinissa, a young man of

                        to the senate, and they were so impressed by its importance that they
                        thought the consul ought not to wait for the elections, but return at once
                        to his province after naming a Dictator to preside over the elections.
                        Matters were delayed somewhat by the debate which followed. <milestone
                            n="15" unit="section"/> The consul said that when he reached Sicily he
                        would nominate M. Valerius Messalla, who was at that time commanding the
                        fleet, as Dictator; the senators on the other hand asserted that no one who
                        was outside Roman soil, i.e., who was beyond the frontiers of Italy, could
                        be nominated Dictator: <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> M. Lucretius, one
                        of the tribunes of the plebs, took the sense of the House upon the question,
                        and the senate made a decree, requiring the consul, previously to his
                        departure from the City, to put the question to the people, whom they wished
                        to have nominated Dictator, and then to nominate the man whom the people had
                        chosen. If the consul declined to do this, then the praetor was to put the
                        question, and if he refused, then the tribunes were to bring the matter
                        before the people. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> As the consul refused
                        to submit to the people what was within his own rights, and had inhibited
                        the praetor from doing so either, it fell to the tribunes to put the
                        question, and the plebs resolved that Q. Fulvius, who was then at Capua,
                        should be nominated. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> But the day before
                        the Assembly met, the consul left secretly in the night for Sicily, and the
                        senate, thus left in the lurch, ordered a despatch to be sent to Marcellus,
                        urging him to come to the aid of the Commonwealth which his colleague had
                        deserted, and nominate the man whom the people had resolved to have as
                        Dictator. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> Q. Fulvius was accordingly
                        nominated Dictator by the consul M. Claudius, and under the same resolution
                        of the plebs P. Licinius Crassus, the Pontifex Maximus, was named by Q.
                        Fulvius as his Master of the Horse. </p>

                        army in Etruria, to relieve C. Calpurnius, to whom he had sent written

                        elections, but they could not be closed owing to a difference between the
                        tribunes and the Dictator. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The junior
                        century of the Galerian tribe had obtained the first place in the order of
                        voting, and they had declared for Q. Fulvius and Q. Fabius. The other
                        centuries, summoned in their order, would have gone the same way, had not
                        two of the tribunes of the plebs-Caius Arrenius and his brother
                        Lucius-intervened. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> They said that it was
                        infringing the rights of his fellow-citizens for a magistrate to extend his
                        period of office, and it was <milestone n="5??" unit="section"/> a still
                        greater offence for the man who was conducting the elections to allow
                        himself to be elected. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> If, therefore, the
                        Dictator accepted votes for himself, they should place their veto on the
                        proceedings, but if the names of any others than himself were put up, they
                        would not stop the election. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The Dictator
                        defended the procedure by alleging the authority of the senate and a
                        resolution of the Assembly as precedents. "When Cneius Servilius," he said,
                        "was consul and the other consul had fallen in battle at Lake Thrasymenus,
                        this question was referred by authority of the senate to the plebs, and they
                        passed a resolution that as long as there was war in Italy the people had
                        the right to reappoint as consuls, any who had been consuls, as often as

                        my action in this instance in the case of L. Postumius Megellus, who was

                        which he was presiding as interrex, and a recent one in the case of
                            <milestone n="9??" unit="section"/> Q. Fabius Maximus, who would
                        certainly never have allowed himself to be re-elected if it had not been in

                        In view of the critical position of the State, the senate saw that the

                        elections were held. Q. Fabius Maximus was returned as consul for the fifth

                        returned to Africa with every description of plunder. Several Roman priests
                        died this year and others were appointed in their place. <milestone n="16"
                            unit="section"/> C. Servilius was made pontiff in place of T. Otacilius
                        Crassus. Tiberius Sempronius Longus, son of Tiberius, was appointed augur in

                        was similarly appointed one of the Keepers of the Sacred Books in place of

                        The deaths took place also of M. Marcius, the Rex Sacrorum, and M. Aemilius
                        Papus, the Curio Maximus; these vacancies were not filled up during the
                        year. The censors appointed this year were L. Veturius Philo and P. Licinius
                        Crassus, the Pontifex Maximus. Licinius Crassus had not been either consul
                        or praetor before he was made censor, he went straight from the aedileship
                        to the censorship. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> These censors,
                        however, did not revise the roll of senators, nor did they transact any
                        public business whatever; the death of L. Veturius put an end to their
                        censorship, for Licinius at once resigned office. <milestone n="19"

                        celebrated the Roman Games for one day. The plebeian aediles, Q. Catius and
                        L. Porcius Licinius, devoted the money derived from fines to the casting of
                        bronze statues for the temple of Ceres; they also celebrated the Plebeian
                        Games with great splendour, considering the resources available at the time.

                        spectators. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The next day he appeared
                        before the senate and reported that Carthage, the capital city of Spain, had
                        been captured in a single day, whilst several revolted cities had been
                        recovered and new ones received into alliance. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> The information gained from the prisoners tallied with
                        that conveyed in the despatches of M. Valerius Messalla. What produced the
                        greatest impression on the senate was the threatened march of Hasdrubal into
                        Italy, which could hardly hold its ground against Hannibal and his arms.

                        Assembly he repeated the statements already made in the senate. A day of
                        solemn thanksgiving for P. Scipio's victories was decreed, and C. Laelius
                        was ordered to return as soon as possible to Spain with the ships he had

                        on the same day the senate assigned them their province. They were both to
                        command in Italy; Tarentum was to be the objective for Fabius; Fulvius was

                        Venturius Philo the alien jurisdiction together with Gaul; Capua fell to T.
                        Quinctius Crispinus, and Sardinia to C. Aurunculeius. The following was the
                        distribution of the armies. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The two
                        legions which M. Valerius Laevinus had in Sicily were assigned to Fulvius,
                        those which C. Calpurnius had commanded in Etruria were transferred to Q.

                        retain the army which Quintus Fulvius had had; C. Hostilius was to take over

                        Fulvius' legions. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> These were hunted up
                        and sent by the consuls into Sicily, where they were subjected to the same
                        humiliating conditions as the defeated of Cannae and those belonging to Cn.
                        Fulvius' army who had already been sent to Sicily as a punishment by the

                        Vulso had held Sardinia were placed under C. Aurunculeius and remained in
                        the island. P. Sulpicius retained his command for another year with
                        instructions to employ the same legion and fleet against Macedonia which he
                        had previously had. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> Orders were issued
                        for thirty quinqueremes to be despatched from Sicily to the consul at
                        Tarentum, the rest of the fleet was <milestone n="16??" unit="section"/> to

                        Laevinus, or if he did not go himself he was to send either L . Cincius or

                        Such were the distribution of the provinces and the military commands for

                            unit="section"/> There was one candidate, a plebeian, C. Mamilius
                        Atellus, and the patricians contended that no votes ought to be counted for
                        him, as none but a patrician had ever yet held that dignity. <milestone
                            n="3" unit="section"/> The tribunes, on being appealed to, referred the
                        matter to the senate, the senate left it to the decision of the people. C.
                        Mamilius Atellus was accordingly the first plebeian to be elected Curio
                        Maximus. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> P. Licinius, the Pontifex
                        Maximus, compelled C. Valerius Flaccus to be consecrated, against his will,
                        a Flamen of Jupiter. C. Laetorius was appointed one of the Keepers of the
                        Sacred Books in place of Q. Mucius Scaevola, deceased. <milestone n="5"

                        given place to a good and honourable character, I should have preferred to
                        keep silence as to the cause of his forcible consecration. It was in
                        consequence of his careless and dissolute life as a young man, which had
                        estranged his own brother Lucius and his other relations, that the Pontifex
                        Maximus made him a Flamen. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> When his
                        thoughts became wholly occupied with the performance of his sacred duties he
                        threw off his former character so completely that amongst all the young men
                        in Rome, none held a higher place in the esteem and approbation of the
                        leading patricians, whether personal friends or strangers to him. <milestone
                            n="7" unit="section"/> Encouraged by this general feeling he gained
                        sufficient self-confidence to revive a custom which, owing to the low
                        character of former Flamens, had long fallen into disuse; he took his seat
                        in the senate. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> As soon as he appeared L.
                        Licinius the praetor had him removed. He claimed it as the ancient privilege
                        of the priesthood and pleaded that it was conferred together with the toga
                        praetexta and curule chair as belonging to the Flamen's office. <milestone
                            n="9" unit="section"/> The praetor refused to rest the question upon
                        obsolete precedents drawn from the annalists and appealed to recent usage.
                        No Flamen of Jupiter, he argued, had exercised that right within the memory
                        of their fathers or their grandfathers. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                        The tribunes, when appealed to, gave it as their opinion that as it was
                        through the supineness and negligence of individual Flamens that the
                        practice had fallen into abeyance, the priesthood ought not to be deprived
                        of its rights. They led the Flamen into the senate amid the warm approval of
                        the House and without any opposition even from the praetor, though every one
                        felt that Flaccus had gained his seat more through the purity and integrity
                        of his life than through any right inherent in his office. </p>

                        made over by the consul Fulvius to his brother Caius for service in Etruria,

                            <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> The withdrawal of these legions from
                        the island did not weaken the occupying force in either numbers or
                        efficiency, for besides the two old legions which had now been brought up to

                        large body of Numidian deserters, mounted and unmounted, and he also
                        enlisted those Sicilians who had served with Epicydes and the Carthaginians,
                        and were seasoned soldiers. By strengthening each of the Roman legions with
                        these foreign auxiliaries he gave them the appearance of two complete
                        armies. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> One of these he placed under L.
                        Cincius, for the protection of that part of the island which had constituted
                        the kingdom of Hiero; the other he retained under his own command for the

                        not simply a refusal of military obligations, but an open revolt against

                        your people. You are not Capuans or Tarentines, but Romans, from Rome you
                        sprang, from Rome you have been planted in colonies on land taken from the

                        memories of your mother country. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> So you
                        must begin your deliberations afresh, for what you are now so recklessly
                        contemplating means the betrayal of the sovereignty of Rome and the

                        advanced at considerable length, but they produced no impression. The envoys
                        said that there was no reply for them to take home, nor was there any other
                        policy for their senate to consider since there was not a man left for
                        conscription nor any money for his pay. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                        As the consuls saw that their determination was unshaken they brought the
                        matter before the senate. Here such general consternation and alarm were
                        felt that most of the senators declared that the empire was doomed, other
                        colonies would take the same course, as would also the allies; all had
                        agreed together to betray the City of Rome to Hannibal. </p>

                        the senate. They declared that the other colonies were as loyal and dutiful
                        as ever, and even those colonies which had forgotten their duty would learn
                        to respect the empire if representatives of the government were sent amongst
                        them, with words of admonishment and rebuke, not of supplication or
                        entreaty. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The senate left it to the
                        consuls to take such action as they deemed best in the interests of the
                        State. After sounding the temper of the other colonies, they summoned their
                        delegates to Rome and questioned them as to whether they had soldiers in

                        were ready for service; if more were needed they would furnish more, and do
                        their utmost to carry out the wishes and commands of the Roman people.

                        dismissing them nor addressing them, but leaving them severely alone. This
                        silent rebuke seemed most in accordance with the dignity of the Roman
                        people. The other preparations for war now occupied the attention of the
                        consuls. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> It was decided that the

                        A similar amount was given to the praetor L. Veturius, who had drawn in the

                        the city wall and temple of Fortune at Capua and the wall and one of the

                        that the water at Alba had run blood and that in the sanctuary of the temple

                        a day was appointed for special intercessions at all the shrines. <milestone

                        with the practice of recent years. During this interval the consul Q.
                        Fulvius convened the Assembly for the election of censors. <milestone n="7"

                        measure was adopted by the plebs, with the sanction of the senate,
                        authorising these censors to let the territory of Capua to individual
                        occupiers. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The revision of the senatorial
                        roll was delayed through a difference between them as to who ought to be

                        selection had fallen to Sempronius; Cornelius, however, insisted that they
                        ought to follow the traditional usage in accordance with which the man who
                        had been the first of <milestone n="10??" unit="section"/> all his surviving
                        contemporaries to be appointed censor was always chosen as leader of the

                            unit="section"/> Sempronius replied that the gods who had given him by

                        Maximus, the man whom he claimed as foremost of all the Romans, a claim he
                        would make good before Hannibal himself. After a lengthy argument his
                        colleague gave way and Sempronius selected Q. Fabius Maximus as leader of

                        after Cannae. For the same reason some were struck out of the equestrian
                        order, but there were very few on whom the taint of that disgrace rested.

                        heavier by an extension of their compulsory service. The years they had
                        served with the horses furnished by the State were not to count, they were
                        to serve their ten years from that date with their own horses. <milestone

                        to the aerarii. The censors next signed contracts for the rebuilding of the

                            unit="section"/> This was a force of 8000 men, the majority drawn, as

                        rapine; their numbers had been swelled by deserters from Bruttium, who were
                        quite their equals in recklessness and love of desperate adventures.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Fabius ordered the commandant to take
                        this force into Bruttium and lay waste the country and then attack the city
                        of Caulonia. They carried out their orders with alacrity and zest, and after
                        plundering and scattering the peasants, they made a furious attack on the
                        citadel. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The consul's letter and his own
                        belief that no Roman general was so good a match for Hannibal as himself
                        stirred Marcellus into action. As soon as there was plenty of forage in the
                        fields he broke up his winter quarters and confronted Hannibal at Canusium.
                        The Carthaginian was trying to induce the Canusians to revolt, but as soon
                        as he heard of the approach of Marcellus, he moved away. <milestone n="8"

                        close to Hannibal's, and the moment he had completed his entrenchments he
                        led his legions out to battle. Hannibal saw no necessity for risking a
                        general engagement, and sent out detached troops of cavalry and bodies of
                        slingers to skirmish. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> He was, however,
                        drawn into the battle which he had tried to avoid, for after he had been
                        marching all night, Marcellus caught him up in level and open country, and
                        prevented him from fortifying his camp by attacking the entrenching parties
                        on all sides. A pitched battled ensued in which the whole strength of both
                        armies was engaged, and at the approach of nightfall they separated on equal
                        terms. Both the camps, separated by only a small interval, were hastily
                        fortified before dark. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> As soon as it

                        and Hannibal accepted the challenge. He said much to encourage his men,
                        bidding them remember Thrasymenus and Cannae, and tame the insolence of

                        brought the 10th legion up to the front. They were slow in coming up, and as
                        the others were becoming unsteady and falling back, the whole line was
                        gradually thrown into disorder and ultimately routed. <milestone n="16"
                            unit="section"/> Their fears got the better of them and they took to
                        flight. 2700 Romans and allies fell in the battle and during the pursuit;
                        amongst them were four centurions and two military tribunes, M. Licinius and
                        M. Helvius. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> Four standards were lost out
                        of the wing which began the fight, and two from the legion which came up in
                        support. </p>

                        Marcellus addressed such an impassioned and stinging remonstrance to his men

                        supplication; the men begged him to pardon them for that day's work, and to
                        make use of his soldiers' courage whenever and wherever he would. "Very
                        well, soldiers," he said, "I will make proof of it and lead you to battle

                        then dismissed and all acknowledged that they had been justly and deservedly
                        censured, and that in the whole army there was not one who had that day
                        shown himself a man except their commander. They felt bound to make
                        satisfaction to him either by their deaths or by a brilliant victory.

                        equipped and armed according to orders. The general expressed his approval
                        and announced that those who had been the first to flee and the cohorts
                        which had lost their standards would be placed in the forefront of the

                        of that day's victory. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> They were then
                        ordered to strengthen themselves with food, so that if the fight was

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> When this was reported to Hannibal, he
                        remarked, "Evidently we have to do with an enemy who cannot endure either
                        good fortune or bad. If he is victorious he follows up the vanquished in
                        fierce pursuit; if he is defeated he renews the struggle with his
                        conquerors." <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Then he ordered the advance
                        to be sounded, and led his men on to the field. The fighting was much hotter
                        than on the previous day; the Carthaginians did their utmost to maintain the
                        prestige they had gained, the Romans were equally determined to wipe out the
                        disgrace of their defeat. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The contingents
                        who had formed the Roman left and the cohorts who had lost their standards
                        were fighting in the front line, and the twentieth legion was stationed on
                        their right. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> L. Cornelius Lentulus and C:
                        Claudius Nero commanded the wings; Marcellus remained in the centre to
                        encourage his men and mark how they bore themselves in battle. <milestone
                            n="5" unit="section"/> Hannibal's front line consisted of his Spanish
                        troops, the flower of his army. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> After a
                        long and undecided struggle he ordered the elephants to be brought up into
                        the fighting line, in the hope that they would create confusion and panic
                        among the enemy. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> At first they threw the
                        front ranks into disorder, trampling some underfoot and scattering those
                        round in wild alarm. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> One flank was thus
                        exposed, and the rout would have spread much farther had not C. Decimius
                        Flavus, one of the military tribunes, snatched the standard of the foremost
                        maniple of hastati and called on them to follow him. He took them to where
                        the animals trotting close to one another were creating the greatest tumult,
                        and told his men to hurl their javelins at them. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> Owing to the short distance and the huge mark presented
                        by the beasts, crowded as they were together, every missile went home. They
                        were not all hit, but those in whose flanks the javelins were sticking
                        turned the uninjured ones to flight, for these animals cannot be depended
                        upon. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Not only the men who first attacked
                        them, but every soldier within reach hurled his javelin at them as they
                        galloped back into the Carthaginian ranks, where they caused much more
                        destruction than they had caused amongst the enemy. They dashed about much
                        more recklessly and did far greater damage when driven by their fears, than
                        when directed by their drivers. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Where the
                        line was broken by their charge, the Roman standards at once advanced, and
                        the broken and demoralised enemy was put to rout without much fighting.
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Marcellus sent his cavalry after the
                        fugitives, and the pursuit did not slacken till they had been driven in wild
                        panic to their camp. To add to their confusion and terror two of the
                        elephants had fallen and blocked up the camp gate, and the men had to
                        scramble into their camp over fosse and rampart. <milestone n="13"
                            unit="section"/> It was here that they suffered the heaviest loss; 8000
                        men were killed and five elephants. The victory was anything but a bloodless
                        one for the Romans; out of the two legions some 1700 men were killed and
                        1300 of the allied contingents, besides a very large number of wounded in
                        both divisions. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> The following night
                        Hannibal shifted his camp. Marcellus, though anxious to follow him, was
                        unable to do so owing to the enormous number of wounded. <milestone n="15"
                            unit="section"/> Reconnoitring parties who were sent out to watch his

                        reproached them for the mistake they had made in the past. This led the
                        Bruttians to hope that similar indulgence might be shown to them, and they
                        sent the two men who were of highest rank amongst them. <milestone n="3"

                        the sea open for supplies he loaded with the engines and apparatus necessary
                        for battering the walls; others he made use of for carrying artillery and
                        stores and projectiles of every kind. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Only
                        the transports which were propelled by oars were there made use of, so that
                        whilst some of the troops could bring up their engines and scaling ladders
                            <milestone n="6??" unit="section"/> close to the walls, others could
                        beat off the defenders from the walls by attacking them at a distance from
                        the ships. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> These vessels were so fitted up
                        that they could attack the city from the open sea without any interference
                        from the enemy, as the Carthaginian fleet had sailed across to Corcyra to
                        assist Philip in his campaign against the Aetolians. The force besieging
                        Caulo, hearing of Hannibal's approach and fearing a surprise, withdrew to a
                        position on the hills which was safe from any immediate attack. </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> While Fabius was besieging Tarentum an
                        incident, of slight importance in itself, helped him to achieve a great
                        success. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The Tarentines had been furnished
                        by Hannibal with a garrison of Bruttian troops. One of their officers was
                        deeply in love with a young woman who had a brother in Fabius' army. She had
                        written to tell him of the intimacy that had sprung up between her and a
                        stranger who was rich and held a high position amongst his countrymen.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The brother was led to hope that
                        through his sister's means her lover might be led on to any lengths, and he
                        communicated his anticipations to the consul. The idea did not seem at all
                        an unreasonable one, and he received instructions to cross the lines and
                        enter Tarentum as a deserter. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> After being
                        introduced to the officer by his sister and getting on friendly terms with
                        him, he cautiously sounded his disposition without betraying his real
                        object. When he had satisfied himself as to the weakness of his character he
                        called in his sister's aid, and through her coaxing and blandishments the
                        man was persuaded to betray the position which he was in charge of.
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> When the time and method of carrying
                        out the project were arranged, a soldier was despatched from the city at
                        night to make his way through the outposts and report to the consul what had
                        been done and what arrangements had been made. </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> At the first watch Fabius gave the signal
                        for action to the troops in the citadel and those who were guarding the
                        harbour, and then marched right round the harbour and took up his position
                        without being observed on the east side of the town. <milestone n="14"
                            unit="section"/> Then he ordered the trumpets to sound at the same
                        moment from the citadel, the harbour and the ships which had been brought up
                        from the open sea. The greatest shouting and uproar was designedly raised in
                        just those parts where there was least danger of an attack. <milestone
                            n="15" unit="section"/> The consul meanwhile kept his men perfectly
                        quiet. Democrates, who had formerly commanded the fleet, happened to be in
                        charge of that part of the defences. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>
                        Finding all quiet round him whilst elsewhere there was shouting and tumult
                        as though the city had been taken, he feared to remain where he was in case
                        the consul should storm the place and break in somewhere else. So he led his
                        men up to the citadel from which the most alarming noise proceeded.
                            <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> From the time that had elapsed and
                        the silence which followed the excited shouts and calls to arms, Fabius
                        judged that the garrison had withdrawn from that part of the fortifications.
                        He at once ordered the scaling ladders to be carried to that part of the
                        walls where he understood from the traitor that the Bruttii were mounting
                        guard. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> With their aid and connivance that
                        section of the fortifications was carried, and the Romans made their way
                        into the town after breaking down the nearest gate to allow the main body of

                        without meeting a single armed enemy. All the defenders who had been engaged
                        at the citadel and the harbour now combined to attack them. </p>

                        an impetuosity which was not sustained. The Tarentine was no match for the
                        Roman either in courage or weapons or military training or bodily strength
                        and vigour. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> They hurled their javelins,
                        and that was all; almost before they came to close quarters they turned and
                        fled through the streets, seeking shelter in their own homes and in their
                        friends' houses. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Two of their leaders,
                        Nico and Democrates, fell fighting bravely; Philemenus, who had been the
                        prime agent in delivering the city up to Hannibal, rode at full speed out of
                        the battle, but though his riderless horse was recognised soon afterwards
                        whilst straying about the city, his body was nowhere found. It was commonly
                        believed that he had been pitched headlong from his horse down an

                        the same fate. Many even of the Bruttians were killed in different parts of
                        the town, either by mistake or to satisfy an old-standing hate, or to
                        suppress any rumour of its capture through treachery, by making it appear as
                        though it had been taken by storm. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> After
                        the carnage followed the sack of the city. It is said that 30,000 slaves
                        were captured together with an enormous quantity of silver plate and
                        bullion, 83 pounds' weight of gold and a collection of statues and pictures
                        almost equal to that which had adorned Syracuse. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> Fabius, however, showed a nobler spirit than Marcellus
                        had exhibited in Sicily; he kept his hands off that kind of spoil. When his
                        secretary asked him what he wished to have done with some colossal
                        statues-they were deities, each represented in his appropriate dress and in
                        a fighting attitude-he ordered them to be left to the Tarentines who had

                    <p> Hannibal had in the meanwhile received the surrender of the force which was
                        investing Caulo. As soon as he heard that Tarentum was being attacked he
                        hurried to its relief, marching night and day. On receiving the news of its
                        capture, he remarked, "The Romans too have their Hannibal, we have lost
                        Tarentum by the same practices by which we gained it." <milestone n="10"

                        fell back on Metapontum. From this place he sent two of the townsmen with a
                        letter to Fabius at Tarentum. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> It was
                        written by the civic authorities, and stated that they were prepared to
                        surrender Metapontum and its Carthaginian garrison if the consul would
                        pledge his word that they should not suffer for their conduct in the past.
                            <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Fabius believed the letter to be
                        genuine and handed the bearers a reply addressed to their chiefs, fixing the
                        date of his arrival at Metapontum. This was taken to Hannibal. <milestone

                        not proof against his stratagems, he disposed his force in ambuscade not far
                        from Metapontum. Before leaving Tarentum Fabius consulted the sacred
                        chickens, and on two occasions they gave an unfavourable omen. <milestone
                            n="15" unit="section"/> He also consulted the gods of sacrifice, and
                        after they had inspected the victim the augurs warned him to be on his guard
                        against plots and ambuscades on the part of the enemy. <milestone n="16"

                        promptly arrested. Terrified at the prospect of examination under torture,

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> P. Scipio had spent the whole winter in
                        winning over the various Spanish tribes, either by bribes or by restoring
                        those of their countrymen who had been taken as hostages or prisoners. At
                        the commencement of summer Edesco, a famous Spanish chieftain, came to visit
                        him. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> His wife and children were in the
                        hands of the Romans, but that was not the only reason why he came. He was
                        influenced by the change which Fortune apparently was bringing about over
                        the whole of Spain in favour of Rome as against Carthage. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> The same motive actuated Indibilis and Mandonius, who
                        were beyond question the most powerful chiefs in Spain. They abandoned
                        Hasdrubal, with the whole of their contingent, and withdrew to the hills
                        above his camp and keeping along the ridge of mountains made their way
                        safely to the Roman headquarters. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> When
                        Hasdrubal saw that the enemy were receiving such accessions of strength
                        whilst his own forces were shrinking in equal proportion, he realised that
                        unless he made some bold move, the wastage would continue, so he made up his
                        mind to seize the first opportunity of fighting. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> Scipio was still more anxious for a battle; his
                        confidence had grown with success, and he was unwilling to wait till the
                        hostile armies had formed a junction, preferring to engage each separately
                        rather than all united. In case, however, he might have to fight with their
                        combined armies, he had augmented his strength by a somewhat ingenious
                        method. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> As the whole of the Spanish coast
                        was now clear of the enemy's ships, he had no further use for his own fleet,
                        and after beaching the vessels at Tarraco he brought up the crews to
                        reinforce his land army. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Of arms and
                        armament he had more than enough, what with those taken in the capture of
                        New Carthage, and those which the large body of artisans had fabricated for
                        him subsequently. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Laelius, in whose
                        absence he would not undertake anything of importance, had now returned from
                        Rome, so in the early days of spring he left Tarraco with his composite army
                        and marched straight for the enemy. </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The country through which he passed was
                        everywhere peaceful; each tribe as he approached gave him a friendly
                        reception and escorted him to their frontiers. On his route he was met by
                        Indibilis and Mandonius. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The former,
                        speaking for himself and his companion, addressed Scipio in grave and
                        dignified language, very unlike the rough and heedless speech of barbarians.
                        Instead of claiming credit for having seized the first opportunity of going
                        over to the side of Rome he rather pleaded that he had no alternative.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> He was quite aware, he said, that the
                        name of deserter was an object of loathing to the old friends and of
                        suspicion to the new ones, nor did he find fault with this way of looking at
                        it as long as the twofold odium attached not merely to the name but to the
                        motive. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Then after dwelling on the
                        services they had both rendered to the Carthaginian generals and the
                        rapacity and insolence which the latter had exhibited and the innumerable
                        wrongs inflicted on them and their fellow-countrymen, he continued:
                            <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> "Hitherto we have been associated
                        with them so far as our bodily presence is concerned, but our hearts and
                        minds have long been where we believe justice and right are cherished.
                            <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Now we come as suppliants to the gods
                        who cannot permit violence and injustice, and we implore you, Scipio, not to
                        regard our change of sides, as either a crime or a merit; put us to the test
                        from this day forward, and as you find us, so judge and appraise our
                        conduct." <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> The Roman general replied that
                        this was just what he intended to do; he should not regard as deserters men
                        who did not consider an alliance binding where no law, human or divine, was
                        respected. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> Thereupon their wives and
                        children were brought out and restored to them amid tears of joy. For that
                        day they were the guests of the Romans, on the morrow a definite treaty of
                        alliance was concluded, and they were sent off to bring up their troops.
                            <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> On their return they shared the Roman
                        camp and acted as guides until they reached the enemy. </p>

                        commanded by Hasdrubal, which was encamped near the city of Baecula.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Cavalry outposts were stationed in
                        front of the camp. The advance guard of the Roman column with the velites
                        and skirmishers, at once attacked these outposts without changing their
                        order of march or stopping to entrench themselves, and the contempt they
                        showed for their enemy showed clearly the difference in the temper of the
                        two armies. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The cavalry were driven in
                        hasty flight back to their camp, and the Roman standards were carried almost
                        to the gates. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> That day's skirmish only
                        served to whet the courage of the Romans, and, impatient for battle, they
                        formed their camp. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> In the night Hasdrubal
                        withdrew his force to a hill, the summit of which formed a broad table-land.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> His rear was protected by a river, in
                        front and on either side the hill sloped down precipitously, forming a kind
                        of steep bank, which surrounded the whole position. Below there was another
                        level stretch of ground which also fell away abruptly, and was equally
                        difficult of ascent. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> When, on the morrow,
                        Hasdrubal saw the Roman battle-line standing in front of their camp, he sent
                        his Numidian cavalry and the Balearic and African light infantry on to this
                        lower ground. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Scipio rode along the ranks
                        and pointed to the enemy standing in full view, who, he said, having given
                        up all hope of success on level ground were clinging to the hills, trusting
                        to the strength of their position and not to their arms or their courage.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> But the walls of New Carthage were
                        higher still, and yet Roman soldiers had surmounted them; neither hills, nor
                        citadel, nor the sea itself had stayed the advance of their arms. <milestone
                            n="10" unit="section"/> What use would the heights which the enemy had
                        seized be to them except to compel them to leap down cliffs and precipices
                        in their flight? Even that way of escape he should close to them. He then
                        told off two cohorts, one to hold the entrance of the valley through which
                        the river ran, the other to block the road which led from the city along the
                        slope of the hill into the country. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The
                        attack was commenced by the light-armed troops who had repulsed the outposts
                        the day before, and who were led by Scipio in person. At first their only
                        difficulty was the rough ground over which they were marching, but when they
                        came within range of the infantry stationed on the <milestone n="12??"
                            unit="section"/> lower plateau, all kinds of missiles were showered upon
                        them, to which they replied with showers of stones, with which the ground
                        was strewn, and which not only the soldiers but the camp followers who were
                        with them flung at the enemy. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Difficult
                        as the climb was, and almost buried as they were beneath stones and javelins
                        and darts, they went steadily on, thanks to their training in escalade and
                        their grim determination. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> As soon as they
                        reached level ground and could plant their feet firmly, their superior mode
                        of fighting told. The light and active enemy, accustomed to fighting and
                        skirmishing at a distance, when he could evade the missiles, was quite
                        incapable of holding his own in a hand-to-hand fight, and he was hurled back
                        with heavy loss on to the main body posted on the higher ground. <milestone
                            n="15" unit="section"/> Scipio ordered the victors to make a frontal
                        attack on the enemy's centre, while he divided the remainder of his force
                        between himself and Laelius. Laelius was ordered to work round the right of
                        the hill till he could find an easier ascent; he himself, making a short
                        detour to the left, attacked the enemy's flank. <milestone n="16"
                            unit="section"/> Shouts were now resounding on all sides, and the enemy
                        tried to wheel their wings round to face the new attack; the consequence was
                        their lines got into confusion. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> At this
                        moment Laelius came up and the enemy fell back to avoid being assailed from
                        the rear; this led to their front being broken, and an opportunity was
                        afforded for the Roman centre to gain the plateau, which <milestone n="18??"

                        The carnage was now spreading over the field, for Scipio, who had brought
                        his left against the enemy's right, was cutting up his exposed flank.

                        flight, for the roads in both directions were blocked by the Roman
                        detachments. Hasdrubal and his principal officers had in their flight closed
                        the gate of their camp, and to make matters still worse, the elephants were
                        galloping wildly about, and were dreaded by the Carthaginians as much as by
                        the Romans. The enemies' losses amounted to 8000 men. </p>

                        the fugitives that he could, he directed his march along the Tagus towards
                        the Pyrenees. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Scipio took possession of
                        the enemy's camp, and gave up all the plunder, with the exception of the
                        prisoners, to his troops. On counting the prisoners he found that they
                        amounted to 10,000 infantry and 2000 cavalry. The Spanish prisoners were all
                        released and sent to their homes; the Africans were ordered to be sold by
                        the quaestor. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> All the Spaniards, those who
                        had previously surrendered and those who had been made prisoners the day
                        before, now crowded round him, and with one accord saluted him as "King."
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> He ordered silence to be proclaimed,
                        and then told them that the title he valued most was the one his soldiers
                        had given him, the title of "Imperator." "The name of king," he said, "so
                        great elsewhere, is insupportable to Roman ears. <milestone n="5"

                        appreciated the greatness of a man who stood so high that he could look down

                            unit="section"/> Presents were then distributed amongst the Spanish
                        princes and chieftains, and Scipio invited Indibilis to choose 300 horses
                        out of the large number captured. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Whilst
                        the quaestor was putting up the Africans to sale, he found amongst them a
                        remarkably handsome youth, and hearing that he was of royal blood, he sent
                        him to Scipio. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Scipio questioned him as to
                        who he was, what country he belonged to, and why at his tender age he was in
                        camp. He told him that he was a Numidian, and his people called him Massiva.
                        Left an orphan by his father, he had been brought up by his maternal
                        grandfather Gala, king of the Numidians. His uncle Masinissa had come with
                        his cavalry to assist the Carthaginians, and he had accompanied him into
                        Spain. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Masinissa had always forbidden him
                        to take part in the fighting because he was so young, but that day he had,
                        unknown to his uncle, secured arms and a horse and gone into action, but his
                        horse fell and threw him, and so he had been made prisoner. Scipio ordered
                        the Numidian to be kept under guard, and when he had transacted all the
                        necessary business he left the tribunal and resumed to his tent. <milestone

                        whether he would like to return to Masinissa. The boy replied amid tears of

                            unit="section"/> Scipio then presented him with a gold ring, a tunic
                        with a wide purple border, a Spanish cloak with a gold clasp, and a
                        beautifully caparisoned horse. He then ordered an escort of cavalry to
                        accompany him as far as he wanted to go, and dismissed him. </p>

                        those present urged the immediate pursuit of Hasdrubal, but Scipio thought
                        it hazardous in case Mago and the other Hasdrubal should join forces with
                        him. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He contented himself with sending a

                        Scipio had descended from the pass of Castulo on his return to Tarraco, the
                        two Carthaginian generals, Hasdrubal Gisgo and Mago, came from Further Spain
                        to join forces with Hasdrubal. They were too late to prevent his defeat, but
                        their arrival was very timely in enabling them to concert measures for the
                        prosecution of the war. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> When they came to
                        compare notes as to the feeling in the different provinces, Hasdrubal Gisgo
                        considered that as the distant coast of Spain between Gades and the ocean
                        still knew nothing of the Romans, it was so far faithful to Carthage.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The other Hasdrubal and Mago were
                        agreed as to the influence which Scipio's generous treatment had had upon
                        the feelings of all states and individuals alike, and they were convinced
                        that the desertions could not be checked until all the Spanish soldiery had
                        either been removed to the furthest corners of Spain or transported into
                        Gaul. They decided therefore, without waiting for the sanction of the
                        senate, that Hasdrubal must proceed to Italy, the focus of the war where the
                        decisive conflict would be fought. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> In this
                        way he would remove all the Spanish soldiers out of Spain far beyond the
                        spell of Scipio's name. </p>
                    <p> His army, weakened as it was by desertions and by the losses in the recent
                        disastrous battle, had to be brought up to its full strength. <milestone
                            n="7" unit="section"/> Mago was to hand over his own army to Hasdrubal
                        Gisgo, and cross over to the Balearic Isles with an ample supply of money to
                        hire mercenaries among the islanders. Hasdrubal Gisgo was to make his way
                        into the interior of Lusitania and avoid any collision with the Romans.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> A force of 3000 horse, selected from
                        all their cavalry, was to be made up for Masinissa, with which he was to
                        traverse Western Spain, ready to assist the friendly tribes and carry
                        devastation amongst the towns and territory of those who were hostile. After
                        drawing up this plan of operations the three generals separated to carry out
                        their several tasks. This was the course of events during the year in Spain.
                        Scipio's reputation was rising day by day in Rome. <milestone n="9"

                        the object of general censure, owing to the defeat which he had suffered and
                        still more because he had quartered his army in Venusia in the height of the

                        Bibulus, a tribune of the plebs. Immediately after Marcellus met with his
                        defeat, this man blackened his character and stirred up a bitter feeling
                        against him by the harangues which he was constantly delivering to the
                        plebs, and now he was actually working to get him deprived of his command.
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Claudius' friends obtained permission
                        for him to leave his second in command at Venusia, and come home to clear

                        only against Marcellus, but against the nobility as a whole. It was due to
                        their crooked policy and lack of energy, he said, that Hannibal had for ten

                        now passing the summer comfortably housed in Venusia. Marcellus made such a
                        crushing reply to the tribune's speech by simply recounting all that he had
                        done that not only was the proposal to deprive him of his command rejected,
                        but the next day all the centuries with absolute unanimity elected him

                        praetor at the time, was assigned to him as his colleague. The next day came

                        considerable anxiety was created by the intelligence that Etruria had
                        revolted. C. Calpurnius, who was acting in that province as propraetor, had

                        thither to ascertain the position of affairs, and if he thought it
                        sufficiently serious to require the presence of his army he was to transfer
                        his operations from Apulia to Etruria. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The
                        Etruscans were sufficiently intimidated by these measures to keep quiet.
                        Envoys came from Tarentum to ask for terms of peace under which they might
                        retain their liberties and their laws. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The
                        senate directed them to come again as soon as Fabius arrived in Rome. The

                        and he then disposed the men in suitable positions. This done, he summoned
                        the senators into the forum and ordered them to give hostages for their good

                        property was sold. The rest of the senators offered their own children to
                        the number of one hundred and twenty; the offer was accepted, and they were

                        imminent. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> C. Terentius was accordingly

                        deserving equally severe punishment. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> At

                        and the entire population confined within their walls until Italy was in a

                        equally warm discussion arose in connection with M. Livius who had commanded
                        the force in the citadel. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Some were for
                        passing a formal vote of censure on him for having, through his negligence,
                        allowed the place to be betrayed to the enemy. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> Others considered that he ought to be rewarded for
                        having successfully defended the citadel for five years, and having done
                        more than any one else to effect the recapture of Tarentum. A third party,
                        taking a middle course, urged that it was for the censors, not the senate,
                        to take cognisance of his action. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> This
                        view was supported by Fabius, who remarked that he quite admitted what
                        Livius' friends were constantly asserting in that House, that it was owing
                        to his efforts that Tarentum had been retaken, for there would have been no

                        One of the consuls, T. Quinctius Crispinus, left with reinforcements for the
                        army in Lucania which Q. Fulvius Flaccus had commanded. Marcellus was
                        detained by religious difficulties which one after another presented

                        he was prevented from dedicating it by the pontiffs. They said that one
                        shrine could not be lawfully dedicated to two deities, because in case it
                        were struck by lightning, or some other portent occurred in it, there would
                        be a difficulty about the expiation, since it could not be known which deity
                        was to be propitiated; <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> one victim could
                        not be sacrificed to two deities except in the case of certain specified
                        deities. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> A second temple was hastily
                        built to Virtus, but this was not dedicated by Marcellus. At last he started

                        Venusia. Seeing how Tarentum had enhanced Fabius' reputation, Crispinus
                        determined to attempt the capture of Locri in Bruttium. <milestone n="11"

                        this view he marched back into Apulia, and the two consuls encamped within

                        they drew out their armies for battle almost every day, feeling perfectly
                        certain that if the enemy would try his chance against two consular armies,
                        the war would be brought to a close. </p>

                        again there was as much ground for fear as for hope, and he was therefore
                            <milestone n="2??" unit="section"/> far from feeling himself equal to

                        also, they ordered a portion of the army which was garrisoning Tarentum to

                        fell into the trap, and 2000 were killed and 1500 taken prisoners. The rest
                        fled through the fields and woods back to Tarentum. <milestone n="7"

                        there was a wooded hill which neither side had taken possession of, for the
                        Romans did not know what that side of it was like which fronted the enemy,
                        and Hannibal regarded it as better adapted for an ambuscade than for a camp.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> He accordingly sent a force of
                        Numidians during the night to conceal themselves in the wood, and there they
                        remained the following day without stirring from their position, so that
                        neither they nor their arms were visible. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                        It was being everywhere remarked in the Roman camp that the hill ought to be
                        seized and strengthened with defences, for if Hannibal seized it they would
                        have the enemy, so to speak, over their heads. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> The idea impressed Marcellus, and he said to his

                        camps were near enough to each other. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> As
                        he was crossing the rampart on his way to the hill he signalled to the
                        soldiers to be at their posts, ready to get the baggage together and follow
                        him in case he decided that the hill which he was going to reconnoitre was
                        suitable for a camp. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> There was a narrow
                        stretch of level ground in front of the camp, and from there a road led up
                        to the hill which was open and visible from all sides. The Numidians posted
                        a vidette to keep a look out, not in the least anticipating such a serious
                        encounter as followed, but simply in the hope of intercepting any who had
                        strayed too far from their camp after wood or fodder. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> This man gave the signal for them to rise from their
                        concealment. Those who were in front of the Romans further up the hill did
                        not show themselves until those who were to close the road behind them had
                        worked round their rear. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Then they sprang
                        up on all sides, and with a loud shout charged down. Though the consuls were
                        hemmed in, unable to force their way to the hill which was occupied, and
                        with their retreat cut off by those in their rear, still the conflict might
                        have <milestone n="6??" unit="section"/> kept up for a longer time if the
                        Etruscans, who were the first to flee, had not created a panic among the

                        abandoned by the Etruscans, maintained the conflict as long as the consuls
                        were unwounded and able to cheer them on and take their part in the
                        fighting. But when both the consuls were wounded, when they saw Marcellus
                        fall dying from his horse, run through with a lance, then the little band of
                        survivors fled in company with Crispinus, who had been hit by two darts, and
                        young Marcellus, who was himself wounded. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                        Aulus Manlius was killed, and Manius Aulius; the other prefect of allies,
                        Arrenius, was taken prisoner. Five of the consuls' lictors fell into the
                        hands of the enemy, the rest were either killed or escaped with the consul.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Forty-three of the cavalry fell either
                        in the battle or the pursuit, eighteen were made prisoners. <milestone

                        consul and the son of the other coming back wounded with the scanty remnant
                        who had survived the disastrous expedition. <milestone n="11" unit="section"
                        /> The death of Marcellus was to be deplored for many reasons, especially
                        because, with an imprudence not to be expected at his age-he was more than
                        sixty-and altogether out of keeping with the caution of a veteran general,
                        he had flung into headlong danger not only himself but his colleague as
                        well, and almost the entire commonwealth. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                        I should make too long a digression about one solitary fact, if I were to go

                            unit="section"/> I will only cite one authority, Coelius. He gives three

                        copied from the funeral oration delivered by his son who was on the spot,
                        and a third which Coelius gives as the ascertained result of his own

                        story, however, most authorities agree that he left the camp to reconnoitre
                        the position, and all agree that he was ambushed. </p>

                        would be thoroughly cowed by the death of one consul and the disablement of
                        the other, and he determined not to lose the opportunity thus afforded him.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He at once transferred his camp to the
                        hill where the action had been fought, and here he interred the body of
                        Marcellus, which had been found. Crispinus, unnerved by the death of his
                        colleague and his own wound, left his position in the dead of night and
                        fixed his camp on the first mountains he came to, in a lofty position
                        protected on every side. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> And now the two
                        commanders showed great wariness, the one trying to deceive his opponent,

                            unit="section"/> When the body of Marcellus was discovered, Hannibal
                        took possession of his rings. Fearing that the signet might be used for
                        purposes of forgery, Crispinus sent couriers to all the cities round,
                        warning them that his colleague was killed and his ring in the possession of
                        the enemy, so that they were not to trust any missives sent in the name of
                        Marcellus. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Soon after the consul's
                        messenger had arrived at Salapia, a despatch was received from Hannibal
                        purporting to come from Marcellus, and stating that he would come to Salapia
                        the night after they received the letter, and the soldiers of the garrison
                        were to hold themselves in readiness in case their services should be
                        required. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The Salapians saw through the

                        not only for their desertion of the Carthaginian cause, but also for the
                        slaughter of his cavalry. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> They sent back
                        the messenger, who was a Roman deserter, that he might not be cognisant of
                        the measures which they decided to take, and then made their dispositions.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The townsmen took their places on the
                        walls and other commanding positions, the patrols and sentries for the night
                        were strengthened and kept a most careful look out, and the pick of the
                        garrison were formed up near the gate to which the enemy were expected to
                        come. </p>

                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Hannibal approached the city about the
                        fourth watch. The head of the column was formed of Roman deserters; they
                        carried Roman weapons, their armour was Roman, and they were all speaking
                        Latin. When they reached the gate, they called up the sentinels and told
                        them to open the gate as the consul was there. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> The sentinels, pretending to be just wakened up,
                        bustled about in hurry and confusion and began slowly and laboriously to
                        open the gate. It was closed by a portcullis, and by means of levers and
                        ropes they raised it just high enough for a man to pass upright under it.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The passage was hardly sufficiently
                        clear when the deserters rushed through the gate, each trying who should be
                        first. About 600 were inside, when suddenly the rope which held it was let
                        go, and the portcullis fell with a great crash. <milestone n="12"
                            unit="section"/> The Salapians attacked the deserters, who were marching
                        carelessly along with their shields hung from their shoulders, as though
                        friends; others on the gate tower and the walls kept off the enemy outside
                        with stones and long poles and javelins. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                        So Hannibal, finding himself caught in his own trap, drew off and proceeded
                        to raise the siege of Locri. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Cincius was
                        making a most determined attack upon the place with siege works and
                        artillery of every kind which he had brought from Sicily, and Mago was
                        beginning to despair of holding the place when his hopes were suddenly
                        revived by the news of Marcellus' death. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>
                        Then came a messenger with the tidings that Hannibal had sent his Numidian
                        cavalry on in advance, and was following as rapidly as he could with his
                        infantry. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> As soon as the signal was given
                        from the look-out of the approach of the Numidians, Mago flung the city gate
                        open and made a vigorous sortie. Owing to the suddenness of his attack which
                        was quite unlooked for, rather than to his fighting strength, the battle was
                        for some time an even one, but <milestone n="17??" unit="section"/> when the
                        Numidians came up, such a panic seized the Romans that they abandoned the

                        fled in disorder to the sea and to their ships. Thus by the arrival of
                        Hannibal, the siege of Locri was raised. </p>

                        elections because he did not think he could bear the fatigue of the journey,
                        and also because he was anxious about Tarentum in case Hannibal should leave
                        Bruttium and direct his armies against it. He also requested that some men
                        of wisdom and experience might be sent to him, as it was necessary for him
                        to confer with them as to the policy of the Republic. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> The reading of this despatch evoked a feeling of deep
                        regret at the death of the one consul and serious apprehensions for the life
                        of the other. In accordance with his wish they sent young Q. Fabius to the
                        army at Venusia, and three representatives to the consul, viz. Sextus Julius
                        Caesar, L. Licinius Pollio and L. Cincius Alimentus who had returned from
                        Sicily a few days previously. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Their
                        instructions were to tell the consul that if he could not come to Rome to
                        conduct the elections, he was to nominate a Dictator in Roman territory for
                        the purpose. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> If the consul had gone to
                        Tarentum, the praetor Q. Claudius was required to withdraw the legions
                        stationed there, and march with them into that district in which he could
                        protect the greatest number of cities belonging to the allies of Rome.

                        resistance. The news of the approach of a Carthaginian fleet caused the

                        from his fleet. Philip won two battles against Pyrrhias, and in each battle
                        the enemy lost not less than 1000 men. From that time the Aetolians were
                        afraid to meet him in the field and remained inside the walls of Lamia.

                        Aegium to the meeting of the League which had been fixed some time

                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The discussion turned upon the question
                        of putting a stop to the war with the Aetolians, so that neither the Romans
                        nor Attalus might have any reason for entering Greece. <milestone n="11"

                        the armistice had expired, after they learnt that Attalus had reached Aegina
                        and that a Roman fleet was anchored off Naupactus. They had been invited to
                        attend the meeting of the League, and the deputations who had been trying to
                        secure peace at Phalara were also present. <milestone n="12" unit="section"

                        armistice, and ended by declaring that hostilities could never cease until
                        the Achaeans restored Pylos to the Messenians, and Atintania was given back
                        to Rome, and the Ardiaei to Scerdilaedus and Pleuratus. <milestone n="13"

                            unit="section"/> He reminded the assembly that when the question of
                        peace was referred to him and an armistice was granted, it was not with any
                        expectation that the Aetolians would remain quiet, but solely in order that
                        all the allies might bear him witness that whilst he was seeking a basis for
                        peace, the other side were determined to find a pretext for war. <milestone

                        established, he dismissed the council and returned to Argos, as the time for
                        the Nemean Games was approaching and he wished to add to their popularity by
                        his presence. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> He left a force of 4000 men
                        to protect the Achaeans, and at the same time took over from them five ships
                        of war. He intended to add these to the fleet recently sent from Carthage;

                        resorted to criminal violence. It was a dangerous thing for husbands and

                        forward to provoke the Aetolians to fight, which they were perfectly ready
                        to do. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The invaders were unaware that
                        Sulpicius had sailed across from Naupactus to Cyllene with fifteen ships and

                        with great alarm. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> At first the king wanted
                        to retire his men, but they were already engaged with the Aetolians and
                        Trallians-an Illyrian tribe-and as he saw that they were being hard pressed,
                        he charged the Roman cohort with his cavalry. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> His horse was wounded by a javelin and fell, throwing
                        the king over its head, and a fierce contest began, on both sides, the

                        horse on which he fled. That day he fixed his camp about five miles from
                        Elis; the following day he led the whole of his force to a fortified place
                        called Pyrgon. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> This was a fort belonging
                        to the Eleans, and he had been informed that a large number of peasants with
                        their cattle had taken refuge there through fear of being plundered.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Destitute as they were of organisation
                        and arms, the mere fact of his approach filled them with terror and they
                        were all made prisoners. This booty was some compensation for his
                        humiliating defeat at Elis. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Whilst he was

                        head of cattle large and small-a messenger arrived from Macedonia stating
                        that a certain Eropus had taken Lychnidos after bribing the commandant of

                        that Philip had been killed; the rumour was due to the fact that in the

                        horse flung him against a tree and one of the horns of his helmet was broken

                        state of orphanhood. The Dictator named C. Servilius, who was curule aedile

                        Meanwhile, as the two consular armies had no generals and were in such close
                        proximity to the enemy, both senate and people were anxious that all other
                        business should be postponed, and consuls elected as soon as possible.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> It was felt that, above all, men

                        another that the people had wronged an innocent man to the great detriment
                        of the commonwealth, which in the stress of a grievous war had been unable
                        to avail itself of the help and counsel of such a man as that. <milestone

                        be assigned to C. Nero as his colleague because it was illegal for two
                        patricians to be elected, and the same difficulty existed in the case of T.
                        Manlius, who had moreover already refused a consulship and would continue to
                        refuse it. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> If they gave him M. Livius as
                        colleague, they felt that they would have a splendid pair of consuls. This
                        suggestion put forward by the senators was approved by the great body of the
                        people. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> There was only one among all the
                        citizens who rejected it and that was the man on whom the honour was to be

                        inconsistency. "When he appeared in mourning garments at his trial they felt
                        no pity for him, now, in spite of his refusal, they would have him put on
                        the white robe of the candidate. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> They
                        heaped penalties and honours on the same man. If they thought that he was a

                        him to be a criminal, why were they entrusting him with a second consulship
                        after he had misused the first?" <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> The
                        senators severely censured him for complaining and protesting in this way,
                        and reminded him of M. Furius Camillus who after being recalled from exile
                        restored his country to its ancient seat. "We ought to treat our country,"
                        they told him, "like our parents, and disarm its severity by patience and

                        by night and mauled one of the watch. These portents were expiated by the

                        their observance. Two white heifers were led from the temple of Apollo
                        through the Carmental Gate into the City; after them were borne two images

                        Then twenty-seven maidens, vested in long robes, walked in procession
                        singing a hymn in her honour, which was perhaps admired in those rude days,
                        but which would be considered very uncouth and unpleasing if it were recited
                        now. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> After the train of maidens came the

                        solemn dance while they sang, beating time with their feet to the sound of
                        their voices. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> They then resumed their

                        and up the Clivus Publicius till they reached the temple of Juno. Here the
                        two heifers were sacrificed by the Ten Keepers, and the cypress images were
                        carried into the shrine. </p>

                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Each community produced its title to
                        exemption, but as the enemy was in Italy, the claim was disallowed in the
                        case of all but two-Antium and Ostia-and in the case of these, the men of
                        military age were compelled <milestone n="6??" unit="section"/> to take an
                        oath that they would not sleep outside their walls for more than thirty
                        nights as long as the enemy was in Italy. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                        Everybody was of opinion that the consuls ought to take the field at the
                        earliest possible moment; for Hasdrubal must be met on his descent from the
                        Alps, otherwise he might foment a rising amongst the Cisalpine Gauls and in
                        Etruria, and Hannibal must be kept fully employed, so as to prevent his
                        leaving Bruttium and meeting his brother. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                        Still Livius delayed. He did not feel confidence in the troops assigned to
                        him, and complained that his colleague had his choice of three splendid
                        armies. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> He also suggested the recall to
                        the standards of the volunteer slaves. The senate gave the consuls full
                        powers to obtain reinforcements in any way they thought best, to select what
                        men they wanted from all the armies and to exchange and transfer troops from
                        one province to another as <milestone n="10??" unit="section"/> they thought
                        best in the interest of the State. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The
                        consuls acted in perfect harmony in carrying out all these measures. The
                        volunteer slaves were incorporated in the nineteenth and twentieth legions.
                        Some authorities assert that Publius Scipio sent M. Livius strong
                        reinforcements from Spain including 8000 Gauls and Spaniards, 2000
                        legionaries, and 1000 Numidian and Spanish horse, and that this force was
                        transported to Italy by M. Lucretius. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> It
                        is further stated that C. Mamilius sent 3000 bowmen and slingers from

                        heightened by a despatch from L. Porcius, the propraetor commanding in Gaul.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He announced that Hasdrubal had left
                        his winter quarters and was actually crossing the Alps. He was to be joined
                        by a force of 8000 men raised and equipped amongst the Ligurians, unless a
                        Roman army were sent into Liguria to occupy the attention of the Gauls.
                        Porcius added that he would himself advance as far as he safely could with
                        such a weak army. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The receipt of this
                        despatch made the consuls hurry on the enlistment, and on its completion
                        they left for their provinces at an earlier date than they had fixed. Their
                        intention was that each of them should keep his enemy in his own province
                        and not allow the brothers to unite or concentrate their forces. <milestone
                            n="4" unit="section"/> They were materially assisted by a miscalculation
                        which Hannibal made. He quite expected his brother to cross the Alps during
                        the summer, but remembering his own experience in the passage first of the
                        Rhone and then of the Alps, and how for five months he had had to carry on
                        an exhausting struggle against man and against <milestone n="5??"
                            unit="section"/> nature, he had no idea that Hasdrubal's passage would
                        be as easy and rapid as it really was. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        Owing to this mistake he was too late in moving out of his winter quarters.
                        Hasdrubal, however, had a more expeditious march and met with fewer
                        difficulties than either he or anyone else expected. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> Not only did the Arverni and the other Gallic and
                        Alpine tribes give him a friendly reception, but they followed his standard.
                        He was, moreover, marching mainly over roads made by his brother where
                        before there were none, and as the Alps had now been traversed to and fro
                        for twelve years he found the natives less savage. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> Previously they had never visited strange lands nor
                        been accustomed to seeing strangers in their own country; they had held no
                        intercourse with the rest of the world. Not knowing at first the destination
                        of the Carthaginian general, they imagined that he wanted their rocks and
                        strongholds and intended to carry off their men and cattle as plunder.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Then when they heard about the Punic
                        War with which Italy had been alight for twelve years, they quite understood
                        that the Alps were only a passage from one country to another, and that the
                        struggle lay between two mighty cities, separated by a vast stretch of sea
                        and land, which were contending for power and dominion. <milestone n="10"

                        the rapidity of his march was forfeited by the <milestone n="12??"

                        that the town would be taken without difficulty, and that the capture of
                        such an important colony would deter the others from offering any
                        resistance. Not only was his own advance hampered by this investment, but he
                        also retarded Hannibal's movements, who, on learning of <milestone n="14??"

                        winter quarters, for Hannibal knew what a slow business sieges usually are
                        and had not forgotten his own unsuccessful attempt on that very colony after
                        his victory at the Trebia. </p>

                        simultaneously; they recalled the disasters which followed upon Hannibal's
                        appearance in Italy, and wondered what gods would be so propitious to the
                        City and the empire as to grant victory over two enemies at once in widely

                        stayed the collapse of the battered republic, whilst the distance at which
                        that unsuccessful war was waged <milestone n="5??" unit="section"/> in the
                        remotest corner of the world afforded in itself a breathing space. Now they
                        had two wars on hand, both in Italy; two generals who bore illustrious names
                        were closing round Rome; the whole weight of the peril, the whole burden of
                        the conflict had settled down on one spot. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        The one who was first victorious would in a few days unite his forces with
                        the other. Such were the gloomy forebodings, and they were deepened by the
                        recollections of the past year made so mournful by the death of both
                        consuls. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> In this depressed and anxious

                        left for their respective provinces. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> There
                        is an utterance recorded of M. Livius which shows his bitter feeling towards
                        his fellow-citizens. When on his departure Q. Fabius warned him against
                        giving battle before he knew the sort of enemy he had to meet, Livius is
                        said to have replied that he would fight as soon as he caught sight of the
                        enemy. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> When asked why he was in such a

                        Claudius Nero arrived in his province, Hannibal, who was marching just

                        amongst the enemy, who were not prepared for action; 4000 of them were
                        slain, and nine standards captured. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Q.
                        Claudius had quartered his troops in various cities in the Sallentine

                        quarters and took the field against him. Not wishing to meet both armies at
                        once, Hannibal left the neighbourhood by night, and withdrew into Bruttium.
                            <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Claudius marched back into the

                        The rampart of the Carthaginian camp seemed to be almost touching the walls

                        allies fell. The next day the Carthaginians remained quiet. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> The Roman general marched in battle order on to the
                        field, but when he saw that no standards were advancing from the opposing
                        camp he ordered his men to gather the spoils of the slain and collect the
                        bodies of their comrades and bury them in one common grave. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> Then for several days in succession he marched up so
                        close to the gates that it seemed as though he were going to attack the
                        camp, until Hannibal made up his mind to depart. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> Leaving numerous fires burning and tents standing on
                        the side of the camp facing the Romans, and a few Numidians who were to show
                        themselves on the rampart and at the gates, he set out with the intention of
                        marching into Apulia. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> As soon as it grew
                        light, the Roman army approached the rampart and the Numidians made
                        themselves visible on the ramparts and at the gates. After deceiving their
                        enemy for some time they rode off at full speed to join their comrades.
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> When the consul found that the camp
                        was silent and that even the few who had been patrolling it at dawn were
                        nowhere visible, he sent two troopers into the camp to reconnoitre. They
                        brought back word that they had examined it and found it safe everywhere, on

                        waited while the soldiers secured the plunder, and then the signal was given
                        to retire; long before nightfall he had his soldiers back in camp.
                            <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Very early next morning he started in
                        pursuit and, guided by the local information supplied to him and the traces
                        of their retreat, he succeeded, by making forced marches, in coming up with
                        the enemy not far from Venusia. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> There a
                        second irregular action took place in which the Carthaginians lost 2000 men.
                        After this Hannibal decided to give no further opportunity of fighting and,
                        in a series of night marches over the mountains, made for Metapontum.
                            <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> Hanno was in command of the garrison
                        here, and he was sent with a few troops into Bruttium to raise a fresh army
                        there. The rest of his force Hannibal incorporated with his own, and
                        retracing his steps reached Venusia, and from there went on to Canusium.
                            <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> Nero never lost touch with him, and
                        while he was following him to Metapontum he sent Q. Fulvius into Lucania, so

                        almost traversed the length of Italy, and were following Hannibal's retreat
                        to Metapontum when they missed the road and were brought to Tarentum.

                        They and the despatches, with seals intact, were handed over to L.

                        despatches had been translated to him, and the prisoners had been examined,
                        the consul saw that the regulation which confined <milestone n="6??"

                        would have to venture upon a startling innovation, and though at the outset
                        it might create as much alarm among his own countrymen as amongst the enemy,
                        it would, when carried through, turn their great fear into great rejoicing.
                        Hasdrubal's despatches he sent on to the senate together with one from
                        himself explaining his project. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> As
                        Hasdrubal had written to say that he would meet his brother in Umbria, he
                        advised the senators to recall the Roman legion from Capua, raise troops in
                        Rome, and with this City force oppose the enemy at Narnia. This was what he
                        wrote to the senate. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> But he also sent
                        couriers into the districts through which he intended to march-Larinum,
                        Marrucina, Frentanum and Praetutia-to warn the inhabitants to collect all
                        the supplies from the towns and the country districts and have them in

                        seize the nearest city in Lucania with its Carthaginian garrison, so that
                        all should be ready to march. Starting by night, he turned off in the

                        quite as great as they had been two years previously, when the Carthaginian

                        that they would await the result before pronouncing for or against it-a most
                        unfair way of judging. "The camp." they said, "is left, near an enemy like
                        Hannibal, with no general, with an army from which its main strength, the

                        without defence, without a general with full powers or one who can take the

                        for Hasdrubal too is a son of Hamilcar and is quite as able and energetic a

                        Hannibal himself, for he got <milestone n="8??" unit="section"/> together an
                        army in those very districts in which his brother lost the greater part of

                        stranger to him, for he was the general whom Hasdrubal, when intercepted in
                        a narrow pass, had duped and baffled as though he were a child by making
                        illusory proposals for peace. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> In this way
                        they exaggerated the strength of the enemy and depreciated their own, their

                        he made a brief address to his men. "No commander," he said, "has ever

                        equipped than if he were advancing against Hannibal himself. However small

                        rendered all the easier because Claudius' army, in their hurried march, had

                        and also might have a few days for getting to know his enemy. <milestone
                            n="7" unit="section"/> Nero tried to dissuade them from this course, and
                        earnestly implored them not to endanger the success of his plan after he had
                        made it perfectly safe by the rapidity of his march. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> Hannibal's activity, he argued, was so to speak
                        paralysed by a mistake which he would not be long in rectifying; he had
                        neither attacked the camp in the absence of its commander, nor had he made
                        up his mind to follow him on his march. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                        Before he moved, it was possible to destroy Hasdrubal's army and march back
                        into Apulia. "To give the enemy time by putting off the engagement would be
                        to betray their camp in Apulia to Hannibal and give him a clear road into
                        Gaul, so that he would be able to form a junction with Hasdrubal when and
                        where he pleased. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The signal for action
                        must be given at once, and we must march on to the field and profit by the
                        mistakes which both our enemies are making, the distant one and the one
                        close at hand. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> That one does not know
                        that he has to deal with a smaller army than he supposes, this one is not
                        aware that he has to meet a larger and stronger one than he imagines."
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> As soon as the council broke up, the
                        red ensign was displayed and the army at once took the field. </p>

                        of their camp, in battle order. But there was a pause. Hasdrubal had ridden
                        to the front with a handful of cavalry, when he noticed in the hostile ranks
                        some well-worn shields which he had not seen before, and some unusually lean
                        horses; the numbers, too, seemed greater than usual. <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> Suspecting the truth he hastily withdrew his troops
                        into camp and sent men down to the river from which the Romans obtained
                        water, to catch if they could some of the watering parties and see whether
                        they were especially sunburnt, as is generally the case after a long march.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He ordered, at the same time, mounted
                        patrols to ride round the consul's camp and observe whether the lines had
                        been extended in any direction and to notice at the same time whether the
                        bugle-call was sounded once or twice in the camp. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> They reported that both the camps-M. Livius' camp and
                        that of L. Porcius-were just as they had been, no addition had been made,
                        and this misled him. But they also informed him that the bugle-call was
                        sounded once in the praetor's camp and twice in the consul's, and this
                        perturbed the veteran commander, familiar as he was with the habits of the
                        Romans. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> He concluded that both the consuls
                        were there and was anxiously wondering how the one consul had got away from
                        Hannibal. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Least of all could he suspect
                        what had actually occurred, namely that Hannibal had been so completely
                        outwitted that he did not know the whereabouts of the commander and the army
                        whose camp had been so close to his own. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                        As his brother had not ventured to follow the consul, he felt quite certain
                        that he had sustained a serious defeat, and he felt the gravest
                        apprehensions lest he should have come too late to save a desperate
                        situation, and lest the Romans should enjoy the same good fortune in Italy
                        which they had met with in Spain. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Then
                        again he was convinced that his letter had never reached Hannibal, but had
                        been intercepted by the consul who then hastened to crush him. Amidst these
                        gloomy forebodings he ordered the camp fires to be extinguished, and gave
                        the signal at the first watch for all the baggage to be collected in
                        silence. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The army then left the camp. In
                        the hurry and confusion of the night march the guides, who had not been kept
                        under very close observation, slipped away; one hid himself in a place
                        selected beforehand, the other swam across the Metaurus at a spot well known
                        to him. The column deprived of its guides marched on aimlessly across
                        country, and many, worn out by sleeplessness flung themselves down to rest,
                        those who remained with the standards becoming fewer and fewer. <milestone

                        ordered the head of the column to advance cautiously, but finding that owing
                        to the bends and turns of the river he had made little progress, he made
                        arrangements for crossing it as soon as daybreak should show him a
                        convenient place. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> But he was unable to
                        find one, for the further he marched from the sea, the higher were the banks
                        which confined the stream, and by thus wasting the day he gave his enemy
                        time to follow him. </p>

                        repeated charges on all sides, until Hasdrubal stopped a march which began
                        to resemble a flight, and decided to form camp on a hill which commanded the
                        river. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> At this juncture Livius appeared
                        with the heavy infantry, not in order of march, but deployed and armed for
                        immediate battle. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> All their forces were
                        now massed together, and the line was formed; Claudius Nero taking command
                        of the right wing, Livius of the left, while the centre was assigned to the
                        praetor. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> When Hasdrubal saw that he must
                        give up all idea of entrenching himself and prepare to fight, he stationed
                        the elephants in the front, the Gauls near them on the left to oppose
                        Claudius, not so much because he trusted them as because he hoped they would
                        frighten the enemy, while on the right, where he commanded in person, he
                        posted the Spaniards in whom as veteran troops he placed most confidence.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The Ligurians were stationed in the
                        centre behind the elephants. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> His formation
                        was greater in depth than length and the Gauls were covered by a hill which
                        extended across their front. That part of the line which Hasdrubal and his
                        Spaniards held engaged the Roman left; <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> the
                        whole of the Roman right was shut out from the fighting, the hill in front
                        prevented them from making either a frontal or a flank attack. The struggle
                        between Livius and Hasdrubal was a fierce one, and both sides lost heavily.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Here were the two captains, the
                        greater part of the Roman infantry and cavalry, the Spaniards who were
                        veteran soldiers and used to the Roman methods of fighting, and also the
                        Ligurians, a people hardened by warfare. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                        To this part of the field the elephants too had been driven, and at their
                        first onset they threw the front ranks into confusion and forced the
                        standards to give way. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Then as the
                        fighting became hotter and the noise and shouting more furious, it became
                        impossible to control them, they rushed about between the two armies as
                        though they did not know to which side they belonged, just like ships
                        drifting rudderless. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Nero made fruitless
                        efforts to scale the hill in front of him, calling out repeatedly to his
                        men, "Why have we made so long a march at such break-neck speed? <milestone

                        in that direction, he detached some cohorts from his right wing where he saw
                        that they were more likely to stand on guard than to take any part in the

                        executed, that almost as soon as they showed themselves on the flank, they
                        were attacking the rear of the enemy. Thus attacked on every side, front,
                        flank and rear, Spaniards and Ligurians alike were simply massacred where

                        gold and silver. Above 3000 Romans who had been captured by the enemy were
                        recovered, and this was some consolation for the losses incurred in the
                        battle. For the victory was by no means a bloodless one; about 8000 Romans

                        courier could not get near it. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> He was
                        dragged away by the crowd, who demanded with loud shouts that the despatch
                        should be read from the rostra before it was read in the senate-house.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> At last the magistrates succeeded in
                        forcing back and restraining the populace, and it became possible for all to
                        share in the joyous news they were so impatient to learn. The despatch was
                        read first in the senate-house, and then in the Assembly. <milestone n="11"
                            unit="section"/> It was listened to with different feelings according to
                        each man's temperament; some regarded the news as absolutely true, others
                        would not believe it till they had the consul's despatch and the report of
                        the envoys. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Word was brought that the envoys were
                        approaching. Everybody young and old alike ran out to meet them, each eager
                        to drink in the good tidings with eyes and <milestone n="2??" unit="section"
                        /> ears, and the crowd extended as far as the Mulvian bridge. <milestone
                            n="3" unit="section"/> The envoys were L. Veturius Philo, P. Licinius
                        Varus and Q. Caecilius Metellus. They made their way to the Forum surrounded
                        by a crowd which represented every class of the population, and besieged by
                        questions on all sides as to what had really happened. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> No sooner did any one hear that the army of the enemy
                        and its commander had been slain whilst the consuls and their army were
                        safe, than he hastened to make others sharers of his joy. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> The senate-house was reached with difficulty, and with
                        much greater difficulty was the crowd prevented from invading the space
                        reserved for the senators. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Here the
                        despatch was read, and then the envoys were conducted to the Assembly. After
                        the despatch was read, L. Veturius gave fuller details and his narrative was
                        received with bursts of applause, which finally swelled into universal
                        cheers, the Assembly being hardly able to contain itself for joy. <milestone
                            n="7" unit="section"/> Some ran to the temples to give thanks to heaven,
                        others hurried home that their wives and children might hear the good news.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The senate decreed a three days'
                        thanksgiving "because the consuls, M. Livius and C. Claudius Nero, had
                        preserved their own armies in safety and destroyed the army of the enemy and
                        its commander." C. Hostilius, the praetor, issued the order for its
                        observance. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The services were attended by
                        men and women alike, the temples were crowded all through the three days,
                        and the matrons in their most splendid robes, accompanied by their children,
                        offered their thanksgivings to the gods, as free from anxiety and fear as
                        though the war were over. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> This victory
                        also relieved the financial position. People ventured to do business just as
                        in a time of peace, buying and selling, lending and repaying loans.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> After Nero had returned to camp he
                        gave orders for Hasdrubal's head, which he had kept and brought with him, to
                        be thrown in front of the enemies' outpost, and the African prisoners to be
                        exhibited just as they were in chains. Two of them were released with orders
                        to go to Hannibal and report all that had happened. <milestone n="12"
                            unit="section"/> Stunned by the blow which had fallen on his country and
                        on his family, it is said that Hannibal declared that he recognised the doom
                        which awaited Carthage. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> He broke up his
                        camp, and decided to concentrate in Bruttium, the remotest corner of Italy,
                        all his supporters whom he could no longer protect, whilst scattered in the
                        different cities. The whole population of Metapontum had to leave their
                        homes together with all the Lucanians who acknowledged his supremacy, and
                        were transported into Bruttian territory. </p>
