                    Italy the consul Marcellus, having regained possession of Salapia by betrayal,
                    took Marmoreae and Meles <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Two unknown
                        towns where Hannibal had important supply bases. For Salapia, in Apulia,
                        northwest of Cannae, cf. XXVI. xxxviii. 6 ff. and note. Its garrison
                        consisted of 500 Numidians; <hi rend="italics">l.c.</hi> § 11. </note> from
                    the Samnites by force. About three thousand of Hannibal's soldiers, who had been
                    left as a garrison, were overpowered there. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    The booty —and there was much of it —was turned over to the soldiers. In
                    addition two hundred and forty thousand pecks of wheat and a hundred and ten
                    thousand pecks of barley were found. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> But the
                    rejoicing in consequence by no means balanced the great loss suffered within a
                    few days not far from the city of Herdonea. <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified"> In Apulia, 30 miles west of Cannae; XXV. xxi. 1; xxii.
                        14. </note> There Gnaeus Fulvius, the proconsul, was encamped, in the hope
                    of regaining Herdonea, which had deserted the Romans after the disaster at
                    Cannae; <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> but his camp was pitched in a position
                    neither quite safe nor strongly held. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    Carelessness, ingrained in the character of the general, was increased by that
                    hope, inasmuch as he had learned that their loyalty was weakening and turning
                    against the Carthaginian, ever since they had heard that, after the loss of
                    Salapia, Hannibal had withdrawn from that region into the land of the Bruttii.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The report of all this to Hannibal from
                    Herdonea by secret messengers made him concerned to retain an allied city and at
                    the same time gave him the hope of attacking the enemy unawares. With an army
                    unencumbered <pb n="p.205"/> by baggage he hastened by forced marches to <note
                        anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 210</note> Herdonea,
                    so that he almost outstripped reports of his coming; and to strike more alarm
                    into the enemy, he approached the city in battle-array. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> The Roman, who was his equal in boldness but not in
                    strategy and in forces, hastily led out his troops and engaged. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> The fifth legion and the left <hi rend="italics">ala</hi>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> For this formation (legion and
                        auxiliaries in the same line) see Vol. VI. p. 422, note; cf. ii. 6; xii. 14;
                        xiv. 3; xlii. 2. </note> went into battle with spirit. But Hannibal gave the
                    order to his cavalry, that when the infantry lines should have concentrated the
                    eyes and attention of the enemy upon the immediate conflict, they should turn
                    the flanks and attack, some of them the enemy's camp, some the rear of the
                    wavering troops. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> And he himself, scornfully
                    alluding to the similarity in the name of Gnaeus Fulvius, since he had defeated
                    a praetor Gnaeus Fulvius two years before in the same region, asserted that the
                    outcome of the battle would be similar. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Nor
                    was that hope groundless. For when many of the Romans had fallen in the close
                    contact of the lines during <milestone n="11??" unit="section"/> the infantry
                    battle, while the ranks and standards nevertheless held their ground, the wild
                    charge of the cavalry was heard in the rear, and at the same time the shouts of
                    the enemy from the camp. This routed first the sixth legion, which was posted in
                    the second line and was the first to be thrown into disorder by the Numidians;
                    and then it routed the fifth legion and the men who were with the front-line
                    standards. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Some scattered in flight, some
                    were slain in the centre of the battle, where Gnaeus Fulvius also fell together
                    with eleven tribunes of the soldiers. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> How
                    many thousand Romans and allies were slain in that battle who could state with
                    certainty, inasmuch as in one source I find thirteen thousand, in another not
                    more <pb n="p.207"/> than seven? <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> The camp and
                    booty fell to the victor. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"
                        type="margin">B.C. 210</note> As for Herdonea, in view of his information
                    that it would have revolted to the Romans and would not remain loyal to him if
                    he should withdraw, he removed the whole population to Metapontum and Thurii and
                    set fire to the city. He put to death the leading men who, he was informed, had
                    had secret conversations with Fulvius. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> The
                    Romans who had made their escape from so disastrous a battle, by different roads
                    and half-armed sought refuge with the consul Marcellus in Samnium. <note
                        anchored="true" place="unspecified"> There is reason to believe that Livy's
                        authorities had duplicated the defeat of a Fulvius (with identity of place
                        and suspiciously similar circumstances), and that this is the real event,
                        while that in XXV. xxi. is the doublet, due to confusion between Gnaeus
                        Fulvius Centumalus, consul in <date when="-0211">211 B.C.</date> , and
                        Gnaeus Fulvius Flaccus, praetor in <date when="-0212">212 B.C.</date> But
                        the praetor must have suffered a shameful defeat somewhere; for the detailed
                        account of his trial in XXVI. ii. 7 ff. and iii. for cowardice and neglect
                        of duty could hardly be invented. Cf. De Sanctis, <hi rend="italics">Storia

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Marcellus, who was not particularly alarmed by
                    so serious a defeat, wrote a letter to the senate at Rome in regard to the loss
                    of general and army at Herdonea. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He said that
                    nevertheless, being the same man who, after the battle of Cannae, had frustrated
                    Hannibal, elated by that victory, he was marching against him to cut short his
                    joy and exultation. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> At Rome, to be sure, there
                    was not only great sorrow owing to what had happened, but also great fear for
                    the future. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The consul, however, crossing over
                    from Samnium into Lucania, pitched camp near Numistro, <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified"> In the extreme north of Lucania, southwest of Venusia,
                        at a distance of <hi rend="italics">ca.</hi> 25 miles. </note> on level
                    ground in sight of Hannibal, while the Carthaginian held a hill. <milestone
                        n="5" unit="section"/> He added the further appearance of confidence in
                    being the first to lead out into battle-line. And Hannibal did not refuse, when
                    he saw the standards borne out of the gates. Nevertheless they drew up their
                    lines so that the Carthaginian made his right wing reach up the hill, while the
                    Romans rested their left wing on the town. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    <pb n="p.209"/> On the Roman side the first legion and right <hi rend="italics"
                        >ala,</hi> on <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C.
                        210</note> Hannibal's side the Spanish soldiers and Balearic slingers were
                    engaged; and the elephants also were driven into battle after the conflict had
                    begun. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> For a long time the battle hung in the
                    balance, not inclining in either direction. After they had prolonged the battle
                    from the third hour to nightfall and the front lines were exhausted by fighting,
                    the third legion relieved the first, the left <hi rend="italics">ala</hi>
                    relieved the right, and among the enemy fresh troops took over the battle from
                    the weary. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> A new battle and fierce suddenly
                    flamed out of a conflict now grown spiritless, for the combatants were now fresh
                    in spirit and in body. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> But night parted them
                    with victory undecided. On the next day the Romans stood in line from sunrise
                    until late in the day. When none of the enemy came out against them, they
                    gathered spoils at their leisure, carried corpses of their men into one place
                    and burned them. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> On the following night
                    Hannibal broke camp silently and marched away into Apulia. Marcellus, when day
                    disclosed the flight of the enemy, left the wounded at Numistro with a small
                    garrison, placed Lucius Furius Purpurio, a tribune of the soldiers, in command
                    of them, and made haste to follow on Hannibal's heels. <milestone n="11"

                    days, while charges were made by outposts, there were mixed cavalry and infantry
                    engagements, rather skirmishes than important battles, and nearly all of them
                    favourable to the Romans. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Thence the armies
                    were led through Apulia without any notable conflict, since Hannibal <pb

                    for ambuscades, while Marcellus did not follow except in broad daylight and

                    his time in selling the property of leading men, in leasing lands that had been

                        who normally had that task; cf. xi. 8. </note> — and he leased them all in
                    return for grain —a fresh crime fomented in secret was brought to light by
                    informers, that he might not lack occasion for harsh treatment of the Capuans.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The soldiers had been removed from
                    dwellings, in order that houses in the city might be leased together with the
                    land, and because Flaccus at the same time feared that the great charms of the
                    city might weaken his army also, as they had Hannibal's. Accordingly he had
                    compelled them to build their own shelters soldier-fashion at the gates and
                    along the walls. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Furthermore most of these
                    were made of wickerwork and planks, others of reeds interwoven, all of them
                    thatched with straw, as though these materials were deliberately intended to
                    feed the flames. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> A hundred and seventy

                    closed by order of the proconsul. The soldiers having rushed to arms at a given

                    have passed over in silence, had not his reputation changed from bad to good.
                    Because of his irresponsible and dissipated youth Gaius Flaccus, who was odious
                    to his own brother, Lucius Flaccus, and other relatives on account of the same
                    vices, had been seized upon as flamen by Publius Licinius, pontifex maximus.

                    character that no one among all the young men stood higher in the estimation and
                    approval of the leading <pb n="p.237"/> senators, both of his own family and of

                    raised to a well-founded self-confidence, and claimed what had been in abeyance
                    for many years owing to the unworthiness of former flamens, namely, that he
                    should be admitted to the senate. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> When he had
                    entered the Senate House, and the praetor, Publius Licinius, had escorted him
                    out of it, he appealed to the tribunes of the plebs. The flamen insistently
                    claimed an ancient right of his priesthood, saying it had been granted to that
                    office of flamen along with the <hi rend="italics">toga praetexta</hi> and the

                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The praetor maintained that a right was based,
                    not upon outmoded instances from the annals, but in each case upon very recent
                    practice; and that within the memory neither of their fathers nor grandfathers
                    had any flamen of Jupiter exercised that right. <milestone n="10" unit="section"
                    /> The tribunes expressed the opinion that obsolescence due to the indolence of
                    flamens was justly accounted their own loss, not a loss to the priestly office.
                    Whereupon, without opposition even from the praetor himself, and with the
                    general approval of the senators and of the commons, the tribunes led the flamen

                    abundance of pasture in the fields, and encountered Hannibal near Canusium. The
                    Carthaginian was tempting the men of Canusium to revolt; but on hearing of the

                    It was an open country, with no concealment for ambuscades; accordingly he began

                    Marcellus kept at his heels and would place camp close to camp, and after
                    completing his fortifications, he would at once lead his legions out into
                    battle-line. Hannibal by his cavalry in single troops and by spearmen on foot
                    kept bringing on slight engagements, but <pb n="p.257"/> thought the risk of a

                    which he was trying to avoid. When the enemy had gone ahead by night, Marcellus
                    overtook him in level and open country. Then as Hannibal was pitching camp, the
                    Roman by fighting on all sides against the men engaged in fortifying prevented
                    them from doing so. Thus standards faced standards and it was a battle with all

                    into line at daybreak. And Hannibal did not refuse battle, after he had exhorted

                    crush the over-confidence of the enemy, who was pressing them, Hannibal said,
                    and threatening them, not allowing them to march undisturbed, nor to pitch their

                    the brutes massed together were causing confusion and bade them hurl their
                    javelins against them. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> All the weapons stuck
                    fast, for it was not difficult to hit bodies of such size from a short distance
                    and now packed in a dense mass. But although not all were wounded, still those
                    in whose backs the javelins remained well fixed —so undependable is the species
                    —took to flight and even made the uninjured wheel about. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> Then no longer did a single maniple hurl its javelins, but
                    every soldier for himself, provided he was able to catch up with the column of
                    the fleeing elephants. All the more did the brutes dash among their own men and
                    cause a greater slaughter than they had done among the enemy, in proportion as
                    the frightened beast is urged on more fiercely by terror than when under the
                    control of a driver on its back. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Into the
                    line thrown into confusion by the brutes dashing through it the Roman infantry
                    carried their standards and with no great struggle they made the scattered and

                    Marcellus sent his cavalry against them, and pursuit did not end until in alarm
                    they were driven into their camp. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> For in
                    addition to the other causes of terror and consternation, two elephants had
                    fallen in the very gate, <pb n="p.267"/> and the soldiers were forced to dash

                    five elephants. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> And for the Romans also it
                    was not a bloodless victory. About one thousand seven hundred from the two
                    legions, and of the allies more than one thousand three hundred, were killed;
                    wounded were a large number of citizens and allies. <milestone n="15"

                    their practice in scaling walls and to their persistence, they were the first to
                    reach the top. As soon as they had taken some level ground where they could get

                    left open even for flight; for both on the right and on the left Roman outposts
                    had blocked the roads, and the gate of the camp was obstructed by the flight of
                    the general and chief officers, while in addition there was the panic of the
                    elephants, of which, when terrified, they were as much afraid as of the enemy.
                    Accordingly about eight thousand men were slain. </p>

                    the Sallentini. The rest of the assignments were distributed as follows: for the

                    Publius Scipio and Marcus Silanus were decreed for one year their own provinces

                    was owing to the report that at Carthage there were great naval preparations
                    that year, and that with two hundred ships the Carthaginians would cover the

                    escorted to Rome. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Upon Varro's arrival
                    Hostilius at once ordered the one legion which was encamped before the city to
                    advance into the city, and he posted his forces in suitable positions. Then,
                    summoning the senate to the forum, he demanded hostages of them. When the senate
                    asked for two days to consider, he ordered that they themselves furnish them
                    forthwith, or else on the next day, he declared, he would take all the children

                    that no one might leave the city in the night. This was done slowly and with
                    carelessness. Seven leading members of the senate, before guards could be posted
                    at the gates, escaped before nightfall with their children. Next day at dawn
                    they were missed when the senators began to be summoned to the forum, and their

                    handed over to Gaius Terentius Varro to be escorted to Rome. Varro in the senate
                    represented everything as causing more apprehension than before. <milestone

                    imminent, Gaius Terentius himself was ordered to lead a single legion, one or
                    the other of the city legions, to Arretium and to keep that legion as the
                    garrison of the town. As for Gaius Hostilius, it was decided that with the rest
                    of the army he should scour the whole province and see to it that no opportunity

                    provided other keys for all the gates, and took great pains to have everything
                    under his own control. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> He very earnestly

                    Marcellus was detained by religious scruples one after another, as they were

                    returned from the land of the Bruttii into Apulia, and the consuls established
                    themselves between Venusia and Bantia in two camps less than three miles apart.
                    Hannibal also, now that the war had been diverted from Locri, returned into the
                    same region. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> There both consuls, who were by
                    nature high-spirited, went out into battle-line almost daily, with no uncertain
                    hope that, if the enemy should risk a battle with two united consular armies,
                    the war could be finished. </p>
                <p> XXVI. Hannibal, since in his two encounters with Marcellus in the previous year
                    he had been both victor and vanquished, believed indeed that, if he should have
                    to fight with the same general, he would find neither hope nor fear unfounded;
                    nevertheless he believed that he would be by no means a match for the two
                    consuls. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Accordingly, devoting himself
                    exclusively to his own arts, he was in search of a place for an ambush. Slight
                    engagements, however, were taking place in the space between the two camps with
                    varying results. The consuls, believing that the whole summer could be spent in
                    that way, and yet thinking it possible to besiege Locri, wrote to Lucius Cincius
                    to cross over from Sicily with his fleet to Locri. And, to make an attack upon
                    the walls possible from the landward side also, they ordered that a part of the
                    force which was serving as a garrison <pb n="p.317"/> should be brought from
                    Tarentum to Locri. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C.

                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Hannibal, being informed by some men of Thurii
                    that this was about to be done, sent men to lie in wait along the road from
                    Tarentum. There, beneath the hill of Petelia, <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified"> The town crowned a hill 1,100 feet high, and could be

                    were slain, about fifteen hundred taken alive. <milestone n="10" unit="section"

                    than to a camp. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> And so, sending by night a
                    number of squadrons of the Numidians for that purpose, he had concealed them in
                    the middle of the wood. And during the day none of them would stir from his
                    post, for fear lest either their arms or the men themselves should be seen from

                    there was a general outcry that the hill must be occupied and defended by a

                    result, but in case they might be able to capture any men who, in wandering
                    about in search of fodder or firewood, had gone too far from camp, gave the
                    signal to spring up, all of them at the same time, from their different

                    depression that they neither could make their way up on to the ridge occupied by

                    themselves taking part in the fight. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> But after
                    they saw both consuls wounded, Marcellus even pierced by a lance and slipping

                    —fled with Crispinus, the consul, who had been struck by two javelins, and

                    also because it was neither consistent with his age —for he was now more than

                    unobserved. And they posted men of the town along the walls and at favourable

                    with more than usual care. Around the gate by which they thought the enemy would
                    come they drew up the best men in the garrison. Hannibal approached the city
                    about the fourth watch. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> At the head of the

                    about six hundred had entered and the rope by which it was held up had been let
                    go, the portcullis fell with a great crash. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    Some of the Salapians attacked the deserters, who fresh from their march were

                    Hannibal, having been ensnared by his own ruse, went away; and he set out to

                    first it was a doubtful conflict, rather because his action had been unexpected

                    when the Numidians came up, such terror was inspired among the Romans that they

                    between them charges starting from outposts brought on engagements not important
                    enough to be mentioned. It was evident that the Roman general's only object was
                    not to allow the enemy to get away. But Hannibal in his eagerness to make his
                    way out of the place would go down into battle-line with all his forces.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Then the consul, using the enemy's talent,
                    all the more readily that on such exposed hills ambuscades could not be feared,
                    commanded five cohorts, with five maniples in addition, to cross over the ridge
                    in the night, and to post themselves on the farther side of the hills.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> As to the time for them to rise from
                    ambush and attack the enemy he instructed Tiberius Claudius Asellus, tribune of
                    the soldiers, and Publius Claudius, prefect of the allies, officers whom he was
                    sending with them. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> At daybreak he himself led
                    out all his forces, infantry and cavalry, into battle-line. A little later the
                    signal for battle was set up by Hannibal also, and a shout was raised in the
                    camp as the men rushed in all directions to get their arms. Then cavalry and
                    infantry in rivalry dashed out of the gates and, scattering over the plain, made
                    haste to reach the enemy. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> On seeing their
                    disorder, the consul ordered Gaius Aurunculeius, tribune of the soldiers of the
                    third legion, to send out the cavalry of the legion with all possible momentum
                    against the enemy, saying that they had scattered so <milestone n="10??"
                        unit="section"/> widely, like sheep, in disorder over the whole plain that

                    caused by the cavalry. Of the Roman infantry also the first legion and the right

                    The battle was enlarged by the reserves and increased by the numbers of men
                    rushing into the fray. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> And while his men were
                    actually fighting, in spite of the uproar and the panic, Hannibal would have
                    drawn them up —a thing not easy except in a veteran army and for a veteran

                    shouting cohorts and maniples, as they dashed down the hillsides, had not

                    panic-stricken and flight began on all sides. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    And the slaughter was less only because the nearness of the camp shortened
                    flight for the routed. For the cavalry clung close to their rear; on the flank
                    the cohorts, charging down the slope of the hills by an open, easy road, had
                    attacked them. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> However, more than eight
                    thousand men were slain, more than seven hundred captured; nine military

                    to show themselves on the earthwork and at the gates; and he pushed on toward

                    quite safe, he ordered an advance into the camp. And after lingering there only
                    long enough for the soldiers to scatter for plunder, he then sounded the recall,

                    Accordingly, as he was now approaching, Nero came to a halt under cover of the

                    camp adjoined that of the consuls, and before their arrival he had baffled the
                    enemy by all the arts of war, leading his army on high ground, while at one time
                    he would occupy a narrow pass, to block their way, at another would make sudden

                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The opinions of many inclined in the
                    direction of postponing the time for battle, until Nero should refresh his
                    troops, worn by the march and lack of sleep, and at the same time should take a
                    few days to acquaint himself with the enemy. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    But Nero began not merely to urge, but by all means also to implore them not to
                    make his plan, which rapid movement had made safe, a reckless plan by delaying.
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> It was by a deception which would not last
                    long, he said, that Hannibal, as though dazed, was not attacking his camp, left
                    without its commander, and had not set his army in motion to pursue him; that
                    before Hannibal should bestir himself, they could destroy Hasdrubal's army and
                    return to Apulia. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Whoever by delaying gave
                    the enemy time, was betraying the distant camp to Hannibal, at the same time
                    opening the way into Gaul, so that unmolested he might join Hasdrubal whenever
                    he pleased. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> At once, he said, the signal must
                    be given and they must go out into battle-line and take advantage of the

                    one army was unaware that it had to do with smaller numbers, and the other that

                    the camp. Delay in beginning the battle was due to Hasdrubal, in that, riding
                    out in front of the standards with a few horsemen, he observed among the enemy
                    old shields which he had not seen before and very lean horses; and he thought
                    the numbers also larger than was usual. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> For,
                    suspecting what had happened, he promptly sounded the recall and sent men to the
                    river from which the Romans were drawing water, that some Romans might be
                    captured there and scanned to see whether any chanced to be more sunburned, as
                    though from a recent march. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> At the same time
                    he ordered men to ride round the camps at a distance, and to notice whether the
                    earthworks had been somewhere enlarged, and to mark whether the trumpet sounded
                    once in the camp or twice. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Cf.

                    that the camps had not been enlarged deceived him. There were two of them, as
                    there had been before the coming of the second consul, one that of Marcus
                    Livius, the other that of Lucius Porcius. In neither case had anything been
                    added to the fortifications to give ampler space for the tents. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> The one thing that impressed an experienced general and one
                    accustomed to a Roman enemy was their report that the trumpet had sounded once
                    in the praetor's camp, twice in the consul's. There surely were two consuls, he
                    thought, and sadly concerned he was how the one had got away from Hannibal.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Least of all could he suspect the
                    fact-that Hannibal had been baffled and baulked to such an extent that he did
                    not know where was the <pb n="p.397"/> general, where was the army with which

                    was formerly in contact. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Surely he had been
                    deterred by no common disaster, and had not dared to pursue. Hasdrubal greatly
                    feared that after all was lost he had himself come too late to assist, and that
                    the Romans would have the same good fortune in Italy as in Spain. <milestone
                        n="8" unit="section"/> At times he believed his own letter had not reached
                    Hannibal, and that the consul, upon intercepting it, had made haste, in order to
                    overpower him. Troubled by these anxieties, he had the fires put out and orders
                    given at the first watch that they should pack up their baggage in silence, and
                    then he commanded the standards to advance. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> In
                    the excitement and confusion of the night the guides were not closely watched,
                    and one of them settled himself in a hiding-place he had previously determined
                    upon, while the other swam across the river Metaurus, using a shallow place
                    known to him. So the column, deserted by its guides, wandered at first about the
                    country, and a considerable number, overcome by drowsiness and lack of sleep,
                    threw themselves down anywhere and left few men with the standards. <milestone
                        n="10" unit="section"/> Hasdrubal ordered the standard-bearers to move along
                    the bank of the river, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> The right
                        (south) bank must be meant. Had Hasdrubal been on the left bank the
                        treachery of his guides would have been of no consequence. For he would
                        simply have followed the Flaminian Way. Livy represents them as vainly
                        seeking for a road; therefore they were on the south side of the Metaurus.
