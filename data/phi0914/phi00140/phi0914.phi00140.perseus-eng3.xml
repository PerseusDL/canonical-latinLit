                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> At the beginning of the following year the
                        consuls and praetors balloted for their provinces. Liguria was the only
                        consular province and was assigned to both consuls. <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> The result of the ballot gave the civic jurisdiction to
                        M. Ogulnius Gallus, the alien jurisdiction to M. Valerius, Hither Spain to
                        Q. Fulvius Flaccus, Further Spain to P. Manlius, Sicily to L. Caecilius
                        Denter, and Sardinia to C. Terentius Istra. <milestone n="3" unit="section"
                        /> The consuls received instructions to levy troops. Q. Fabius had written
                        from Liguria to say that the Apuani were contemplating a renewal of
                        hostilities and there was danger of their making an irruption into the
                        territory of Pisae. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> In the Spanish
                        provinces too there was trouble: the senate knew that Hither Spain was in
                        arms and that fighting was going on with the Celtiberi; in Further Spain,
                        owing to the long-continued illness of the praetor, military discipline was
                        relaxed by luxury and idleness. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Under
                        these circumstances they decided that fresh armies should be raised: four
                        legions for Liguria each numbering 5200 infantry and 200 cavalry, with the
                        addition of 15,000 infantry and 800 cavalry drawn from the Latin allies.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> These were to form the two consular
                        armies. The consuls were further instructed to call up 7000 infantry and 400
                        cavalry as an allied contingent and despatch them to M. Marcellus, whose
                        command in Gaul had been extended at the close of his consulship. <milestone
                            n="7" unit="section"/> For the two Spanish provinces a force of 4000
                        Roman infantry and 200 cavalry, together with 7000 infantry and 300 cavalry
                        from the Latin allies, was to be raised. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                        Q. Fabius Labeo had his command in Liguria extended, and he was to retain
                        the army which he had. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The spring of that year was a stormy one.
                        On the eve of the Parilia, about the middle of the day a terrible storm of
                        wind and rain burst and wrecked many sacred and ordinary buildings.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> It blew down the bronze statues on the
                        Capitol, it carried off the door from the temple of Luna on the Aventine and
                        dashed it against the walls behind the temple of Ceres. Other statues were
                        overturned in the Circus Maximus together with their pedestals. <milestone
                            n="3" unit="section"/> Several sculptures were broken off from the roofs
                        of the temples and ruthlessly shattered. This storm was in consequence
                        regarded as a portent, and the augurs were bidden to direct the necessary
                        expiation for it. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> A further expiation was
                        demanded in consequence of intelligence brought to Rome of the birth of a
                        mule at Reate with only three feet, and a report from Formiae that the
                        temple of Apollo at Caieta had been struck by lightning. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> In consequence of these portents twenty full-grown
                        victims were sacrificed and special intercessions offered for one day. From
                        a despatch sent by A. Terentius it was ascertained that P. Sempronius, after
                        more than a year's illness, had died in Further Spain. The praetors were
                        ordered to start for Spain as soon as possible. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> Legations from overseas were admitted to an audience of
                        the senate. First came those from Eumenes, Pharnaces and the Rhodians. The
                        latter complained of the disaster which had overtaken Sinope. <milestone
                            n="7" unit="section"/> Envoys from Philip and from the Achaeans and
                        Lacedaemonians went to Rome at the same time. After hearing Marcius, who had
                        been sent to ascertain the state of affairs in Greece and Macedonia, the
                        senate gave their reply. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The two
                        sovereigns and the Rhodians were informed that the senate would send a
                        commission to look into those matters. </p>

                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="3" type="chapter">
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Marcius had increased the senate's
                        apprehensions about Philip. He admitted that Philip had carried out the
                        measures insisted upon by the senate, but in such a way that he would
                        obviously continue to do so no longer than he was compelled. <milestone
                            n="2" unit="section"/> There was little doubt that he would recommence
                        war, and all his words and actions pointed in that direction. <milestone
                            n="3" unit="section"/> He transferred almost the entire population from
                        the maritime cities to the district now called Emathia, formerly known as
                        Paeonia, and had handed over those cities to the Thracians and other
                            <milestone n="4??" unit="section"/> barbarians for their residence,
                        thinking that these races could be more safely depended upon in case of a
                        war with Rome. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> This action called forth
                        loud protests throughout Macedonia; few of those who with their wives and
                        children were abandoning their homes bore their grief in silence. Everywhere
                        amongst the crowds of emigrants were heard curses on the king; their anger
                        got the better of their fears. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Furious at
                        all this, Philip began to suspect all persons, places and seasons alike, and
                        at last openly avowed that he could only be secure <milestone n="7??"
                            unit="section"/> when he had the children of those whom he had put to
                        death arrested and in safe keeping. Then he could put them out of the way
                        from time to time. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> This brutality, hideous as it was, was
                        rendered still more so by the sufferings of one particular family.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Herodicus, a leading man in Thessaly,
                        had been put to death by Philip many years ago; afterwards he put his
                        sons-in-law to death and his two widowed daughters, Theoxena and Archo, were
                        left each with one little son. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Theoxena
                        had several offers of marriage but declined them all. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> Archo married a man called Poris who held quite the
                        first place among the Aenianes. She bore him several children but died
                        whilst they were still small. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> In order
                        that her sister's children might be brought up under her own care, Theoxena
                        married Poris and took as much care of her sister's sons as she did of her
                        own. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> When she heard of the king's edict
                        about arresting the children of those whom he had put to death, she felt
                        sure that the boys would fall victims to the king's lust and even to the
                        passions of his guards. She formed a terrible design and dared to say that
                        she would rather kill them with her own hand than let them fall into
                        Philip's power. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Poris was horrified at the
                        mere mention of such a deed, and said that he would send <milestone n="8??"
                            unit="section"/> them away to some trustworthy friends in Athens and
                        that he would accompany them in their flight. They went from Thessalonica to
                        Aenia. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> A festival was being held there at
                        the time, which was celebrated with great pomp every four years in honour of
                        Aeneas, the founder of the city. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> After
                        spending the day in the customary feasting they waited till the third watch,
                        when all were asleep, and went on board a ship which Poris had in readiness,
                        ostensibly to return to Thessalonica, but really to sail across to Euboea.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> While, however, they were vainly
                        trying to make headway against a contrary wind, they were surprised by
                        daylight not far from land, and the king's troops who were on guard at the
                        harbour sent an armed boat to seize the ship, with strict orders not to
                        return without her. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Poris, meanwhile, was
                        doing his utmost to urge on the rowers and sailors, lifting up his hands
                        from time to time to heaven and imploring the gods to help him. His wife, a
                        woman of indomitable spirit, fell back on the purpose she had long ago
                        formed, and mixing some poison, placed the cup where it could be seen,

                        flames of hatred against the king. Curses were everywhere heaped upon him
                        and upon his children, and the dire imprecations soon reached the ears of

                        with the mass of his nation and in favour with the Romans, and he felt that
                        no hope remained to him of winning the crown except through the perpetration
                        of a crime, and to its accomplishment he now devoted all his thoughts.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He did not think himself strong enough
                        to carry out the purpose which he was hatching in his weak and unmanly mind,
                        and he began to sound his father's friends one by one, dropping dark and
                        dubious hints in his talks with them. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Some
                        of them made it appear at first as though they rejected anything of the

                        Perseus encouraged and Demetrius did his utmost to check, became more
                        pronounced every day, they foresaw the ruin of the youth who was taking no
                        precautions against his brother's intrigues. So they at last decided to help
                        on what must inevitably happen and advance the hopes of the stronger by
                        taking the side of Perseus. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> They left
                        other measures to be carried out at a fitting time, for the present they
                        determined to use all their endeavours to inflame the king against the
                        Romans and induce him to expedite the warlike plans which he was already
                        contemplating. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> To aggravate the suspicions
                        against Demetrius, they used to bring up the subject of the Romans in their
                        conversations with him. Some would run down their national character and
                        institutions, others spoke lightly of their military achievements, others
                        scoffed at the appearance of the City, its lack of adornment in both public
                        and private buildings, whilst others, again, spoke contemptuously of
                        different public men. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The young man,
                        thrown off his guard by his devotion to the name of Rome and his opposition
                        to his brother, defended them in every way, and thus made himself an object
                        of suspicion to his father and laid himself open to charges of disloyalty.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The result was that his father
                        excluded him from all consultations on matters relating to Rome and took
                        Perseus entirely into his confidence, discussing these subjects with him day
                        and night. </p>

                        give his sister in marriage to Philip's son, and the king was quite elated
                        at the prospect of an alliance with that nation. Perseus, on this, said to
                        him, "What advantage is there in that? <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                        Little protection will there be in foreign support, compared with the danger

                        distempered mind of the old king was made still more uneasy by these words,
                            <milestone n="14??" unit="section"/> which he took more seriously than

                        placed on the right side of the road and the hinder part with the entrails

                        their father; Perseus was now thirty years old and Demetrius five years his
                        junior, the former in the prime of manhood, the latter in the flower of
                        youth. The father would have been fortunate in his maturer offspring if only
                        he had been wise and sensible. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> When the
                        purificatory rite was completed it was the custom for the army to go through
                        maneuvers and after being formed into two divisions to engage in a
                        sham-fight. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The two princes were appointed
                        to command in this mimic contest, but there was no make-believe about the
                        fighting, it looked like a struggle for the crown, so fiercely did they
                        engage. Many wounds were caused by their staves and nothing was wanting but
                        swords to give the actual appearance of war. <milestone n="7" unit="section"

                        was intensely annoyed, but his wiser friends were delighted. That
                        circumstance in itself, they said, would afford grounds for incriminating
                        the young man. </p>

                            unit="section"/> The lavish hospitality, as befitted the festal day, and
                        the high spirits of youth led both parties to drink freely. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> Then they began to talk about the battle and jokes were
                        made at the expense of their opponents, not even their leaders being exempt.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> A spy was sent from Perseus' party to
                        listen to this conversation, but as he behaved somewhat incautiously he was
                        caught by some youths who happened to be leaving the banquet-room and
                        soundly cudgelled. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Demetrius knew nothing
                        of this and he asked his companions, "If my brother is still in an angry
                        mood after the battle, why should we not go to him as boon companions and

                        were afraid of prompt retaliation for thrashing the spy, called out that
                        they would go. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Demetrius made those also
                        go with him, and they concealed swords under their garments to defend
                        themselves in case of attack. Nothing could possibly be kept secret in this
                        family quarrel, both their houses were full of spies and traitors.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> An informer ran to Perseus and told
                        him that four young men who were wearing concealed swords were coming with
                        Demetrius. Although he must have known the reason, for he had heard that one

                        was under the influence of wine, and finding himself shut out protested

                        commands at the same time. P. Manlius went to Further Spain, which he had
                        administered in his former praetorship; Q. Fulvius Flaccus proceeded to
                        Hither Spain and took over the army from A. Terentius, for owing to the
                        death of P. Sempronius, Further Spain had been without a magistrate.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Whilst Fulvius Flaccus was besieging a
                        Spanish town called Urbicua he was attacked by the Celtiberians. Many fierce
                        actions took place, and there were severe losses in killed and wounded
                        amongst the Romans. No display of force could draw Fulvius away from the
                        siege, and his perseverance finally conquered. <milestone n="9"

                        the city, now that assistance was withdrawn, was taken in a few days and
                        sacked. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The praetor gave the booty to the
                        soldiers. Beyond this capture Fulvius did nothing worth recording, nor did

                        was the record of that summer in Spain. Terentius, after giving up his
                        command there, entered the City in ovation. He brought home 9320 pounds of
                        silver, 82 pounds of gold and seven golden crowns weighing 60 pounds. </p>

                        the country became more wooded and overgrown; <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> and one part of their route was so dark that, owing to
                        the density of the foliage and the interlacing of the branches, the sky was
                        hardly visible. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> As they approached the
                        crest, everything was veiled in cloud, an uncommon occurrence at great
                        altitudes, and so dense that they found marching as difficult as at night.
                        At last on the third day they reached the summit. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> After their descent they said nothing to contradict the
                        popular belief; more, I suspect, to prevent the futility of their march from
                        becoming a subject of ridicule than because the widely separated seas and
                        mountains and rivers could really be seen from one spot. They were all
                        distressed by the hardships of the march, the king most of all, owing to his
                        age. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> He raised two altars there to Jupiter
                        and the Sun, on which he offered sacrifices, and then commenced the descent,
                        which occupied two days, the ascent having taken three. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> He was afraid of the cold nights, which, though it was
                        the dog-days, were like the cold in winter. </p>

                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> After all the difficulties he had had to
                        contend against during those five days, he found things just as cheerless in
                        his camp, where they were destitute of everything. This was inevitable in a
                        district surrounded on all sides by uninhabited country. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> After one day in camp to rest the men whom he had taken
                        with him, he hastened into the Dentheletic country at a speed which
                        resembled a flight. This people were his allies, but owing to lack of food
                        the Macedonians plundered them as though they were on enemy soil. <milestone

                        devastated some of the villages, <milestone n="11??" unit="section"/> and it
                        was with feelings of deep shame that the king heard his allies making
                        fruitless appeals to the gods who watch over treaties and invoking his help
                        and protection. Carrying off a supply of corn he returned to Maedica and
                        made an attempt on a city called Petra. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                        He fixed his camp on a plain which extended to the city and sent Perseus
                        with a small force to approach the place from higher ground. <milestone

                        townsmen gave hostages and surrendered the place for the time being, but as

                        forgot all about the hostages, deserted their city and fled to their

                        Macedonia with his men worn out to no purpose by labours and hardships
                        innumerable, and with his mind filled with suspicions of his son through the

                        pretended to be indignant on his account, and offered, unsolicited, to
                        assist him in every way, and gave him his word of honour to be true to him.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> In this way he succeeded in eliciting
                        his secret thoughts. Demetrius was meditating flight to the Romans and hoped
                        to get away safely across Paeonia. That the governor of this province should

                        letter was sent to Philip while he was besieging Petra. On this, Heliodorus,
                        the leading man amongst the friends of Demetrius, was flung into prison and
                        orders were given to keep a secret watch on Demetrius. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> This more than anything else made the king's journey to
                        Macedonia a very melancholy one. This new charge disturbed him greatly, but
                        he felt that he ought to await the return of those who had been sent to find
                        out everything in Rome. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> For some months he
                        remained in suspense; at length his envoys returned after having settled
                        beforehand in Macedonia what report they should bring back from Rome.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> In addition to all their other
                        treachery, they handed to the king a forged letter sealed with a counterfeit

                        deprecated any harsh judgment of Demetrius, and stated that whatever
                        communication the young prince in his eagerness for the crown had had with
                        him, T. Quinctius, he was certain that he would do nothing to injure any of
                        his relatives, nor was the writer a man who could be thought to countenance
                        any unfilial conduct. This letter made Perseus' accusations appear more
                        credible. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Heliodorus was at once submitted

                        bribery of some who were to accompany him. The forged letter purporting to
                        come from T. Quinctius, he said, was the strongest proof of his guilt.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> No pronouncement was, however, made as
                        to the infliction of any severe punishment, the intention was rather that he
                        should be put to death secretly, not through any anxiety felt about him, but
                        that Philip's designs against the Romans might not be revealed by a public
                        sentence of death. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Philip was marching
                        from Thessalonica to Demetrias, and he sent Demetrius, still accompanied by
                        Didas, to Astraeum in Paeonia, and Perseus to Amphipolis, to receive the

                        was invited to the sacrificial banquet and went to Heraclea for the purpose.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> It is said that poison was given to

                        he perceived that most of them would lead to the break-up of the national

                        without, however, disturbing his friendly relations with the praetor. The

                        great slaughter among them. As many as 23,000 men were killed that day, and
                        4700 were made prisoners; 500 horses and 88 military standards were

                        a bloodless one. Out of the two legions rather more than 200 Roman soldiers
                        fell, 830 out of the Latin allies, and 2400 out of the native auxiliaries.

                        on the part of the Celtiberi, but because they could not make their way over
                        the roads which were rendered impassable and the rivers which were flooded
                        by incessant rain. Despairing of any help from their countrymen, the

                        stopped they succeeded at last in crossing the rivers and arrived before
                        Contrebia. They saw no camp outside the walls, and concluding that it had
                        been transferred elsewhere, or else that the enemy had withdrawn, they
                        approached the town without taking precautions or keeping any proper

                        standards were also secured. The scattered fugitives made their way to their
                        homes, and meeting another body of Celtiberi who were going to Contrebia,
                        stopped them by informing them of the surrender of the place and of their

                        and not long after that of the consul C. Calpurnius, followed by those of
                        many distinguished men of all ranks, came to be regarded as a portent.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> C. Servilius, the Pontifex Maximus,
                        was instructed to search in the pontifical rolls for the method of appeasing
                        the wrath of the gods, and the Keepers of the Sacred Books were to examine
                        their Sibylline Books. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The consul was
                        ordered to vow and offer gilded statues to Apollo, Aesculapius and Salus.
                        The Keepers of the Sacred Books proclaimed special intercessions for two
                        days in the City, and in all market-towns and places of public resort.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> All who were above twelve years of age
                        took part in the intercessions, wearing wreaths of bay and carrying branches
                        of it in their hands. Men began to suspect that this was the work of
                        criminals, and the senate ordered investigations to be made into some cases
                        of alleged poisoning. C. Claudius was charged with this enquiry in the City
                        and within a radius of ten miles from it; C. Maenius was to undertake it in
                        the market-towns and places of public resort outside that limit, before he
                        sailed for his province of Sardinia. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The
                        death of the consul aroused the strongest suspicion. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> He is said to have been murdered by his wife, Quarta
                        Hostilia. When her son Q. Fulvius Flaccus was declared consul in place of
                        his step-father, the death of Piso aroused much greater misgivings.
                        Witnesses came forward who asserted that after Albinus and Piso had been
                        declared consuls, Flaccus having been defeated in the election was
                        reproached by his mother for having failed three times in his candidature
                        for the consulship, and she went on to say that she was getting ready to
                        canvass and would manage in less than two months to have him made consul.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Amongst much other evidence bearing on
                        the case this utterance of hers, which was only too truly confirmed by what
                        followed, did most to secure her condemnation. <milestone n="8"

                        enrolment of fresh troops and matters were still further delayed by the
                        death of one of them, and the holding of an election to choose his
                        successor, P. Cornelius and M. Baebius, who during their consulship

                        that war would begin before the arrival of the new consuls, were taken
                        wholly by surprise, and after a crushing defeat surrendered <milestone

                        senate by letter, Cornelius and Baebius decided to remove them from their
                        mountains into some open and level country far from their homes, so that
                        there could be no hope of return; for they did not see any other end of the
                        Ligurian wars. There was some land in Samnium, forming part of the State
                        domain, which had belonged to Taurania. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                        The consuls wished to settle the Ligurians in this district, and they issued
                        an order for them to come down from Anidus and their mountain homes with
                        their wives and children and take all their property with them. <milestone
                            n="4" unit="section"/> The Ligurians made frequent appeals through their
                        envoys, begging that they might not be compelled to abandon their household
                        gods, the homes in which they <milestone n="5??" unit="section"/> had been
                        born and the burial-places of their forefathers, and promising to surrender
                        their arms and give hostages. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> When they
                        found all their appeals fruitless, and knew that they were not strong enough
                        for war, they obeyed the consuls' edict. As many as 40,000 freemen with
                        their wives and children were transported at the expense of the government;
                        150,000 silver denarii were allowed them to procure necessaries for their
                        new homes. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Cornelius and Baebius were also
                        authorised to distribute and assign the land; they asked, however, that five
                        assessors might be appointed to assist them, and the senate appointed them.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> After finishing this business they
                        brought their army of veterans to Rome, and the senate decreed a triumph for
                        them. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> These men were the very first to
                        enjoy a triumph without having been engaged in a war. Only victims for
                        sacrifice were led before the chariot; there were no prisoners, no spoils,
                        nothing to distribute amongst the soldiers. </p>

                        reaching Spain, Fulvius Flaccus led out his army from winter quarters and
                        began to devastate the more distant parts of Celtiberia, where the

                        By this action he irritated the natives more than he intimidated them, and
                        secretly collecting a force they beset the Manlian Pass, through which they
                        were tolerably certain that the Romans would march. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> Gracchus had instructed his colleague, L. Postumius
                        Albinus, who was on his way to Further Spain, to inform Q. Fulvius that he
                        was to bring his army to Tarraco, where he intended to disband the old
                        soldiers, incorporate the reinforcements into the various corps and
                        reorganise the whole army. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Fulvius was
                        also informed of the date of his successor's arrival which was close at
                        hand. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> This information compelled Flaccus
                        to abandon his projected operations and withdraw his army hastily from
                        Celtiberia. The barbarians, ignorant of the true reason, and imagining that
                        he had become aware of their rising and secret gathering in arms and was
                        afraid of them, invested the pass all the more closely. When the Roman
                        column entered the pass, the enemy rushed down upon it from both sides.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> As soon as Flaccus saw this, he
                        allayed the first symptoms of tumult in the column by giving the order
                        through the centurions for every <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/> man to
                        stand where he was and get his weapons ready. <milestone n="8"

                        place, and partly by his own exertions, partly through his officers, he got
                        the whole force into such fighting order as the time and place required.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> He reminded his men that they had to
                        deal with those who had twice made their submission and who were impelled by
                        treachery, not by true courage. His soldiers, he told them, would have
                        returned home without distinguishing themselves; the enemy had given them
                        the chance of a glorious and memorable homecoming. They would carry in
                        triumph through Rome swords reddened with the slaughter of their foes and

                        auxiliaries confronted by men similarly armed, but somewhat better fighters,
                        could not hold their ground. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> When the

                        in wedge-formation, a maneuver which gives them such weight that in whatever

                        were now thrown into disorder and the Roman line was all but broken.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Fulvius, seeing this, galloped up to
                        the legionary cavalry and shouted: "Unless you can come to the rescue it
                        will be all over with this army." "Say," they shouted in reply, "what you
                        want done, we shall not be slack in carrying out your orders." <milestone
                            n="5" unit="section"/> He replied: "Close up your squadrons, cavalry of

                        our men. Your charge will have all the greater force if you make it on
                        unbitted horses." <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> (We have heard that
                        Roman cavalry have often done that and covered themselves with glory.)
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> They removed the horses' bits and
                        charged the wedge in both directions, first forward and then back again,
                        inflicting great slaughter upon the enemy and shivering all their spears.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> When the wedge on which all their
                        hopes rested was broken up, the Celtiberi so completely lost heart that they
                        gave up almost any attempt at fighting and began to look about for means of
                        escape. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> When the auxiliary cavalry saw the

                        proved decisive; the Celtiberi fled precipitately in all directions, and the
                        Roman commander, watching them as they turned their backs, vowed a temple to
                        Fortuna Equestris and the celebration of solemn Games to Jupiter Optimus

                        standards and nearly 600 horses. The victorious army remained encamped in
                        the pass. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> The victory was not without
                        loss; 472 Roman soldiers, 1019 soldiers of the allies and 3000 native
                        auxiliaries perished on the field. With its former glory thus renewed the

                        Tiberius Sempronius, who had landed two days before, went to meet Fulvius
                        and congratulated him upon his successful conduct of affairs. They were
                        quite at one as to which soldiers they should release and which retain.
                        After releasing the time-expired men from their military oath, Fulvius

                        Neapolis. From there they were transported to Samnium, and land was assigned

                        consul laid the matter before the senate, and they passed a resolution that
                        M. Fulvius should be relegated to a part of Spain beyond New Carthage, and a
                        letter was handed to him by the consul to be given to P. Manlius in Further

                        goods. In consequence of their disgraceful conduct, it was decreed that this

                        dedication of Queen Juno and Diana, which he had vowed eight years
                        previously, during the Ligurian war. A sum of 20,000 ases was granted.

                        the Macedonians died, worn out with old age and grief at the death of his
                        son. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He passed the winter at Demetrias,
                        full of poignant regret at the death of his son and of remorse for his own
                        cruelty. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> His feelings were still further
                        embittered by the conduct of his other son, who, in his own opinion and in
                        that of others, was undoubtedly king, for all eyes were turned towards him,
                        and also by the desertion of his friends in his old age, some waiting for
                        his death, others not even waiting for it. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                        This was a greater source of anxiety to him as it was to Antigonus the son
                        of Echecrates, who bore the name of his paternal uncle, Antigonus. The uncle
                        had been Philip's guardian, a man of kingly dignity, distinguished, too, for
                        his conduct in the famous battle against Cleomenes the Lacedaemonian.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> This man's nephew, Antigonus, out of
                        all those whom Philip had honoured with his friendship, alone remained
                        uncorrupted, and this loyalty made Perseus, who had never been friendly to
                        him, his bitterest enemy. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> He foresaw the
                        danger in which he would be involved by the heritage of the crown descending
                        to Perseus, and as <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/> soon as he saw the
                        king's feelings changing, and heard him deploring the loss of his son, he
                        used sometimes to be a silent listener; at others he would lead the king to
                        speak of the incident as unpremeditated, and in this way often showed active
                        sympathy with his grief. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> And as truth
                        usually gives signs of its presence, so it was here, and he followed up the
                        traces to the utmost of his power so that everything might be the sooner
                        brought to light. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Suspicion attached
                        mainly to Apelles and Philocles as the authors of the crime; they were the
                        men who had gone in the character of envoys to Rome, and had brought back
                        the letter forged in the name of Flamininus which had proved so fatal to
                        Demetrius. </p>

                        the letter was a forgery concocted by one of the secretaries and sealed with
                        a counterfeit seal. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Whilst, however, there
                        was as yet no clear evidence, only suspicion, Xychus happened to meet
                        Antigonus, who had him promptly arrested and conveyed to the palace.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Leaving him there under guard he went
                        in to Philip and said to the king: "I think I have understood from my many
                        conversations with you that you would value very highly the opportunity of
                        learning the whole truth about your sons, which of them was the victim of
                        the cunning and treachery of the other. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                        The one man in the whole world who can unravel the knot, namely Xychus, is
                        in your hands. I met him by chance and had him brought to the palace; order
                        him to be summoned." <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> When brought in he at
                        first denied everything, but with such hesitancy that a moderate appeal to
                        his fears would obviously make him a ready informer. The sight of the
                        executioner with his scourge was too much for him, and he explained in full
                        detail the villainy of the two envoys and the way he had acted as their
                        tool. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Men were at once despatched to
                        arrest them. Philocles was seized on the spot; Apelles, who had been in
                        pursuit of a certain Chaereas, on learning that Xychus was turned informer,
                        sailed for Italy. The fate of Philocles is not certain. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> According to some writers he, at first, stoutly denied;
                        afterwards, confronted with Xychus, he no longer held out. Others say that
                        even when put to the torture he still maintained his innocence. Philip's
                        grief and distress were awakened afresh. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                        He considered that the unhappiness caused by his children was made more
                        painful by the survival of the one than by the death of the other. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> On being informed that everything had been
                        disclosed, Perseus, whilst feeling himself strong enough to avoid the
                        necessity of flight, took care, nevertheless, to keep well out of the way,
                        and prepared to protect himself from the flames of his father's wrath, as
                        long as he was alive. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Philip, hopeless of
                        being able to inflict punishment on the person of his son, made it his aim
                        to prevent him, whilst escaping punishment, from enjoying the rewards of his
                        wickedness as well. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Accordingly he
                        summoned Antigonus, to whom he was under such obligations for the detection
                        of the fratricide, and who he thought, owing to the glory recently won by
                        his uncle, Antigonus, might be one whom the Macedonians would not be ashamed
                        of or disappointed in as their king. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                        "Antigonus," he began, "now that my condition is such that the childlessness
                        which other fathers regard as a curse I am compelled to regard as a thing to
                        be wished for, I have resolved to leave to you the kingdom which your
                        gallant uncle not only defended but augmented by his fidelity and
                        watchfulness. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> You are the only one I have
                        whom I judge worthy of the crown; if I had no one I would rather have my
                        kingdom perish and disappear than that Perseus should have it as the prize
                        of treachery and murder. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> I should feel
                        that Demetrius had been recalled from the tomb, if I could leave you to take
                        his place, you who have shed tears over the death of an innocent victim and
                        wept at my terrible mistake." </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> From this time he was continually
                        advancing him from one honour to another. Whilst Perseus was away in Thrace,
                        Philip made a progress through the cities of Macedonia, and recommended
                        Antigonus to their leading men, and had he lived longer he would undoubtedly
                        have left him in actual possession of the crown. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> Leaving Demetrias, he stopped for a considerable time
                        at Thessalonica. From there he travelled to Amphipolis, and here he became
                        seriously ill. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> But he was more sick in
                        mind than in body. He was a prey to gloomy fears and sleeplessness; again
                        and again the form and shade of his innocent murdered son threw him into
                        violent agitation. He died whilst invoking terrible curses on the other one.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Antigonus could, however, have been
                        warned, had he been at hand, or had the king's death been openly announced
                        in the palace. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Calligenes, the head
                        physician, did not anticipate it so soon. When the case became hopeless he
                        sent the news as had been mutually agreed, to Perseus by a relay of
                        messengers and concealed the fact from all outside the palace pending his

                        were unaware of what had happened and were not in the least expecting him.
                        He seized the throne which he had gained by crime. <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> The death of Philip occurred very opportunely as
                        regarded the postponement of hostilities and the concentration of the
                        resources for war. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> A few days later the
                        tribe of the Bastarnae, after repeated invitations, left their homes and
                        crossed the Hister with a large body of infantry and cavalry. Antigonus and
                        Cotto-a Bastarnian noble-went in advance to inform the king. Antigonus had
                        previously been sent with this same Cotto to induce the Bastarnae to move.
                        Not far from Amphipolis they heard a report, and soon afterwards were met by
                        messengers who announced the king's death. This completely upset their
                        plans. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> It had been settled that Philip
                        would afford the Bastarnae a safe passage through Thrace and supply them
                        with provisions. To ensure this he had bribed the chiefs in the districts to
                        be traversed and had pledged his word that the Bastarnae would pass through
                        peacefully. It was intended to exterminate the Dardani and to make a home
                        for the Bastarnae in their territory. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                        There was to be a double advantage in this; <milestone n="6" unit="section"
                        /> the Dardani, who had always been bitter enemies to Macedonia, and ready
                        to fall on her in times of misfortune, would be put out of the way, and the
                        Bastarnae could leave their wives and children in Dardania and be sent on to
                        devastate Italy. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The way to the Hadriatic
                        and to Italy lay through the Scordisci; that was the only practicable route
                        for an army, and the Scordisci were expected to grant a passage to the
                        Bastarnae without any difficulty, for neither in speech nor habits were they
                        dissimilar, and it was hoped that they would unite forces with them when
                        they saw that they were going to secure the plunder of a very wealthy
                        nation. Thus Philip's plans were adapted to either alternative. <milestone
                            n="8" unit="section"/> If the Bastarnae were defeated by the Romans, the
                        extermination of the Dardani, the plunder of what remained of the Bastarnae,
                        and the unchallenged possession of Dardania would be some consolation to
                        him; <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> if on the other hand they met with
                        success and the Romans were recalled to a war with the Bastarnae, he would

                        peaceable and orderly fashion. But after Cotto and Antigonus had left them
                        and the news of Philip's death arrived a few days later, the Thracians began
                        to make difficulties about providing a market. Unable to buy what they
                        needed, the Bastarnae could not be kept in their ranks nor prevented from
                        straggling. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> This led to acts of violence
                        on both sides, and as these became daily more aggressive, war broke out. In
                        the end the Thracians, finding themselves unable to withstand the numbers
                        and the fierceness of their assailants, left their villages in the plains
                        and retired to a mountain of immense height called Donuca. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> While the Bastarnae were preparing to follow them, a
                        storm similar to that which is said to have destroyed the Gauls while
                        plundering Delphi burst upon them as they were nearing the summit.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> They were overwhelmed by a deluge of
                        rain, followed by a heavy hailstorm accompanied with the crashing of thunder
                        peals and blinding flashes of lightning. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                        The lightning played everywhere round them; it seemed as though it were
                        aimed at the men; not only the common soldiers but their chiefs were struck
                        down. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> As they floundered and fell in blind
                        headlong flight amongst the beetling cliffs, they were closely pursued by
                        the Thracians; but they said to themselves that the gods were causing their
                        flight and the heavens were falling on them. <milestone n="7" unit="section"
                        /> Scattered by the storm like shipwrecked sailors, they at last reached
                        their camp, most having lost their arms, and then began to deliberate as to
                        what they were to do. Opinions were divided; some were for returning home,
                        others wanted to invade Dardania. About 30,000 men, led by Clondicus,
                        succeeded in reaching Dardania; the rest of the host retraced their steps
                        and made their way into the inland district of Apollonia. <milestone n="8"

                        Antigonus to be put to death. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Whilst he
                        was strengthening himself on the throne, he sent an embassy to Rome to renew
                        the friendship which had existed in his father's time and to request the
                        senate to recognise him as king. These were the events of the year in
                        Macedonia. </p>

                        Ligurians, but it was generally believed that this triumph was granted to
                        him more on personal grounds than because of the importance of his
                        victories. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He had a large amount of enemy
                        arms carried in the procession, but no considerable sum of money. <milestone
                            n="3" unit="section"/> However, he distributed 300 ases to each of the
                        legionaries, twice as much to each centurion, and three times as much to
                        each of the cavalry. The most striking thing about this triumph was that he
                        happened to celebrate it on the same day as his triumph the preceding year
                        after his praetorship. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Immediately after
                        his triumph he fixed the day for the elections. The new consuls were M.
                        Junius Brutus and A. Manlius Vulso. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Three
                        of the praetors had been elected when a storm interrupted the proceedings.
                        The next day the remaining three were elected, namely, M. Titinius Curvus,
                        Ti. Claudius Nero, and T. Fonteius Capitol The Roman Games were exhibited
                        afresh by the curule aediles Cnaeus Servilius Caepio and Appius Claudius
                        Cento in consequence of some portents which had occurred. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> There was an earthquake. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> Whilst a lectisternium was going on in the public
                        shrines the deities on their couches turned away their heads from the
                        offerings set before them, and the coverlet with the covers of the dishes
                        set before Jupiter fell from the table. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                        The olives were nibbled by mice before they were placed before the gods, and
                        this was regarded as a portent. Nothing beyond the repetition of the Games
                        was done in the way of expiating these portents. </p>
