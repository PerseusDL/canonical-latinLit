                    <p> Two magistrates were added, the praetorship and curule aedileship. A
                        pestilence rages in the city, which carries off the celebrated Furius
                        Camillus. Scenic representations first introduced. Curtius leaps on
                        horseback completely armed into a gulf in the forum. Titus Manlius, having
                        slain a Gaul in single combat, who challenged any of the Roman soldiers,
                        takes from him a golden chain, and hence gets the name of Torquatus. Two new
                        tribes are added, called the Pomptine and Publilian. Licinius Stolo is
                        condemned on a law which he himself had carried, for possessing more than
                        five hundred acres of land. Marcus Valerius, surnamed Corvinus, from having
                        with the aid of a crow killed a Gaul, who challenged him, is on the
                        following year elected consul, though but twenty-three years old. A treaty
                        of friendship made with the Carthaginians. The Campanians, overpowered by
                        the Samnites, surrender themselves to the Roman people, who declare war
                        against the Samnites. P. Decius Mus saves the Roman army, when brought into
                        very great danger by the consul A. Cornelius. Conspiracy and revolt of the
                        Roman soldiers in the garrison of Capua. They are brought to a sense of
                        duty, and restored to their country, by Marcus Valerius Corvus, dictator.
                        Successful operations against the Hernicians, Gauls, Tiburtians,
                        Privernians, Tarquinians, Samnites, and Volscians. </p>

                <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> THIS year will be remarkable for the
                    consulship of a man of mean birth, remarkable for two new magistracies, the
                    praetorship and curule aedileship. These honours the patricians claimed to
                    themselves, in consideration of one consulship having been conceded to the
                    plebeians. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The commons gave the consulship to
                    Lucius Sextius, by whose law it had been obtained. The patricians by their
                    popular influence obtained the praetorship for Spurius Furius Camillus, the son
                    of Marcus, the aedileship for Cneius Quinctius Capitolinus and Publius Cornelius
                    Scipio, men of their own rank. To Lucius Sextius, the patrician colleague
                    assigned was Lucius Aemilius Mamercinus. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> In
                    the beginning of the year mention was made both of the Gauls, who, after having
                    strayed about through Apulia, it was now rumoured were forming into a body; and
                    also <pb n="448" xml:id="p.448"/> concerning a revolt of the Hernicians.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> When all business was purposely deferred,
                    so that nothing should be transacted through means of the plebeian consul,
                    silence was observed on all matters, and a state of inaction like to a
                    justitium; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> except that, the tribunes not
                    suffering it to pass unnoticed that the nobility had arrogated to themselves
                    three patrician magistracies as a compensation for one plebeian consul, sitting
                    in curule chairs, clad in the praetexta like consuls; <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> the praetor, too, administering justice, and as if
                    colleague to the consuls, and elected under the same auspices, the senate were
                    in consequence made ashamed to order the curule aediles to be elected from among
                    the patricians. It was at first agreed, that they should be elected from the
                    commons every second year: afterwards the matter was left open. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> Then, in the consulate of Lucius Genucius and Quintus
                    Servilius, affairs being tranquil both at home and abroad, that they might at no
                    period be exempt from fear and danger, a great pestilence arose. <milestone
                        n="8" unit="section"/> They say that a praetor, a curule aedile, and three
                    plebeian tribunes died of it, and that several other deaths took place in
                    proportion among the populace; and that pestilence was made memorable chiefly by
                    the death of Marcus Furius, which, though occurring at an advanced age, was
                    still much lamented. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> For he was a truly
                    extraordinary man under every change of fortune; the first man in the state in
                    peace and war, before he went into exile; still more illustrious in exile,
                    whether by the regret felt for him by the state, which, when in captivity,
                    implored his aid when absent; or by the success with which, when restored to his
                    country, he restored that country along with himself. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> For five and twenty years afterwards (for so many years
                    afterwards did he live) he uniformly preserved his claims to such great glory,
                    and was deemed deserving of their considering him, next after Romulus, a second
                    founder of the city of Rome. </p>
                <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The pestilence continued both for this and the
                    following year, Caius Sulpicius Peticus and Caius Licinius Stolo being consuls.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> During that year nothing worth recording
                    took place, except that for the purpose of imploring the favour of the gods,
                    there was a Lectisternium, the third time since the building of the city.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> And when the violence of the disease was
                    alleviated neither by human measures nor by divine interference, their minds
                    being broken down by superstition, <pb n="449" xml:id="p.449"/> among other
                    means of appeasing the wrath of heaven, scenic plays also are said to have been
                    instituted, a new thing to a warlike people (for hitherto there had been only
                    the shows of the circus). But the matter was trivial, (as all beginnings
                    generally are,) and even that itself from a foreign source. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> Without any poetry, or gesticulating in imitation of such
                    poetry, actors were sent for from Etruria, dancing to the measures of a
                    musician, and exhibited, according to the Tuscan fashion, movements by no means
                    ungraceful. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The young men afterwards began to
                    imitate these, throwing out at the same time among each other jocular
                    expressions in uncouth verses; nor were their gestures irrelevant to their
                    language. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Wherefore the matter was received
                    with approbation, and by frequent use was much improved. To the native
                    performers the name of <hi rend="italics">histriones</hi> was given, because <hi
                        rend="italics">hister,</hi> in the Tuscan vocabulary, was the name of an
                    actor, <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/> who did not, as formerly, throw out
                    alternately artless and unpolished verses like the Fescennine at random, but
                    represented medleys complete with metre, the music being regularly adjusted for
                    the musician, and with appropriate gesticulation. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> Livius, who several years after, giving up medleys, was the
                    first who ventured to digest a story with a regular plot, (the same being,
                    forsooth, as all were at that time, the actor of his own pieces,) after having
                    broken his <milestone n="9??" unit="section"/> voice from having been too
                    repeatedly called on, and after having sought permission, is said to have placed
                    a boy before the musician to chaunt, and to have performed the gesticulations
                    with considerably freer movement, because the employment of his voice was no
                    impediment to him. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Thence commenced the
                    practice of chaunting to the actors according to their manual gesticulations,
                    and the dialogues only were left to their voice. <milestone n="11"
                        unit="section"/> When by this arrangement the business of the scenic
                    performances was called away from laughter and intemperate mirth, and the
                    amusement became gradually converted into an art, the young men, leaving to
                    regular actors the performance of plays, began themselves, according to the
                    ancient usage, to throw out ludicrous jests comprised in verses, which from that
                    time were called <hi rend="italics">exodia,</hi> and were collected chiefly from
                    the Atellan farces. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Which kind of amusement,
                    received from the Osci, the young kept to themselves, nor did they suffer it to
                    be debased by regular players. Hence it remains an established usage that the
                    actors of the Atellan farces are neither degraded <pb n="450" xml:id="p.450"/>
                    from their tribe, and may serve in the army, as if having no connexion with the
                    profession of the stage. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Among the trifling
                    beginnings of other matters, it seemed to me that the first origin of plays also
                    should be noticed; that it might appear how from a moderate commencement it has
                    reached its present extravagance, scarcely to be supported by opulent kingdoms. </p>
                <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> However, the first introduction of plays,
                    intended as a religious expiation, neither relieved their minds from religious
                    awe, nor their bodies from disease. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Nay more,
                    when the circus being inundated by the overflowing of the Tiber happened to
                    interrupt the middle of the performance, that indeed, as if the gods were now
                    turned from them, and despised their efforts to soothe their wrath, excited
                    great terror. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Accordingly, Cneius Genucius and
                    Lucius Aemilius Mamercinus being a second time consuls, when the searching for
                    expiations harassed their minds, more than the diseases did their bodies, it is
                    said to have been collected from the memory of the more aged, that a pestilence
                    had formerly been relieved, on the nail being driven by a dictator. <milestone
                        n="4" unit="section"/> Induced by this superstitious circumstance, the
                    senate ordered a dictator to be appointed for the purpose of driving the nail.
                    Lucius Manlius Imperiosus being appointed, named Lucius Pinarius master of the
                    horse. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> There is an ancient law written in
                    antique letters and words, that whoever is supreme officer should drive a nail
                    on the ides of September. It was driven into the right side of the temple of
                    Jupiter supremely good and great, on that part where the temple of Minerva is.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> They say that the nail was a mark of the
                    number of years elapsed, because letters were rare in those times, and that the
                    law was referred to the temple of Minerva, because number is the invention of
                    that goddess. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Cincius, a careful writer on
                    such monuments, asserts that there were seen at Volsinii also nails fixed in the
                    temple of Nortia, a Tuscan goddess, as indices of the number of years.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Marcus Horatius, being consul, according
                    to law dedicated the temple of Jupiter the best and greatest the year after the
                    expulsion of kings; the solemnity of fixing the nail was afterwards transferred
                    from the consuls to the dictators, because theirs was a superior office. The
                    custom being afterwards dropped, it seemed a matter of sufficient importance in
                    itself, on account of which a dictator should be appointed. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> For which reason Lucius Manlius being appoint- <pb n="451"
                        xml:id="p.451"/> ed, just as if he had been appointed for the purpose of
                    managing the business of the state in general, and not to acquit it of a
                    religious obligation, being ambitious to manage the Hernician war, harassed the
                    youth by a severe levy, and at length, all the plebeian tribunes having risen up
                    against him, whether overcome by force or shame, he resigned the dictatorship. </p>
                <milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>

                    he exercised not more against strangers than his nearest friends, and even those
                    of his own blood. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> And among other things, the

                        offence? <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> because he was not eloquent, nor
                        ready in discourse. Which defect of nature, whether ought it to be treated

                        punished, and rendered more remarkable by harsh treatment? The dumb beasts

                    at the further side of the bridge of the Anio. The dictator, after he had

                    of the Gallic tumult, bound all the younger citizens by the military oath; and
                    having set forth from the city with a great army, pitched his camp on the hither
                    bark of the Anio.. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The bridge lay between both
                    armies, neither side attempting to break it down, lest it should be an
                    indication of fear. There were frequent skirmishes for the possession of the
                    bridge; nor could it be clearly determined who were masters of it, the
                    superiority being so indecisive. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> A Gaul of
                    very large stature advanced on the bridge, then unoccupied, and says with as

                    following the army of the Gauls, having abandoned their camp in confusion,
                    passed over into the territory of Tibur, and from thence soon after into
                    Campania, having concluded an alliance for the purpose of war, and being

                        unit="section"/> That was the reason why, on the next year, Caius Paetelius

                    against the Tiburtians. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> To whose assistance
                    when the Gauls came back from Campania, dreadful devastations were com- <pb

                    satisfied with a consul as leader against the Tiburtian enemy, the alarm created
                    by the Gauls rendered it necessary that a dictator should be appointed. Quintus
                    Servilius Ahala having been appointed, named Titus Quinctius master of the
                    horse; and with the sanction of the senate, vowed the great games, should that
                    war turn out successfully. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The dictator then,
                    having ordered the consular army to remain to confine the Tiburtians to their
                    own war, bound all the younger citizens by the military oath, none declining the
                    service. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> A battle was fought not far from the
                    Colline gate with the strength of the entire city, in the sight of their
                    parents, wives, and children: which being great incitements to courage, even
                    when these relatives are absent, being now placed before their eyes, fired the

                    the war; and being intercepted whilst straggling by the consul Paetelius not far
                    from Tibur, and the Tiburtians having come out to bring them aid, they are with
                    the latter driven within the gates. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Matters
                    were managed with distinguished success both by the dictator and the consul. And
                    the other consul, Fabius, at first in slight skirmishes, and at length in one
                    single battle, defeated the Hernicians, when they attacked him with all their
                    forces. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The dictator, after passing the
                    highest encomiums on the consuls in the senate and before the people, and
                    yielding up the honour of his own exploits to them, resigned his dictatorship.
                    Paetelius enjoyed a double triumph, over the Gauls and the Tiburtians. Fabius
                    was satisfied with entering the city in ovation. <milestone n="10"

                    further, the ignorance of many as to who the enemy were or whence they had come.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> However they quickly ran to arms, and
                    guards were posted at the gates, and the walls were secured with troops; and
                    when daylight showed but an inconsiderable force before the walls, and that the
                    enemy were none other than the Tiburtines, the consuls, having gone forth from
                    the two gates, attack on either side the army of these now advancing up to the

                    more, it was evident that their coming proved an advantage to the Romans, and
                    that a disturbance just arising between the patricians and commons was checked
                    by the dread of a war so near them. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> In the
                    next war there was another irruption of the enemy, more terrible to the country
                    than to the city. The Tarquinians overran the Roman frontiers, committing
                    depredations on that side more especially where they are contiguous to Etruria;
                    and restitution being demanded in vain, the new consuls, Cneius Fabius and Caius
                    Plautius, proclaimed war on them by order of the people; and that province fell
                    to the lot of Fabius, the Hernicians to Plautius. <milestone n="7"

                    with an old treaty, which they had for several years ceased to observe.
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> When the Roman cause was supported by this

                    Pedum, were less heeded. It was determined that Caius Sulpicius should be
                    appointed dictator. Caius Plautius the consul, being sent for for the purpose,
                    nominated him; Marcus Valerius was assigned as master of the horse to the

                    the ferocity of the Gauls in their ardour for arms and battle; it by no means
                    met the approbation of the dictator when no urgent necessity existed to run any
                    hazard against an enemy, whose strength time and inconvenient situation would
                    daily impair, in total inactivity, without provisions previously laid up or any
                    fortified situation; besides, being persons of such minds and bodies, that all

                        <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> On these considerations the dictator
                    protracted the war, and denounced a severe penalty against any one who should
                    fight against the enemy without orders. The soldiers, being much dissatisfied
                    with this, first censured the dictator, in their conversation, when on guard and

                    whithersoever his intelligence of the enemy led him, he surprised many of them
                    straggling about in scattered parties, laying waste the lands. Moreover, he

                    they neither wished that the consular elections should be held by a plebeian
                    dictator or consul, and the other consul, Fabius, was detained by the war,
                    matters came to an interregnum. There <pb n="468" xml:id="p.468"/> were then

                    During this year Empulum was taken from the Tiburtians with a struggle not worth

                    waste by the consul Sulpicius about the same time that Valerius led the troops
                    against the Tiburtians. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The consuls had a more
                    arduous contest at home with the commons and tribunes. As two patricians had

                    obtained by him over the Tiburtians: in other respects the victory was a mild
                    one. Rigorous severity was practised against the Tarquinians. A great many being
                    slaughtered in the field, out of a great number of prisoners three hundred and
                    fifty-eight were selected, all of the highest rank, to be sent to Rome; the rest

                    were the people more merciful towards those who had been sent to Rome. They were
                    all beaten with rods and beheaded in the middle of the forum. That was the
                    punishment retaliated on the enemy for their butchering the Romans in the forum
                    of Tarquinii. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The successes in war induced the
                    Samnites to seek their friendship. A courteous answer was returned to their
                    ambassadors by the senate: they were received into an alliance by a treaty.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The Roman commons had not the same success
                    at home as in war. For though the burden of interest money had been relieved by
                    fixing the rate at one to the hundred, the poor were overwhelmed by the
                    principal alone, and submitted to confinement. On this account, the commons took
                    little heed either of the two consuls being patricians, or the management of the
                    elections, by reason of their private <pb n="470" xml:id="p.470"/> distresses.
                    Both consulships therefore remained with the patricians. <milestone n="6"

                    the people of Caere had joined the Tarquinians through compassion for them from
                    their relationship, ambassadors from the Latins drew their attention to the
                    Volscians, bringing tidings that an army enlisted and fully armed was now on the
                    point of attacking their frontiers; from thence that they were to enter the
                    Roman territory in order to commit depredations. <milestone n="7" unit="section"
                    /> The senate therefore determined that neither affair should be neglected; they
                    ordered that troops should be raised for both purposes, and that the consuls
                    should cast lots for the provinces. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The
                    greater share of their anxiety afterwards inclined to the Etrurian war; after it
                    was ascertained, from a letter of the consul Sulpicius, to whom the province of
                    Tarquinii had fallen, that the land around the Roman Salinae had been
                    depopulated, and that part of the plunder had been carried away into the country
                    of the people of Caere, and that the young men of that people were certainly
                    among the depredators. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The senate therefore,
                    having recalled the consul Valerius, who was opposed to the Volscians, and who
                    had his camp on the frontiers of Tusculum, ordered him to nominate a dictator.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> He nominated Titus Manlius, son of
                    Lucius. He, after he had appointed Aulus Cornelius Cossus his master of the

                    order of the people, with the sanction of the senate. </p>

                    seized with a real dread of war, as if there was greater power in the words of
                    the enemy to indicate war than in their own acts, who had provoked the Romans by
                    devastation; and they perceived how ill suited the contest was to their
                    strength. They repented of their depredations, and cursed the Tarquinians as the
                    instigators of the revolt. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Nor did any one

                    treated with all due ceremony, that the same compassion for them might influence
                    the Romans now in a flourishing condition, which had formerly influenced
                    themselves when the state of the Roman people was distressed; and turning to the

                    interrex, and Titus Quinctius Pennus. Some attach the name of Kaeso, others that
                    of Caius to Quinctius. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> They both set out to
                    the war, Quinctius to the Faliscian, Sulpicius to the Tarquinian; and the enemy
                    no where meeting them in the field, they waged war more against the lands than
                    the men, by burning and laying waste every thing, by the <milestone n="5??"

                    the pertinacity of both states was so broken, that they solicited a truce, first
                    from the consuls, then through their permission from the senate. They obtained a
                    truce for forty years. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Thus the concern
                    regarding the two wars which were hanging over them being laid aside, whilst
                    there was some repose from arms, it was determined that a census should be
                    instituted, because the payment of the debt had changed the owners of much
                    property. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> But when the assembly was proclaimed
                    for the appointment of censors, Caius Marcius Rutilus, who had been the first
                    plebeian dictator, having declared himself a candidate for the censorship,
                    disturbed the harmony of the different orders. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    This step he seemed to have taken at an unseasonable time; because both the
                    consuls then happened to be patricians, who declared that they would take no
                    account of him. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> But he both succeeded in his
                    undertaking by his own perseverance, and the tribunes aided him by recovering a
                    right lost in the election of the consuls; and both the worth of the man brought
                    him to the <pb n="474" xml:id="p.474"/> level of the highest honour, and also
                    the commons were anxious that the censorship also should be brought within their
                    participation through the medium of the same person who had opened a way to the
                    dictatorship. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Nor was any dissent [from this
                    feeling] evinced at the election, so that Marcius was elected censor along with
                    Cneius Manlius. This year also had Marcus Fabius as dictator, not by reason of
                    any terror of war, but in order that the Licinian law should not be observed at
                    the consular elections. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Quintus Servilius was
                    attached to the dictator as master of the horse. Nor yet did the dictatorship
                    render that combination of the senators more effectual at the consular
                    elections, than it had proved at that of the censors. </p>

                    more distinguished; for when news was brought that a vast army of the Gauls had
                    pitched their camp in the Latin territory, Scipio being attacked with a serious
                    fit of illness, the Gallic war was intrusted out of course to Popillius.

                    strength before he should hazard a decisive action, he commenced drawing an
                    intrenchment on a hill, the nearest he could select to the camp of the Gauls.

                    they perceived that neither the opposite army descended into the plain, and that
                    the Romans were protected both by the height of the ground and also by the
                    entrenchments, supposing that they were dismayed with fear, and also more

                    remaining for them after they had descended into the plain; for the great
                    numbers of the Gauls being such as to prevent all feeling of such a disaster,
                    raised up fresh troops against the victorious enemy, as if a new army rose up
                    once more. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> And the Romans stood still,
                    suppressing their ardour; both because the struggle had to be undergone a second

                        unit="section"/> At the same time they found fault with the dictator, who
                    had obtained the consulship as a bribe for having infringed the Licinian law,
                    more dishonourable for the private ambition [evinced] thereby than for the
                    injury inflicted on the public, so that, when dictator, he might have himself
                    appointed consul. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The year was remarkable for
                    many and various commotions. The Gauls [descending] from the Alban mountains,

                    through the plains and the parts adjoining the sea, committed devastations.

                    procured silence, through an interpreter he challenged any one of the Romans to
                    contend with him with the sword. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> There was a

                    on his helmet, facing the enemy, which, as an augury sent from heaven, the
                    tribune at first received with pleasure. Then he prayed that whatever god or

                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Wondrous to relate, the bird not only kept
                    the place it had once taken, but as often as the encounter was renewed, raising
                    itself on its wings, it attacked the face and eyes of the foe with its beak and
                    talons, until Valerius slays him, terrified at the sight of such a prodigy, and
                    confounded both in his vision and understanding. The crow soaring out of sight

                    and the Romans began to run to their successful champion with still greater

                    contest is carried on not by the companies of the nearest posts, but by the
                    legions pouring out from both sides. The soldiers exulting in the victory of the
                    tribune, and also at such favour and attention from the gods, are commanded by
                    Camillus to advance against the enemy: and he, pointing to the tribune

                    out the others, there was a desperate encounter: the rest of the soldiery,
                    before they came within throw of a weapon, turned their backs. At first they
                    were dispersed through the Volscians and the Falernian territory; thence they
                    made for Apulia and the upper sea. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The

                    being commanded by the senate to take charge of the maritime war, joined his
                    camp to that of the praetor. There because matters seemed to be delayed by the
                    dastardly conduct of the Greeks, who did not venture into the field, with the
                    approbation of the senate, he nominated Titus Manlius Torquatus dictator.
                        <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The dictator, after appointing Aulus
                    Cornelius Cossus his master of the horse, held the consular elections, and with
                    the greatest applause of the people he returned Marcus Valerius Corvus (for that
                    was his surname from thenceforth) as consul though absent, the rival of his own
                    glory, then three and twenty years of age. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> As
                    colleague to Corvus, Marcus Popillius Laenas, a plebeian, was assigned to be
                    consul for the fourth time. Nothing memorable occurred between Camillus and the
                    Greeks; neither the one were warriors by land, nor the Romans by sea. <milestone

                    wearied by intestine war, was now in dread of the power of the Macedonians. </p>

                    the state, compelled the senate to order the decemvirs to inspect the Sibylline

                    reliance in their walls not being sufficiently strong, when the city,
                    encompassed by a continuous line of troops, was now on the point of being taken

                    considered exclusive of the spoil; these the consul when triumphing drove before
                    his chariot in chains; afterwards by selling them he brought a great sum of

                    themselves to the contest without reluctance, considering that the aid of the
                    gods should also be engaged, vowed a temple to Juno Moneta in the heat of the

                    to be appointed to have the temple built suitably to the grandeur of the Roman
                    people; the site destined for it was in the citadel, where the ground was on

                    on the books being inspected, the state being filled with religious scruples, it
                    was resolved by the senate that a dictator should be nominated for the purpose

                    states also should offer supplications: and a certain order was appointed for
                    them on what day each should offer supplication. <milestone n="9" unit="section"

                    the countries, or the length of time during which they were carried on. For in
                    that year arms were taken up against the Samnites, a nation powerful both in
                    wealth and in arms. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Pyrrhus followed as an
                    enemy the war of the Samnites carried on with various success, the Carthaginians
                    followed Pyrrhus. How great a mass of events! How often have extreme dangers

                    which is now scarcely sustained! <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> But the cause
                    of the war between the Samnites and Romans, as they had been joined in alliance
                    and friendship, came from without; it originated not among themselves.

                    unite themselves to the Campanians. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> As the

                    enervated as they were by luxury, they were beaten in the Sidicinian territory
                    by men who were inured to the use of arms, and then brought on themselves the

                    taking no further notice of the Sidicinians, having attacked the Campanians as
                    being the chief of the neighbouring states, from whom the victory might be
                    equally easy, and a greater share of spoil and glory, after they had secured
                    Tifata, a ridge of hills hanging over Capua, with a strong garrison, they march
                    down from thence with their army formed in a square into the plain which lies

                    his entire army into the valley; Publius Decius, a tribune of the soldiers,
                    espies in the tract a hill higher than the rest, hanging over the enemies' camp,
                    rather steep to be ascended by an encumbered army, not difficult for such as
                    were lightly armed. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> He says therefore to the

                    and the army. For the enemy, lying beneath us and [exposed thereby] to all our
                    weapons, will not be able to stir without destruction to themselves. After that
                    either the good fortune of the Roman people or our own bravery will extricate

                    Then, whilst all were struck with astonishment, after he had attracted the eyes
                    of all to himself, he both afforded the consul time to draw off his army to more
                    advantageous ground, and he himself was posted on the top of the hill.

                    neither determine by what signal they should collect themselves into a body,

                    Samnites quiet, to purge the army by sending away the turbulent men; by telling
                    some that their regular time had been served; that others were weighed down by
                    years and debilitated in bodily vigour. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Some
                    were sent away on furloughs, at first individuals, then some cohorts also, on
                    the plea that they had wintered far from their home and domestic affairs.

                    indeed, not suspecting the artifice, they returned to their homes by no means
                    with reluctance. After they saw that neither those first sent returned to their
                    standards, and that scarcely any others, except those who had wintered in
                    Campania, and chiefly the fomenters of the mutiny, were sent away; at first
                    wonder, and then certain fear entered their minds, that their schemes had been
                    divulged; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> "that now they would have to suffer
                    trials, discoveries, the secret punishments of individuals, and the tyrannical

                    were at no great distance from Anxur, posted itself at Lautulae, in a narrow
                    woody pass between the sea and the mountains, to intercept those whom the consul
                    was dismissing under various pretences (as has been already mentioned). Their

                    Without order, therefore, they come into the Alban territory committing

                    the remainder of the day they discuss their different opinions regarding the

                    which was passed with great glory, having been relinquished in consequence of
                    one of his feet being lamed by a wound, he determined on spending his life in
                    the country far from ambition and the forum. His name once heard, they
                    immediately recognised the man; and with wishes for success, ordered him to be
                    sent for. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> There was, however, but little hope
                    that he would do any thing voluntarily; they resolved on employing force and

                    sent for the purpose, having entered the house in the silence of the night, and
                    surprising Quinctius overcome in sleep, threatening that there was no

                    Immediately on his arrival he was styled general, and whilst he was startled at

                    honour, and bid him lead them to the city. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>
                    Then having torn up their standard, more under the influence of their own

                    advancing before the standards, declared that <quote> the soldiers would be
                        obedient to the dictator; he entreated that he would espouse the cause of
                        his unfortunate countrymen, and having espoused it, he would maintain it
                        with the same fidelity with which he had wont to administer public affairs.

                        That provision should be made for the soldiers, as provision had been made
                        by the senate, once for the commons, a second time for the legions, so that
                        the secession should not be visited with punishment. </quote>
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The dictator, having lauded Quinctius, and
                    having bid the others to hope for the best, returned back to the city with all
                    speed, and, with the approbation of the senate, proposed to the people in the
                    Peteline grove, that the secession should not be <pb n="501" xml:id="p.501"/>
                    visited with chastisement on any of the soldiers. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> He also en- treated, with their permission, that no one
                    should either in jest or earnest upbraid any one with that proceeding. A
                    military devoting law was also passed, that the name of any soldier once
                    enrolled, should not be erased unless with his own consent; <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> and to the law [a clause] was added that no one, after he
                    had been a tribune of the soldiers, should afterwards be a centurion. That
                    demand was made by the conspirators on account of Publius Salonius; who in
                    alternate years was both tribune of the soldiers and first centurion, which they
                    now call <hi rend="italics">primi pili.</hi>
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The soldiers were incensed against him,
                    because he had always been opposed to their recent measures, and had fled from
                    Lantulae, that he might have no share in them. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    Accordingly when this alone was not obtained from the senate through their
                    regard for Salonius, then Salonius, conjuring the conscript fathers, that they
                    would not value his promotion more highly than the concord of the state,
                    prevailed in having that also carried. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Equally
                    ineffectual was the demand, that some deductions should be made from the pay of
                    the cavalry, (they then received triple,) because they had opposed the
                    conspiracy. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Besides these, I find in some writers that
                    Lucius Genucius, tribune of the commons, proposed to the people, that no one
                    should be allowed to practise usury; <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> likewise
                    provision was made by other enactments, that no one should fill the same office
                    within ten years; nor hold two offices on the same year; and that it should be
                    allowed that both the consuls should be plebeians. If all these concessions were
                    made to the people, it is evident that the revolt possessed no little strength.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> In other annals it is recorded, that
                    Valerius was not appointed dictator, but that the entire business was managed by
                    the consuls; and also that that bang of conspirators were driven to arms not
                    before they came to Rome, but at Rome; <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> and
                    that it was not on the country-house of Titus Quinctius, but on the residence of
                    Caius Manlius the assault was made by night, and that he was seized by the
                    conspirators to become their leader: that having proceeded thence to the fourth
                    mile-stone, they posted themselves in a well-defended place; <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> and that it was not with the leaders mention of a
                    reconciliation originated; but that suddenly, when the armies marched out to
                    battle fully armed, a mutual saluta- <pb n="502" xml:id="p.502"/> tion took
                    place; <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> that mixing together the soldiers began
                    to join hands, and to embrace each other with tears; and that the consuls, on
                    seeing the minds of the soldiers averse from fighting, made a proposition to the
                    senate concerning the re-establishment of concord. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> So that among ancient writers nothing is agreed on, except
                    that there was a mutiny, and that it was composed. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> Both the report of this disturbance, and the heavy war
                    entered into with the Samnites, alienated some states from the Roman alliance:
                    and besides the treaty of the Latins, which now for a long time was not to be
                    depended on, the Privernians also by a sudden incursion laid waste Norba and
                    Setia, Roman colonies in their neighbourhood. </p>
