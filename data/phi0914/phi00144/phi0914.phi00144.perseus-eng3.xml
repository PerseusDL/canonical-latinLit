                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> At the beginning of the following spring,
                        the consul Q. Marcius Philippus arrived in Brundisium with the 5000 men who
                        were to reinforce his legions. M. Popilius, an ex-consul, and a number of
                        young men of equally noble birth, followed the consul as military tribunes
                        for the legions in Macedonia. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> C. Marcius
                        Figulus, who was to command the fleet, reached Brundisium at the same time,
                        and he and the consul left Italy together. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                        The following day they made Corcyra, the next day Actium, the seaport of
                        Acarnania. The consul landed at Ambracia and proceeded by land to Thessaly.
                        Figulus sailed past Leucatas and entered the Gulf of Corinth. <milestone
                            n="4" unit="section"/> Leaving his ship at Creusa he hurried on through
                        the middle of Boeotia-a one day's march for a lightly-equipped soldier-to
                        join the fleet at Chalcis. A. Hostilius was at the time in a camp near
                        Palaepharsalus in Thessaly. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> He had not
                        fought any important action but he had checked the licence and disorder of
                        his soldiers and brought them up to a state of complete military efficiency,
                        and he had been consistently honourable in his conduct towards the allies
                        and protected them from all injustice and oppression. On hearing of the
                        arrival of his successor he made a careful inspection of the arms, the men
                        and the horses, and went to meet the consul with his army in complete
                        equipment. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Their first meeting was quite
                        in accord with their rank and their character as Romans, and subsequently
                        they worked in perfect harmony as long as the proconsul stayed with the
                        army. </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> A few days later the consul addressed his
                        troops. He first alluded to Perseus's contemplated assassination of his
                        father, and his actual murder of his brother, and then went on to describe
                        how, after his <milestone n="8??" unit="section"/>
                        <milestone n="9??" unit="section"/> crimes had secured him the crown, he had
                        recourse to poisoning and bloodshed; how he laid an infamous plot against
                        Eumenes, inflicted injuries against the people of Rome, and plundered the
                        cities of the allies of Rome in violation of the existing treaty. <milestone
                            n="10" unit="section"/> He would find out in the ruin of his fortunes
                        how hateful all this conduct was to the gods, for the gods bestowed their
                        favour on natural affection and honourable dealing; it was by these that the
                        Roman people gained their lofty position in the world. <milestone n="11"
                            unit="section"/> He next drew a comparison between the strength of Rome,
                        embracing as she does the world, and the strength of Macedonia, army against
                        army. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> "How much greater," he exclaimed,
                        "were the forces of Philip and Antiochus, and yet they were shattered by
                        armies no stronger than ours today." </p>
                </div>
                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="2" type="chapter">
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> After kindling the spirits of his men by
                        speeches of this kind, he consulted his staff on the strategy of the war. C.
                        Marius, the praetor, who had taken over the command of the fleet, was also
                        present. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> They decided not to waste any
                        more time in Thessaly, but to go forward at once into Macedonia, and the
                        praetor was to make <milestone n="3??" unit="section"/> a naval attack on
                        the enemy's coast at the same time. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The
                        consul issued orders for the soldiers to take a month's supply of corn. Ten
                        days after taking over the command of the army he broke up the camp, and at
                        the end of the first <milestone n="5??" unit="section"/> day's march he
                        called the guides together and told them to explain to the council what
                        route each of them would choose. After they had withdrawn he asked the
                        council to say which they thought best. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        Some preferred the route through the Pythian Pass; others were in favour of
                        the road over the Cambunian Range which the consul Hostilius had taken the
                        previous year; others again chose the road by Lake Ascuris. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> All these routes had a considerable section in common;
                        the further discussion was therefore adjourned until they reached the point
                        where they began to diverge. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> From there he
                        marched into Perrhaebia and went into camp between Azorus and Doliche, to
                        hold a second consultation as to the best route to take. During this time
                        Perseus had heard that the enemy were approaching, but did not know which
                        route they were taking. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> He decided to
                        occupy all the passes, and sent 10,000 light infantry under Asclepiodotus to
                        hold a peak in the Cambunian Range-its local name is Volustana. <milestone
                            n="10" unit="section"/> At a fortified place above Lake Ascuris, called
                        Lapathus, Hippias with 12,000 Macedonians was posted to defend the pass.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Perseus himself with the rest of his
                        force formed an entrenched camp at Dium. And here it would almost seem as if
                        his reasoning faculties were benumbed and he <milestone n="12??"
                            unit="section"/> was destitute of all resource, for he used to start
                        from his camp at Dium with an escort of light cavalry, and gallop to
                        Heraclea or to Phila, returning at the same speed to Dium. </p>
                </div>
                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="3" type="chapter">
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> In the meanwhile the consul had made up
                        his mind to march through the pass near Ottolobus, where as already stated
                        the king's forces were; 4000 men were nevertheless sent on in advance to
                        occupy suitable positions. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> They were under
                        the command of M. Claudius and Q. Marcius, the consul's son. <milestone
                            n="3" unit="section"/> The whole of the force followed very soon
                        afterwards. The road, however, was so steep and rough and stony that the
                        light troops in advance had, with great difficulty, covered only fifteen
                        miles when they formed their camp and rested at a place called Dierum.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> On the following day they advanced
                        seven miles and after seizing some rising ground not far from the enemy's
                        camp, they sent word to the consul that they had reached the enemy, and had
                        established themselves in a safe and extremely advantageous position, so
                        that he might follow at such speed as he could. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> The messenger found the consul at Lake Ascuris in a
                        state of anxiety about the difficulties of the route upon which he had
                        entered and also about the fate of those few troops whom he had sent in
                        advance to the positions occupied by the enemy. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> He was greatly relieved at hearing the message sent
                        him, and marching on with his main body reunited the whole of his force and
                        encamped in an admirable position on the slopes of the hill already
                        occupied. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Its height was such that it
                        commanded a view not only of the enemy's camp, which was not more than a
                        mile distant, but of the whole of the country up to Dium and Phila and the
                        far-extended line of the sea coast. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The
                        soldiers' spirits rose when they saw the whole weight of the war, the entire
                        military strength of the king and the hostile country so near them.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> They pressed the consul to lead them
                        at once against the enemy, but he allowed them one day's rest after the
                        toils of the march. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The next day, leaving
                        a detachment to guard the camp, he led them out to battle. </p>
                </div>
                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="4" type="chapter">

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Hippias had recently been sent by the king
                        to guard the pass, and as soon as he caught sight of the Roman camp on the
                        hill he prepared his men for battle and marched to meet the enemy's column
                        as it advanced. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The Romans went into the
                        fight in light equipment; the enemy force, too, consisted of light infantry;
                        these troops are the readiest to commence an action. <milestone n="3"

                        missiles; many wounds were inflicted in their random charges, a few were

                        space in which to deploy their lines a decisive action might have been
                        fought. The summit of the mountain narrows into a wedge-shaped ridge which
                        hardly allows a front to be formed of three men abreast. So while the actual
                        fighting was carried on by a few, the rest, especially the heavy infantry,
                        stood and watched it. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The light infantry
                        were able to run forward through the dips in the ridge and attack the flanks
                        of the enemy's light infantry, both where the ground was favourable and
                        where it was not. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Night put an end to the

                        was equally impossible for him to retreat without loss of honour and even
                        without danger should the enemy attack him from the higher ground. There was
                        only one course left, to carry through the adventure with the same rashness
                        with which he had entered upon it; <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> a

                        not strengthen his line by sending fresh men to replace those who had borne
                        the burden of the combat, nor, what was most important of all, did he
                        himself appear on the field. And yet the Roman commander, more than sixty
                        years old and very stout, was discharging personally all the duties of a

                        almost as much confusion in the line as the enemy might have done; when they
                        came to places which could not be crossed they flung their drivers off and

                        contradictory orders he sent two of his ''friends", the one to Pella to

                        burn the fleet. He recalled Asclepiodotus and Hippias and their troops from

                        nature, was held by detachments of the king's troops at four different

                        returned to Dium, repaired what had been shattered and devastated by the
                        Romans, replaced the battlements which had been shaken down, strengthened
                        the walls in all directions, and finally fixed his camp on the other bank of
                        the Elpeus. This river is an extremely dangerous one to cross, and it served
                        to protect his camp. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> It rises on Mount
                        Olympus; in summer it is a narrow brook, but when swollen by winter storms
                        it rushes over the boulders in enormous eddies and washing out the earth at
                        the bottom and carrying it down to the sea, it forms whirlpools of great
                        depth, and the continual hollowing out of the channel leaves the banks
                        precipitous on both sides. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> As Perseus
                        believed that the advance of the enemy would be arrested by this river, it
                        was his intention to spend the rest of the summer there. <milestone n="8"

                        tried to induce the magistrates and chief men to test the good faith and

                        fires in the distance of the king's camp by the Elpeus. Then the attack
                        began in earnest, by land and also by sea-for the fleet was moored off the
                        shore-by direct assault as well as by the employment of siege engines and
                        artillery. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Some young Romans turned their

                        extravagant habit came in of filling the Circus with animals from all parts
                        of the world, it was the practice to devise various forms of amusement, as
                        the chariot and horse races were over within the hour. <milestone n="5"

                        generally about sixty, but larger in the more elaborate games, were
                        introduced fully armed. To some extent they represented the maneuvers of an
                        army, but their movements were more skilful and resembled more nearly the

                        various evolutions, they formed a solid square with their shields held over
                        their heads, touching one another; those in the front rank standing erect;
                        those in the second slightly stooping; those in the third and fourth bending
                        lower and lower; whilst those in the rear rank rested on their knees. In
                        this way they formed a testudo, which sloped like the roof of a house.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> From a distance of fifty feet two
                        fully armed men ran forward and, pretending to threaten one another, went
                        from the lowest to the highest part of the testudo over the closely locked
                        shields; at one moment assuming an attitude of defiance on the very edge,
                        and then rushing at one another in the middle of it just as though they were
                        jumping about on solid ground. </p>
                    <p> A testudo formed in this way was brought up against the lowest part of the
                        wall. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> When the soldiers who were mounted
                        on it came close up to the wall they were at the same height as the
                        defenders, and when these were driven off, the soldiers of two companies
                        climbed over into the city. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The only
                        difference was that the front rank and the files did not raise their shields
                        above their heads for fear of exposing themselves; they held them in front
                        as in battle. Thus they were not hit by the missiles from the walls, and
                        those which were hurled on the testudo rolled off harmlessly to the ground
                        like a shower of rain from the roof of a house. <milestone n="10"

                        ordered the divers to be secretly put to death, and the same fate overtook
                        Andronicus and Nicias, in order that no one alive might know anything about
                        his insane orders. C. Marcius sailed with his fleet from Heracleum to

                        This district, by far the most fertile of all those on the coast along which
                        they had sailed, belonged to Cassandrea. Here Eumenes, who had sailed from
                        Elaea, met them with twenty decked ships, and five had also been sent by
                        Prusias. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> This accession of strength
                        emboldened the praetor to attempt the capture of Cassandrea. This city was
                        built by Cassander on the narrow isthmus which connects the district of
                        Pallene with the rest of Macedonia, and is washed on one side by the

                        sea, forming a promontory equal in extent to the towering Mount Athos. In
                        the direction of Magnesia it has two headlands; the larger one is called the
                        Posideum, the smaller the Cape of Canastra. The attack was commenced on two
                        sides. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The Roman commander, at a place
                        called Clitae, carried his lines through from the Macedonian to the Toronaic
                        Gulf and hedged them with forked poles to cut off all communication with the
                        north. On the other side there was a canal, and here Eumenes was operating.
                        The Romans had a very heavy task in filling up a fosse which Perseus had
                        recently excavated for the defence of the town. The praetor, seeing no heaps
                        lying about anywhere, enquired where the earth out of the fosse had been
                        carried. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Some arches were pointed out to

                        that of a single brick. The consul formed the design of breaking through
                        these and penetrating into the city, and he thought he might do this
                        unobserved, if the scaling parties assaulted the walls elsewhere and called
                        off the defenders to these threatened points. <milestone n="7"

                        2000 Illyrians sent by Pleuratus from Peneste, all keen fighters. <milestone

                        Romans were doing their utmost to surmount them, the brickwork of the arches
                        was broken down in a moment and the city laid open. If those who had made
                        the breaches had been armed, they would have taken the place at once.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> When the soldiers heard that this had

                        thinking that this would be an advantage to whichever side was the first to

                        charged the Romans who were coming up from all sides and were massing with
                        the intention of entering the city in regular formation. Unable to present a
                        firm front or proper line of battle, they were routed and pursued as far as
                        the fosse, into which they were driven headlong, and lay in heaps.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Nearly 600 were killed there, and
                        almost all who were caught between the wall and the fosse were wounded.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> His attempt thus recoiling on himself
                        made the praetor somewhat slow in forming other plans. Eumenes, too, who was
                        making a combined attack by land and sea, was equally unsuccessful.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> It was decided therefore to post
                        strong detachments on both sides of the city to prevent any succour being
                        introduced from Macedonia, and then, as direct assault had failed, to
                        commence a regular siege. Whilst they were preparing for this, ten swift
                        ships belonging to Perseus's fleet were sent up from Thessalonica with a
                        picked force of Gaulish mercenaries on board. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> When they caught sight of the Roman fleet standing out

                        they made for the nearest point on which to disembark, and so entered the

                        that the city might be taken at the first assault. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> Preparations were accordingly made for a regular siege
                        and the construction of the necessary works was commenced. Perseus heard
                        that Meliboea was being attacked by the consul's army and that the fleet was
                        lying off Iolcus, preparatory to an attack on Demetrias. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> He sent one of his generals, a man called Euphranor,
                        with a picked force of 2000 men to Meliboea. This officer was ordered, in
                        case he cleared the Romans away from Meliboea, to make a secret march to
                        Demetrias and enter the city before the Romans advanced against it from
                        Iolcus. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> His sudden appearance on the
                        ground above the Roman lines created great alarm amongst the besiegers of
                        Meliboea; their works were abandoned and burnt. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> The siege of the one city being raised, Euphranor
                        hurried on to Demetrias. In the night . . . not only the walls . . . but
                        even their fields they felt sure could be protected from ravages. They made
                        sorties and attacked the scattered groups of plunderers, not without
                        wounding many of them. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> However, the
                        praetor and Eumenes rode round the walls, examining the situation of the
                        city, to see if they could not make an attempt somewhere, either by
                        siege-works or by storm. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> There was a
                        rumour that negotiations for the establishment of friendly relations between
                        Perseus and Eumenes had been carried on by Cydas of Crete and Antimachus,
                        the governor of Demetrias. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> At all events,
                        the Romans withdrew from Demetrias. Eumenes sailed away to visit the consul,
                        and after congratulating him upon his successful invasion of Macedonia, went
                        home. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The praetor sent part of his fleet
                        to Sciathus to lie up for the winter; with the rest of his ships he steered
                        for Oreum in Euboea, as he considered that city the most suitable base from
                        which supplies could be sent to the armies in Macedonia and Thessaly.
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Very different accounts are given of
                        Eumenes. If you are to believe Valerius Antias, the praetor received no
                        assistance from his fleet, though he had often written for his co-operation,
                        and further, when he left for Asia, he was not on good terms with the
                        consul, nor could the consul induce him to leave behind the Gaulish cavalry
                        whom he had brought with him. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Valerius
                        goes on to say that Eumenes's brother Attalus remained with the <milestone

                        "philippei," and begged that they might be allowed to place it as an

                        and shortly afterwards to those from Rhodes. Both embassies dealt with the
                        same subject, but on very different lines; they both pleaded for peace with
                        Perseus. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The tone of Prusias's
                        representatives was one of entreaty rather than demand. Prusias declared
                        that he had stood by the Romans up to that time, and would continue to do so
                        as long as the war lasted, but when envoys from Perseus approached him with
                        the object of bringing the war with Rome to an end he had promised to
                        intercede for him with the senate. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> He
                        begged them, if they could make up their minds to lay aside their

                        peace. Such was the appeal which the king's envoys made. </p>

                        Macedonia and Rome, friendly relations were formed between them and Perseus.
                        Much against their will they had broken off that friendship, without his
                        having done anything to deserve such treatment, because the Romans had

                        that L. Aemilius was not going to show any lack of energy in the prosecution
                        of the war; amongst other proofs of this was the exclusive attention he gave
                        night and day to everything that had to do with it. <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> The very first thing he did was to ask the senate to
                        send a commission to Macedonia to inspect the armies and the fleet and to
                        report from their own personal knowledge what was required for the land and

                        under our control and how much under the king's, and whether the Romans were
                        still encamped in mountainous and difficult country, or whether they had
                        cleared all the passes and reached open country. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> Then with regard to our allies they were to ascertain
                        who were still faithful, who were making their fidelity depend upon the
                        issue of the war, and what States were openly hostile. They were further to
                        find out what amount of supplies had been accumulated; from what sources
                        further supplies could be brought by land or sea; and what were the results
                        of the year's campaign by land and sea. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                        When accurate information on these points had been received, it would be
                        possible to form definite plans for the future. The senate authorised the
                        consul Cn. Servilius to send as commissioners into Macedonia those whom L.
                        Aemilius approved of. Those selected were C. Domitius Ahenobarbus, A.

                        and sent off. Meantime the foreign deputations could be received in

                        dress. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Antiochus, king of Syria, who had
                        been in Rome as a hostage, was now, under the specious pretext of restoring
                        the elder Ptolemy to his throne, waging war against his younger brother and
                        was threatening Alexandria at the time. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> He
                        had won a naval victory off Pelusium, and after hurriedly throwing a bridge

                        the prospect of a siege, and it seemed almost certain that he would gain
                        possession of the powerful realm of Egypt. After stating these facts the

                        urged that the kindness which the Roman people had shown to <milestone

                        their friends, he would at once quit the walls of Alexandria and take his

                        hesitated to do this, they would soon have Ptolemy and Cleopatra coming as

                        the commissioners arrived from Macedonia. Their return had been so anxiously

                        present position. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> On leaving the camp they
                        proceeded to the fleet. Here they learnt that some of the crews had been
                        carried off by disease, some, mostly the Sicilian seamen, had gone home, and
                        the ships were undermanned; the men who were in them had not received their

                        affairs; then from those who are taking part in the operations, who know the

                        He urged them to reflect on these things, and either insist upon the Romans

                        and ill-will against Eumenes amongst the Romans, and still graver, though
                        unfounded, charges were made against him, for he was regarded as a traitor
                        and a declared enemy. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> There was a Cretan
                        called Cydas, an intimate friend of Eumenes. This man went with a certain

                        because of the differences he had with his father as because of personal

                        /> The jealousy of the two monarchs was such that Eumenes would not have
                        seen with complacency Perseus winning such an accession of power and glory
                        as would have awaited him had he defeated the Romans. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> He knew also that from the very beginning of the war
                        Perseus had tried every means of gaining peace, and the nearer the danger
                        the more his actions and thoughts were, day and night, turned to this
                        object. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> As regarded the Romans, he
                        believed that since the war had dragged on longer than they expected, both
                        their generals and the senate would not be averse from bringing to a close
                        such a tedious and difficult war. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Having
                        thus discovered what both sides wished for, he was all the more desirous of
                        winning their good graces by offering for a consideration his assistance
                        towards securing what he believed would come about of itself through the
                        weariness of the stronger and the fears of the weaker side. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> He fixed his price in the one case for not lending
                        assistance to the Romans either by land or sea, and in the other for
                        mediating peace. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> For refusing assistance
                        he asked 1000 talents, for bringing about peace, 1500. Impelled by his fears
                        Perseus was very prompt in commencing negotiations and made no delay in
                        discussing the question of hostages; it was settled that those whom he
                        received should be sent to Crete. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> But when
                        it came to the mention of money he drew back and said that a money payment

                        Still in the hope of obtaining peace with Rome he did not grudge the
                        expense, though he would only hand over the money when the transaction was
                        completed; meanwhile he would deposit it in the temple at Samothrace.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> As that island belonged to Perseus,
                        Eumenes saw that it made no difference whether it were there or at Pella,
                        and he proposed to carry away a portion at once. <milestone n="12"

                        and the invaluable support now offered of the Gauls who were pouring through
                        Illyria, were both lost to him through his avarice. <milestone n="3"

                        were to receive a thousand. Perseus went with half his whole force from his
                        camp at the Elpeus and began to give notice through all the villages and
                        cities adjoining their route that they were to prepare ample supplies of

                        sent the crafty messenger back unhurt-treatment which the man himself hardly
                        ventured to hope for. The Gauls returned to the Hister, devastating those

                        the fields so that the Romans could have looked for no supplies from those
                        districts, but also have utterly destroyed the cities to prevent their

                        such an opportunity Perseus encouraged the Romans and discouraged to a great

                        thirty-five vessels called "hippagogi," carrying Gaulish horses and

                        They first thought that they were Romans and then that it was Attalus or

                        enemy, there was great alarm. The clumsy nature of their ships and the
                        difficulty of keeping the Gauls quiet, destroyed all hope of resistance.

                        and Antenor gave orders for the ten vessels which he had previously sent to
                        carry these and the prisoners to Thessalonica and return as soon as

                        the new generals had reached their provinces. The consul Aemilius was in

                        conduct the war against Gentius. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The
                        father of Gentius was Pleuratus, formerly king of Illyria; his mother's name
                        was Eurydice. Gentius had two brothers, one named Plator, the other, a
                        half-brother, named Caravantius. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He felt
                        no uneasiness about the latter, as the father was a man of low birth, but to
                        make his throne more secure he put Plator to death, and two of his friends
                        with him, Ettritus and Epicadus, both of them able and enterprising men.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> It was commonly said that his jealousy
                        was aroused by Plator's betrothal to Etuta, a daughter of Monunus, the
                        prince of the Dardani, as though by this marriage he would secure the whole
                        nation to his interest, and the fact that after Plator's death his brother
                        married the girl made this conjecture highly probable. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> When all fear of his brother was removed, Gentius began
                        to harass and oppress his people, and his naturally violent temper was
                        inflamed by excessive indulgence in wine. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        However, as I have said above, he was bent upon war with Rome, and assembled
                        the whole of his forces at Lissus. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> They
                        numbered 15,000 men. He sent his brother Caravantius with 1000 infantry and

                        force, whilst he himself advanced against Bassania, a city five miles

                        friendly to Rome, and when Caravantius sent a demand for submission they

                        opened its gates to Caravantius; another city, Caravandis, shut its gates
                        against him, and when he began an extensive devastation of their fields the

                        its situation and defended by the whole strength of Illyria under the king
                        himself, the Roman praetor determined to attack it. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> His first operations had been successful, and he
                        believed that the same good fortune would carry him through, and that the
                        alarm created by his sudden appearance would have its effect. Had the gates
                        been kept shut and the defenders stationed on the walls and towers, the
                        attempt would have failed and the Romans would have been driven away from
                        the walls. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> As it was, however, they made a
                        sortie from the gate, and they began a <milestone n="8??" unit="section"/>
                        battle on open ground with more courage than they kept it up. <milestone
                            n="9" unit="section"/> They were driven back, and more than 200 men were
                        killed as they squeezed together in their flight through the confined space
                        of the gate. This created such a panic that Gentius at once sent two of the
                        foremost men in the country, Teuticus and Bellus, to the praetor to ask for
                        a cessation of hostilities, to allow him time to consider his position.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> He was allowed three days-the Roman
                        camp was only five miles away-and went on board ship and sailed up the
                        Barbanna to Lake Libeatus as though in quest of a retired spot for
                        reflection but, as it turned out, he had been misled by a false report that
                        his brother Caravantius was <milestone n="11??" unit="section"/> approaching
                        with several thousand men, whom he had raised in the country to which he had
                        been sent. After the rumour proved groundless he went down in the same ship
                        to Scodra, and sent to ask for permission to interview the praetor.
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> His request was granted and he went
                        to the camp. He began his speech by blaming his own folly, and then, falling
                        on his knees, amidst tears and supplications he placed himself entirely in
                        the hands of the praetor. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> He was told to
                        be of good courage, and even received an invitation to supper. He went back
                        to the city to see his friends, and was for that day treated with all honour
                        at the praetor's table. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> The next thing
                        was his being handed over to the custody of C. Cassius, one of the military
                        tribunes, after having, himself a king, received from a king a paltry ten
                            <milestone n="15??" unit="section"/> talents-hardly as much as a

                        /> Anicius had brought the war in Illyria to a close in less than a month,
                        and Perpenna was sent to Rome to announce his victory. A few days later he
                        sent Gentius to Rome, together with his mother, his wife, his children and
                        his brother, and also some of the principal men of Illyria. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> This is the only war the close of which was reported in
                        Rome before they had heard that it had begun. All through this time, Perseus
                        on his side was in a state of great alarm by the advance of the consul
                        Aemilius who, he understood, was on the march in <milestone n="6??"

                        movement of Octavius with the Roman fleet menacing the coast. Eumenes and
                        Athenagoras were in command of Thessalonica with a small force of 2000
                        cetrati. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> He sent Androcles there also with
                        orders to remain encamped close to the naval arsenal; <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> 1000 cavalry under Creon of Antigonea were sent to
                        Aenea to guard the coast, so that at whatever point they heard the hostile
                        ships were threatening, they might at once go to the help of the country
                        folk; <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> 5000 Macedonians were sent to
                        garrison Pytho and Petra under the command of Histieaus, Theogenes and
                        Midon. After they had left, Perseus set himself to fortify the bank of the
                        Elpeus, because, as the river-bed was now dry, it could easily be crossed.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> To allow of the whole army being free
                        for this work, supplies of food were brought into the camp by women from the

                        follow him to the sea, which was less than 300 paces distant, and to dig at
                        short intervals from each other on the shore. <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> The towering height of the mountains led him to expect
                        that as no rivulets flowed from above the ground they contained hidden
                        streams which flowed as it were through veins into the sea and mingled with
                        its waters. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Hardly had the surface of the
                        sand been removed when springs bubbled up, muddy at first and scanty, but
                        they soon poured forth a clear and copious supply of water, as though it
                        were a gift from the gods. This incident added much to their general's
                        prestige and authority amongst the soldiers. <milestone n="4" unit="section"
                        /> Orders were then issued for the troops to get their arms ready, and the
                        consul with the military tribunes and the centurions of the first rank went
                        out to examine the place where they were to cross, where the men under arms
                        could find an easy descent, and where the ascent of the opposite bank
                        presented least difficulty. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> After
                        satisfying himself on these points, the consul's first care was that
                        everything should be done in an orderly fashion and without confusion, in
                        obedience to the word of command. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> When an
                        order was promulgated to all the troops at the same time, it was not
                        distinctly heard by everybody, and in their uncertainty as to what had been
                        said, some made additions for themselves and went beyond what had been
                        ordered, while some did less than they were told to do. Then confused shouts
                        arose throughout the column and the enemy knew the general's intentions
                        before they did. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> He therefore gave
                        directions for the military tribunes to communicate the order privately to
                        the first centurion of the legion and he was to notify what was to be done
                        to each of the centurions, rank by rank, whether the order was to be
                        transmitted from front to rear of the column or from rear to front. He also
                        forbade the sentinels to follow the new fashion of wearing their shields; a
                        sentinel did not go into battle to make use of his arms; his duty was on
                        becoming aware of the enemy's approach to retire and call the rest to arms.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> They used to stand, wearing their
                        helmets and holding their shields in front of them, and then, when they were
                        tired, they leaned on their spears, rested their heads on the rim of their
                        shields and went to sleep as they stood, so that the glitter of their armour
                        made them visible to the enemy while they themselves saw nothing in front of
                        them. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> He also altered the regulations with
                        regard to the outlying pickets. They used to stand all day under arms, the
                        cavalry with their horses bridled, and in the days of summer under a
                        cloudless and scorching sun, the men themselves and their horses were
                            <milestone n="10??" unit="section"/> so languid and exhausted by the
                        heat after so many hours that often, when attacked by a small body of the
                        enemy who were fresh and unwearied, they were discomfited, though greatly
                        superior in numbers. He thereupon gave orders that those who were sent out
                        in the morning should quit their posts at noon and be relieved by others who
                        went on duty for the rest of the day. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> In
                        this way it was never possible for a fresh and unwearied enemy to attack
                        them when they were suffering from fatigue. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> After Aemilius had paraded his troops and
                        announced to them his intention of making these reforms, he went on to
                        address them on very much the same lines as in his speech to the Assembly.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He reminded them that it was the duty
                        of the commander alone to provide for the welfare of his army and to advise
                        as to what ought to be done, sometimes alone and sometimes in consultation
                        with those whom he has called into council. <milestone n="3" unit="section"
                        /> Those who were not called into council had no right to ventilate their
                        own opinions either publicly or privately. It was the soldier's duty to be
                        careful about these three things: To keep his body as strong and agile as
                        possible; to keep his arms in good order, and to have his food ready against
                        any sudden order of his commander. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> All
                        other matters, he must understand, are under the care of the gods and of his
                        general. In an army where the soldiers take upon them to give advice and the
                        general is swayed by the opinions of the multitude, there is no safety.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> He, as their commander, would do his
                        duty and be on the watch to give them an opportunity of fighting a
                        successful battle. It was not for them to ask what was going to happen, as
                        soon as the signal was given, it was their duty to do all that a soldier
                        could do. </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> With these instructions he dismissed the
                        troops, and even the veterans generally confessed that on that day they had
                        for the first time, as though they were raw recruits, learnt what military
                        service meant. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> And it was not only by
                        remarks of this kind that they showed how greatly they appreciated the
                        consul's words-they began at once to act on them. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> In a short time you would see no one in the camp idle;
                        some were sharpening their swords; others rubbing up their helmets and
                        cheek-pieces and their cuirasses; others fastening on their armour and
                        testing their agility under its weight; others poising their spears; others
                        again making their swords flash with rapid thrusts and keeping their eyes on
                        the point. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> So that anyone could easily see
                        that on the very first opportunity of coming to close quarters with the
                        enemy they would finish the war by a splendid victory or, in their own case,
                        by a glorious death. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Perseus, too, when
                        he saw that after the consul's arrival-it was the beginning of spring as
                        well-all was bustle and movement with the enemy as though for a fresh
                        campaign, and that the camp was shifted from Phila to the bank of the river,
                        and the consul was going on his rounds, at one time to inspect the works and
                        evidently looking out for a place where he could cross the river; at another

                        Romans and produced considerable alarm amongst the Macedonians and their
                        king. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> At first he tried to stifle the
                        report by sending to Pantauchus, who was on his way to the camp, to forbid
                        him from entering it; but some boys, who were being taken away amongst the
                        Illyrian hostages, had been seen by their friends. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> So the greater the pains taken to conceal the details,
                        the more easily did they leak out through the love of gossip in the king's
                        Court. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Just after this the envoys from
                        Rhodes arrived at the Roman camp bringing with them the same demand for
                        peace which had so roused the ire of the Roman senate. They received a much
                        more hostile hearing from the council of war in the camp. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> Some thought they ought to be driven helter-skelter out
                        of the camp; the consul said he would give them an answer in a fortnight's
                        time. Meanwhile, to make it clear how far the influence of the Rhodians
                        extended in their efforts to bring about peace, he began to discuss the plan
                        of operations with his council. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Some,
                        mainly the younger officers, were for crossing the Elpeus and storming the
                        opposite bank and the defensive works above it. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> After their expulsion the year before from their forts,
                        which were on higher ground, better fortified and strongly held, they
                        thought the Macedonians would be unable to stand a general attack made in
                        full force. Others were of opinion that Octavius ought to take his fleet to
                        Thessalonica and devastate the coast. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> By
                        thus menacing his rear they would compel the king to divide his forces and
                        march away to protect the interior of his kingdom, thus leaving the passage
                        of the river in some direction open. The consul considered the river bank
                        insurmountable, owing to its steepness and the works which defended it,
                        especially as artillery was in position everywhere, and he had heard that
                        the enemy used their missile weapons more skillfully, and with a surer aim. </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The consul had quite made up his mind to
                        adopt another course, and the council broke up. There were two Perrhaebian
                        traders, Coenus and Menophilus, whose honesty and sagacity he knew he could
                        trust. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> He sent for them and questioned
                        them privately about the routes leading into Perrhaebia. They told him that
                        the country was not difficult; it was held by detachments of the king's
                        troops. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Hearing this he thought that by a
                        sudden night attack delivered in force, when the enemy were not expecting
                        it, they could be dislodged and driven back. Javelins and arrows and other
                        missiles were useless in the dark, when it was impossible to see what to aim
                        at; it was in close hand-to-hand fighting with the sword, in the melee of
                        battle, that the Roman soldier was victorious. <milestone n="12"
                            unit="section"/> He decided to take these men as guides, and sent for
                        Octavius, to whom he explained his plans, and he gave him instructions to
                        sail to Heracleum and have in readiness ten days' rations for 1000 men.
                            <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> P. Scipio Nasica and Q. Fabius
                        Maximus, his own son, were sent overland to Heracleum with 5000 select
                        troops, as though they were going on board the fleet to devastate the
                        Macedonian coast-the scheme which had been advocated in the council.
                            <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> They were privately informed that, to
                        avoid any delay, there was food ready for these troops on board the fleet.
                        The two guides were then ordered so to regulate the length of each day's
                        march as to allow of an attack being made on Pythium in the fourth watch of
                        the third day. </p>

                        attention elsewhere, the consul, at dawn on the following day, commenced an
                        action with the enemy's outposts in the middle of the river-bed, and the
                        fighting was kept up by the light infantry on both sides; heavier troops
                        could not possibly fight on such uneven ground. <milestone n="16"
                            unit="section"/> From the top of each bank down to the river-bed was
                        about 300 paces; the actual channel of the river between the banks, which
                        varied in depth, was over a mile wide. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>
                        There in mid-channel the fight went on, the king watching it from his
                        intrenchments on the one side and the consul from the rampart surrounded by
                        his legionaries on the other. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> As long as
                        they were not in touch and could use their missiles the king's men fought at
                        an advantage, but when it came to close fighting the Roman was more steady
                        and better protected, whether by the shield or the Ligurian buckler.
                            <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> About noon the consul ordered the
                        retreat to be sounded, so the action was broken off for that day with a not
                        inconsiderable number killed on both sides. <milestone n="20" unit="section"
                        /> The next day the conflict was renewed at sunrise with even greater
                        bitterness, as their passions had been roused by the previous contest.
                            <milestone n="21" unit="section"/> But the Romans were wounded, not only
                        by those with whom they were actually fighting, but to a much greater extent
                        by the missiles of every kind which were discharged by the multitude of
                        assailants posted on the turrets, and especially by the huge stones from the
                        ballistae. Whenever they got nearer to the bank held by the enemy the
                        discharges from the catapults reached even the hindmost. After losing far
                        more on that day, the consul recalled his men somewhat later than the day
                        before. <milestone n="22" unit="section"/> On the third day he abstained
                        from fighting and went down to the lowest part of the camp, as if to attempt
                        a passage through that part of the enemy's line, which was carried down to
                        the sea. <milestone n="23" unit="section"/> . . . </p>

                        time of day was approaching noon; the march had been made amidst clouds of

                        and thirst were already felt, and it was certain that both would be
                        aggravated at high noon. The consul was determined not to expose his men
                        while thus suffering to an enemy who was fresh and in full vigour.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> But such was the eagerness of the men
                        for battle under any circumstances that it needed as much skill on the part
                        of the consul to beguile his own men as to deceive the enemy. <milestone

                        urged the military tribunes to hasten its formation; he rode round the ranks
                        and fired the spirits of the men by his words. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> On this they at first eagerly demanded the signal for
                        battle; then under the increasing heat their faces showed less animation and
                        their voices became weaker; some hung over their shields and propped
                        themselves up with their spears. Now at last he gave the order to the
                        centurions of the first rank to mark out the front line for a camp and to
                        deposit the baggage. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> When the soldiers
                        became aware of what was happening, some openly expressed their delight that
                        he <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/> had not compelled them to fight,
                        exhausted as they were with the toilsome march and the intense heat.

                        decision, namely, to give battle. Not even to them had he disclosed his
                        intention of delaying action. The sudden change of plan made nearly all of
                        them silent. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Nasica alone had the courage
                        to admonish the consul not to do as former commanders had done, and by
                        avoiding battle let the enemy slip through his fingers. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> If Perseus got away in the night, he was afraid that

                        heart of Macedonia, and they would spend the summer as previous generals had
                        done, in feeling their way through the passes and tracks of the Macedonian
                        mountains. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> He strongly advised the consul
                        to attack the enemy while he had him in level and open country, and not to

                        regard this as a portent, because this <milestone n="6??" unit="section"/>
                        happened in the natural order of things at stated intervals, and could be
                        known beforehand and predicted. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Just in
                        the same way, then, as they did not regard the regular rising and setting of

                        a thin and waning crescent as a marvel, so they ought not to take its
                        obscuration when it is hidden in the shadow of the earth for a supernatural

                        eclipse took place at the stated hour, and the Roman soldiers thought that
                        Gallus possessed almost divine wisdom. It gave a shock to the Macedonians as

                        be wasting time on the pretext of offering sacrifice, although the signal
                        for battle had been hoisted at dawn and he ought to have taken the field.

                        took upon himself to a large extent the duties and dangers which are usually
                        the lot of younger men. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The interval
                        between the "caetrati" and the divisions of the phalanx was filled up by the
                        legion, and thus the enemy's line was interrupted. The "caetrati" were in
                        their rear; the legion were fronting the shieldmen of the phalanx, who were
                        known as the "chalcaspides." <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> L. Albinus,
                        an ex-consul, was ordered to lead the second legion against the phalanx of
                        "leucaspides"; these formed the centre of the enemy's line. On the Roman
                        right, where the battle had begun, close to the river, he brought up the
                        elephants and the cohorts of allied troops. <milestone n="4" unit="section"
                        /> It was here that the Macedonians first gave ground. For just as most new
                        devices amongst men seem valuable as far as words go, but when they are put
                        to a practical test and have to be acted upon they fail to produce results,
                        so it was with the elephants; those of the Macedonians were of no use
                        whatever. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The contingents of the Latin
                        allies followed up the charge of the elephants and repulsed the left wing.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The second legion which had been sent
                        against the centre broke up the phalanx. The most probable explanation of
                        the victory is that several separate engagements were going on all over the
                        field, which first shook the phalanx out of its formation and then broke it
                        up. As long as it was compact, its front bristling with levelled spears, its
                        strength was irresistible. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> If by attacking
                        them at various points you compel them to bring round their spears, which
                        owing to their length and weight are cumbersome and unwieldy, they become a
                        confused and involved mass, but if any sudden and tumultuous attack is made
                        on their flank or rear, they go to pieces like a falling house. <milestone
                            n="8" unit="section"/> In this way they were forced to meet the repeated
                        charges of small bodies of Roman troops with their front dislocated in many
                        places, and wherever there were gaps the Romans worked their way amongst
                        their ranks. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> If the whole line had made a
                        general charge against the phalanx while still unbroken, as the Paeligni did
                        at the beginning of the action against the "caetrati," they would have
                        spitted themselves upon their spears and have been powerless against their
                        massed attack. </p>

                        and Cotys and the Odrysaeans were following at his heels. <milestone n="3"

                        their ranks unbroken, because the infantry were between them and the enemy,
                        and the latter were so fully occupied in massacring the infantry that they
                        forgot to pursue the cavalry. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> For a long
                        time the slaughter of the phalanx went on in front, flank and rear. At last
                        those who had escaped out of the hands of the enemy threw away their arms
                        and fled to the shore; some even went into the water and, stretching out
                        their hands in supplication to the men in the fleet, implored them to save
                        their lives. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> When they saw boats from all

                        further into the water, some even swimming. <milestone n="6" unit="section"
                        /> But when they found that they were being killed by the men in the boats,
                        those who could swim back to land met with a more wretched fate, for the
                        elephants, forced by their drivers to the water's edge, trampled on them and
                        crushed them to death as they came out. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> It
                        is universally admitted that never had so many Macedonians been killed by
                        the Romans in a single battle. As many as 20,000 men perished; 6000 who had
                        fled to Pydna fell into the enemy's hands, and 5000 were made prisoners in
                        their flight. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Of the victors not more than
                        100 fell, and of these the majority were Paelignians; the wounded were much

                        Roman fleet had put in at Emathia, and the fields all round were being
                        ravaged. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The officers in charge of Emathia
                        implored him to send the garrison to deal with the ravagers. <milestone
                            n="6" unit="section"/> After reading the despatch he urged the Thracians
                        to go and defend the coast of Emathia; they would inflict great slaughter on
                        the Romans while scattered through the fields, and would also secure large
                        booty. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> At the same time he made light of
                        the report of an unfavourable battle; if, he said, it were true, fugitive
                        after fugitive would have come in fresh from the fight. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> In this way he got rid of the Thracians, and as soon as
                        he saw that they had crossed the Strymon, he shut the gates. </p>

                        arrived at Amphipolis, and from that city he sent heralds with a caduceus to
                        Paulus. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> In the meanwhile Hippias, Midon,
                        and Pantauchus, the principal men among the king's friends who had fled from
                        the field of battle to Beroea, went and made their surrender to the Roman
                        consul. In the case of others also, their fears prompted them, one after
                        another, to do the same. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The consul sent
                        his son Q. Fabius, together with L. Lentulus and Q. Metellus, with
                        despatches to Rome announcing his victory. He gave the spoils taken from the
                        enemy's army lying on the field of battle to the foot soldiers and the
                        plunder from the surrounding country to the cavalry on condition that they
                        were not <milestone n="4??" unit="section"/> absent from the camp more than
                        two nights. The camp at Pydna was shifted to a site nearer the sea.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> First of all Beroea, then Thessalonica
                        and Pella, and almost the whole of Macedonia, city by city, surrendered
                        within two days. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The people of Pydna, who
                        were the nearest to the consul, had not yet sent envoys, for their citizens
                        were prevented from coming to any decision in their council by the mixed
                        population drawn from many nationalities and also by the crowd of fugitives
                        from the battle. The gates were not only closed but walled up. <milestone
                            n="7" unit="section"/> Midon and Pantauchus were sent up to the walls to
                        hold a parley with Solon, the commandant of the garrison; by his means the
                        mob of fighting men was sent way. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The
                        surrendered town was given up to the soldiers to plunder. Perseus' one hope
                        was in the help of the Bisaltians, but finding this hope vain he came before
                        the assembled citizens of <milestone n="9??" unit="section"/> Amphipolis,
                        with his son Philip, with the intention of kindling the courage of the
                        Amphipolitans themselves and of the men, both infantry and cavalry, who had
                        accompanied him or been carried there in their flight. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> But as often as he tried to speak he was prevented by
                        his tears, and finding that he could not utter a word, he told Euander what
                        he wanted to bring before the people and went down from the tribunal.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The sight of the king and his
                        distressful weeping moved the people themselves to groans and tears, but
                        they would not listen to Euander. Some in the middle of the Assembly had the
                        audacity to shout out, "Go away, both of you, lest we, the few survivors,
                        perish on your account." <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Their daring
                        opposition closed Euander's lips. Then the king retired to his house, and
                        after placing an amount of gold and silver on board some boats lying in the
                        Strymon, went down to the river. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> The
                        Thracians would not venture on board and dispersed to their homes, so did
                        the rest of the soldiers; the Cretans, attracted by the money, followed him.
                        As the distribution of it amongst them would cause more jealousy than
                        gratitude, 50 talents were placed on the bank to be scrambled for. Whilst
                        they were going on board, after the scrambling, in wild confusion, they sunk
                        a boat in the mouth of the river through overcrowding. <milestone n="14"
                            unit="section"/> That day they arrived at Galepsus and the day after
                        they reached Samothrace, for which they were making. <milestone n="15"

                        king's flight he sent P. Nasica with a small detachment of horse and foot to
                        Amphipolis for the purpose of ravaging Sintice and frustrating any attempt
                        which the king might make. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> At the same
                        time Meliboea was taken and sacked by Cn. Octavius. Cn. Anicius was sent to
                        Aegeum, but as the citizens did not know that the war was over they made a
                        sortie from the town and the Romans lost 200 men. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> The following day the consul left Pydna with the whole
                        of his army and formed his camp two miles distant from Pella. He remained
                        there several days, surveying the city from every side, and he observed that
                        it was not without good reason that it had been chosen as the royal
                        residence. It is situated on the south-west slope of a hill and surrounded
                        by a marsh too deep to be crossed on foot either in summer or winter.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The citadel the "Phacus," which is
                        close to the city, stands in the marsh itself, <milestone n="6??"
                            unit="section"/> projecting like an island, and is built on a huge
                        substructure which is strong enough to carry a wall and prevent any damage
                        from the infiltration from the water of the lagoon. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> At a distance it appears to be continuous with the city
                        wall, but it is really separated by a channel which flows between the two
                        walls and is connected with the city by a bridge. Thus it cuts off all means
                        of access from an external foe, and if the king shut anyone up there, there
                        could be no possibility of escape except by the bridge, which could be very
                        easily guarded. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The royal treasure was
                        kept there, but nothing was found there at that time beyond the 300 talents
                        which had been sent to Gentius and then kept back. <milestone n="9"

                        embassies of congratulation were received, mostly from Thessaly. On
                        receiving intelligence that Perseus had sailed to Samothrace the consul left
                        Pella, and after a few days' march arrived at Amphipolis. <milestone n="10"
