                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> While these incidents were occurring in
                        Rome-if indeed they did occur in this year-both consuls were engaged in war
                        with the Ligurians. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> That enemy seemed born
                        to keep up the military discipline of the Romans in the intervals between
                        the more important wars; no other field of operations did more to whet the
                        soldiers' courage. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> In Asia the pleasures
                        of city life, the ample supply of luxuries furnished by land and sea, the
                        effeminacy of the enemy, and the princely wealth had enriched the armies
                        instead of making them more efficient. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                        Especially under the command of Manlius they became careless and
                        undisciplined, and so the somewhat rougher march through Thrace and a more
                        warlike enemy gave them a much-needed lesson through severe defeat.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> In Liguria there was everything to try
                        a soldier's mettle; a rough and difficult country, mountainous heights which
                        it cost the men as much labour to secure for themselves as it did to
                        dislodge the enemy from them; steep narrow roads where there was always the
                        danger of an ambush; an enemy lightly armed, rapid in his movements, sudden
                        in his onset, who never allowed any place or hour to remain quiet and
                        undisturbed. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Any attack on a fortified
                        position involved much toil and danger; there was but little to be got out
                        of the country, and the soldiers were reduced to scanty food, as they could
                        secure very little plunder. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Consequently,
                        there were no camp-followers, no extended line of baggage animals; there was
                        nothing beyond the arms and the men who depended solely upon them.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Occasions of fighting were never
                        lacking, for the natives driven by their poverty were in the habit of
                        raiding their neighbours' fields; they never, however, engaged in a pitched
                        battle. </p>

                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="2" type="chapter">
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The consul C. Flaminius, after several
                        successful actions with the Ligurian Freniates, accepted their surrender and
                        disarmed them. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> As they evaded this demand,
                        he took severe measures with them, on which they abandoned their villages
                        and took refuge on Mt. Auginus, the consul following in close pursuit.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> In scattered parties, mostly without
                        arms, they fled precipitately over trackless and rocky ground, where their
                        enemy could not follow them, and in this way escaped across the Apennines.
                        Those who had held to their camp were surrounded and driven out. The legions
                        were then led across the Apennines. The Gauls were protected for a short
                        time by the mountain height which they had occupied, but they soon made
                        their surrender. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> This time there was a
                        closer search made for arms and they were all secured. From them the war was
                        transferred to the Apuani, whose continual incursions into the territories
                        of Pisa and Bononia made any cultivation of the soil impossible. <milestone
                            n="5" unit="section"/> The consul thoroughly vanquished these also and
                        so brought peace to their neighbours. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Now
                        that the province was brought from a state of war into one of peace and
                        quiet, he determined that his soldiers should not be kept in idleness, so he
                        employed them in constructing a road from Bononia to Arretium. <milestone
                            n="7" unit="section"/> The other consul, M. Aemilius, destroyed and
                        burnt the farms and villages of the Ligurians who dwelt in the lowland
                        country the inhabitants having previously fled and taken possession of the
                        heights of Ballista and Suismontium. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> He
                        then attacked them on the mountains, harassing them with skirmishes, and at
                        last forcing them into a regular engagement, in which he completely defeated
                        them. During the battle he vowed a temple to Diana. As all the tribes south
                        of the Apennines were now subjugated, Aemilius advanced against those on the
                        other side of the range, including those of the Freniates with whom C.
                        Flaminius had not been in touch. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> He
                        reduced them all to submission, deprived them of their arms and brought down
                        the whole population from the mountains into the plains. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> After establishing peace in Liguria he led his army
                        into Gaul and made a road from Placentia to Ariminum to join the Via
                        Flaminia. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> In the last pitched battle he
                        fought in Liguria he vowed a temple to Queen Juno. These were the events of
                        the year in Liguria. </p>

                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> In Gaul all was peaceful, but the praetor
                        M. Furius, anxious to make it appear as though he were engaged in war,
                        deprived the unoffending Cenomani of their arms. <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> They sent to Rome to complain and were referred by the
                        senate to Aemilius, who was empowered to investigate the case. <milestone
                            n="3" unit="section"/> There was a long and heated debate with the
                        praetor, but they maintained their ground throughout, and Furius was ordered
                        to restore their arms and leave his province. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> The senate then gave audience to the deputations who
                        had come from all the cities and colonies of the Latin allies. Their
                        grievance was that a large number of their citizens had migrated to Rome and
                        were placed on the census there. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Q.
                        Terentius Culleo, one of the praetors, was charged with the task of finding
                        them out, and whoever was proved to have been registered at home during the
                        censorship of C. Claudius and M. Livius or their successors, he was to order
                        his return to the city in which he had been registered; 12,000 Latins
                        returned in consequence to their homes. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        Even then the City was overcrowded by the multitude of immigrants. </p>

                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Before the consuls returned to Rome M.
                        Fulvius came back from Aetolia. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He had an
                        audience of the senate in the temple of Apollo and gave a detailed report of
                        his operations in Aetolia and Cephallenia. He then asked the senate to pass
                        a resolution that it was right and proper, in consideration of the success
                        and good fortune with which he had served the State, that honours should be
                        paid to the immortal gods and that a triumph should be decreed to him.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> M. Albutius, one of the tribunes of
                        the plebs, declared his intention of vetoing any decree which should be
                        passed before the arrival of M. Aemilius. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                        The consul had wished to speak against it, and on his departure for his
                        province had charged him, the tribune, to reserve all discussion of the
                        question till his return. Fulvius, he argued, would lose nothing by the
                        delay; even when the consul was present, the senate would decree what it
                        wished. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> To this Fulvius replied: "Even if
                        Aemilius' hostility to him and the arbitrary and dictatorial temper he
                        showed towards his opponents were not a matter of common knowledge, still it
                        would be intolerable that an absent consul should stand in the way of honour
                        being paid to the immortal gods and should <milestone n="6??" unit="section"
                        /> delay a triumph which was well earned and justly due, or that a general
                        who had achieved brilliant success should be standing before the gate of the
                        City with his <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/> victorious army and the
                        spoils of war and the prisoners until the consul, who was for this very
                        purpose delaying his movements, should please to return to Rome. But as a
                        matter of fact his differences with the consul were notorious. <milestone
                            n="8" unit="section"/> What fair dealing could any one look for from the
                        man who in a thinly attended and secret meeting of the senate got a
                        resolution carried and deposited in the treasury in the temple of Saturn
                        stating that there was no evidence that Ambracia had been carried by
                        assault. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Why, that city was besieged by
                        agger and vineae, and when the siege-works were burnt, new ones were

                        Still worse things were witnessed amongst his soldiers every day' for it was
                        through the army serving in Asia that the beginnings of foreign luxury were
                        introduced into the City. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> These men

                        furniture-pedestal tables and silver salvers. <milestone n="8"

                        should be paid out of the money borne in the triumphal procession. The

                        Fecenia who, though she was a courtesan, was worthy of better things than

                        his reputation or his purse. She sought his company and his love
                        unsolicited, and as his parents kept him close in every way, he was
                        maintained by the girl's generosity. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Her

                        surprised if he absented himself from her for some nights; he had a
                        religious duty to perform, the discharge of a vow made while he was ill, and
                        he intended therefore to be initiated into the Bacchic mysteries. <milestone

                        to lament the youth's misfortunes, robbed as he had been of his fortune by

                        priestesses. Paculla Annia, a Campanian, when she was priestess, made a
                        complete change, as though by divine monition, for she was the first to
                        admit men, and she initiated her own sons, Minius Cerinnius and Herennius

                        against fires, five men were appointed to assist the commissioners and take

                        brought forward by the consul Q. Marcius and made the subject of a decree,
                        namely, the cases of those whom the consuls had employed as informers. The
                        question was left for the senate to deal with as soon as Sp. Postumius had
                        closed his inquiry and returned to Rome. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                        The senate decided that Minius Cerrinius, the Campanian, should be sent in
                        chains to Ardea, and that the magistrates there should be warned to keep him
                        in custody under close observation to prevent not only his escape but any
                        chance of his committing suicide. After some time Sp. Postumius returned to
                        Rome. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He brought up the question of the
                        rewards to be given to P. Aebutius and Hispala Fecenia, as it was owing to
                        them that the Bacchanalia had been detected. <milestone n="4" unit="section"
                        /> The senate decided that the City praetor should give each of them 100,000
                        ases out of the treasury, and that the consul should arrange with the
                        tribunes to propose to the plebs on the first opportunity that P. Aebutius
                        should be exempted from military conscription, and not compelled, unless he
                        wished, to serve in either the infantry or the cavalry. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> To Fecenia was granted the right of disposing of her
                        property in any way she chose, of marrying out of her gens, and selecting
                        her own guardian, just as though a husband had left her this power in his
                        will. She was also at liberty to marry a free-born citizen, and whoever
                        married her should not suffer in reputation or position. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> Moreover, the consuls and praetors then in office, and
                        those who should succeed them, were to make it their care that no harm
                        should happen to the woman but that she should live a safe life. These
                        proposals the senate considered equitable and thought it right that they
                        should be adopted. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> They were submitted to
                        the plebs and the resolution of the senate was confirmed, and the consuls
                        were to secure the impunity of the other informers and decide upon their
                        rewards. </p>

                        150 cavalry, together with a contingent from the Latin allies of 5000
                        infantry and 200 cavalry. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> This province
                        had been decreed to his colleague in conjunction with him, and he, too,

                        They took over the armies which the previous consuls had commanded, and on

                        required the Latin allies to furnish 20,000 infantry and 800 cavalry, and
                        called up 3000 Roman infantry and 200 cavalry as well. The whole of this
                        force, with the exception of the legions, was destined to reinforce the

                        fought a pitched battle with the Lusitanians in the neighbourhood of Hasta.

                        be the weaker side. They were worsted in the battle; 12,000 were killed,
                        2000 made prisoners, and the Romans gained possession of their camp.

                        Tamphilus. The war which was threatening with Perseus and the Macedonians
                        did not owe its origin to what most people imagined, nor was it due to the
                        action of Perseus himself. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Its beginnings
                        were prepared by Philip, and had he lived longer, he would himself have

                        Naupactus, and the consul, hastening there, mollified Philip's anger by

                        indignation against the Romans. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The
                        Thessalians and Perrhaebians protested against his retaining possession of
                        their cities; envoys from Eumenes complained of the forcible occupation of
                        towns in Thrace and the removal of the population into Macedonia. The
                        reception given to these remonstrances made it clear that they would not be
                        ignored. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> What created the deepest
                        impression on the senate was the information they had received that he was
                        contemplating the seizure of Aenus and Maronea; they were less interested in
                        the Thessalians. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Delegates also appeared
                        from Athamania, the burden of whose complaint was not the loss of a part of
                        their country but the subjection of the whole of Athamania to the power and
                        rule of the king. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Some Maronite refugees
                        were present who had been expelled because they had tried to defend their
                        liberty against the king's garrison. They declared that not only Maronea but
                        Aenus also was in Philip's power. Envoys came from Philip to defend him
                        against these charges. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> They affirmed that
                        nothing had been done without the sanction of the Roman generals; <milestone
                            n="11" unit="section"/> that the cities of the Thessalians and
                        Perrhaebians and Magnetes, as well as the people of Athamania with their
                        king Amynander, were in the same case as the Aetolians. <milestone n="12"
                            unit="section"/> For when after the expulsion of Antiochus the consul
                        was engaged in the reduction of the cities of Aetolia, he sent Philip to
                        take the cities in question; they were his by the rights of war. <milestone
                            n="13" unit="section"/> The senate would not come to any decision in the
                        king's absence, and accordingly they sent Q. Caecilius, M Baebius Tamphilus
                        and Ti. Sempronius, as special commissioners, to settle the dispute.
                            <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Previous to their arrival, notice was
                        sent to all the cities concerned that a council would be convened at Tempe
                        in Thessaly. </p>

                        commissioners appearing as arbitrators, the Thessalians, Perrhaebians and
                        Athamanians as open accusers, and Philip, who had to listen to the charges
                        against him, as <milestone n="2??" unit="section"/> defendant-the leaders of
                        the different delegations revealed their characters in the attitude they
                        assumed towards Philip, whether of sympathy or of more or less violent
                        antagonism. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The dispute turned upon the
                        status of the cities of Philippopolis, Tricca, Phaloria, Eurymenae, and the
                        other towns in their neighbourhood. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Did
                        they belong of right to the Thessalians, though they had been forcibly
                        seized and taken possession of by the Aetolians-for it was admitted that it
                        was from the Aetolians that Philip had wrested them-or had they always been
                        Aetolian towns? <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> It was argued that Acilius
                        had granted them to the king on the understanding that they belonged to the
                        Aetolians, and had joined their League voluntarily, not under the compulsion
                        of arms. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> A similar question arose with
                        regard to the towns in Perrhaebia and Magnesia, for the Aetolians, by
                        seizing all these towns as they had opportunity, had made their rightful
                        position uncertain. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> To these matters in
                        dispute were added the complaints of the Thessalians, who pointed out that
                        if those towns were restored to them as they were, he would restore them
                        plundered and deserted. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Besides those lost
                        through the accidents of war, he had carried off 500 of their young men to
                        Macedonia, where they were wasting their energies in servile tasks, and
                        whatever he was compelled to restore to the Thessalians, he took care to
                        render of no further use. In former times the one mercantile port which the
                        Thessalians had access to was Phthian Thebes, from which they derived profit
                        and revenue. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The king fitted out a number
                        of merchant ships there which made their voyages past Thebes to Demetrias,
                        and so diverted all sea-borne traffic from that port. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> Now things had come to such a pass that he did not
                        shrink from doing violence to their envoys, who were protected by the law of
                        nations; he had waylaid and captured them on their way to T. Quinctius.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The whole of Thessaly was in
                        consequence so intimidated that no one dared to open his mouth, either in
                        their cities or in their national council. The Romans, the authors of their
                        liberties, were far away; an oppressive tyrant was close at their side,
                        making it impossible for them to enjoy the benefits which the people of Rome
                        had conferred upon them. What liberty was there, where there was no liberty
                        of speech? Even now, whilst relying on the protection of the commissioners,
                        they were uttering groans rather than coherent words. <milestone n="12"
                            unit="section"/> Unless the Romans devised some means of checking
                        Philip's audacity and relieving the fears of the Greek neighbours of
                        Macedonia, his defeat and their liberation would be in vain. If he does not
                        obey, he must, like a stubborn horse, be coerced with a severer bit.
                            <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> These bitter invectives were from
                        those who spoke last; the former speakers had softened his resentment by
                        asking him to pardon their speaking in defence of their liberties.
                            <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> They expressed a hope that he would
                        lay aside the <milestone n="15??" unit="section"/> harshness of a master and
                        reconcile himself to becoming their friend and ally, and so follow the
                        example of the Romans who prefer to extend their alliances through affection
                        and not through fear. After the Thessalians, the Perrhaebians stated their
                        case. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> They claimed Gonnocondylum, which
                        Philip had re-named Olympias, as belonging to Perrhaebia, and pleaded for
                        its restoration. The same request was made with regard to Malloea and
                        Ericinium. The Athamanians sought to recover their independence and the
                        fortified posts of Athenaeum and Poetneum. </p>

                        rather than defendant. He began by charging the Thessalians with seizing
                        Menelais in Dolopia by force of arms, a place which belonged to his
                        dominions, and in conjunction with the Perrhaebians capturing also Petra in
                        Pieria. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Even Xynias, beyond all doubt an
                        Aetolian town, had been forced to join their confederacy, and without a
                        shadow of right they had made themselves masters of Parachelois, which was
                        under Athamania. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> As to the charges brought
                        against him of waylaying envoys, of causing the fulness or emptiness of
                        seaports, the latter was absurd; he was not responsible for the preference
                        which traders or skippers showed for certain ports; <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> and as to the former, it was quite alien from his
                        character. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Through all these years,
                        charges had been continually made against him either to the Roman generals
                        or to the Roman senate. Who had ever been injured even by a word? 'They said
                        that a plot was once formed against those who were going to Quinctius, but
                        they did not go on to say what happened to them. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> These are the accusations of men who are hunting for
                        false charges, since they have nothing true to go upon. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> The Thessalians in their insolence were shamelessly
                        abusing the indulgence of the people of Rome; like men who after a long
                        thirst drank wine too eagerly, they were intoxicated with liberty.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Like slaves suddenly and unexpectedly
                        manumitted, they show their freedom by putting no constraint on their speech
                        and language and showering abuse on their late masters. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> Then in a towering rage he exclaimed: "The evening of

                        as a threat against themselves. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> When the
                        murmurs of disapprobation at these words had died away, he replied to the
                        Perrhaebian and Athamanian envoys, and maintained that the cities which they
                        represented were in the same position as the others; Acilius and the Romans
                        had given them to him at a time when they belonged to the enemy. <milestone

                        of Eumenes, who asserted that if the Romans wished Aenus and Maronea to be
                        free, their sense of honour forbade them to say more, unless it was to warn
                        them to leave those people in the enjoyment of a real and not merely nominal
                        liberty, and not to allow their boon to be intercepted by some one else.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> But if they thought the question of
                        the Thracian cities comparatively unimportant, it would be much more
                        reasonable that those which had been under Antiochus should be held as

                            unit="section"/> This would be a return to Eumenes for the services of

                        Philip, and also for what he had himself done in sharing all their toils and
                        dangers on land and sea. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Moreover, Eumenes
                        had the decision of the ten commissioners in his favour, for in giving him
                        the Chersonese and Lysimachia they certainly gave him Aenus and Maronea as
                        well, for these two places owing to their proximity formed appendages as it

                        They told the commissioners that the king's troops were not confined to one
                        part of the city, as in other places, but were dispersed everywhere; the
                        city was full of Macedonians. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The king's
                        adherents were complete masters; they alone were allowed to speak in the

                        line; Philip subsequently constructed a new road by which he took in the

                        reply from that which he adopted towards the Thessalians and Perrhaebians.
                        "My contention," he began, "is not with the Maronites or with Eumenes, but

                        right that the cities of the Macedonians which revolted from me during the
                        suspension of hostilities should be restored to me; not that these would
                        have been a great addition to my kingdom, for they are small places situated
                        on the extreme frontiers, but because such an example would have gone far to
                        restrain the rest of the Macedonians. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> This
                        has been refused me. During the Aetolian war I was instructed by Manius
                        Acilius to attack Lamia, and when after long and weary siege operations and
                        fighting I was at last surmounting the walls, and the city was all but
                        taken, the consul recalled me, and compelled me to draw off my troops.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> As some consolation for this

                        view. Unless the Romans had-I will not say conquered, but even-undertaken
                        that war, Eumenes could not have remained on his throne. So it is he who is

                        was any part of my kingdom from being in danger, that when Antiochus sought

                        all the cities of Greece which he had previously held, I rejected his offer
                        and declared myself his enemy even before Manius Acilius landed his army in

                        and this not through Macedonia only, but through Thrace as well, where

                        impression on the commissioners. Their reply was a compromise; nothing was

                        to the senate. In order that matters might remain as they were, the

                        no commander should enjoy a triumph unless he had brought back his army, or
                        unless he left to his successor a province thoroughly subjugated and
                        pacified. However, the intermediate honour was allowed to Manlius; he was to

                        at a distance of twelve miles from the Tagus. Then, taking up the standards
                        and forming into a closed square, they reached the Tagus at daybreak.

                        Quinctius on the left. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The enemy remained
                        quiet-taken aback at the sudden advance of the Romans and making up their

                        divisions on their side of the river, they decided to engage them before
                        they could form a united front, and swarming out of their camp they rushed
                        down to battle. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The fighting began very
                        fiercely, as the Spaniards were full of spirit after their recent victory,
                        and the Romans were smarting under their unwonted humiliation. <milestone
                            n="3" unit="section"/> The Roman centre, formed by two of the bravest
                        legions, fought most gallantly, and the enemy finding themselves unable to
                        dislodge them in any other way, formed themselves into a wedge and thus
                        massed, the ranks behind always more numerous than those in front, they
                        forced the centre back. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> When he saw that
                        the line was in trouble, Calpurnius sent two of his staff, T. Quinctilius
                        Varus and L. Juventius Thalna, one to each legion, to stimulate their
                        courage, and warn them that all hopes of victory or of keeping their hold on

                        made a short detour and charged the flank of the enemy's wedge as it was
                        pressing back the centre, and Quinctilius delivered a similar charge on the
                        other side. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> But the cavalry under
                        Calpurnius fought with much the greater determination, and he, himself, most
                        of all. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> He was the first to strike down an
                        enemy, and he rode so far into the hostile ranks that it was difficult to
                        recognise to which side he belonged. The praetor's conspicuous courage fired
                        the cavalry, and the cavalry fired the infantry. <milestone n="9"

                        urged on their standard-bearers, shouting to them to carry their standards
                        forward, and then called upon the soldiers to follow them up. <milestone
                            n="10" unit="section"/> The battle-shout rose again from the whole army,
                        and they dashed forward as if they were charging from higher ground. Just
                        like a mountain torrent they bore down and swept away their unnerved foe,
                        and as rank after rank pressed on, they carried all before them. <milestone

                        camp, and mingling with the crowded enemy forced their way into it. Here a
                        fresh battle began with those left to guard the camp, and the Roman troops
                        were obliged to dismount and fight on foot. <milestone n="12" unit="section"

                        neighbourhood, and the rest, only half-armed, straggled about the country.
                        The enemy had numbered more than 35,000, out of whom this small number alone
                        survived the battle. One hundred and thirty-two standards were captured.

                        for their own camp, they remained in the enemy's camp. The next day
                        Calpurnius addressed words of thanks and praise to the cavalry, and

                        was standing for the consulship. The other patrician candidates were L.

                        Galba. They had been unsuccessful in previous contests, and they considered
                        that they had all the stronger claim to the honour because it had been
                        denied them before. Only one consul could be a patrician, and this lent
                        additional keenness to the contest. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The
                        plebeian candidates were all popular men: L. Porcius, Q. Terentius Culleo
                        and Cnaeus Baebius Tamphilus, and they, too, had had their hopes of
                        attaining the distinction deferred by previous defeats. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> Out of all the candidates, Claudius was the only new
                        one. It was generally looked upon as a certainty that Q. Fabius Labeo and L.
                        Porcius Licinius would be the successful candidates. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> But Claudius, unattended by his lictors, was bustling
                        about with his brother in every corner of the Forum, notwithstanding the

                        and of most of the senators, who told him to bear in mind that he was the
                        consul of the people of Rome rather than that he was Publius' brother.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> "Why," they asked, "did he not take
                        his seat on the tribunal and show himself as a witness or silent spectator
                        of the proceedings?" In spite of all, he could not be restrained from his
                        zealous exertions. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The elections were
                        from time to time disturbed by heated quarrels between the tribunes of the
                        plebs; some were fighting against the consul, and some in his support. At
                        last Appius succeeded in defeating Fabius and carrying his brother in.
                            <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Contrary to his own expectation and
                        everybody else's, P. Claudius Pulcher was elected consul. L. Porcius
                        Licinius gained his position because he had conducted his canvass amongst
                        the plebeians in a temper of moderation, not with the violence of a
                        Claudius. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Those who were elected praetors
                        on the following day were C. Decimius Flavus, P. Sempronius Longus, P.

                        deplored the razing of their walls, the removal of the population as slaves
                        into Achaia, and the abolition of the laws of Lycurgus, on which up to that

                        on the Maronites. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He sent instructions to
                        Onomastus, the governor of the coastal district, to put to death the leaders
                        of the party opposed to him. There was a certain Casander, one of the king's
                        courtiers, who had been living a considerable time in Maronea. <milestone

                        been taken by assault. The Roman commissioners censured him for behaving so
                        cruelly to the unoffending Maronites and so defiantly towards the people of
                        Rome; those to whom the senate had guaranteed their liberty had been
                        butchered as though they were enemies. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                        Philip said that neither he nor any of his people were concerned in the

                        bring the city over to him, others to Eumenes; the commissioners could
                        easily get at the facts by questioning the Maronites themselves. <milestone

                        should make no enquiry, as though there was any doubt in his mind, the facts
                        were quite clear. If Philip wished to remove all suspicion, he must send

                        The king was so startled at this that the colour fled from his face. At

                        with the affair, seeing that he was not in Maronea nor anywhere near it?
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> He was anxious to keep Onomastus out

                        advanced against the latter and completely defeated them in a single battle,
                        taking Amodocus, their leader, prisoner. He had previously sent messages to
                        the barbarians dwelling round the Hister urging them to make an incursion

                        under orders to proceed from Macedonia to Achaia, and their arrival was
                        being awaited in the Peloponnese. The captain-general Lycortas summoned a
                        special meeting of the national council to decide upon the policy to be
                        adopted. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The subject of discussion was the
                        Lacedaemonians. From being enemies they had become accusers, and there was
                        fear lest they should be more dangerous now that they were defeated than

                        odium against him for aspiring to double honours, as if it were not

                        Though the Achaeans proved superior in the war, their captain-general
                        Philopoemen was taken prisoner. He was on his way to occupy Corone, against
                        which place the enemy were advancing, and whilst he was traversing a valley

                        surprised by the enemy. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> It is said that

                        was closing up his rear to meet the enemy's onset, and so give his cavalry a
                        chance of escaping through the narrow pass, his horse fell, and what with

                        great services, treated him just as if he had been their own general, lifted

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Prusias had for some time fallen under
                        suspicion in Rome, partly owing to his having sheltered Hannibal after the
                        flight of Antiochus and partly because he had started a war with Eumenes.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> T. Quinctius Flamininus was
                        accordingly sent on a special mission to him. He charged Prusias, amongst
                        other things, with admitting to his court the man who of all men living was
                        the most deadly foe to the People of Rome, who had instigated first his own
                        countrymen and then, when their power was broken, King Antiochus to levy war
                        on Rome. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Either owing to the menacing
                        language of Flamininus or because he wished to ingratiate himself with
                        Flamininus and the Romans, he formed the design of either putting Hannibal
                        to death or delivering him up to them. In any case, immediately after his
                        first interview with Flamininus he sent soldiers to guard the house in which
                        Hannibal was living. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Hannibal had always
                        looked forward to such a fate as this; he fully realised the implacable
                        hatred which the Romans felt towards him, and he put no trust whatever in
                        the good faith of monarchs. He had already had experience of Prusias'
                        fickleness of temper and he had dreaded the arrival of Flamininus as certain
                        to prove fatal to himself. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> In face of the
                        dangers confronting him on all sides he tried to keep open some one avenue
                        of escape. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> With this view he had
                        constructed seven exits from his house, some of them concealed, so that they
                        might not be blocked by the guard. But the tyranny of kings leaves nothing
                        hidden which they want to explore. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The
                        guards surrounded the house so closely that no one could slip out of it.
                        When Hannibal was informed that the king's soldiers were in the vestibule,
                        he tried to escape through a postern gate which afforded the most secret
                        means of exit. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> He found that this too was
                        closely watched and that guards were posted all round the place. Finally he
                        called for the poison which he had long kept in readiness for such an
                        emergency. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> "Let us," he said, "relieve the
                        Romans from the anxiety they have so long experienced, since they think it
                        tries their patience too much to wait for an old man's death. <milestone
                            n="10" unit="section"/> The victory which Flamininus will win over a
                        defenceless fugitive will be neither great nor memorable; this day will show
                        how vastly the moral of the Roman People has changed. <milestone n="11"
                            unit="section"/> Their fathers warned Pyrrhus, when he had an army in
                        Italy, to beware of poison, and now they have sent a man of consular rank to
                        persuade Prusias to murder his guest." <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                        Then, invoking curses on Prusias and his realm and appealing to the gods who
                        guard the rights of hospitality to punish his broken faith, he drained the
                        cup. Such was the close of Hannibal's life. </p>

                        was the year in which Scipio died. I do not agree with either of these
                        writers, nor with Valerius; I find that during the censorship of M. Porcius
                        and L. Valerius, Valerius was himself chosen as leader of the senate, though
                        Africanus had held that position through the two <milestone n="2??"
                            unit="section"/> previous censorships, and unless we are to assume that
                        he was removed from the senatorial roll-and there is no record of any such
                        stigma being affixed to his name-no other leader of the senate would have
                        been chosen. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Valerius Antias is proved to
                        be wrong by the following considerations. There was a tribune of the plebs,
                        M. Naevius, against whom Scipio delivered a speech which is still extant.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> From the lists of the magistrates it
                        appears that this Naevius was tribune of the plebs during the consulship of
                        P. Claudius and L. Porcius, but actually entered upon office on December 10,
                        when Appius Claudius and M. Sempronius were the consuls. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> Three months elapsed from that date to March I5, when
                        P. Claudius and L. Porcius assumed office. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        Thus it appears that Scipio was alive when Naevius was tribune and might
                        have been impeached by him, but dead before L. Valerius and M. Porcius were
                        censors. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> We may trace a correspondence in
                        the death of these three men, who were each the most illustrious of his
                        nation, for not only did they die about the same time, but not one of the
                        three ended his life in a way worthy of his splendid career. <milestone
                            n="8" unit="section"/> None of them died on his native soil or was
                        buried there. Hannibal and Philopoemen were carried off by poison; Hannibal
                        was an exile, and betrayed by his host, Philopoemen was a captive and died
                        in prison and in chains. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Though Scipio had
                        not been banished or condemned to death, still, as he did not appear on the
                        day fixed for his trial, though duly cited, he passed upon himself a
                        sentence of banishment, not only for life but even after he was dead. </p>

                        from which I have made a digression, Demetrius and his legation returned to
                        Macedonia. There was much divergence of view as to the results of their
                        embassy. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The bulk of the Macedonian
                        people, appalled at the imminent prospect of a war with Rome, were
                        enthusiastic supporters of Demetrius. They looked upon him as the author of
                        peace and regarded his succession to the throne after his father's death as
                        a certainty. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Although younger than
                        Perseus, he was a legitimate son, the other was the son of a concubine.
                        People said that Perseus, the offspring of a prostitute, had no note or mark
                        of any particular father, whereas Demetrius showed a remarkable likeness to
                        his father; <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> moreover, Perseus was no
                        favourite with the Romans and they would place Demetrius on his father's
                        throne. Such was the common talk. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Perseus
                        felt himself superior to his brother in everything else, but he was haunted
                        by the thought that his age alone would count but little in his favour.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Philip himself, too, whilst feeling
                        doubtful whether it would be in his power to decide whom he should leave as
                        heir to the throne, considered that his younger son was assuming more
                        authority than he wished him to possess. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                        He was annoyed at the way in which the Macedonians resorted to Demetrius and
                        he looked upon the existence of a second royal court as an indignity to
                        himself. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The young prince had certainly
                        come home with a much higher sense of his own importance, presuming as he
                        did upon the compliments paid him by the senate and the concessions they had
                        made to him after refusing them to his father. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> Every allusion he made to the Romans raised his
                        prestige amongst the Macedonians and evoked a corresponding amount of
                        jealousy and ill-will in his father and brother. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> This was particularly the case when the fresh
                        commissioners arrived from Rome and Philip was compelled to evacuate Thrace
                        and withdraw his garrisons and carry out the other measures demanded by the
                        previous commissioners and the fresh orders of the senate. <milestone n="11"
                            unit="section"/> All these things were a source of grief and bitterness
                        to him, all the more so because he saw him associating with the Romans much
                        more frequently than with himself. Still he acted in obedience to the orders
                        of Rome that there might be no pretext for commencing hostilities.
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Thinking to divert any suspicions the
                        Romans might entertain as to his designs, he led his army into the interior
                        of Thrace, against the Odrysae, the Dentheleti and the Bessi. <milestone

                        were 12,000 under arms, most of them had arms which they had taken by force
                        from the peasants. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> These were taken from

                        Valerius the praetor introduced them to the senate. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> They explained how, owing to over-population, want of

                        the Alps. Where they saw the country uninhabited and uncultivated there they
                        had settled, without doing injury to any one. They had even begun to build a
                        town, a clear proof that they were not going to attack either town or
                        village. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> M. Claudius had recently sent a
                        message to them that if they did not surrender he would make war upon them.
                        As they preferred a secure if not a very honourable peace to the
                        uncertainties of war, they had placed themselves under the protection,
                        before they had to submit to the power, of Rome. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> A few days afterwards they were ordered to evacuate
                        their city and territory, and they intended to depart quietly and settle in
                        what part of the world they could. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Next,
                        their arms were taken from them, and at last all that they possessed, their
                        goods and their cattle. They implored the senate and the People of Rome not
                        to treat those who had surrendered without striking a blow with greater
                        severity than they treated active enemies. </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> To these pleas the senate ordered the

                        acted wrongfully in coming into Italy and attempting to build a town on

                        who was over that province. On the other hand, it was not the pleasure of
                        the senate that after they had surrendered they should be despoiled of their
                        goods and possessions. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The senate would
                        send back with them commissioners to the consul, who on their returning

                        The commissioners would also cross the Alps and warn the Gaulish communities

                        The commissioners who were sent were L. Furius Purpurio, Q. Minucius and L.

                        at the time discussing the question of sending colonists to Aquileia, and
                        the question was whether they should make it a Latin colony or send Roman
                        citizens. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> It was finally decided that the
                        colony should consist of Latin settlers. The commissioners for
                        superintending the settlement were P. Scipio Nasica, C. Flaminius and L.
                        Manlius Acidinus. Mutina and Parma were also colonised this year by Roman
                        citizens. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Two thousand men were settled in
                        each colony on land which had recently belonged to the Boii, formerly to the
                        Tuscans. Those at Parma received eight jugera each, those at Mutina, five.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The allocation of the land was carried
                        out by M. Aemilius Lepidus, T. Aebutius Carus and L. Quinctius Crispinus.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Saturnia, also, a colony of Roman
                        citizens, was founded under the supervision of Q. Fabius Labeo, C. Afranius
                        Stellio and Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus. Ten jugera were assigned to each
                        colonist. </p>

                        fought some successful actions with the Celtiberi not far from the Ebro in
                        the Ausetanian country, and stormed several places which they had fortified
                        there. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Further Spain was quiet during the
                        year owing to the long illness of P. Sempronius, and the Lusitanians,
                        receiving no provocation, remained, fortunately, quiet. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> Nor did Q. Fabius do anything worth mentioning in
                        Liguria. M. Marcellus was recalled from Histria and his army disbanded. He
                        returned to Rome to conduct the elections. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                        The new consuls were Cnaeus Baebius Tamphilus and L. Aemilius Paulus. The
                        latter had been curule aedile with M. Aemilius Lepidus who five years before
                        had won his consulship after two previous defeats. The new praetors were Q.
                        Fulvius Flaccus, M. Valerius Laevinus, P. Manlius for the second time, M.
                        Ogulnius Gallus, L. Caecilius Denter, and C. Terentius Istra. <milestone

                        owing to portents. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> It was firmly believed
                        that a rain of blood had fallen for two days in the temple precinct of
                        Concord, and it was reported that not far from Sicily a new island had been
                        thrown up by the sea. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Valerius Antias is
                        our authority for stating that Hannibal died this year, and that in addition
                        to T. Quinctius Flamininus, whose name is well known in connection with that
                        incident, L. Scipio Asiaticus and P. Scipio Nasica were sent to Prusias on
                        that occasion. </p>
