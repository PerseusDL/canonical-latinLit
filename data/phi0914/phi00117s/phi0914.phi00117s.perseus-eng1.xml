                <p> THE consul Gnaeus Cornelius was surrounded by a Carthaginian fleet and was made
                    prisoner by fraud, having been lured out as to a colloquy. <name>The</name>
                    consul Gaius Duillius fought a successful engagement with the fleet of the
                    Carthaginians and was first of all Roman leaders to triumph for a naval victory.
                        <reg>for</reg> this reason he was granted a perpetual honour—that a waxen
                    torch should be borne before him and a flautist should make music when he
                    returned from dining out. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                    <name>The</name> consul Lucius Cornelius fought successfully in Sardinia and
                    Corsica against the Sardinians and Corsicans and against Hanno, the Carthaginian
                    general. <name>The</name> consul Atilius Calatinus having rashly led his army
                    into a place surrounded by the Carthaginians, escaped through the valiant
                    services of Marcus Calpurnius, a tribune of the soldiers, who with three hundred
                    men broke through the enemy and drew their attack upon himself.
                        <name>Hannibal</name> , a Carthaginian general, on the defeat of the fleet
                    which he commanded, was crucified by his own soldiers. <name>Atilius</name>
                    Regulus the consul, having beaten the Carthaginians in a naval battle, crossed
                    into Africa. </p>
