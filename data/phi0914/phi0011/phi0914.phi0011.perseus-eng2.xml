                <argument>
                    <p> The coming of Aeneas into Italy, and his achievements there; the reign of
                        Ascanius in Alba, and of the other Sylvian kings. Romulus and Remus born.
                        Amulius killed. Romulus builds Rome; forms a senate; makes war upon the
                        Sabines; presents the <foreign xml:lang="la">opima spolia</foreign> to
                        Jupiter Feretrius; divides the people into <foreign xml:lang="la"
                            >curiae;</foreign> his victories; is deified. Numa institutes the rites
                        of religious worship; builds a temple to Janus; and having made peace with
                        all his neighbours, closes it for the first time; enjoys a peaceful reign,
                        and is succeeded by Tullus Hostilius. War with the Albans; combat of the
                        Horatii and Curiatii. Alba demolished, and the Albans made citizens of Rome.
                        War declared against the Sabines: Tullus killed by lightning. Ancus Marcius
                        renews the religious institutions of Numa; conquers the Latins, confers on
                        them the right of citizenship, and assigns them the Aventine hill to dwell
                        on; adds the hill Janiculum to the city; enlarges the bounds of the empire.
                        In his reign Lucumo comes to Rome; assumes the name of Tarquinius; and,
                        after the death of Ancus, is raised to the throne. He increases the senate,
                        by adding to it a hundred new senators; defeats the Latins and Sabines;
                        augments the centuries of knights; builds a wall round the city; makes the
                        common sewers; is slain by the sons of Ancus after a reign of thirty-eight
                        years; and is succeeded by Servius Tullius. He institutes the census; closes
                        the lustrum, in which eighty thousand citizens are said to have been
                        enrolled; divides the people into classes and centuries; enlarges the
                        Pomaerium, and adds the Quirinal, Viminal, and Esquiline hills to the city;
                        after a reign of forty years, is murdered by L. Tarquin, afterwards surnamed
                        Superbus. He usurps the crown. Tarquin makes war on the Volsci, and, with
                        the plunder taken from them, builds a temple to Jupiter Capitolinus. By a
                        stratagem of his son, Sextus Tarquin, he reduces the city of Gabii; after a
                        reign of twenty-five years is dethroned and banished, in consequence of the
                        forcible violation of the person of Lucretia by his son Sextus. L. Junius
                        Brutus and L. Tarquinius Collatinus first created consuls. </p>

                    both of immense labour, as being one which must be traced back for more than
                    seven hundred years, and which, having set out from small beginnings, has
                    increased to such a degree that it is now distressed by its own magnitude. And,
                    to most readers, I doubt not but that the first origin and the events
                    immediately succeeding, will afford but little pleasure, while they will be

                    my labour, viz. to withdraw myself from the view of the calamities, which our
                    age has witnessed for so many years, so long as I am reviewing with my whole

                    warp it from the truth. The traditions which have come down to us of what
                    happened before the building of the city, or before its building was
                    contemplated, as being suitable rather to the fictions of poetry than to the
                    genuine records of history, I have no intention either to affirm or refute. This
                    indulgence is conceded to antiquity, that by blending things human with divine,
                    it <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> may make the origin of cities appear more
                    venerable: and if any people might be allowed to consecrate their origin, and to
                    ascribe it to the gods as its authors, such is the renown of the Roman people in
                    war, that when they represent Mars, in particular, as their own parent and that
                    of their founder, the nations of the world may submit to <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> this as patiently as they submit to their sovereignty. —But
                    in whatever way these and such like matters shall be attended to, or judged of,
                    I shall not deem of great importance. I would have every man apply his mind
                    seriously to consider these points, viz. what their life and what their manners
                    were; through what men and by what measures, both in peace and in war, their

                    more and more, then began to fall headlong, until he reaches the present
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> times, when we can neither endure our
                    vices, nor their remedies. This it is which is particularly salutary and
                    profitable in the study of history, that you behold instances of every variety
                    of conduct displayed <pb n="4" xml:id="p.4"/> on a conspicuous monument; that
                    from thence you may select for yourself and for your country that which you may

                    you may avoid. But either a fond partiality for the task I have undertaken
                    deceives me, or there never was any state either greater, or more moral, or
                    richer in good examples, nor one into which luxury and avarice made their
                    entrance so late, and where poverty and frugality were so much and so long
                    honoured; so that the less wealth there was, the less desire was there. Of late,
                    riches have introduced avarice, and excessive pleasures a longing for them,
                    amidst luxury <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> and a passion for ruining
                    ourselves and destroying every thing else. But let complaints, which will not be
                    agreeable even then, when perhaps they will be also necessary, be kept aloof at
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> least from the first stage of commencing
                    so great a work. We should rather, if it was usual with us (historians) as it is
                    with poets, begin with good omens, vows and prayers to the gods and goddesses to
                    vouchsafe good success to our efforts in so arduous an undertaking. </p>

                    established that, Troy having been taken, the utmost severity was shown to all
                    the other Trojans; but that towards two, Aeneas and Antenor, the Greeks forbore
                    all the rights of war, both in accordance with an ancient tie of hospitality,
                    and because they had ever been the advisers of peace, and of the restoration of

                    vicissitudes came into the innermost bay of the Adriatic Sea, with a body of the

                    commotion, were in quest both of a settlement and a leader, their king
                    Pylaemenes having been lost at Troy; <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> and that
                    the Heneti and Trojans, having expelled the Euganei, who dwelt between the sea
                    and the Alps, took possession of <pb n="5" xml:id="p.5"/> the country; and the
                    place where they first landed is called Troy; from whence also the name of
                    Trojan is given to the canton; <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> but the nation
                    in general is called Veneti: that Aeneas was driven from home by a similar
                    calamity, but the fates leading him to the founding of a greater empire, he came
                    first to Macedonia: that he sailed from thence to Sicily in quest of a
                    settlement: that from Sicily he made for the Laurentine territory; this place
                    also has the name of Troy. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> When the Trojans,
                    having disembarked there, were driving plunder from the lands, —as being persons

                    two-fold: some say, that Latinus, after being overcome in battle, made first a
                    peace, and then an alliance with Aeneas: others, that when the armies were drawn
                    out in battle-array, before the signals were sounded, Latinus advanced to the
                    front of the troops and invited the leader of the adventurers to a conference.

                    and their homes, which had been destroyed by fire, they were seeking a
                    settlement and a place for building a town, struck with admiration of the noble
                    origin of the nation and of the hero, and their spirit, alike prepared for peace
                    or war, he confirmed the assurance of future friendship by giving his right

                    between the chiefs, and mutual greetings passed between the armies: that Aeneas
                    was hospitably entertained by Latinus: that Latinus, in the presence of his
                    household gods, added a family league to the public one, by giving Aeneas his
                    daughter in marriage. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> This event confirms the

                    now daily coalescing more and more, although Etruria was so powerful, that it
                    filled with the fame of its prowess not only the land, but the sea also, through

                    Sylvius, the son of Ascanius, born by some accident in a wood, ascends the

                    shepherds, from her being a common prostitute, and that this gave rise to the
                    surprising story. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The children thus born and

                    his grand-children, the manner of their birth and education, and how they came

                    ambition of the sovereignty, the bane of their grandfather, interrupted these
                    designs, and thence arose a shameful quarrel from a beginning sufficiently
                    amicable. For as they were twins, and the respect due to seniority could not
                    determine the point, they agreed to leave to the tutelary gods of the place to
                    choose, by augury, which should give a name to the new city, which govern it

                    if he had driven them forward into the cave, their footsteps would have guided
                    the search of their owner thither, he therefore drew the most beautiful of them,

                    chance their footsteps would lead him thither. But when he observed that they
                    were all turned from it, and directed him no other way, confounded, and not

                    of those that were confined being returned from the cave, made Hercules turn
                    that way. And when Cacus attempted to prevent him by force, as he was proceeding
                    to the cave, being struck with a club, he was slain, vainly imploring the

                    own homes, but they flocked from all quarters to Titus Tatius, king of the
                    Sabines; and because he bore the greatest character in these parts, embassies
                    were sent to him. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The Caeninenses, Crustumini,
                    and Antemnates were people to whom a considerable portion of the outrage
                    extended. To them Tatius and the Sabines seemed to proceed somewhat dilatorily.
                    Nor even do the Crustumini and Antemnates bestir themselves with sufficient
                    activity to suit the impatience and rage of the Caeninenses. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> Accordingly the state of the Caeninenses by itself makes an
                    irruption into the Roman territory. But Romulus with his army met them ravaging
                    the country in straggling parties, and by a slight engagement convinces them,

                    of the enemy's general, whom he had slain, and there after he had laid them down

                        unit="section"/> Cures. As a memorial of this battle, they called the place

                    Accordingly, when he divided the people into thirty curiae, he called the curiae

                    contagious influence of the Fidenatian war, both from the tie of consanguinity,
                    for the Fidenates also were Etrurians, and because the very proximity of
                    situation, in case the Roman arms <pb n="22" xml:id="p.22"/> should be turned
                    against all their neighbours, urged them on, they made an incursion on the Roman
                    territories, more to commit depredations than after the manner of a regular war.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Accordingly, without pitching a camp, or
                    awaiting the approach of the enemy's army, they returned to Veii, carrying with

                    they did not find the enemy in the country, being prepared for and determined on

                    the Veientes heard that they were pitching a camp, and intended to advance to
                    the city, they came out to meet them, that they might rather decide the matter
                    in the open field, than be shut up and fight from their houses and walls.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Here the Roman king obtained the victory,
                    his power not being aided by any stratagem, merely by the strength of his

                    attempt on the city, strong as it was by its fortifications, and well defended
                    by its situation: on his return he lays waste their lands, rather from a desire
                    of revenge than booty. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> And the Veientes, being
                    humbled by that loss no less than by the unsuccessful battle, send ambassadors
                    to Rome to sue for peace. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> A truce for one
                    hundred years was granted them after they were fined a part of their land. These
                    are the principal transactions which occurred during the reign of Romulus, in
                    peace and war, none of which seem inconsistent with the belief of his divine

                    attained from that outset under him, it became so powerful, that for forty years
                    after it enjoyed a profound peace. He was, however, dearer to the people than to
                    the fathers; but above all others he was most beloved by the soldiers. And he
                    kept three hundred of them armed as a body-guard not only in war but in peace,
                    whom he called Celeres. </p>

                    throne actuated the minds of the fathers; factions had not yet sprung up from
                    individuals, because, among a new people, no one person was eminently
                    distinguished above the rest: the contest was carried on between the different
                    orders. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The descendants of the Sabines wished
                    a king to be elected <pb n="24" xml:id="p.24"/> out of their body, lest, because

                    equal participation. The old Romans spurned the idea of a foreign prince.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Amid this diversity of views, however, all
                    were anxious that there should be a king, they not having yet tasted the sweets

                    lest the minds of the surrounding states being incensed against them, some
                    foreign power should attack the state, now without a government, and the army
                    without a leader. It was therefore their wish that there should be some head,
                    but no one could bring himself to give way to another. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> Thus the hundred senators divide the government among them,
                    ten decuries being formed, and one selected from each decury, who was to have

                    one only was attended with the insignia of authority and the lictors: their
                    power was limited to the space of five days, and it passed through all in
                    rotation, and the interval between a kingly government lasted a year. From the
                    circumstance it was called an Interregnum, a term which holds good even now.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> But the people began to murmur, that their
                    slavery was multiplied, and that they had got a hundred sovereigns instead of
                    one, and they seemed determined to bear no authority but that of a king, and

                    conciliate the favour of the people by yielding to them the supreme power, yet
                    in such a manner as to grant them no greater privilege than they reserved to

                        subject to the control of the senate, and therefore not precarious as

                    wanting to the complete year as constituted by the solstitial revolution, he so
                    portioned it out by inserting intercalary months, that every twenty-fourth year,
                    the lengths of all the intermediate years being completed, the days should
                    correspond to the same place of the sun (in the heavens) whence they had set
                    out. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Romulus had made his year to
                        consist of ten months, the first month being March, and the number of days
                        in the year being only 304, which corresponded neither with the course
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> of the sun or moon. Numa, who added
                        the two months of January and February, divided the year into twelve months,
                        according to the course of the moon. This was the lunar Greek year, and
                        consisted of 354 days. Numa, however, adopted 355 days for his year, from
                        his partiality to odd numbers. The lunar year of 354 days fell short of the
                        solar year by 11 1/4 days; —this in 8 years amounted to (11 1/4 × 8) 90
                        days. These 90 days he divided into 2 months of 22 and 2 of 23 days,
                        (\overline(2 × 22) + \overline(2 × 23) = 90,) and introduced them
                        alternately every second year for two octennial periods: every third
                        octennial period, however, Numa intercalated only 66 days instead of 90
                        days, <hi rend="italics">i. e.</hi> he inserted 3 months of only 22 days
                        each. The reason was, because <milestone n="6??" unit="section"/> he adopted
                        355 days as the length of his lunar year instead of 354, and this in 24
                        years (3 octennial periods) produced an error of 24 days; this error was
                        exactly compensated by intercalating only 66 days (90 —24) in the third
                        octennial period. The intercalations were generally made in the month of
                        February, after the 23rd of the month. Their management was left to the

                    strength, Tullus declares war against the Sabines, a nation at that time the
                    most powerful, next to the Etrurians, in men and in arms. Injuries had been done
                    on both sides, and restitution demanded in vain. <milestone n="5" unit="section"
                    /> Tullus complained that some Roman merchants had been seized in an open market
                    near the temple of Feronia; the Sabines, that some of their people had taken
                    refuge in the asylum, and were detained at Rome. <milestone n="6" unit="section"
                    /> These were assigned as the causes of the war. The Sabines, holding in
                    recollection both that a portion of their strength had been fixed at Rome by
                    Tatius, and that the Roman power had also been lately increased by the accession
                    of the Alban people, began, on their part, to look around for foreign aid.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Etruria was in their neighbourhood; of the
                    Etrurians the Veientes were the nearest. From thence they drew some volunteers,
                    their minds being stirred up to a revolt, chiefly in consequence of the rankling
                    animosities from (former) wars. And pay also had its weight with some stragglers

                    stipulated with Romulus was strictly observed by the Veientes (for with respect
                    to the others it is less surprising). While they were preparing for war with the
                    utmost vigour, and the matter seemed to turn on this, which should first
                    commence hostilities, Tullus first passes into the Sabine territory. <milestone

                    stones on the Alban Mount. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> As this could
                    scarcely be credited, on persons being sent to inquire into the prodigy, a thick
                    shower of stones fell from heaven in their sight, just as when hail collected

                    religious service according to the rites of their native country, which they had
                    consigned to oblivion, as if their gods had been abandoned together with their
                    country; and they had either adopted the religion of Rome, or, as may happen,
                    enraged at their evil destiny, had renounced altogether the worship of the gods.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> A festival of nine days was instituted
                    publicly by the Romans also on account of the same prodigy, either in obedience
                    to the heavenly voice sent from the Alban mount, (for that too is stated,) or by

                    continued a solemn observance, that whenever the same prodigy was announced, a
                    festival for nine days was observed. Not long after, they were afflicted with a
                    pestilence; and though from this there arose an aversion to military service,
                    yet no respite from arms was granted by this warlike king, who considered that
                    the bodies of the young men were even more healthy abroad than at home, until he
                    himself also was seized with a lingering disease. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> Then, together with his body, those fierce spirits became
                    so broken, that he, who formerly considered nothing less worthy of a king than
                    to devote his mind to religion, suddenly became a slave to every form of
                    superstition, important and trifling, and filled the people's minds also with
                    religious scruples. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The generality of persons,
                    now wishing to recur to that state of things which had existed under king Numa,
                    thought that the only relief left for their sickly bodies was, if peace and
                    pardon could be obtained from the gods. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> They
                    say that the king himself, turning over the commentaries of Numa, after he had
                    found therein that certain sacrifices of a secret and solemn nature had been
                    performed to Jupiter Elicius, shut himself up and set about the performance of
                    this solemnity; but that that rite was not duly undertaken or conducted, and
                    that not only no appearance of <pb n="44" xml:id="p.44"/> heavenly notification
                    was presented to him, but that he was struck with lightning and burnt to ashes,
                    together with his house, through the anger of Jupiter, exasperated at the
                    impropriety of the ceremony. Tullus reigned two-and-thirty years with great

                    the comitia, the people elected Ancus Marcius king. The fathers confirmed the
                    election. Ancus Marcius was the grandson of king Numa Pompilius by his daughter.

                    reflecting on the renown of his grandfather, and that the late reign, glorious
                    in every other respect, in one particular had not been sufficiently prosperous,
                    the rites of religion having either been utterly neglected, or improperly
                    performed; deeming it of the highest importance to perform the public ceremonies
                    of religion as they had been instituted by Numa, he orders the pontiff, after he
                    had transcribed them all from the king's commentaries on white tables, to expose
                    them to public view. Hence, both his own subjects, desirous of peace, and the
                    neighbouring nations, entertained a hope that the king would conform to the
                    conduct and institutions of his grandfather. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    Accordingly the Latins, with whom a treaty had been concluded in the reign of
                    Tullus, assumed new courage; and after they had made an incursion upon the Roman
                    lands, return a contemptuous answer to the Romans on their demanding
                    restitution, supposing that the Roman king would spend his reign in indolence
                    among chapels and altars. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The genius of Ancus
                    was of a middle kind, partaking both of that of Numa and of Romulus; and,
                    besides that, he thought that peace was more necessary in his grandfather's
                    reign, considering the people were but recent as well as uncivilized, he also
                    (considered) that he could not, without injury, preserve the tranquillity which
                    had fallen to his lot; that his patience was tried, and being tried, was now
                    despised; and that the times were more suited to a king Tullus than to a Numa.

                    according to some rite, he borrowed from an ancient nation, the Aequicolae, the

                    fortune, the name of Egerius was given on account of his poverty. <milestone
                        n="4" unit="section"/> And when his wealth already inspired Lucumo, on the
                    other hand, the heir of all his father's wealth, with elevated notions,
                    Tanaquil, whom he married, further increased such feeling, she being descended
                    from a very high family, and one who would not readily brook the condition into
                    which she had married to be inferior to that in which she had been born.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> As the Etrurians despised Lucumo, because
                    sprung from a foreign exile, she could not bear the affront, and regardless of
                    the innate love of her native country, provided <pb n="48" xml:id="p.48"/> she
                    might see her husband advanced to honours, she formed the determination to leave
                    Tarquinii. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Rome seemed particularly suited for
                    her purpose. In this state, lately founded, where all nobility is recent and the
                    result of merit, there would be room for her husband, a man of courage and
                    activity. Tatius a Sabine had been king of Rome: Numa had been sent for from
                    Cures to reign there: Ancus was sprung from a Sabine mother, and rested his
                    nobility on the single statue of Numa. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> She
                    easily persuades him, as being ambitious of honours, and one to whom Tarquinii
                    was his country only on the mother's side. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    Accordingly, removing their effects they set out together for Rome. They
                    happened to have reached the Janiculum; there, as he sat in the chariot with his
                    wife, an eagle, suspended on her wings, gently stooping, takes off his cap, and
                    flying round the chariot with loud screams, as if she had been sent from heaven
                    for the very purpose, orderly replaced it on his head, and then flew aloft.
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Tanaquil is said to have received this
                    omen with great joy, being a woman well skilled, as the Etrurians generally are,
                    in celestial prodigies, and embracing her husband, bids him hope for high and
                    elevated fortune: that such bird had come from such a quarter of the heavens,
                    and the messenger of such a god: that it had exhibited the omen around the
                    highest part of man: that it had lifted the ornament placed on the head of man,
                    to restore it to the same, by direction of the gods. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> Carrying with them these hopes and thoughts, they entered
                    the city, and having purchased a house there, they gave out the name of Lucius
                    Tarquinius Priscus. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> His being a stranger and
                    very rich, caused him to be taken notice of by the Romans. He also promoted his
                    own good fortune by his affable address, by the courteousness of his
                    invitations, and by conciliating those whom he could by acts of kindness;
                        <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> until a report of him reached even to the
                    palace; and by paying court to the king with politeness and address, he in a

                    that he was present at all public and private deliberations, foreign and
                    domestic; and being now tried in every trust, he was at length, by the king's

                    Tarquin was more urgent that the assembly for the election of a king should be

                        surprise,) but the third who aspired to the sovereignty of Rome. That Tatius
                        not only from being an alien, but even an enemy, was made king: that Numa,
                        unacquainted with the city, and without soliciting it, had been voluntarily

                        loyalty to his prince, and even with the king himself in his bounty to
                        others. </quote>

                    prompted Tarquin, in other respects an excellent man, to aspire to the crown,
                    followed him whilst on the throne. And being no less mindful of strengthening
                    his own power, than of increasing that of the commonwealth, he elected a hundred

                    took the town of Apiolae by storm, and having brought back thence more booty
                    than the character of the war would lead one to expect, he celebrated games with
                    more cost and magnificence than former kings. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    The place for the circus, which is now called Maximus, was then first marked
                    out, and spaces were parted off for the senators and knights, where they might

                    with a stone wall, when a Sabine war obstructed his designs. The matter was so
                    sudden, that the enemy had passed the Anio before the Roman army could meet and
                    stop them; great alarm therefore was produced at Rome. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> And at first they fought with dubious success, but with
                    great slaughter on both sides. After this, the enemy's forces being led back
                    into their camp, and the Romans getting time to make new levies for the war,
                    Tarquin, thinking that the weakness of his army lay in the want of horse,
                    determined to add other centuries to the Ramnenses, the Titienses, and Luceres
                    which Romulus had appointed, and to leave them distinguished by his own name.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Because Romulus had done this by augury,
                    Attus Navius, at that time a celebrated soothsayer, insisted that no alteration
                    or new appointment of that kind could be made, unless the birds approved of it.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The king, enraged at this, and, as it is
                    related, ridiculing the art, said, <quote>Come, thou diviner, tell me, whether
                        what I am thinking on can be done or not?</quote> When he had tried the
                    matter by divination, he affirmed it certainly could. <quote>But I was
                        thinking,</quote> says he, <quote> whether you could cut asunder this

                    was erected in the comitium, upon the very steps on the left of the
                    senate-house, on the spot where the transaction occurred. They say that the
                    whetstone also was deposited in the same place, that it might remain a monument
                    of that miracle to posterity. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> There certainly
                    accrued so much honour to augury and the college of augurs, that nothing was
                    undertaken either in peace or war without taking the auspices. Assemblies of the
                    people, the summoning of armies, and affairs of the greatest importance were put
                    off, when the birds would not allow of them. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    Nor did Tarquin then make any other alteration in the centuries of horse, except

                    that the three centuries consisted of one thousand eight hundred knights.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Those that were added were called

                    during the battle, and, after they were routed, impeded their flight; so that
                    many, who had escaped the enemy, perished in the river. Their arms floating down
                    the Tiber, and being recognised at the city, made known the victory, almost

                    there. In that action the glory of the cavalry was prominent: they say that,
                    being posted in the two wings, when the centre of their own infantry was being
                    beaten, they charged so briskly in flank, that they not only checked the Sabine
                    legions who pressed hard on those who retired, but quickly put them <milestone

                    great precipitation, yet few reached them; for, as we said before, the greatest
                    part were driven by the cavalry into <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> the

                    were to pay two thousand asses yearly for the support of the horses. All these

                    and the same right, but gradations were established, so that no one might seem
                    excluded from the right of voting, and yet the whole power might reside in the

                    respectability might attach to the place. He surrounds the city with a rampart,

                    augury, reaching to a certain extent both within and without in the direction
                    they intended to raise the wall; so that the houses might not be joined to it on
                    the inside, as they commonly are now, and also that there might be some space
                    without left free from human occupation. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> This
                    space, which it was not lawful to till or inhabit, the Romans called the

                    without it: and in enlarging the city, as far as the walls were intended to
                    proceed outwards, so far these consecrated limits were likewise extended. </p>

                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> This was an acknowledgment that Rome was
                    the head of both nations, concerning which they had so often disputed in arms.
                    Though that object seemed to have been left out of consideration by all the
                    Latins, in consequence of the matter having been so often attempted
                    unsuccessfully by arms, fortune seemed to present one of the Sabines with an

                    remained, for many ages, a monument of this wonder. <milestone n="5"

                    This prediction had also reached the ears of the high priest of Diana. The

                    drove the cow to Rome, led her to the temple of that goddess, and set her before
                    the altar. The Roman priest, struck with the uncommon size of the victim, so
                    much celebrated by fame, thus accosted the Sabine: <quote>What intendest thou to

                    She, accustomed to the secret conversations of the other's husband, refrained
                    not from using the most contumelious language of her husband to his brother, of

                    whose actions procured him the surname of the Proud, for he refused his
                    father-in-law burial, alleging, that even Romulus died without sepulture.

                    whom he suspected of having been in the interest of Servius. Then, conscious
                    that the precedent of obtaining the crown by evil means might be adopted from
                    him against himself, he surrounded his person with <milestone n="3??"

                    as he reposed no hope in the affection of his subjects, he found it necessary to
                    secure his kingdom by terror; and in order to strike this into the greater
                    number, he took cognizance of capital cases solely by himself without assessors;

                    might feel the less resentment at no business being transacted by them.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> For he was the first king who violated the
                    custom derived from his predecessors of consulting the senate on all subjects;
                    he administered the public business by domestic counsels. War, peace, treaties,
                    alliances, he contracted and dissolved with whomsoever he pleased, without the

                    not only ties of hospitality but affinities also with their leading men.
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> To Octavius Mamilius of Tusculum he gives

                        submitted to the yoke, he may crush them when at his mercy. For to whom did

                            unit="section"/> not even so, inasmuch as he was a foreigner). But if
                        his own subjects are dissatisfied with him, (seeing that they are butchered

                        better prospects are held out to the Latins? If they follow his advice, that
                        they would depart thence, each to his own home, and take no more notice of

                    virtue of his authority, he accomplished the ruin of this innocent man by
                    bringing a false accusation against him. By means of some Aricians of the

                        yesterday at the meeting; that the matter was deferred, because the person

                        the assembly met, attended with a band of conspirators, and with arms in his

                    presaged that this temple should be the metropolis of the empire, and the head

                    further, he was anxious that the frontiers of the empire should be more

                    frightful prodigy appeared to him. A serpent sliding out of a wooden pillar,
                    after causing dismay and a run into the palace, not so much struck the king's

                        unit="section"/> solicitude. Accordingly when Etrurian soothsayers only were
                    employed for public prodigies, terrified at this as it were domestic apparition,
                    he determined on sending persons to Delphos to the most celebrated oracle in the

                    Aruns were the two who <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> went. To them were
                    added, as a companion, L. Junius Brutus, the son of Tarquinia, sister to the

                    which he had assumed. Brutus, on hearing that the chief men of the city, and
                    among others his own brother, had been put to death by his uncle, resolved to
                    leave nothing in his intellects that might be dreaded by the king, nor any thing
                    in his fortune to be coveted, and thus to be secure in contempt, where there was

                    designedly fashioning himself to the semblance of foolishness, after he suffered
                    himself and his whole estate to become a prey to the king, he did not refuse to
                    take even the surname of Brutus, that, concealed under the cover of such a

                    the Tarquinii rather as a subject of sport than as a companion, is said to have
                    brought with him as an offering to Apollo a golden rod, enclosed in a staff of

                    and in labour fit for slaves. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> An attempt was
                    made to take Ardea by storm; when that did not succeed, the enemy began to be
                    distressed by a blockade, and by works raised around them. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> As it commonly happens in standing camps, the war being
                    rather tedious than violent, furloughs were easily obtained, more so by the
                    officers, however, than the common soldiers. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    The young princes sometimes spent their leisure hours in feasting and
                    entertainments. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> One day as they were drinking
                    in the tent of Sextus Tarquin, where Collatinus Tarquinius, the son of Egerius,
                    was also at supper, mention was made of wives. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    Every one commended his own in an extravagant manner, till a dispute arising
                    about it, Collatinus said, <quote> There was no occasion for words, that it
                        might be known in a few hours how far his Lucretia excelled all the rest. If
                        then, added he, we have any share of the vigour of youth, let us mount our
                        horses and examine the behaviour of our wives; that must be most
                        satisfactory to every one, which shall meet his eyes on the unexpected
                        arrival of <pb n="75" xml:id="p.75"/> the husband. </quote>
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> They were heated with wine; <quote>Come on,
                        then,</quote> say all. They immediately galloped to Rome, where they arrived
                    in the dusk of the evening. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> From thence they
                    went to Collatia, where they find Lucretia, not like the king's
                    daughters-in-law, whom they had seen spending their time in luxurious
                    entertainments with their equals, but though at an advanced time of night,
                    employed at her wool, sitting in the middle of the house amid her maids working
                    around her. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The merit of the contest
                    regarding the ladies was assigned to Lucretia. Her husband on his arrival, and
                    the Tarquinii, were kindly received; the husband, proud of his victory, gives
                    the young princes a polite invitation. There the villanous passion for violating
                    Lucretia by force seizes Sextus Tarquin; both her beauty, and her approved
                    purity, act as incentives. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> And then, after
                    this youthful frolic of the night, they return to the camp. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> A few days after, without the knowledge of

                    his intention, after he had been conducted after supper into the guests'
                    chamber, burning with passion, when every thing around seemed sufficiently
                    secure, and all fast asleep, he comes to Lucretia, as she lay asleep, with a
                    naked sword, and with his left hand pressing down the woman's breast, he says,
                        <quote> Be silent, Lucretia; I am Sextus Tarquin; I have a sword in my hand;
                        you shall die, if you utter a word. </quote>
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> When awaking terrified from sleep, the woman
                    beheld no aid, impending death nigh at hand; then Tarquin acknowledged his
                    passion, entreated, mixed threats with entreaties, tried the female's mind in
                    every possible way. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> When he saw her
                    inflexible, and that she was not moved even by the terror of death, he added to
                    terror the threat of dishonour; he says that he will lay a murdered slave naked
                    by her side when dead, so that she may be said to have been slain in infamous
                    adultery. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> When by the terror of this disgrace
                    his lust, as it were victorious, had overcome her inflexible chastity, and
                    Tarquin had departed, exulting in having triumphed over a lady's honour,
                    Lucretia, in melancholy distress at so dreadful a misfortune, despatches the
                    same messenger to Rome to her father, and to Ardea to her husband, that they
                    would come each with one trusty friend; that it was necessary to do so, and that

                    met by his wife's messenger. They find Lucretia sitting in her chamber in
                    sorrowful <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> dejection. On the arrival of her
                    friends the tears burst from her eyes; and to her husband, on his inquiry
                        <quote>whether all was right,</quote> she says, <quote> By no means, for

                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> unpunished. It is Sextus Tarquin, who,
                        an enemy in the guise of a guest, has borne away hence a triumph fatal to
                        me, and to himself, if you are <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> men.
                    </quote> They all pledge their honour; they attempt to console her, distracted
                    as she was in mind, by turning away the guilt from her, constrained by force, on
                    the perpetrator of the crime; that it is the mind sins, not the body; and that

                    grief, having drawn the knife out of the wound, and holding it up before him
                    reeking with blood, said, <quote> By this blood, most pure before the pollution
                        of royal villany, I swear, and I call you, O gods, to witness my oath, that

                    after him to Lucretius and Valerius, who were surprised at such extraordinary
                    mind in the breast of Brutus. However, they all take the oath as they were
                    directed, and converting their sorrow into rage, follow Brutus as their leader,
                    who from that time ceased not to so- <pb n="77" xml:id="p.77"/> licit them to
                    abolish the regal power. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> They carry Lucretia's
                    body from her own house, and convey it into the forum; and assemble a number of
                    persons by the strangeness and atrocity of the extraordinary occurrence, as
                    usually happens. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> They complain, each for
                    himself, of the royal villany and violence. Both the grief of the father moves
                    them, as also Brutus, the reprover of their tears and unavailing complaints, and
                    their adviser to take up arms against those who dared to treat them as enemies,
                    as would become men and Romans. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Each most
                    spirited of the youth voluntarily presents himself in arms; the rest of the
                    youth follow also. From thence, after leaving an adequate garrison at the gates
                    at Collatia, and having appointed sentinels, so that no one might give
                    intelligence of the disturbance to the king's party, the rest set out for Rome
                    in arms under the conduct of Brutus. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> When they
                    arrived there, the armed multitude cause panic and confusion wherever they go.
                    Again, when they see the principal men of the state placing themselves at their
                    head, they think that, whatever it may be, it was not without good reason.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Nor does the heinousness of the
                    circumstance excite less violent emotions at Rome than it had done at Collatia;
                    accordingly they run from all parts of the city into the forum, whither, when
                    they came, the public crier summoned them to attend the tribune of the celeres,
                    with which office Brutus happened to be at that time vested. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> There an harangue was delivered by him, by no means of that
                    feeling and capacity which had been counterfeited up to that day, concerning the
                    violence and lust of Sextus Tarquin, the horrid violation of Lucretia and her
                    lamentable death, the bereavement of Tricipitinus, to whom the cause of his
                    daughter's death was more exasperating and deplorable than the death itself.
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> To this was added the haughty insolence of
                    the king himself, and the sufferings and toils of the people, buried in the
                    earth in cleansing sinks and sewers; that the Romans, the conquerors of all the
                    surrounding states, instead of warriors had become labourers and stone-cutters.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The unnatural murder of king Servius
                    Tullius was dwelt on, and his daughter's driving over the body of her father in

                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> By stating these and other, I suppose,

                    Tarquin arrived by different routes, the one at Ardea, the other at Rome.

                    received with great joy, and the king's sons were expelled. Two of them followed
                    their father, and went into banishment to Caere, a city of Etruria. Sextus
                    Tarquin, having gone to Gabii, as to his own kingdom, was slain by the avengers
                    of the old feuds, which he had raised against himself by his rapines and

                    Two consuls, viz. Lucius Junius Brutus and Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, were
